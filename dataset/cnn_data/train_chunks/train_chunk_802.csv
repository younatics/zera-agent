"By . Emma Innes . Dr Max Pemberton says he would rather have HIV than Type 2 diabetes . The thought of HIV strikes fear into the hearts of many people. In contrast, Type 2 diabetes is rapidly becoming normalised and many people see it as a mere inconvenience, or even an inevitable part of ageing. But now, one doctor has claimed he would rather have HIV than Type 2 diabetes. Writing in The Spectator, Dr Max Pemberton said: ‘As a doctor I can tell you that, medically speaking, I’d rather have HIV than diabetes. ‘While this might sound shocking or surprising, the facts speak for themselves: the prognosis for those with Type 2 diabetes is much worse than for those with HIV.’ Dr Pemberton goes on to explain that it is now very rare for someone to die of HIV in the UK and that, in fact, people with the virus have a very similar life expectancy to people who are HIV-negative. He says that, assuming patients take their medication, they experience very few problems as a result of being HIV-positive. In contrast, he says the situation is very different for people with Type 2 diabetes. Dr Pemberton, a psychiatrist in the NHS, says people with Type 2 diabetes are more than twice as likely to have a stroke as people without the disease. He says they are also four times more likely to have heart disease and that 20 to 30 per cent of patient have kidney problems which can lead to the need for regular dialysis. He added that diabetes can also lead to blindness, foot ulcers and amputations. He explained that HIV can be treated very successfully with highly active antiretroviral therapy (Haart) which prevents the development of the opportunistic infections that kill people with untreated HIV/AIDs. Dr Pemberton says HIV (pictured) can be treated effectively leaving patients with few health problems. In contrast, he says Type 2 diabetes is progressive even with treatment and causes a host of health problems . He says many people believe that Type 2 diabetes can also be easily treated with medication but that this is not the case. Dr Pemberton explained that the disease is progressive meaning people usually end up needing insulin injections and that they suffer serious consequences from having the disease. He concludes: ‘To put it starkly, the latest statistics show that because of Haart, HIV now no longer reduces your life expectancy, while having Type 2 diabetes typically reduces it by ten years.’","Max Pemberton says HIV is now easily treated with antiretroviral therapy .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . If anyone was wondering what model and actress Kelly Brook sees in her muscle-bound new squeeze David McIntosh, he’s keen to reveal all. Before meeting the pin-up, McIntosh had been working in security for four years after leaving Sky One TV show Gladiators in 2009. Now he has launched a fitness website KingDavidMcintosh.com, where there is an online shop. Online business: Kelly Brook's boyfriend David McIntosh has set up a website where he will sell fitness programmes and photos of himself . Selling himselfie: Kelly's Gladiator boyfriend has chosen to call his new business venture KingDavidMcintosh.com . Visitors can purchase programmes to develop chiselled abs, calendars and screensavers full of photos of the former marine’s eye-poppingly athletic body, and there are plans to develop a fitness clothing range. Kelly herself has plenty of contacts in the fitness industry after releasing a fitness DVD with Strictly Come Dancing star Flavia Cacace in 2008 and modelling for Reebok. Expensive pint: Heavy drinking costs the UK more than £21billion a year . Government advisers say plans to scrap beer tax rises are ‘staggering’ when harm caused by heavy drinking costs the UK more than £21 billion a year. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore, of the Royal College of Physicians, called the move ‘deplorable’. Katherine Brown, of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said with alcohol-related hospital admissions doubling over a decade, ‘it’s a shock to learn the Chancellor believes it is right to incentivise drinking further by making alcohol cheaper’. Feeling down? Then stand up more. In a study of 9,000 women aged 50 to 55, those who sat for more than seven hours at a time were 49 per cent more likely to have symptoms of depression. Researchers at Australia’s Victoria University and University of Queensland believe a lack of interaction with the environment limits blood flow to the part of the brain that controls emotions.","Former Gladiator David McIntosh is setting up a fitness website .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The claims were made by Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, pictured, during an interview with BBC Breakfast in London . Facebook has been heavily criticised by users and authorities alike about the way the site harvests personal data and uses it for advertising. But the social network’s chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg has spoken out in defence of the site, vehemently denying sharing its user's data. During an interview with BBC Breakfast, Sandberg said Facebook was very protective of its users' privacy and personal data. She continued that despite the use of personalised ads, the site 'does nothing to compromise its user’s data.' 'Privacy is of the utmost concern and importance to Facebook and it's important to us that the people who use our service know that we are very protective of them,' Sandberg explained. ‘It is their data, they have control of it, they share it. ‘When we are able to personalise ads, we are doing that without sharing their private data with any advertisers.’ Her comments follow the launch of the UK and Ireland Small Business Council at the company's international headquarters in Dublin. This council aims to increase participation between Facebook and small to medium-sized businesses. Sandberg said working with small to medium-sized businesses was important because ‘our missions are inextricably tied and the challenge and the opportunity of this huge technological shift that we're going through is one that we can work together (on). Sandberg said that despite the use of personalised ads, Facebook 'does nothing to compromise its user's data. Privacy is of the utmost concern and importance to Facebook and it's important to us that the people who use our service know that we are very protective of them. It is their data, they have control of it, they share it' When a company creates an advert, they can add a number of parameters to target the most appropriate people. These include the user's location, gender, age, likes and interests, relationship status, workplace and education. Rather than sharing this information directly with advertisers, Facebook uses a process called hashing. For example, personal information such as email addresses and names are automatically encrypted - making it impossible for the advertisers to uniquely identify the user. Facebook then converts the other information into a sequence of numbers and letters. For example, the information for an 18-year-old who likes reading the MailOnline and lives in Boston becomes a string of numbers, along the lines of '145sjfor23455djj'. Adverts are then matched to the appropriate series of characters, meaning private data is never directly shared. ‘We have 25 million small to medium-sized businesses around the world that use our free products to set up a page and use it to reach their customers. ‘So just as I can share with you if we're friends on Facebook, small businesses can reach their customers.’ The sixth most powerful woman in the world, according to Forbes magazine, said: ‘We are in the middle of the fastest adoption of disruptive technology the world has ever seen. 'The word 'online' is becoming an old-fashioned word because we're all going to be connected all the time.’ Sandberg also wrote and published Lean In last March, which advised women on how to be more confident and successful at work by becoming more involved and to face their fears. But she said there was still more to be done: ‘Despite all the progress women have made, men still have the great majority of the leadership positions in every business, in every industry, in every country in the world. 'It's really important that since women make up half the population, women start having half the seats at tables where decisions are made, and that's not where we are today.' She said women thinking about doing something should ask themselves what they would do if they were not afraid and then do it.","Claims were made by Facebook’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . If you’re looking to buy Amazon’s Fire TV, search with caution. The device has a similar name to a porn streaming box called FyreTV, and the company behind the adult service is so put out by the similarity, it is suing the online retailing giant. WREAL, which also owns FireTV.com, claims Amazon’s Fire TV streaming device is a trademark infringement and is seeking damages, according to papers filed in Florida earlier this week. WREAL, which owns the FyreTV porn streaming box as well as FireTV.com, claims Amazon's Fire TV device, pictured, is a trademark infringement, according to papers filed in Florida earlier this week. The firm wants a jury trial and is seeking damages, including any profits Amazon makes from the use of the FireTV brand . The Fire TV device, about the size of a CD case, runs Google's Android operating system. It plugs into HDTVs and offers Netflix, Hulu and other streaming channels in addition to Amazon Prime Instant video. It comes with a voice-activated Bluetooth remote, which lets users search for videos to watch. It launched in the U.S for $99 at the start of April but did not confirm a UK release date. Fire TV also offers a range of other services, including channels like YouTube and Pandora and 'Free Time,' a customisable interface for children. WREAL launched the trademarked media streamer in 2008, and it only broadcasts porn. This was six years before Amazon launched its $99 box in the U.S, which connects to HDTVs and lets users stream content from Netflix, Prime Instant Video and Hulu Plus. The complaint filed by WREAL claims five counts of unauthorised use and infringement on the Fyre brand and states: ‘Amazon’s continued use of the Fire TV moniker has caused, and will continue to cause, serious irreparable harm to WREAL’s established business, necessitating this action.’ It added that the services not only share a similar name, but also perform a similar service that WREAL claims will add to the confusion. WREAL launched the trademarked media streamer, pictured, in 2008 and it only broadcasts porn. According to the firm, the two services not only share a similar name, but perform a similar service which WREAL claims will add to the confusion among customers . WREAL additionally explained in the files that although the service only offers porn at the moment, it has ‘no intention of limiting the FyreTV brand to adult content. Indeed, the underlying technology that powers FyretV is a flexible and scalable platform capable of delivering content to a wide variety of media streaming devices.’ WREAL is requesting a jury trial with WREAL and damages for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, and unfair competition. It is also asking for Amazon’s profits from the use of the Fire TV name. MailOnline has approached Amazon for comment.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . The complex structure of transport networks across the world's major cities has been laid strikingly bare in a series of maps that plot taxi journeys. But in addition to unveiling how residents navigate their cities, the maps also highlight the contrast between rich, tech-savvy areas with the less affluent neighbourhoods. The maps have been released by taxi firm Uber to celebrate the service launching in Beijing - bringing the total number of cities on the scheme to 100. As part of the Uber 100 project, the San Francisco-based firm has plotted the major routes its drivers take across all of these cities, including London, New York, Sydney, Mumbai, Moscow, Tokyo, Barcelona, and more. Taxi firm Uber has launched in Beijing, taking its total number of cities to 100. To celebrate, the firm has created the Uber 100 project and plotted the major routes from all of these cities on to maps. This includes Tokyo, pictured, which has a spider-like reach with legs reaching around the city centre, shown in bright blue . Uber is a smartphone taxi app that lets people hail a cab from their phone. It lets users compare rates and add credit cards to an account so they don't need cash. The service launched in California in 2010 and has grown from 35 cities last summer to a century this month. 'In 2010, Uber started as simply a big idea for a better way to get around,' said Uber. 'With today's launch in Beijing - four years and millions of trips later -we're now moving people in 100 cities around the world.' As a result, it is used by people who can afford smartphones in the first place, but also afford the taxi journeys, and this give a clear indication of economic differences. Uber's own stats also reveal the majority of its users are around 30. London, pictured, has the most sprawling and far-reaching map in Uber's collection. The two black sections in among the complex blue lines is the pedestrianised Hyde Park. As expected, the centre of the city is shown in bright blue, but there is also a hub of activity to the east of the capital towards the O2 venue in Greenwich. The straggly lines to the west are the major routes to Heathrow airport. Lines are paler as they approach the suburbs, especially passed Bermondsey and towards Croydon . New York's distinctive shape is instantly recognisable in the Uber map of the U.S city, as is the economic split. The brightest, and therefore busiest, stretches of the city are in Manhattan, especially around Central Park. The lines become thinner towards Harlem, and the poorer neighbourhoods of the Bronx. Elsewhere, Newark's sparse lines almost fade into the background. There is additionally a hub on Brooklyn Bridge, and on Route 278 that surrounds the neighbourhood, but not in inner Brooklyn . Mumbai's map looks like an elongated face, with the Sanjay Gandhi National Park blocking out the eyes, Malabar Hill representing the nose and the Back Bay appearing to be an open mouth. Bright blue lines plot the popular port hotspots in the southeast of the city. The map also reveals the major routes into and out of the city and highlights the relatively few journeys made across the Vashi Bridge to the suburbs . The cities are marked as nodes and . plotted on a larger map of the world. Clicking on a node lets you . download the map for that city. As expected, the busiest and most . affluent locations within these major cities are typically in the . centre, and around the airport.

Elsewhere, roads around the Royal Botanic Gardens and Museum of Contemporary Art in the centre of the Sydney map, pictured, are a wave of bright blue, as is Sydney Harbour Bridge. It is particularly bright in the affluent regions of Neutral Bay above the harbour, and Double Bay to the east of the Opera House. The main routes of the M5 heading southwest and M4 trailing off to the northwest towards Penrith frame the relatively sparse, poorer districts to the west including Liverpool and Campbelltown . While the maps of New York and San Francisco show the regions as being very narrow, Los Angeles, pictured, is much more flat and square with popular destinations shown as Santa Monica and Manhattan Beach on the coast.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . A lot physically separates the sexes, but all of these differences depend on one single element – the Y chromosome. Researchers have long held the belief that the X and Y chromosome were once identical, until the Y began to evolve and differentiate from the X in males - although the timing of this change was unknown. Now scientists from Switzerland claim the first ‘sex genes’ appeared in mammals around 180 million years ago and may have been caused by changes in global temperature. Researchers have long held the belief the X, pictured left, and Y, pictured right, chromosome were once identical, until the Y evolved and differentiated itself, but the timing of this change was unknown. Now scientists claim ‘sex genes’ appeared 180 million years ago and may have been caused by changes in global temperature . Researchers from Massachusetts have discovered that despite its dramatic decay, the Y chromosome has preserved a small set of genes over millions of years that have ensured the survival of men. And most have little, if any, role in sex determination or sperm production. Instead, they have been discovered to play a vital role in determining the differences between the sexes in terms of health and disease. The findings, published in the journal Nature, . suggest these Y-linked genes could be contributing to differences in . how susceptible the different sexes are to disease, and how severely it . affects them. By studying samples from several male tissues - taken predominantly from the testicles of different mammal species - researchers from the University of Lausanne's Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics took the Y chromosome genes from the three major mammal lines. These included placentals, such as humans, apes, rodents and elephants; marsupials such as opossums and kangaroos; and monotremes - egg-laying mammals which include the platypus and the echidna. In total, the researchers worked with samples from 15 different mammals, representing these three lineages, as well as the chicken, which they included for comparison. Instead of sequencing these Y chromosomes, the scientists compared genetic sequences from male and female tissues. From this they were able to eliminate all sequences common to both sexes in order to keep only those sequences corresponding to the Y chromosome. Researchers from the University of Lausanne studied the Y chromosome genes from the three major mammal lines. These included placentals, such as humans and elephants, pictured left; marsupials such as opossums and kangaroos, pictured right; and egg-laying mammals which include the platypus and the echidna . By doing so, they established the largest gene atlas of the male chromosome to date. The study shows that the same sex-determining gene, named SRY, in placentals and marsupials had formed in the common ancestor of both lineages around 180 million years ago. Another gene, called AMHY, is responsible for the emergence of Y chromosomes in monotremes and appeared 175 million years ago. Both genes, which according to researcher Professor Henrik Kaessmann are ‘involved in testicular development ,’ and emerged ‘nearly at the same time but in a totally independent way .’ The scientists believe the trigger may have been linked to other sex chromosomes, or environmental factors such as the temperature. For example, temperature determines sex in present-day crocodiles and may have played a role 180 million years ago.","Researchers have long held the belief X and Y chromosomes were identical .

"By . Mark Prigg . The Supreme Court is set to hear a case that could change the way we watch TV. New York firm Aereo sends live TV broadcasts to mobile devices - but broadcasters wants it to stop. Now the entertainment conglomerates that own U.S. television networks are waging a legal fight, culminating in Tuesday's Supreme Court argument. Scroll down for video . The Aereo system allows tablet owners to watch live TV anywhere . Aereo currently has paying subscribers in 11 cities, and charges from $8 a month. It is available in New York, Boston, Houston and Atlanta, among others. Subscribers get about two dozen local over-the-air stations, plus the Bloomberg TV financial channel. In the New York market, Aereo has a data center in Brooklyn with thousands of dime-size antennas. When a subscriber wants to watch a show live or record it, the company temporarily assigns him an antenna and transmits the program over the Internet to the subscriber's laptop, tablet, smartphone or other device. The antenna is only used by one subscriber at a time, and Aereo says that's much like the situation at home, where a viewer uses a personal antenna to watch over-the-air broadcasts for free. Aereo Inc currently has paying subscribers in 11 cities. Backed by billionaire Barry Diller, has plans to more than double that total. Broadcasters including ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and PBS have sued Aereo for copyright infringement, saying Aereo should pay for redistributing the programming the same way cable and satellite systems do. The U.S. networks increasingly are reliant on these retransmission fees, estimated at $3.3 billion last year and going up to more than $7 billion by 2018, according to research by SNL Kagan, which analyzes media and communications trends. They fear that they will lose some of that money if the Supreme Court rules for Aereo. Aereo's service starts at $8 a month and is available in New York, Boston, Houston and Atlanta, among others.

The antenna is only used by one subscriber at a time, and Aereo says that's much like the situation at home, where a viewer uses a personal antenna to watch over-the-air broadcasts for free. 'Aereo is in some ways novel, but it is also among a host of technologies that uses the Internet to offer consumers the ability to do what they always have more cheaply and conveniently,' the Dish Network and Echostar Technologies said in a supporting legal brief filed in the Supreme Court. But the broadcasters and their backers argue that Aereo's competitive advantage lies not in its product, but in avoiding paying for it. 'Aereo is simply a blatant free rider trying to make a quick buck without paying anything toward the true costs of what it misappropriates,' Time Warner Inc. said in a court filing. The broadcasters told the court that Aereo's ""competitors pay for the rights to retransmit 'live TV' to the public — as they must to avoid liability for copyright infringement — while Aereo does not."" The federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo did not violate the copyrights of broadcasters with its service, but a similar service has been blocked by judges in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said its ruling stemmed from a 2008 decision in which it held that Cablevision Systems Corp. could offer a remote digital video recording service without paying additional licensing fees to broadcasters because each playback transmission was made to a single subscriber using a single unique copy produced by that subscriber. The Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal from movie studios, TV networks and cable TV channels. Barry Diller, whose firm Aereo is set to take on TV broadcasters . The entertainment industry has changed dramatically since the high court ruled in favor of home video recording in 1984 in a 5-4 decision. Then, Sony was the maker of the Betamax recorder and Universal City Studios and Walt Disney Productions were arguing for protection under copyright law. Now, Disney owns ABC and cable giant Comcast owns NBC and Universal. In the Aereo case, a dissenting judge said his court's decision would eviscerate copyright law. Judge Denny Chin called Aereo's setup a sham and said the individual antennas are a ""Rube Goldberg-like contrivance"" — an overly complicated device that accomplishes a simple task in a confusing way — that exists for the sole purpose of evading copyright law. The Obama administration, artists, actors, Major League Baseball and the National Football League all support the broadcasters. But the administration and computer software and telecommunications groups are urging the court to avoid a broad ruling in favor of copyright protection that could call into question the rapidly evolving world of cloud computing, which gives users access to a vast online computer network that stores and processes information. Smaller cable companies, independent broadcasters and consumer groups are backing Aereo. FM radio and cable TV were initially derided as unnecessary, inefficient or just bizarre, said the digital civil liberties watchdog Electronic Frontier Foundation. In a legal filing joined by other public interest groups and the consumer electronics trade association, the group said the justices should not become regulators of technology and 'the court should not attempt to predict the future of television.'","Aereo allows subscribers to watch live TV on their mobile device .

It can connect to both iOS and Android devices to allow a wearer to make calls and send and receive text messages, as well as other features . The Rufus Cuff is currently a prototype but will have a 3-inch screen once the Los Angeles-based start-up, Rufus Labs, has raised the cash required to put it into production. It said: ‘The Rufus Cuff ends the era of the watch and ushers in the Wrist Communicator.’ The watch cannot connect to a phone network on its own, but digitally linked up to a smartphone, users will be able to make and receive voice and video calls plus text messages. Vibrating and light alerts will be used to let users known when they have mail or a call. ‘If you don’t want your call overheard, . simply switch off the speaker and continue by holding your wrist up to . your ear or put the call back on your smartphone,’ the firm said. Loud and clear: The watch has a built-in microphone and camera and runs a full Android operating system (pictured) so wearers can use apps listed on the Google Play store . It has a built-in microphone and camera and runs a full Android operating system so wearers can use apps listed on the Google Play store. Users will be able to scroll through social media feeds and use popular apps like Skype and WhatsApp, while a full web browser will let them access the internet without restrictions. It will also have GPS and accelerometer and gyroscope on board so it can support lots of fitness apps and count steps taken, calories burned and distance travelled. Big and Bold: The Rufus Cuff is currently a prototype but will have a 3-inch screen, once the start-up has raised the cash required to put it into production. Its screen is much larger than that of Samsung's Galaxy Gear and Pebble (pictured) but its designer claims it is more comfortable as weight is more evenly distributed . A Bluetooth connection will allow users to manage music playlists or take photos on their smartphone remotely. Gabe Grifoni, CEO and co-founder of the start-up told Mashable that he was inspired to create the watch while driving back from CES 2013, having seen plenty of smart watches but thinking that they could be done better. ‘Smartwatches are cool - a good start to where we should be going - but this is where we should be.’ Colourful: Gabe Grifoni, CEO and co-founder of the . start-up said he was inspired to create the watch while . driving back from CES 2013, having seen plenty of smart watches but . thinking that they could be done better. His design is striking, large (pictured right) and comes in many colour combinations (pictured left) Mr Grifoni hopes that one day smart watches will replace smartphones and said that while his device has a big screen and is bulky, it is easy to wear – even for small wrists – because the weight is distributed over a greater area. The Rufus Cuff can be ordered on Indiegogo, where it is priced at $239 (£142) for early birds ranging to $888 (£531) for a completely customised version. At the time of writing the campaign has raised $125,000 (£74,707) of its $200,000 (£119,531) target with 13 days left and delivery of the gadget is expected in September.

A pair of rare ospreys returned to their nest in Wales after spending the winter in Africa to find two rival birds had moved in. Pictured here are Blue 24 (left) being attacked by Glesni (right) in a female battle for the nest . Ospreys are migratory birds and are also known as sea hawks, fish eagles, river hawks or fish hawks. They are fish-eating birds of prey that are active in the day and sleep at night. They can be found in a wide variety of habitats on every country except Antarctica. It is classed as a bird of 'Least Concern' on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Emyr Evans, of the Dyfi Osprey Project near Machynlleth, said: 'All hell broke loose. 'Monty arrived to find a strange female bird in the nest and soon presented her with a large fish - which is like chocolates and flowers to a bird of prey. 'But then his partner Glesni turned up and the feathers flew.' After a scrap the two intruders were sent packing but the female visitor was still hanging around. The two visiting ospreys - nicknamed Dai Dot and Blue 24 - normally spend their summers 180 miles away in Rutland, East Midlands. Monty and Glesni, regular stars on BBC's Springwatch, discovered their nesting site had been taken over by squatters - two other ospreys - Dai Dot (left) and Blue 24 (right) Upon discovering the intruders, a fight between the birds soon broke out... Monty and Glesni raised two chicks Cerist and Clarach last year at the nesting site which is kept secret to stop raids by illegal egg collectors. Both adult birds were fitted with GPS tracking devices for BBC viewers to follow them during their winter migration to Africa.

"By . Associated Press . Forecasters are predicting a significant chance of strong tornadoes this weekend across a large part of the nation's mid-section, an outbreak that could stretch from the Great Plains to the Midwest and South. It's been a quiet year for tornadoes so far, but that doesn't mean the placid weather won't take an abrupt turn, forecasters said Thursday. 'Our run of relatively quiet weather may be about to come to an end,' Bill Bunting, operations chief for the Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said. Scroll down for video . There's a storm a-coming: A strong storm system, with high winds and torrential rain, is taking shape in the south central United States this weekend and threatens to produce tornadoes, which have been relatively uncommon so far this year . Bunting said the coming system will start Saturday in the Plains - Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas and a sliver of South Dakota - and move eastward into Missouri, Arkansas and Louisiana on Sunday. The system is expected to stretch into parts of Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi and Alabama later Sunday. Strong winds in the upper and middle atmosphere will meet most air moving north from the Gulf of Mexico, creating conditions conducive for tornado development, Bunting said. 'The threat is there and folks need to monitor the latest information from the National Weather Service,' Bunting said. Bunting said that people in the affected areas should be aware that dangerous weather is possible. But when it comes to exactly where and how dangerous, he said it's too early to say. Active storm system: Storm chaser Brad Mack take photos of a low level thunder storms supercells pass over the area of Bearden, Arkansas earlier this week . Large hail and damaging straight-line winds of more than 70 mph are likely, in addition to possible tornadoes. The system is expected to bring heavy rain, so flash flooding and even some river flooding is possible, according to the National Weather Service. The Midwest and South haven't seen many severe storms yet this spring, but Bunting noted that residents in the forecast area are accustomed to violent weather this time of year. Bunting said people who are headed to outdoor activities, from golf outings to spring festivals, should make sure they can receive weather warnings in case they need to quickly find shelter. Severe weather forecast: Multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes into early next week . Rough forecast: This weekend, the next weather system will begin to kick into gear and spark multiple rounds of severe thunderstorms and possible tornadoes from Saturday through at least Tuesday . Forboding: Menacing dark clouds brought rain, wind and  lightning above downtown Durham  North Carolina, on Friday  afternoon, April 25, 2014,  as cold and warm fronts clashed, making a dangerous weather situation . The Oklahoma City Memorial Marathon is scheduled for Sunday and organizers are emphasizing their alert system to notify participants and spectators of approaching storms. The marathon has three parking garages near the start and finish lines where people can take shelter. A color-coded warning system will be in place at medical aid stations that dot the course. If people need a reminder of how dangerous tornadoes can be, this weekend marks the third anniversary of a 175-twister, multi-day outbreak that killed 316 people, the third-deadliest outbreak in U.S. history. The fatalities occurred as 122 tornadoes swept through on April 27, 2011, striking parts of Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia.","Threat of severe weather is ramping up from the Plains into the Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley and parts of the South through early next week .

"By . Michael Seamark . Conviction: As horrified parents and pupils at London's elite Southbank International School are now discovering, William Vahey was hiding a vile secret . Outwardly, Bill Vahey was a pillar of respectability within the world educational community. His global CV spanned four decades and nine countries, he attended international leadership conferences and was married to the executive director of the European Council of International Schools. But, as horrified parents and pupils at London’s elite Southbank International School are now discovering, the American was hiding a vile secret. Away from the classroom, where he taught geography and history, the 64-year-old father-of-two was concealing his serial paedophilia under cover of school trips. Gloria Doll, director general of the American Nicaraguan School in Managua where Vahey’s sordid activities were finally uncovered, said yesterday he was ‘famous for wanting to lead student experience trips’. The FBI say Vahey coached basketball at several of the schools and regularly accompanied students on overnight field trips and other ‘educational or athletic travel opportunities’. Agents say the teacher, described by parents as highly popular and respected, ‘created a system that gave him the opportunity and the means to molest children.’ It is field trips on which he accompanied youngsters to Nepal and Venezuela, while working in London between 2009 and 2013, that school governors are focusing on to identify possible victims. Graham Lacey, executive principal at Southbank International School said Vahey was subject to a CRB check when he joined the school, which revealed nothing untoward. Scroll down for video . Teacher: The FBI say William Vahey, who abused children at London's elite Southbank International School, regularly accompanied students on overnight field trips . A second check three years later produced the same result and Mr Lacey added that three references the school obtained were ‘outstanding’. His CV showed he had been registered as a teacher in the state of New Jersey in 1986 and his ‘immaculate record’ raised no concerns. But no check picked up on a conviction for child molestation in California in 1969. Vahey had been arrested on six counts but pleaded guilty to one charge and was sentenced to 90 days in jail, followed by five years probation.

At 1:20 a.m. Saturday, firefighters from several departments still were working to contain the blaze and some homes had been evacuated. A gas line at the home continued to shoot flames several feet high two hours after the explosion. Insulation from the home was found as far away as half a mile.

"By . Jessica Jerreat . There has been a rise in the number of Chinese investors snapping up apartments in New York after finding they can get more for their money in Manhattan than Shanghai or Hong Kong. Russians used to dominate the property market in the city, but their interest has dropped since the crisis in Ukraine and the increasing threat of sanctions. The number of buyers from China is nearly a fifth higher than it was this time last year, with many signing deals on properties they haven't even viewed in person. Scroll down for video . Investment: Chinese buyers are dominating Manhattan's property market, with a trend for owning apartments in buildings such as One57, above . One of the driving forces behind the increased interest in the Manhattan property market is that investors find they get more square footage for their money. In previously popular markets for Chinese, such as Hong Kong, buyers expect to pay between $4,100 to $5,000 per square foot. But in Manhattan it is nearer $2,100. 'By far and away, the Chinese are the fastest-growing demographic,' Dean Jones, of Sotheby's International, said. 'They are the top consumer for real estate, and New York is front and center.' Nikki Field, of Sotheby's, added that the Russians had been 'gone since the Crimean outbreak' and said Chinese investors now accounted for 28.5 percent of his international business. 'We've only scratched the surface with Chinese demand,' Field said, adding that in the first quarter of this year Chinese business was up 19 percent from the same time period last year. No official figures exist for the nationalities of home buyers because of New York's discrimination laws, but five top real estate brokers gave Reuters their listing of foreign investors. More for your money: Investors have found they can get more square footage for less in New York City than in Hong Kong and Shanghai . Online shopping: One investor recently bought two apartments at the Baccarat, pictured in an artist's impression above, in a deal brokered on a social media website . Chinese buyers took the lead in volume and value of sales in all five estimates. 'In sheer . numbers, the Chinese outspend the Russians in every segment of the . market,' Pamela Liebman, of Corcoran . Group, told Reuters. One key factor was their desire to establish a base in cities such as New York and London so their children have access to Western education. Apartments near leading universities are popular with families, even when the child is too young to walk, let alone start life at college. Shawn Elliott, who takes groups of Chinese buyers on property tours every week, said: 'They're . looking for trophy properties. They're looking for . their children to be comfortable, and to be near Columbia or New York . University.' Typically, Chinese investors spend between $1 million to $5 milion in New York, and buy two to three properties as an investment. But a recent trend has seen them move towards the luxury range, with a fashion for taking apartments in One57, the 90-storey building overlooking Central Park. Life of luxury: Popular buildings such as One57 have amazing city views and and hotel-like amenities . New owners: The lavish design of One57 appeals to the Chinese buyers, who have replaced Russians as the leading property investors in the city . Pritzker Prize-winning architect Christian de Portzamparc designed the skyscraper, where apartments start at $18.85 million for a three-bedroom, and rise to $55 million for a home that covers the entire 81st floor. Each apartment has floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park and the Manhattan skyline, and the building has a private performance room, swimming pool and gym and yoga studio, and 24ft aquarium. Another popular luxury building is the Baccarat Hotels & Residences, where one buyer recently took over two apartments for $13 million without ever stepping foot inside them. The entire deal was conducted through the Chinese social networking site, WeChat, according to Emma Hao of Douglas Elliman, who managed the sale. Brokers forecast the Chinese will continue to dominate the market, with Liam Bailey of Knight Frank said: 'There will be more Chinese buyers, and they will take more share of the market.'","Ukraine crisis and threat of sanctions blamed for drop in Russian interest .

"By . John Hall . Children are not harmed in any way by losing in competitive sports, former Olympian Sir Roger Bannister has claimed. Speaking at the Chipping Norton Literary Festival in Oxfordshire, the 85-year-old said young people need more competitive sports in schools, not less, adding that he felt 'terribly strongly' about the importance of physical education lessons. The former athlete, who rose to fame after breaking the four minute mile barrier in 1954, described changes to the way sport was taught in schools as 'worrying'. Scroll down for video . Legend: Sir Roger, who rose to fame after breaking the four minute mile barrier in 1954, described changes to the way sport was taught in schools as 'worrying' Athlete: Roger Bannister as a young man was the first person to break the four minute mile in 1954. He believes competitiveness is a vital life skill and should be encouraged in schools . Sir Roger was quoted by The Telegraph as saying: 'Children like competing. They don't suffer an emotional crippling for life if they come second or third in the egg and spoon race.' More... Winner takes it all? Not as far as Britain's school pupils are concerned, with nearly two thirds 'left cold' by the idea of competitive sport . 'In some schools PE can easily be got out of. It's not attractive because there's no competition. Or they have to get on a bus somewhere to get there because their playing fields have been sold off to fund a computer room,' he added. Sir Roger's comments echo those made in his new autobiography, Twin Tracks, where he demands the Government avoid 'destructive neglect' caused by schools making daily exercise a low priority. Competition: Children are not harmed in any way by losing in competitive sports Sir Roger Bannister has said. The former Olympian, 85, added that he felt 'terribly strongly' about the importance of physical education . He also criticises the 'more liberal concepts' that took hold in the 1980s where failure became something as purely negative, and a competitive spirit as something that is 'bad for character'. Last week a survey claimed that most children would be happy for competition to be removed from sport as they had lost interest in the concept of winning. Research by Marylebone Cricket Club suggested that although pupils still believe it is . important to experience winning and losing, 64 per cent admit they wouldn't . miss sport's competitive element. The survey prompted experts to voice concern that sports lessons were failing to foster competitive spirit in pupils, warning that Britian risked losing its competitive edge unless young people start caring about whether they win or lose. The research also led to speculation that a 'prizes for all' culture still holds sway at many schools.","Former Olympian said he feels 'terribly strongly' about sports in schools .

"By . Carol Driver . Nearly 200 passengers have been awarded hundreds of thousands of pounds in compensation after being struck down by a vomiting bug on board ‘atrocious’ cruises. Holidaymakers had to endure overflowing toilets, urine-covered floors and lukewarm food on the Island Escape, on which they suffered diarrhoea, stomach cramps and severe sickness. TUI, the cruise operator, has now agreed to pay a substantial six-figure settlement to the passengers, who travelled on board the ship to destinations including Morocco, Gibraltar, Madeira and Las Palmas between December 2009 and June 2010. 'Disaster' cruise: Nearly 200 passengers have won a six-figure compensation package after falling sick on board the Island Escape ship . Some passengers had booked their holidays for Christmas, wedding anniversary and birthday celebrations. Colette Ellis, 59, from Fareham, Hampshire, travelled on the luxury ship for a two-week cruise to mark her mother's 75th birthday. Within days the entire family were struck with stomach cramps and sickness which left them confined to their cabin for the majority of their holiday. Payout: Passengers are to receive compensation after falling ill on a Tui cruise, which they said was 'atrocious' on board, with a leaking roof on one ship . Both Ms Ellis and her mother still experience gastric symptoms. Ms Ellis said: ‘Our holiday was totally ruined, the conditions aboard the vessel were atrocious. ‘On . occasions toilets were blocked and overflowing, cabins were grubby and . on occasions food was not served at the correct temperature. ‘This . was supposed to be a dream cruise but it quickly turned into an . absolute nightmare, certainly a Christmas time we wanted to forget. ‘On our return home both myself and my mum, who was celebrating her 75th birthday continued to suffer illness. ‘We hope no one else has to go through such an experience like we did.’ 'Atrocious': Passenger photos taken with a mobile phone reveal the dirty conditions on board the Island Escape . Ruined holiday: An mobile phone photo on board shows the 'atrocious' conditions of the ship . Collette was one of more than 100 passengers who were struck down by illness on the Island Escape between December 2009 and June 2010. They were not warned of the risk of illness prior to boarding. Sunshine Cruises Limited, Thomson and First Choice Holidays & Flights Limited have denied liability. But travel lawyers at Irwin Mitchell have now secured a settlement of ‘several hundred thousand pounds’ from TUI in compensation. This was for more than 100 passengers who have been ill and dozen whose holiday was ruined as a result. Passengers affected are expected to receive up to £10,000 each. Irwin Mitchell is also representing a 117 further passengers who have made similar claims following trips on the same cruise ship in 2012 and 2013. Elizabeth Tetzner, a travel law expert at the firm, said: ‘We are pleased for this group of passengers that travelled on board the cruise ship in 2009 and 2010 that their legal battle is over and they will now receive settlements after their trips were ruined aboard the Island Escape cruise. ‘A number of the passengers that suffered illness suffered from symptoms such as stomach cramps, diarrhoea, vomiting and lethargy. ‘Aside from making the cruise extremely unpleasant, these types of illness can have a debilitating long term impact on their health. ‘Some passengers had to seek medical assistance on board the cruise ship, whilst others had to seek medical assistance upon return home. ‘Passengers have described to us how these special occasions were ruined by the illness suffered or by the experiences they suffered on board the cruise ship. ‘We hope that now a settlement has been reached they will be able to get on with their lives and put the experience behind them.’ A spokesman for TUI said they did not comment on settlements.","Passengers travelling on board TUI's Island Escape fell unwell in 2009/10 .

Among those aged 18 to 30 going overseas to work, 43 per cent say they are seeking adventure, 21 per cent aspire to work abroad and 36 per cent had simply had enough of Britain. One of the main reasons for the exodus abroad among young people was the continuing poor state of the jobs market with more than half (54 per cent) describing it as 'bad'. Seeking adventure: More young travellers are leaving the UK due to dire jobs market, says the report . The research, carried out by youth travel and work organisation Smaller Earth UK, went on to highlight how just 28 per cent thought the current UK jobs situation to be 'good'. Smaller Earth UK placed more than 6,000 young adults on its Camp Leaders programme in the United States in 2013, an increase of almost 20 per cent on the previous year. The organisation is also seeing growing interest in other parts of the world, with a 243 per cent rise in the number of applications from people to work as au pairs in China. Other countries in which Smaller Earth UK operates include Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, Czech Republic and Vietnam. Getaway: Smaller Earth UK has seen a rise in the number of young people leaving the UK to work abroad . The survey of 1,000 young people aged 18-30 highlighted how 65 per cent had a clear idea about their future career, but felt that the opportunity to work and travel overseas would enhance their prospects of competing in the employment market. Smaller Earth UK Chief Executive Bastian Weinberger said: 'We know from the increasing number of applicants we are seeing that young people continue to have serious concerns about the opportunities available to them in Britain. 'They are therefore grabbing with both hands the chance to work and travel abroad to improve their prospects of securing jobs in the future, either overseas or in the UK. 'It is also the case that the continuing uncertainty of the UK jobs market is driving many people aged 18-30 to go off in search of a great adventure. 'Young people are far more global in their outlook these days so the idea of travelling or working abroad holds few fears. It is also a lot cheaper to travel abroad than was the case a few years ago.' The Smaller Earth UK survey confirmed this with 89 per cent of respondents saying they had no concerns about their safety travelling abroad. All of those gaining placements on the Camp Leaders programme for 2014 said they intended to use the opportunity to travel around the United States when their placement was finished.","Smaller Earth UK report shows 54% of 18-30s leave UK due to jobs market .

The pilots, both Taiwanese, were injured in the smash but were taken to hospital and are not thought to be seriously hurt. Scroll down for video . Clean-up: Rescue workers lifted the wrecked helicopter from the building yesterday . According to a military spokesman, the accident took place during a routine training mission. Rescue workers could be seen yesterday extracting the smashed wreckage from the building. 'The incident happened during basic flight training for unknown reasons and a special team is investigating the cause,' an official told the South China Morning Post. Taiwan in November took delivery of its first six AH-64E Apache attack helicopters bought from the United States as it modernises its military despite warming ties with China. It temporarily grounded the choppers from December to February for checks after Washington warned the model could malfunction. Wrecked: Both pilots survived the crash, and were taken to hospital . The devastating attack helicopter, which comes equipped with laser-guided missiles, rockets and machine guns, is the same model which Prince Harry learned to use in his military training. The prince qualified as a qualifying as a co-pilot gunner in February 2012. Officers were so impressed with his aptitude for flying the Â£46million helicopter that he was handed the prize of top co-pilot gunner on his course. He later gave up flying attack helicopters in favour of a desk job.","Aircraft smashed into a building in Taoyuan county yesterday .

"By . Associated Press . Health officials are worried about recent U.S. measles outbreaks that have caused more illnesses than at the same point of any year since 1996. Authorities say 129 cases in 13 states were reported by mid-April, the bulk of them in California and New York City. Most were triggered by travelers who caught the virus abroad and spread it in the United States among unvaccinated people. Scroll down for video . Origin: Doctors say that many of the U.S. cases stem from Americans who traveled recently to the Philippines where an epidemic has been spreading throughout the country (a child getting vaccinated in Manila is pictured) Many of the travelers had been to the Philippines, where a recent measles epidemic has caused at least 20,000 illnesses. The U.S. numbers remain relatively tiny, but officials are worried to see case counts growing. Since 2000, the highly contagious disease has been considered eliminated in the United States, aside from occasional small outbreaks sparked by overseas travelers. For most of the last decade, the nation was seeing only about 60 cases a year but since 2010, the average has been nearly 160. 'This increase in cases may be a “new normal,” unfortunately,' said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. A double-edged sword is causing part of the problem: Decades of measles vaccination campaigns have been so successful that many doctors have never seen a case, don't realize how contagious it is, and may not take necessary steps to stop it from spreading. 'New normal': Dr William Shaffner says that the increasing rate of measles cases in the U.S. appears to be a growing- and steadying- trend . Among the 58 cases reported from California, at least 11 were infected in doctor's offices, hospitals or other health-care settings, according to a report released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. New York City health officials say two of their 26 cases were infected in medical facilities. 'It's a shock to younger physicians that their own waiting room or emergency room is where people can get measles,' said the CDC's Dr. Anne Schuchat. Also on Thursday, a medical journal — the Annals of Internal Medicine — released a commentary warning doctors to prevent that kind of situation. 'We must ensure that our facilities do not become centers for secondary measles transmission,' wrote Dr. Julia Shaklee Sammons, an infectious disease specialist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. She urged doctors who suspect a measles case to place the patient in an isolation room with special ventilation that keeps the air from circulating around the building. Doctors and nurses should also wear surgical masks or respirators to protect themselves from getting infected, and to ask the infected patient to wear a surgical mask too. The measles virus spreads easily through the air, and in closed rooms. Infected droplets can linger for up to two hours after the sick person leaves. It causes a fever, runny nose, cough and a rash all over the body. In rare cases, measles can be deadly, and is particularly dangerous for children. Infection can also cause pregnant women to have a miscarriage or premature birth. Before a vaccine became available about 50 years ago, nearly all children got measles by their 15th birthday. In those days, nearly 500 Americans died from measles each year. A bad resurgence of measles hit the nation in 1989 to 1991, when 55,000 cases were reported. That flood of cases was blamed on a widespread failure to vaccinate uninsured children. In reaction, the federal government started a program in 1994 to pay for vaccines for kids who are uninsured, in the Medicaid program, or meet other criteria. Anti-vaccination: The number of Americans chosing not to get vaccinated has gone up in recent years and a host of celebrities- including Jenny McCarthy (left) and Alicia Silverstone (right) have been outspoken in their support of mothers opting out of the shots for their children . In a report released Thursday, CDC officials estimated that the program and other childhood vaccination efforts will prevent 322 million illnesses and 732,000 premature deaths over the course of the lifetimes of children born in the years 1994 through 2013. Wrapped into that estimate are 71 million measles cases, nearly 9 million measles hospitalizations and 57,000 measles deaths. There has been no measles deaths reported in the U.S. since 2003. 'But the way we're going, we feel it (another) is inevitable,' Schuchat said. Today, the measles vaccination rate is above 95 per cent for children of kindergarten age. But there has been a small but growing trend of parents seeking exemptions for their children from school-entry vaccination requirements for religious or philosophical reasons. Other parents have tried to space out, or delay, measles vaccinations because of fears that the shot will trigger autism or other problems. Measles outbreaks are more common in communities where such beliefs are more common, experts say. 'It's often concentrated there. Folks who think similarly tend to live in the same neighborhood or attend the same religious organization,' Schaffner said. The CDC national tally may already be outdated. Also on Thursday, Ohio officials announced a new cluster of 13 suspected cases in rural Knox County. At least three traveled to the Philippines last month on a religious humanitarian mission. About 17 per cent of U.S. cases this year were vaccinated. Health officials say that although the vaccine is very effective, it's not perfect.","So far this year there have been 129 cases in 13 states .

"By . Becky Evans . Scroll down for videos . Three bizarre Chinese sex education videos offering advice for children on how to avoid being molested have gone viral. The three one-minute hand-drawn animations tackle questions including 'where babies come from', 'why boys are different from girls' and 'how minors can prevent molestation'. In a country where sex education is still a controversial topic, the animators say they want to give children basic information. The three bizarre hand-drawn animations aim to give basic sex education to young Chinese children . In this one-minute video children are given advice on how to protect themselves from molestation . The videos were released last week and became an immediate hit in China and have already been viewed more than one million times. The cartoons' creator, Zhao Yilong, said he was spurred into action after a series of molestation scandals in China. Mr Zhao said he wanted to tackle dangerous levels of ignorance by making basic information accessible. He told China's state-run Xinhau news agency: 'Children are curious about sex, so we wanted to explain it clearly in a cartoon.' A study released this year by Chinese newspaper the Beijing News and charity the Maple Women's Psychological Counselling Center found that fewer than one in five parents had told their children how to ask for help if they felt they were being victimised. The creators use metaphors to explain sex and compares insemination to a hospital injection . The cartoons debunk myths, including a common one that babies come from garbage dumps, and explain how they originate from sperm and eggs . The survey of 1,100 parents found that only one in three said they had told their children about 'private parts which no one else can touch'. Of the 107 six to 14-year-olds surveyed, 38 per cent showed complete ignorance about protecting their bodies. Mr Zhao also hopes the metaphors used in the animations - funded by technology site Guokr - will give adults advice on how to broach the topic. In China, a common reply to the question of where babies come from is they were 'picked up at a garbage dump'. The narrator in one clip explains this is not true but that babies are conceived by 'a combination of sperm and eggs'. The videos tackle subjects such as 'where babies come from' and 'why boys are different from girls' In another it compares male and female genitalia to plugs and sockets and says insemination is similar to an injection. Liu Wenli, who researches children's sex education at Beijing Normal University, told Xinhau that the popularity of the three cartoons shows the dearth of information in the country. He said: 'The internet has become an effective tool for sex education but it cannot replace the roles of parents and schools.' There are growing calls in China for better sex education in schools. A survey this year found 90 per cent of parents support teachers giving information in the classroom. However, only about one in 1,000 secondary schools in the country provide it, according to Tea Leaf Nation.","Three one-minute animations for children viewed more than 1million times .

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Peter Allen . Socialist Francois Hollande performed a dramatic U-turn on the economy yesterday by announcing he would slash public spending by 50billion euros (£43billion). With his stagnant country being compared to the economic disaster zone of Greece, and his popularity at rock bottom, Mr Hollande announced a four per cent reduction in budgets for national and local authorities. The French leader’s volte-face came two years after he turned his back on eurozone austerity that ‘cannot be our horizon’. Pledge: Francois Hollande performed a dramatic U-turn on the economy yesterday by announcing he would slash public spending by 50billion euros . Yesterday the President, who has witnessed the wealthy fleeing France because of his crushing 75 per cent tax rate, signalled he would go easier on businesses by reducing ‘certain taxes’. In another about-turn, he also said he wanted to simplify French bureaucracy and petty rules in a country notorious for its red tape. ‘We must begin a new battle. The challenge is not just that France finds growth, but it needs to be vigorous,’ said Mr Hollande. Speaking at his press conference, he was asked why so many French youngsters under the age of 25 were leaving for more economically successful countries such as the UK. ‘I often meet these young people when I go abroad,’ said the French leader. ‘They are ambassadors of our country across the world. 'We hope they come back. How do we get them back? It’s an employment issue and a question of pay.’ Exodus: Speaking at his press conference, Mr Hollande was asked why so many French youngsters under the age of 25 were leaving for more economically successful countries such as the UK . President Hollande said he wanted to simplify French bureaucracy and petty rules in a country notorious for its red tape . He said France needed to bounce back from recession, saying that a ‘responsibility pact’ with big business would be the key. Mr Hollande said that ‘everyone will be involved - businesses, unions, local authorities. No time must be lost. France must bounce back and get back on the right foot’. The plan effectively involves the government reducing the cost of hiring labour in return for increased recruitment, so as to cut down on a jobless figure past the 3million mark. In another controversial announcement, the left-wing leader vowed to enact a record expulsion of 20,000 Roma gypsies from France. Despite condemnation from the European Commission, the president said he was determined to crack down on the numbers arriving from Romania and Bulgaria. French police demolished 165 out of 400 illegal Roma camps last year, pushing almost 20,000 people out in the process, according to figures collected by France’s League of Human Rights and the European Roma Rights Centre. Mr Hollande also defended his decision to send troops to the the troubled African states of Mali and Central African Republic last year, saying both ‘would have been worse without the intervention.’","Stagnant country being .

"By . Hugo Gye . and Sam Greenhill . Published: . 13:00 EST, 30 December 2013 . Complaint: Lisa Bowden says she needs a new council house because someone died in her flat . A jobless mother is demanding a new council home after she complained that a previous tenant had died in hers – which she says offends her gipsy culture. Lisa Bowden, who has not worked in 15 years and collects around £13,000 a year in benefits, was given her current newly-decorated two-bedroom flat two months ago. But she discovered that a man had died there, and claims it is against her culture to live where someone has passed away. Miss Bowden, 40, who has four children by two fathers, said she can feel the presence of the deceased man’s ‘spirit’ and insisted that Dartford Borough Council move her to a three- bedroom house with a garden. Neighbours branded her a ‘freeloader’. The former traveller, whose flat in the pretty Kent village of Stone, near Dartford, is equipped with mod cons, said: ‘When someone dies from a gipsy culture, we would burn the caravan. ‘It is forbidden for us to enter somewhere where someone has died. It doesn’t matter that the man who died here was not a gipsy. I can feel his spirit and it gives me the shivers. 'I can’t live here – I always sleep with the light on and would never stay at night on my own. The council need to give me a new home – one with a garden and three bedrooms so my daughter can visit.’ Miss Bowden lives with her nine-year-old son, while her 15-year-old daughter lives with her father, Miss Bowden’s ex-husband. Her other children have left home. She gets £70 weekly employment and support allowance, and £60 a week in child tax credits. She also receives £80 a month in child benefit, and her £90 weekly rent is paid for by the taxpayer. Demands: Ms Bowden was given her current two-bedroom flat in Stone, near Dartford, two months ago . Home: Ms Bowden inside the living room of the taxpayer-funded flat, which is equipped with mod cons . Demand: The mother of four says it is against travellers' beliefs to live in a home where someone has died . Her house has two flat-screen . televisions, a PlayStation 3 console, a Nintendo Wii, a new sofabed and a . new microwave, kettle and toaster. At Christmas she bought her . nine-year-old a laptop computer. When . she was given the flat in October, the council gave her nearly £200 to . redecorate, and she got a new bathroom and kitchen. Miss Bowden said she . had called in a priest in an attempt to exorcise her flat, but claims . she can still ‘smell the death’ inside it. She . claims her ‘haunted’ flat  is making worse a long-standing lung . condition, and was recently admitted to hospital for a chest infection. She added: ‘I told them I didn’t want a flat where someone died, but . they didn’t listen and told me either I take the flat or I end up on the . street.’ One neighbour . said: ‘She’s so ungrateful. Beggars can’t be choosers. Nobody should . turn their nose up at a free flat, even if someone has died in it. It’s . not like he is still in there.’ Bedroom: The master bedroom in Ms Bowden's flat, which she moved into in October this year . Family: Ms Bowden sits in the bedroom of her nine-year-old son, who has his own flat-screen television . Before . her present home, Miss Bowden lived in nearby Thamesmead with a . partner, before leaving him and ending up in a shelter. Prior to that, . she lived in Kent in a council-owned home with her first husband, whom . she married aged 16. Matthew . Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Many . people will find it difficult to believe a council could be accused of . mistreating someone by providing a taxpayer-funded council house.’ Joseph Jones, spokesman for the Gypsy Council of Great Britain, said: ‘I think everyone has their own take on gipsy rules. ‘She . is right that when someone dies in a caravan it’s traditional to lay . them to rest then burn the caravan. I think it’s important everyone’s . religious beliefs don’t count against them.’ A Dartford Borough Council spokesman said: ‘We have no plans to rehome her. We have no further comment.’ Not enough: The mother of four has insisted that Dartford Borough Council move her to a house with a garden . Lisa Bowden is the latest in a series of council house tenants who have demanded to be moved to a better home. The best-known is Heather Frost, an unemployed mother of 11 who lived in two council houses in Churchdown, Gloucestershire but complained that they were too small for her. Her local council agreed to build her a new six-bedroom eco-house in order to house the whole family. Demand: Heather Frost had a new home built for her because she could not fit her 11 children in her house . However, she attracted public outrage when it emerged that she owned a horse on which she spent about £200 a month. Ms Frost also used benefits money to pay for her unemployed partner to take flying lessons. A documentary crew later filmed her apparently buying stolen groceries from door-to-door salesmen, prompting her to claim that 'everybody has to get their goods off shoplifters'. In October, mother of nine Cheryl Prudham, from Sittingbourne in Kent, said she needed a larger house to fit her whole family. Complaint: Cheryl and Robert Prudham said they needed a larger home because they could not stop having children . Family: Maggie and Gavin Flisher said they needed a new home for themselves and their six children . She and husband Robert earned more than £50,000 tax-free from benefits and part-time work, but she said they could not stop having children because they disliked contraception. And this summer, Maggie Flisher demanded a new council house because she is 'super-fertile', meaning she and husband Gavin had six children. She said she had tried using contraception, but had been unable to stop herself getting pregnant again.","Lisa Bowden, 40, moved into two-bedroom council flat in October .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Miami-Dade Police believe they have their man, the one who violently killed an 18-year-old girl and coldly dumped her lifeless body in an empty lot. Fernando Granados, 20, of Homestead FL., confessed Thursday to the killing of Tiffany Cabreja. Mr Granados reportedly told investigators another man helped him kill the girl, he has yet to be apprehended. Mr Granados was snagged by police after he confessed to a relative he killed the girl. Confessed killer: Fernando Granados. Granados confessed to strangling 18-year-old Tiffany Cabreja and dumping her body at a construction site . The trio smoked crack-cocaine together at a local park before the two men strangled and beat her to death before leaving her lifeless body behind at a construction site, according to an affidavit cited by local media. ‘The victim was with this suspect, and another male, left her home with these two individuals, went to a nearby park, it’s my understanding they smoked crack at the park,’ Detective Roy Rutland, of Miami-Dade Police, told CBS Miami. Ms Cabreja was found earlier this week with a bag over her head, secured tightly with a cord, and covered in bruises, the affidavit said. Her cause of death was determined to be strangulation and blunt force trauma. Just turned 18: Ms Cabreja recently celebrated her 18th birthday, she's blowing out the candles on her cake in this picture . Mr Cabrejas almost immediately came clean with investigators after he was brought in for questioning. Saying he was high on crack-cocaine at the time, Mr Cabrejas told officials he attacked the young girl and put her in a choke hold while the other man ‘“simultaneously struck her from the front,’ the affidavit said. ‘Mr. Granados advised that he was under the influence of crack cocaine at the time he attacked the victim and was unaware if he killed her,’ said the affidavit. ‘It appears because they were sharing crack together, these two individuals lost control and murdered [Ms Cabreja],’ Mr Rutland told NBC Miami. Brutally killed: Tiffany Cabreja was strangled and beaten to death, her body was left in the below field . Desolate: Ms Cabreja's battered, strangled body was found in this field . Conflicting reports have Ms Cabreja’s father telling local media that she either knew Mr Granados from school or did not know him at all. The relationship between the trio is unclear at this time. The murdered teen’s heartbroken mother is still struggling to cope with the loss of her daughter.‘I have not slept for four days. I have not eaten. I can’t imagine what is going on. I feel a lot of pain inside,’ Miriam Vasquez told CBS Miami. ‘What they did to her was just horrible,’ Ms Vasquez added. ‘I saw her body and it was horrible what they did to her.’ Inconsolable: Miriam Vasquez, Ms Cabreja's mother, hasn't eaten of slept in days . Confused: Domingo Cabreja, Ms Cabreja's father, first told police she knew the killer, but has since gone back on that statement despite Mr Garagos confessing to picking her up from her home - Ms Cabreja lived with her father . Investigators initially focused their attention on a truck in the area where Ms Cabrejas body was discovered after multiple witnesses claimed to have seen a body fall out before being stuffed back in. That truck driver repeatedly proclaimed his innocence during interrogation and to any media outlet that would listen. His girlfriend told multiple local media outlets she was the one who fell out of the truck, not Ms Cabreja, and that it happened while the two were fighting. Officials are still searching for the second suspect.","Fernando Granados, 20, confessed to murdering 18-year-old Tiffany Cabreja, officials said .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Hawaiian woman whose last name contains a whopping 36 characters claims officials are bullying her and disrespecting her husband's heritage by shortening it because it doesn't fit on state-issued identification cards. Over the past 20-years, Janice 'Lokelani' Keihanaikukauakahihuliheekahaunaele has carried two separate IDS - a state ID card and a driver's license. The driver's license was printed with an abbreviated version of her family name and her first and middle name was completely left off. However, to counteract this, the Hawaiian Governor's office allowed her special dispensation to accommodate her full name on her state ID, but that expired in May and her problems began when her new one arrived laid out the same as her drivers license. Her frustrations began when she contacted her local county on Hawaii and asked them what could be done - they suggested she change her last name to make the situation easier on her and them.

"By . Sam Greenhill . and Peter Allen . A Briton who murdered his two young children in France by slitting their throats has hanged himself in prison, authorities said yesterday. Julian Stevenson was awaiting trial for killing Mathew, ten, and five-year-old Carla in an apparent fit of rage over a custody battle with his French ex-wife. The 48-year-old’s body was found in a sports hall at Corbas prison near Lyon on Monday and assistant prosecutor Pascal Guinot said there was ‘no doubt’ he had taken his own life. Now he's taken his own life: British father Julian Stevenson seen on CCTV with his two children - Mathew, 10, and Carla, 5 - in a bakery hours before he slit their throats with a kitchen knife in the French town of Lyon . Was facing murder trial: Stevenson left the scene of his crime, near the eastern French city of Lyon, on a pair of roller skates but was later found covered in blood . Stevenson had been on remand in . solitary confinement after admitting knifing his children in an . alcohol-fuelled rage at his apartment in Lyon in May. Their . French mother, Stephanie Morlet, had arrived to see her ex-husband . covered in blood and fleeing the scene of his gruesome crime on roller . skates. Inside, she discovered her children with their throats cut and collapsed in horror. Hours . before the tragedy, the unemployed father, who is originally from . Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was seen on CCTV buying his children sweets . in a bakery as they clutched pink balloons. Stevenson . – described as a wife beater and heavy drinker – had not been allowed . to see his children without a chaperone after attacking Miss Morlet, who . works as an accountant, in 2010. The . day of the murder was the first time in three years he had brought the . children home to his apartment without another adult being present. Mathew . and Carla were two of the most popular pupils at their primary school . in rural France and renowned for being extremely close. Grieving: Stevenson's ex-wife Stephanie Morlet (left) at the funeral of their two children Mathew, 10, and five-year-old Carla (right) in May . Tearful: Stephanie Morlet and her family took part in an emotional march in memory of the children days after their deaths . A . picture of them hugging and smiling – giving the impression of a . brother and sister who could not have been prouder of one another – was . displayed at a memorial event in their village of Charantonnay, south of . Lyon, a few days after the siblings died. Classmates . were in floods of tears as Miss Morlet, who is in her early 40s, walked . at the head of a procession of 300 people carrying white roses and . white balloons. Neighbour .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Fathers are twice as likely as mothers to have requests for flexible working rejected by bosses, figures show. Despite rules giving parents equal rights to ask for family-friendly hours, almost one in five men are rebuffed by employers. Labour blamed ‘cultural barriers’ which mean firms still see looking after children as the responsibility of mothers, with men expected to work full-time. Fathers are twice as likely as mothers to have requests for flexible working rejected . Figures released in Parliament show how men, people in their forties and northerners are more likely to have requests rejected. It also reveals how men are much less likely to even bother asking their boss for to work flexibly. In 2012, 18 per cent of men who asked for flexible working were turned down, compared to 10 per cent of women. Labour shadow children's minister Lucy Powell said dads feel short-changed by employers . Only 17 per cent of fathers even ask to change their hours compared to 28 per cent of women. It comes as a new report shows younger dads aged between 26 and 35 are the most resentful towards their employers about their work-life balance. Lucy Powell, Labour’s shadow children’s minister, said: ‘Childcare is not just an issue for mums. ‘These figures show that dads are getting a raw deal when trying to balance work and family. ‘Today, dads need a modern workplace and family-friendly policies and practices so they can get on at work as well as having time to be with their kids.’ The figures from the Department for Work and Pensions also reveal people are more likely to be turned down for flexible leave depending on their age or where they live. People in their forties are most likely to be rejected (18 per cent) compared to 12 per cent for 16-39-year-olds and 11 per cent of over-50s. People in the Midlands were least likely to be rebuffed (8 per cent) compared to 14 per cent in the south of England and 16 per cent in the north. As the law stands parents with children aged 16 or under, those with disabled children under 18, and carers of adults have the right to apply for a flexible working pattern. Data released to Parliament shows how men are more likely than women to have requests for flexible working turned down . Miss Powell added: ‘While women still face a glass ceiling to get back and get on in work, many dads face other cultural barriers to being able to flexibly including working long hours, inflexible organisational culture and expectations that men should be the main breadwinner. ‘This generation of dads feels short-changed by employers and the system. We know having more dads involved in childcare and home life is good for children but this should benefit employers too, making their employees happier and less resentful. Policy and practice needs to change to give more opportunities to fathers.’ A BIS spokesman said: 'We are extending the right to request flexible working to all employees from this year. 'By allowing everyone to work flexibly, we want to remove the cultural assumption that flexible working is only for women, or just for parents and carers. 'We want these reforms to bring about a culture change in Britain's workplaces, allowing everyone to better balance work with their personal life through jobs shares, part-time working or working from home. 'The current system for maternity and paternity leave has not kept up with the times, so in 2015 we're introducing shared parental leave and pay, which will allow working couples to choose how they share care for their child in the first year after birth. It will allow men to play a more active role in childcare and family responsibilities, and women to return to work sooner if they wish to.'","18% of men have claims rebuffed by firms, compared to 10% of men .

"By . Peter Allen . and Sam Greenhill . Francois Hollande’s government performed an embarrassing U-turn yesterday after his mistress was chosen for a top public job. The French president faced ridicule when it was announced that his secret lover, actress Julie Gayet, was to join a prestigious panel to decide arts funding. The decision was made before his infidelity with Miss Gayet, who is reported to be four months pregnant, became public. She has denied the pregnancy claims. Prestigious role: Francois Hollande's mistress has been denied a role as member of the Villa Medici jury for 2014 . Yesterday the embattled President’s aides hastily blocked the appointment. Mr . Hollande, 59, was already under fire for keeping his humiliated first . lady, Valerie Trierweiler, on the public payroll, despite confessing . about his year-long affair with Miss Gayet, 41. Yesterday . the Academy of France website reported that Miss Gayet was to become a . member of the jury on a prestigious cultural committee that chooses . artists to receive grants to stay at France’s Medici institute in Rome. The French press continued largely to ignore their leader’s duplicity yesterday. The . country’s main newspapers seem to agree with Francois Hollande that his . ‘painful’ private life is not a matter for the public – no matter how . much taxpayers’ money is being spent on it. Both Le Figaro and Le Monde concentrated on the Socialist’s announcement of £43billion spending cuts. They . did have short stories about his affair with Julie Gayet but Le Monde . carried a comment piece on his private life with the headline: ‘Three in . four French people do not care.’ The glamorous actress did adorn the front covers of the weekly magazines, with Elle calling her ‘a French passion’. It was to have been ratified by arts minister Aurelie Filipetti, who . chose Miss Gayet to ‘please Hollande’, according to Paris weekly Le . Canard Enchaine. But the . appointment threatened to sabotage Mr Hollande’s attempts to separate . his ‘painful’ love life from his public duties and government officials . rushed to insist it was just a ‘nomination’ and had been withdrawn. A . spokesman said Miss Gayet’s career as an actress meant she was a . ‘totally legitimate’ candidate for the jury but that Miss Filipetti . ‘decided not to make the appointment’. The . appointment also raised questions about the way in which the women in . Mr Hollande’s  life seem to have easy access to public roles. He has . refused to tell France which of the two women in his life is the . country’s first lady, saying it was a ‘private’ matter – despite the . role costing taxpayers an estimated £70,000  a month. Miss . Gayet was reported to have been boasting to friends of her ‘politician . lover’ for months, but it emerged last night she is to sue French . Closer, the magazine that exposed her affair, for breach of privacy. The President initially threatened to do the same but has now decided against it. French President Francois Hollande (left), pictured walking through the lobby of the Elysee Palace after the weekly cabinet meeting in Paris today, and Julie Gayet at the 65th Cannes Film Festival last year . A spokesman said Miss Gayet's career as an actress meant she was a 'totally legitimate' candidate for the jury but that Miss Filipetti 'decided not to make the appointment' Valerie Trierweiler, pictured (left) in Tulle, south-west France, with Mr Hollande remains in hospital .

The first lady is being treated for exhaustion at . Pitie-Salpetriere – the Paris hospital where Princess Diana died in . 1997. France’s Grazia . magazine reported that Miss Trierweiler had suspected Mr Hollande of . having an affair since last summer and made a ‘desperate’ bid to . befriend Segolene Royal, who was Mr Hollande’s partner of 28 years . before he switched his affections to Miss Trierweiler. ‘It was an appeal for feminine solidarity,’ said the magazine. ‘But after years of rivalry, obviously Miss Royal did  not respond.’","Julie Gayet was set to be a member of the Villa Medici jury for 2014 .

"By . Sam Greenhill . Messages: Hester Barsham-Rolfe sent emails to the boy . A mistress at a top private school made famous by the film Chariots Of Fire has been rebuked for having a relationship with a 17-year-old pupil. Economics teacher Hester Barsham-Rolfe, 30, met the boy alone away  from lessons at £4,682-a-term Eltham College. She also sent him private messages on Facebook and email after they formed a personal bond by going running together. It was the running prowess of former pupil Eric Liddell, immortalised in 1981’s Chariots Of Fire, which led to his 400 metres gold medal at the 1924 Paris Olympics. In Miss Barsham-Rolfe’s case, it led to her suspension for abusing her position of trust. The teacher and pupil shared a love of running, but their friendship developed into an ‘inappropriate relationship’, a teaching disciplinary panel found. The panel was told the sixth-former, named only as Pupil A, turned to the teacher for ‘emotional support’. They kept in close contact over a 15-month period from January 2012 to April 2013, even continuing after the boy’s parents confronted her about their relationship. There was no evidence of any sexual contact between the pair but the panel heard there was ‘the possibility of Ms Barsham-Rolfe and Pupil A having hugged on one occasion’. She was not found guilty of ‘sexual misconduct or predatory behaviour’, and the evidence suggested the relationship was ‘platonic’. Miss Barsham-Rolfe, who started teaching at the South-East London school in 2010, was suspended in April this year, and admitted to the inappropriate relationship. Exclusive: The private Eltham College, pictured, costs £4,682 per term to attend . The teacher at Eltham College (pictured) had an 'inappropriate' relationship with the 17-year-old boy, a disciplinary panel ruled . The school and its grounds were made famous by Chariots Of Fire (pictured) which was inspired by former pupil Eric Liddell . She is a keen long-distance runner and has raced for Belgrave Harriers, a leading athletics club. A report from the professional conduct panel for the National College for Teaching and Leadership said: ‘Ms Barsham-Rolfe and Pupil A exchanged an extensive number of messages using Facebook, personal emails and text messages. A statue of the Scottish athlete (pictured) remains at the school . ‘Ms Barsham-Rolfe also met with Pupil A alone outside of school on a number of occasions to go running with him.’ The boy’s parents confronted her in February 2013. But despite her assurances to them and the school that she would cease having ‘non-essential contact’ with the boy, she continued to do so, leading to her suspension. The report said: ‘Ms Barsham-Rolfe accepts that the relationship with Pupil A was inappropriate given her role as his teacher.’ The panel ruled her conduct was ‘unprofessional’ but did not ask for her to be banned from teaching, adding she did not pose a risk to children and had simply become ‘too involved with supporting her student emotionally’. It concluded her conduct ‘fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession’ and was an abuse of her position of trust as the boy’s teacher. But she had ‘not deliberately intended to, or sought to, engage in an inappropriate relationship with Pupil A’.","Hester Barsham-Rolfe developed 'platonic' relationship with Pupil A .

"By . Sam Greenhill . A report detailing Jimmy Savileâ€™s abuse of up to 1,000 children on BBC premises has been delayed, it was announced last night. Dame Janet Smithâ€™s review of the paedophile DJâ€™s victims at the corporation was expected to be published later this month. But now it will be shelved until the middle of the year, at the request of police and prosecutors who want it delayed until after the trial of former presenter Stuart Hall. Delay: A report into the activities of Jimmy Savile, pictured, has been delayed after a police request . Last night victims' lawyers expressed disappointment at the setback. It means the BBC is spared a crisis, for now, over the scale of Savile's offending. The report is expected to accuse BBC executives of turning a blind eye to the rape and sexual abuse of up to 1,000 boys and girls in the corporation's changing rooms and studios. The review, led by former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith, is expected to suggest the abuse took place on BBC property for more than four decades. In three known cases, Savile carried out his abuse with the help of others connected to the BBC, the review has heard. A source said: 'It will go right to the heart of how Savile was able to get away with the most heinous of crimes under the very noses of BBC staff for more than 40 years.' 'Under their noses': The report is expected to shed light on 40 years of abuse by the peadophile DJ . Yesterday a spokesman for the Dame Janet Smith Review said: 'The Review recently received a request from Lancashire Police and the Crown Prosecution Service to postpone delivery of its report until the criminal proceedings against Stuart Hall have concluded in mid-2014.' He said there were concerns it could 'adversely affect the fairness of Mr Hall's trial', and said Dame Janet Smith had agreed to postpone her report. Trial: Lancashire police asked that the report be delayed so as not to affect the 'fairness' of the forthcoming trial of Stuart Hall, pictured . Liz Dux, a lawyer at Slater & Gordon representing 74 victims of Savile, said: 'The victims will be naturally disappointed by the delay in the release of this report. They have been living with the trauma of this matter in the spotlight now for 16 months. 'Those that have given evidence to the Dame Janet Smith review were pleased with how sympathetically they were listened to but there has been no follow up support given by the BBC after they went through the trauma of giving their statements. 'They will understand the reasons why the release of the report has been delayed but for them their suffering continues until answers are given.' The Dame Janet Smith Review is expected to overshadow the investigation led by Nick Pollard, former head of Sky News, which sought to uncover why the BBC dropped its Newsnight programme on the Savile allegations. Police investigations have so far uncovered that at least 450 people were abused by the Jim'll Fix It presenter on BBC premises. They also say at least 1,300 people were attacked by him over the course of 54 years. Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is said to have carried out most of the attacks in the 1960s and 1970s, when his popularity as a BBC presenter was at its peak. However, aged 79 he groped a teenage girl while filming the last Top of the Pops. Described as Britain's worst ever paedophile, Savile's abuse also took place on NHS premises, prompting a further review expected later this year.","Dame Janet Smith review is set to detail 1,000 cases of child abuse .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Wanted: Police have released this image of a third woman they want to question over the attack . California police have released an image of a third woman they want to question over the death of Kim Pham, a 23-year-old beaten while waiting in line at a Santa Ana nightclub. The photo of the 'person of interest', who has not been named, was released after the arrest of a second unidentified woman, over the brutal attack. Miss Pham was taken off life support and died on Tuesday, and her organs were donated, after a fatal fight that may have started over an accidental 'photobomb' - when someone messes up a photo. On Wednesday, a 25-year-old was charged with murder, after being accused of taking part in the beating, which took place in the early hours of Saturday, and left Miss Pham brain dead. Vanesa Tapia Zavala, who has has pleaded not guilty, faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted. She was ordered to remain jailed in lieu of $1 million bail and is due back in court January 30 for a pretrial hearing. Zavala is a woman with only a traffic ticket on her record. Miss . Pham was beaten about 12.20am Saturday outside the Crosby Bar and . Nightclub. She was declared brain-dead Sunday, but was kept on life . support so her organs could be donated. Scroll down for video . Charged: Vanesa Tapia Zavala, 25, of Westminster, was charged with one felony count of murder for her alleged role in the death of Kim Pham, according to the Orange County District Attorney¿s Office . Behind bars: Vanesa Tapia Zavala was charged with one felony count of murder for her role in the death of Pham, who was beaten early Saturday morning outside the The Crosby club in downtown Santa Ana. Bail was set at $1 million . She was taken off life support Tuesday and died around midday. Her organs were offered for donation, as per the college graduate's wishes. Arrest: Vanesa Zavala has been charged with murder over the attack . 'Kim Pham … saved five lives through the donation of her heart, kidneys, lungs, pancreas and liver to patients on the national organ transplant waiting list,' transplant group One Legacy, told the Los Angeles Times. Miss Pham had been waiting to get into the nightclub with friends when an argument started with another group of club-goers, escalating into a fight, according to police. Zavala was identified through video taken by bystanders at the scene on their cell phones. A . friend who wanted to remain anonymous told the LA Times that Miss Pham . accidentally walked into one of the photos being taken by a group of . three women and two men. An . argument started between that group and Miss Pham and her friends. The . victim was beaten and left unconscious at the sidewalk. Zavala's . attorney, Kenneth Reed, told reporters after his client's arraignment . that she was knocked down during the melee, and he doubted reports that . it was a beat-down. Killed over a photo? Kim Pham was knocked to the ground and savagely beaten by a group of men and women after a friend said she may have accidentally ruined their picture by walking in front of the camera . Plea: Posters have been put near the crime scene appealing for information about the attackers . 'I . refuse to believe that people of this community would watch a woman . stomped to death by five people and nobody would do anything,' Mr Reed . said. The lawyer characterized it as 'a melee, a bunch of people . fighting.' Mr Reed said the . violence outside the club was chaotic and involved at least a half-dozen . other people. Zavala lost . her phone in the brawl, and it was recovered later by police, according . to Mr Reed, who said she is 'devastated' by the violence. 'Your . day is fine, your life is fine, you have a five-year-old son, you go out . one night on a Friday with your boyfriend and then your life is turned . upside down and you find out someone is killed,' Mr Reed said. 'No matter what the situation is, you're going to be devastated.' Disturbing: Police were quick to announce that they did not believe the attack was motivated by race, as the area has a large Vietnamese community that were concerned about a possible hate crime . A . second attorney, Michael Molfetta, a criminal defense lawyer who said . he’s been contacted by a potential defendant, said 'there is a lot more . to this.' 'Nobody deserves . the fate Pham got. But it was not race related or a photo bombing. It . was simply a stupid argument over somebody inadvertently bumping into . somebody else that escalated very, very quickly and very, very . violently.' An attorney for another one of the suspects said it was Pham who threw the first punch in what deteriorated into a violent altercation on the sidewalk outside the club. The charge against Zavala carries a maximum sentence of 15 years to life in prison. Patrol officers called to the scene found Miss Pham unconscious on the sidewalk. The . fight has drawn national attention as a . short video circulated online showing a group of people in nightclub . attire wrestling and kicking a figure on the ground in front of a crowd . of about 50 people. In the video, one person is visible crouching to . take another cellphone video. A bouncer from the club appears to try to . intervene, well after the violence began. Brutal: A video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground . Miss Pham, 23, graduated from Chapman University last year with a psychology . degree and had worked to raise money for breast cancer awareness. Downtown . Inc., a coalition of Santa Ana businesses, offered a $5,000 reward for . information leading to the attackers. The city matched the reward, . bumping it up to $10,000. In her personal blog, titled: ‘These Are the 7 Biggest Fears That You Need To Avoid . Having In Your Twenties’ on the website Elite Daily, Miss Pham calls on . people her age to stop being fearful. On . the ‘Fear of Missing Out’, a rationale she said was ‘empty’, she wrote: . ‘We all have this guilt that tells us we should be doing one thing when . we choose to do another. ‘We may even choose to justify it by . announcing it on Facebook or Twitter to receive likes and lighthearted . comments that perhaps make us feel more at ease about being “out . studying the babes instead of studying for a midterm.” Don’t be a fool. Attend to the things you need to do in order to grow a better you.’ She . tells her contemporaries to stop worrying about ‘Not Being Invited to . the party’, instead claiming that it is merely the universe’s way of . ‘telling you that you’ve got more valuable things to be doing with your . time’. On the scourge of social media, in the third part of her . missive, ‘Fear That We Don’t Compare’, she wrote that spending hours . stalking people online is pointless. ‘We are taught that with photos, . we select the ones where smiles are fresh and forward — the good is . often highlighted. As for your own life, don’t forget that sometimes the . most beautiful lessons in life stem from the unconventional. The . elevated focus on showing everyone how much of a superstar you are on . social media is quite unnecessary.’ She explained that in ‘Fear of . the Unknown, or What the Future Holds’: ‘The greatest harm we can do to . ourselves is to not take the chance’. Other ‘Fears’ she addresses include ‘Fear of Being Lonely’, ‘Fear of Rejection’ and ‘Fear of Getting Hurt’ ‘Perhaps . in our generation of self-promotion, egos yield a delicate tiptoe . around the subject of getting hurt or being disappointed,’ she . concludes. ‘However, we need to recognize that this fear should not . paralyze us from feeling, living and loving. ‘If you are forthright . in your own heart’s honest intent to love, you have nothing to worry . about. Be bold, go forward, and love like hell.’ Scene: Investigators swarm the scene after the fight on Saturday morning. Police are looking for four suspects, while one has been arrested . Violent Police say a fight broke out between Pham and another woman, whose friends then stepped in . 1. Fear of Missing Out . 2. Fear of Not Being Invited to the Party . 3.

Her family only found out that she was an organ donor after she was admitted to hospital. ‘She . would go out of her way to help others and never expect anything back . from them’, her stepsister Lisa said. ‘That’s the kind of person she . is.’ Authorities are appealing for witnesses to come forward with footage of the attack after receiving reports that club-goers had taken out their cell phones. One video clip shows a person lying on the floor as they are surrounded by a group of people. A guard can be seen attempting to separate the crowd as witnesses look on, horrified. Memorial . posters and flowers have been placed outside the club, and friends and . relatives spread posters online pleading for information into the . attack. A donation page was also set up for the family, but Miss Pham's . sister later said that they did not want to receive donations and would . be returning the money. Anyone with any information is urged to call the Santa Ana Police Department at (714) 245-839.

"By . Ashley Collman . A former Buffalo Bills cheerleader says squad members were auctioned off at a charity golf tournament, and made to sit on the winner's laps in just one of many demeaning tasks revealed in a new lawsuit against the football team. A 23-year-old identifying herself as 'Alyssa U' is one of five former cheerleaders suing the team claiming she was underpaid and mistreated, and detailed the dark side of the job in an essay for the New York Post published Sunday. A native of West Falls, New York, Alyssa was a life-long fan of the Bills and considered it a 'huge accomplishment' when she made the team for the 2012-2013 season. Dirty job: Alyssa U of West Falls, New York (pictured) is one of five former Buffalo Bills cheerleaders suing the team, claiming she was underpaid, mistreated, and even sexually harassed . Impossible standards: Alyssa, a life-long Bills fan, was initially excited when she made the team for the 2012-2013 season. But soon realized she was in over her head after reading the detailed contract. Above, Buffalo Jills cheer at a football game on August 9, 2012 . But after looking over her contract, she knew she was in over her head. The contract detailed everything about being a Buffalo Jill, from appropriate nail polish to how to properly sip soup at a formal dinner. 'I was taken back by it all. It’s degrading. It’s embarrassing to even talk about,' Alyssa told the Post. Being a Buffalo Jill also required attending an annual charity golf tournament where squad members either performed tasks(like sitting at the dunk tank) or were auctioned off to ride along with the highest bidder in their golf car. 'Basically there were four seats to a golf cart — basically four men. So where was this Jill to sit? Well, in the golfer’s lap. It was very inappropriate,' Alyssa said. Sexual harassment: One of the many demeaning tasks the Jills were made to do included being auctioned off at an annual charity golf tournament, sitting on the lap of the highest bidder . The cheerleaders also had to endure grueling criticism about their bodies, routinely submitting to 'Jiggle Tests' in front of team management. If their body didn't look good while performing jumping jacks, they could be benched for a game. Alyssa says that while the cheerleaders understood there were weight standards for being a professional cheerleader, judgements about weight often seemed random. Footing the bill: Alyssa was allegedly told by team management that her blonde hair was not 'field ready' and that she would need to pay for it to get re-colored by a stylist who knew the 'Jills look' and also happened to be best friends with the coach. Pictured above in a photo from her Twitter account . 'The inconsistency with the physique evaluations was pretty much a mind game. How someone’s weight could fluctuate from one week to the next — someone was field ready one week, not the next, and was the week after that, it was very emotional for these girls.' Management specifically had a problem with Alyssa's blonde hair when she joined the team, and she was deemed not 'field ready'. 'I was told it was not natural looking, and that I needed to go see the Jill’s hairstylist who knew “the Jills look” — who also happened to be the coach’s best friend. 'And it wasn’t free. You have to pay her, that’s not for free — but we got a $5 discount, so it was around $85,' she says. The . Jills aren't paid for games or . practices and have to make 20-35 appearances, most of which are unpaid, . at community and charity events each season, the lawsuit said. Pay is . $35 dollars an hour for a maximum of two hours, meaning some girls ended . up making just $1,800 for an entire season. And yet, like Alyssa's hair coloring, they were made to pay for everything - including their $650 uniforms. Alyssa . says that while she thought of quitting the team several times, she . decided to tough it out until the end of the season because she loved . the team so much. 'I . have never been a quitter. Cheering for the Bills was a life long dream . and I felt it was only right to honor my commitment and not let my . fellow team mates down,' she said. But . now she and four other former cheerleaders are hitting back, suing the . team, as well as two companies that have managed the cheer squad. Underpaid: Alyssa (right) and former teammate Maria P (center) appeared in a press conference Tuesday with their lawyer Frank Dolce, and said they were exploited out of '840 hours of work' On Tuesday, Alyssa and another former squad member, identified as 'Maria P', held a news conference with their attorney, Frank Dolce, explaining how they were each exploited out of '840 hours of work'. The women say they were wrongly classified as independent contractors by Stejon Productions, which manages the Jills and failed to pay them for hundreds of hours of work during 2012 and 2013 season. Stejon Productions - the current company managing the Jills - announced that it will be suspending the team pending the lawsuit.","Alyssa U. of West Falls, New York is one of five former Bills cheerleaders suing the team for being underpaid and mistreated .

"By . Stephen Wright . Murdered: Jill Dando was killed in 1999 . The shooting of Jill Dando on her doorstep remains one of Britain’s enduring murder mysteries. But after 14 years, Scotland Yard has abandoned any hope of finding who killed the popular TV presenter. The admission comes after one of the highest-profile police investigations in modern times and a ground-breaking £587,000 review of the case by the forensics firm which helped crack the murder of Stephen Lawrence. The investigation has effectively been closed, and a number of former officers who worked on the case doubt whether the Yard will ever be able to prove who killed Miss Dando. Miss Dando, 37, was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, West London, in April 1999. A year later, unemployed loner Barry George was charged with her murder. He was convicted in July 2001, but was acquitted at a retrial in August 2008. Months later, senior officers ordered an exhaustive forensic review of the case which has finished with no leads identified. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Daily Mail, Scotland Yard has revealed that since Mr George’s acquittal police paid £587,383 to privately run LGC Forensics  for the review of the Jill Dando investigation. Forensic experts subjected dozens of scenes of crime exhibits, including Miss Dando’s clothing, to state-of-the-art tests. According to a number of sources, the possibility of a forensic breakthrough was hampered by what happened after Miss Dando was blasted in the head at point-blank range. Although she died at once, paramedics ripped off her clothes and trampled over potentially vital evidence in a vain effort to resuscitate her. Mystery: Jill was at the height of her fame when she was shot, and yet 14 years later, Scotland Yard has no leads on her killer and a review of the case has not seen any results . Scene: Jill was murdered with a single gunshot to her head from pointblank range on her own doorstep in Fulham, West London . The end of the inquiry emerged two . months after convicted sex offender Mr George lost a bid for up to . £500,000 compensation after two High Court judges ruled that another . jury could have found him guilty. Released: Barry George spent eight years in prison after being wrongly convicted of Jill Dando's murder . They decided in January that Mr George, 52, who spent eight years in jail, was not eligible for damages as a victim of a ‘miscarriage of justice’. Lord Justice Beatson and Mr Justice Irwin rejected his claim that the Justice Secretary unfairly and unlawfully decided that he was ‘not innocent enough to be compensated’. Scotland Yard refused to comment on whether the review by LGC Forensics had uncovered any new leads. But, pointedly, it confirmed that no officers are working full-time on the case. A spokesman said: ‘This case remains unsolved and, as with all unsolved cases, any new information that comes to us would be examined. 'All unsolved cases remain open; our aim is always to try to solve all murders.’ Miss Dando was at the height of her fame when she died. She fronted the Holiday programme and Crimewatch UK with close friend Nick Ross. She was engaged to consultant Alan Farthing, who is now gynaecologist to the royal household and is overseeing the Duchess of Cambridge’s pregnancy.","TV presenter Jill Dando was murdered at height of her fame in 1999 .

"By . Associated Press . Scroll down for video . President Barack Obama . said Sunday that he had raised the need for improved human rights in .

Obama is sending national security adviser Susan Rice to meet Anwar on . Monday. Obama cited freedom of the press, . human rights and civil liberties as issues that he said are always on . the agenda when he travels the world. He downplayed the fact that a . meeting with Anwar wasn't on his schedule. U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and Malaysia's Prime Minister Najib Razak speak at the Malaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Center in Cyberjaya . 'The . fact that I haven't met Mr. Anwar in and of itself is not indicative of . our lack of concern, given the fact that there are a lot of people I . don't meet with and opposition leads that I don't meet with,' he said . at a joint news conference with Prime Minister Najib Razak after the two . met privately. 'That doesn't mean I'm not concerned about them.' Obama, . who met with Najib during a historic, two-day visit to Malaysia, . defended the government's handling of the search for missing Malaysia . Airlines Flight 370. He also said Russia will soon be hit with new . sanctions because President Vladimir Putin's government has ""not lifted a . finger"" to help diffuse tensions in Ukraine. Anwar, . a former deputy prime minister, was recently convicted for the second . time on sodomy charges that the U.S. and international human rights . groups have challenged as politically motivated. He presents the most . potent political threat to Najib, whose popularity has declined over the . past two elections. Obama said Najib has made . progress on human rights in his country and would be the first to . acknowledge having more work to do to improve the climate. Obama said he . shared with Najib his own view that countries will be better off in the . long run if they respect the rule of law and basic freedoms - 'even . when it drives you crazy, even when it's inconvenient.' The United States still has work to do on these issues, too, Obama added. U.S. President Barack Obama and Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak discussed the need for improving human rights in Malaysia . U.S. National Security Advisor Susan Rice will meet with Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim . In . his own defense, Najib said he and Obama are 'equally concerned about . civil liberties as a principle' and touted steps he says he has taken to . promote them. Answering his critics, Najib said: 'Don't underestimate . or diminish whatever we have done.' Obama is . the first American president to visit Malaysia in nearly 50 years.

He then went to the University of Malaya to . announce a new initiative to increase U.S. engagement with the region's . young people and answer questions. At the news . conference, Obama defended Najib's government's handling of the search . for the missing airplane. The Boeing 777 carrying 239 people, most of . them Chinese, has been missing since March 8 and is believed to be deep . at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.

"By . Katy Winter . A mother-of-two who decided to lose 11st in weight through dieting rather than accept the offer of NHS gastric surgery has inspired her overweight family to lose 18st between them. Lisa Robinson, 33, of Blyth, Northumberland, was offered a gastric band by her GP when she reached 21st 6lb after years of struggling with her weight. But Ms Robinson decided against surgery and chose instead to lose weight by switching to portion and calorie-controlled meals instead. By July 2011 Ms Robinson, pictured before she lost weight, was wearing size 30 clothing and was suffering with constant pain in her feet and knees . The family together following their shared weight loss journey. From left to right: Amy Mitchell, 24, David Kidd, 38, Lynda Kidd, 57, Lisa Robinson, 33 and Andy Snaith, 38 . Lisa dropped from 21st 6lb and size 30 (right) to 10st 1lb and size 10 (left) by ditching her junk food diet . As the weight fell away, her efforts inspired first her mother Lynda Kidd,57, who lost 3st, then her brother David Kidd, 38, who lost more than 7st, and his partner Amy Mitchell, 24, who lost more than 4st, and finally own her partner Andy Snaith, 38, who lost 4st. Together, the fabulous fat-fighting family has lost nearly 30st in weight - all thanks to Ms Robinson’s refusal to take the option of taxpayer-funded bariatric surgery . Ms Robinson, a care assistant, said: 'I knew instinctively a gastric band wouldn’t be the quick fix it’s sometimes made out to be. I’d seen people on television having to go on milk diets and becoming really miserable. I just couldn’t bear the idea of going without nice food. 'When I told my doctor ‘thanks but no thanks’ he was sceptical. He thought there was no way I could lose the weight on my own. 'My mum decided to join a slimming club with me for moral support. She was delighted when we lost our first few pounds together, and we kept it up. 'My brother was amazed at what we were doing and decided to give slimming club a go too. He met and fell in love with his partner Amy there. He got on so well that he came to lead a group himself. 'Then I began a relationship with David’s friend Andy. He was so impressed when I’d told him all that I’d achieved that he signed up for David’s class. 'Five months later I went back to the doctor having lost 5st, and he had to eat his words. It’s amazing to think about how much we’ve all changed. Sometimes I don’t recognise myself in the mirror.' Lisa's brother's girlfriend Amy Mitchell lost more than four st, pictured left after her weight loss . Ms Robinson, who is mother to Dylan, eight, and Caitlyn, six, was taunted by bullies in her teenage years because she was overweight. She said: 'Classmates called me ‘fatty’ and made thunder sounds as I walked past them.' When she was 19 she was diagnosed with polycystic ovaries which made weight control a challenge. She said: 'I ate shortbread and cakes out of habit, which didn’t help. I was trapped in a cycle where I would overeat. I felt there was no way out.' Lisa's boyfriend Andy Snaith has slimmed down from 19st 10lb (right) to 16st 4lb (left) By July 2011, Ms Robinson was wearing size 30 clothing and was suffering constant pain in her feet and knees. She said: 'My GP said I would be in a wheelchair within a year and informed me I would be eligible for an NHS-funded gastric band operation. 'I knew I didn’t want it. I love food. I had been prone to depression over the previous few years and I didn’t know how restricting myself to half a handful of beans at mealtimes would affect me. I couldn’t have that lifestyle. We wouldn’t be able to go out for family meals, for one thing.' Ms Robinson threw out all the fatty snack food in her house and learned how to cook healthy square meals using fresh, lean ingredients. Lisa's brother David managed to lose 6st 7lb, dropping down from 20st (right) to the 13st 7lb he is today . Before beginning her weight loss journey she would typically eat two egg and bacon sandwiches for breakfast, followed by tuna sandwiches and crisps for lunch, and finally a Chinese takeaway for dinner. She would snack on a stream of cakes and chocolates. Today, breakfast is typically made up of fruit and natural yogurt, followed by a chicken salad for dinner, with beef and fresh vegetables for evening meal. Ms Robinson’s mother, Lynda Kidd, a supermarket worker, slimmed from 13st to 10st after joining the same Slimming World group and following a similar eating plan. Then her brother David Kidd, a retail salesman, decided to emulate his sister’s success by joining a group in January 2012. He managed to lose 6st 7lb, dropping down from 20st to the 13st 7lb he is today. Lisa’s mother, Lynda Kidd, shrunk from 13st (right) to 10st (left) after following a similar eating plan . Mr Kidd said: 'I’d completely fallen out of the habit of exercising and watching my food. That I regained my motivation is all thanks to Lisa. I thought, ‘if she can do this, I can too’. 'Lisa and Amy met at the slimming club and that’s how me and Amy came to be together. When I think of the positive way my life has changed, I feel like the luckiest man in the world.” Miss Mitchell, Mr Kidd’s partner, has lost 4st 4lb since starting her own slimming programme. Then, in January 2013, Ms Robinson met her partner, port worker Andy Snaith, during a night out. She said: 'Andy was a big lad then. He couldn’t believe I’d lost so much weight. He surprised himself that he got on so well in David’s class.' In total the group have lost an astonishing 30st between them and have transformed their lives . Mr Snaith has slimmed down from 19st 10lb to 16st 4lb. In the 18 months Ms Robinson shrank down to 11st 4lb. Today she is 10st 1lb and can wear size 10 dresses. In June 2013, Ms Robinson travelled to Poland for an operation to remove excess skin on her stomach which was causing constant irritation. She decided to pay £3,500 to fund the operation privately because the NHS requires a two-year waiting period for such procedures. This year Ms Robinson secured NHS funding for a final operation to remove excess skin from her chest, arms and legs. She is now looking forward to a healthy future with her new-look family. She said: 'I feel completely different. All our lives have been transformed - even my children’s. Dylan once battled with ADHD but since I removed the additives and junk food from our family diet, he’s so much better. 'I’ve had to get used to the new person I see in the mirror.. I feel just wonderful.'","Lisa dropped from 21st 6lb and size 30 to 10st 1lb and size 10 .

"By . Jenny Hope . Getting out into the garden or doing DIY could save your life, claim researchers. Older people with active hobbies cut their risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke, and their chances of dying from any cause by up to 30 per cent. A new study found ‘working out’ in the garden or the home was as good as going to the gym for keeping the heart healthy. A 12-year study in Sweden has found that active hobbies, such as gardening or doing DIY, can cut the risk of hear disease and strokes in elderly people by up to 30 per cent (file picture) Experts say it shows the benefits of active daily routines, which counteract the harm caused by sedentary lifestyles. The study monitored the heart health and daily activities of almost 4,000 people aged 60 in Stockholm, Sweden, for 12.5years. Participants took part in an initial health check, which included information on lifestyle, such as diet, smoking, and alcohol intake, and how physically active they were. They were asked how often they did a range of daily life activities, such as gardening, DIY, car maintenance and blackberry picking over the previous 12 months, as well as any formal exercise. Their cardiovascular health was assessed using lab tests and physical examinations, to check on blood fats, blood sugars, and blood clotting factor, high levels of which raise the risk of heart attack and stroke. The study looked at the daily activity and heart health of 4,000 pensioners and found that those who had an active hobby and took regular exercise were at lowest risk . At the start of the study, those who had a generally active daily life had a much lower risk profile for cardiovascular problems, irrespective of how much formal exercise they took, than those with low levels of daily activity. This profile included smaller waists, lower levels of potentially harmful blood fats, and lower glucose, insulin, and clotting factor levels in men. The same was true of those who did a lot of formal exercise, but who were not routinely physically active very often. Those who exercised regularly and were also often physically active had the lowest risk profile for heart problems. During the 12.5 year monitoring period, 476 of the participants had their first heart attack and 383 died from various causes. The highest level of daily physical activity was linked with a 27 per cent cut in risk of a heart attack or stroke and a 30 per cent reduced risk of death from all causes, compared with the lowest level, regardless of the amount of formal exercise undertaken. Compared with young adults, older people spend proportionately more time doing routine activities which makes it important for them to be physically taxing, says a report published online in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. Researcher Elin Ekblom-Bak, of the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences, Stockholm, said ‘Our findings are particularly important for older adults, as they often find it difficult to achieve recommended exercise intensity levels.’ In the UK people are advised to do 150 minutes of moderate activity such as gardening, dancing or brisk walking, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise including playing sport, running or aerobics every week. The report suggests extra energy expenditure is behind the health improvements, because prolonged sitting reduces metabolic rate to the bare minimum, while standing up and physical activity increase it. It says the muscular contractions necessary for being active counteracts the damage done by sitting down, which doesn’t require any muscle effort. Normal hormone production is affected, with potential adverse effects on many body organs and tissues. Dr Gavin Sandercock, Reader in Sport and Exercise Science, University of Essex, said: ‘This study is excellent news for large swathes of the population who might not want to run, swim or go to the gym because it clearly shows that even moderate, non-exercise activity like gardening benefits the health of older adults. The study will bring relief to many older people as it shows that even gentle workouts can have health benefits . ‘We must be careful when generalising of course, because older adults tend to be less fit, so gardening represents relatively hard exercise for them. ‘We still need to promote moderate or vigorous exercise like fast walking, running, swimming and cycling in younger people. ‘While the amounts reported here are okay for older people, children still need to do an hour of activity every day to be healthy and that needs to be hard enough to make them breathe hard and preferably feel hot.’ Dr Tim Chico, Senior Clinical Lecturer and honorary Consultant Cardiologist, University of Sheffield/Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, said: ‘This study emphasises the importance of physical activity for prevention of cardiovascular disease rather than simply focusing on sport or dedicated exercise sessions. 'Although studies like this cannot prove that physical activity reduces risk of heart disease, it is clear from this and similar surveys that the more active a person is (in the broadest sense) the less likely they are to develop heart disease in the years to come. ‘Although this study only examined people aged 60, it is reasonable to assume that the more active someone is throughout their life, the lower their risk of cardiovascular disease. ‘The message I take from this study is simple. If you want to reduce your risk of heart disease, be more active. Don’t sit down for long periods; get up on your feet and do something you enjoy that involves moving around.’","Daily activity of 4,000 pensioners measured for study .

A surfer has been killed by a shark at a South African beach dubbed the world's deadliest following a string of attacks. Ngidi Msungubana, 25, died yesterday after being repeatedly bitten as he rode the waves off Second Beach in Port St Johns. Witnesses said he had wrestled with the shark for five minutes as the water turned red around him. Rescuers try to save shark attack victim Ngidi Msungubana following an attack at Second Beach in Port St Johns in South Africa . The beach is branded the world's most deadliest following six fatal shark attacks since 2007 . The incident was the sixth fatal shark . attack in just five years at the beach, which lies beside the Indian . Ocean in South Africa's rural Eastern Cape province. Officials described how Mr Msungubana fought with the shark before being dragged bleeding out of the water by a lifeguard. Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said: 'The man was surfing and was in water which was only around a metre and a half deep when the shark struck. 'Witnesses who were near him at the time said he wrestled with the shark for around five minutes as the water turned red. 'A fellow surfer then helped a lifeguard to get the man out of the sea and onto the beach. 'There happened to be a doctor on the beach who helped to treat the man at the scene, and an ambulance then arrived to take him to hospital. 'However the surfer had been bitten on both of his arms and his stomach and he sadly died on the way to the medical facility.' Experts said it was believed Mr Msungubana was attacked by a bull shark, which hunt alone and are famously aggressive. Attacked: Swimmers watch in horror as the man hangs on to his surfboard in shallow water . Beach-goers and lifeguards attend to the victim, who later died . Paramedics on the scene at Port St Johns on South Africa's east coast . Officials said it was the sixth fatal shark attack at Port St Johns' Second Beach since 2007. Local guesthouse owner and surfing expert Michael Gatcke said a team of specialists had been brought in to study the issue amid the spate of attacks. He said: 'This is now the sixth attack here in the last five years and people are getting worried about their safety in the sea. 'I can remember the previous attacks clearly - a lifeguard died in 2007 and there were three attacks in 2009. 'There was a fatal attack on a surfer on January 15, 2011, and then this one, exactly a year later.' He added: 'Experts are now saying this is the world's most dangerous beach for shark attacks and I can believe it. 'The frightening thing is that when you look at the statistics for attacks worldwide, usually only around one in six shark attacks in fatal. 'But here all of the attacks in the last five years have resulted in death. 'It makes you wonder whether the sharks are particularly aggressive, or whether there is some other factor that is causing this problem. 'Whatever the reason, I no longer surf or go into the water. 'I think the local authorities need to do more to tackle the problem and warn people about the dangers.' Officials today issued a fresh safety warning for bathers at the popular beach, which lies along a stretch of largely undeveloped coastline known as the Wild Coast. Meanwhile public safety chiefs have launched a probe into what caused the spate of attacks. Mr Kupelo said one theory was that the sharks were attracted to the area to feed on the remains of animals slaughtered during traditional sacrifices. He said: 'The local community continues in its tradition of slaughtering animals to mark auspicious occasions and for cultural events. 'Sometimes this is done by members of the church or community leaders on the beach or in the river which leads to the sea. 'It is now being thought that perhaps the offal and remains of the animals are attracting the sharks, which are coming in from the deep to feed. 'The latest attack is definitely not the first and we need to examine why this area is becoming so dangerous. 'Perhaps if the link to the traditional ceremonies is proven then the local municipality will need to take steps to prevent this practice.' Yesterday's death is the latest shark attack in South Africa. Last September Briton Michael Cohen, 47, lost his right leg and part of his left foot after being savaged by one of the beasts in the sea near Cape Town.",Sixth fatal attack at Eastern Cape beach in five years .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Tea Party favorite Michele Bachmann has a new political option after her early exit from the GOP presidential race - she can run for office in Switzerland. The Republican U.S. Representative, whose husband Dr Marcus Bachmann is Swiss, recently activated her right to become a dual U.S.-Swiss citizen along with three of their five children. 'Congresswoman Bachmann's husband is of Swiss descent so she has been eligible for dual-citizenship since they got married in 1978,' said Bachmann's press secretary Becky Rogness. Dual citizenship: Michele, pictured with her husband Dr Marcus Bachmann, has written to revoke her filing for Swiss nationality that was announced earlier this week . 'However, recently some of their children wanted to exercise their eligibility for dual-citizenship so they went through the process as a family.' A spokesman at the Swiss embassy said Bachmann had activated that citizenship in March. In an interview with Swiss television, Bachmann - who pulled out of the race in January for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination - laughed when asked if she would run for office in Switzerland. 'There's a lot of competition ... and it would be very stiff because they are very good,' she said. Christian counsellor Dr Marcus Bachmann, 55, met his wife at a Minnesota university and they have been involved in politics since working together on Jimmy Carterâ€™s presidential campaign in 1976. Dr Bachmann is president of Bachmann . & Associates, a Christian counselling firm based in Lake Elmo and . Burnsville - two cities around 30 miles apart in Minnesota. Togetherness: Marcus and Michele Bachmann, right, have raised five children- as well as 23 foster kids - and decided to go for Swiss citizenship as a family . He has been a clinical therapist for more than 20 years after studying at Winona State University in Minnesota, Regent University in Virginia and Union Institute and University in Ohio. They have raised five children and 23 foster children together. Mrs Bachmannâ€™s hardline approach throughout her campaign on issues from gay marriage to energy-saving light bulbs saw her win support from the far-right wing but in the end she was seen as little more than a fringe candidate. She ended her run for the White House in January after a disastrous sixth-place showing in the Iowa caucus.",Tea party firebrand Bachmann eligible for dual  nationality as husband Marcus is from Switzerland .
"By . Associated Press . A 56-year-old woman who was found living in filth had been held captive for years by her brother in dungeon-like conditions inside their Connecticut home, police said Friday. The frail, malnourished woman was covered in urine and human feces when police conducting a welfare check found her Thursday night, according to Paul Satkowski, deputy chief of the Seymour police. A lock was on the outside of her bedroom door and the room's windows were blacked out with paint. The woman's brother, Arthur Gauvin, 58, was arrested and charged with unlawful restraint, reckless endangerment and cruelty to persons. The brother and sister lived in the same house with other relatives, including children. Scroll down for video . House of horror: Arthur Gauvin allegedly kept his own sister a prisoner in the home they shared in Connecticut . Veteran police officer Lisa Wexler describes a frail, starving woman covered head-to-toe with feces and urine who sat in a room so foul officers couldn’t breathe. They had to leave and call in a colleague wearing a hazardous material suit with an air pack to explore the room. 'Your eyes immediately watered. The smell … awful. We had to change uniforms after leaving because the stench was in them,' Wexler said Friday afternoon at a news conference outside the Seymour Police Department. 'I served on the New Haven police force for 22 years before retiring and coming here last July. I never saw anything like this in my years with New Haven. I was absolutely shocked.' The woman was recovering Friday afternoon at Yale-New Haven Hospital from what police said was neglect by her caretaker - her brother, Arthur Gauvin. 'Officers and detectives have determined the motive for Gauvin keeping the victim locked up inside the house was so he wouldn’t lose the house to the state of Connecticut,' Deputy Chief Paul Satkowski said on Friday. Filthy: Police say the woman, 56, was covered from head to toe in feces and urine, with matted hair and an emaciated frame . Gauvin faces numerous felony charges, including first-degree unlawful restraint, and was being held on $150,000 bond after his arraignment Friday afternoon in Superior Court in Derby. He is due in Milford Superior Court on May 13 for another hearing. Detectives learned that the victim had owned the house once, and that ownership was transferred to Arthur Gauvin seven years ago. He was required to care for his sister for a total of nine years before the state would begin providing her any services, Satkowski said. The exact details of the home ownership issue are still being sought by investigators, he said. Satkowski, at the post-arraignment news conference, said officers had been called to the home for minor issues in 2010 and 2012, and found no evidence of anything wrong. Officers saw and talked with the sister both times, and she appeared normal, and conditions in the home were not unusual, he said. After an anonymous call Thursday night asking officers to check on the welfare of a woman at the home, 'What officers found Thursday night was astonishing, terrible,' Satkowski said. White picket fences: Things were far from perfect at this home on a quiet suburban street, where Gauvin held his sister against her will for years . No sightings: The window to the room where the 56-year-old woman lived was blacked out so neighbors couldn't see in . The tiny bedroom - its sole window painted black, nailed shut with boards and locked tight from the outside - was 'kept like a dungeon,' he said in the news release distributed after Gauvin’s arrest. 'When the victim was brought Thursday night by ambulance to Yale-New Haven Hospital, some of the doctor and nurses on duty were mortified by her condition,' Wexler said. 'She was so frail, malnourished, dehydrated, dirty. Unbelievable.' Gauvin, who police said has no previous criminal record, was arrested twice Thursday night. The first time was on charges that he imprisoned and was criminally cruel to his sister. The second time was on threatening and witness tampering charges because he allegedly warned his daughter, who was waiting for him in the police station lobby, not to talk to police or he would kick her and her young daughter out of the house. The younger woman, 33, told police later she had often questioned her father’s poor care of the victim, saw continued mistreatment of her and was 'petrified' by her own father’s threat that he would toss her and his own six-year-old grandchild out of the home if she cooperated in the investigation. Horrific condition: Officers in hazmat suits were brought in to explore the room the woman was kept in, which was in deplorable state . The daughter and grandchild lived in the home with Gauvin and the imprisoned sister. Police also said two young men, friends of the daughter, rented space in the basement because they had no other place to live. Satkowski said the state Department of Children and Families had joined police in reviewing the case. It was not clear Friday if anyone would be allowed back into the home. Nancy Phillips, who lives nearby and had bought a dog several years ago from Arthur Gauvin, said she walked by the Eleanor Road home about a year ago and saw a woman standing in the bedroom, looking out the window. Phillips said she thought it might be Gauvin’s sister and asked people in Gauvin’s yard how 'the girl in the bedroom' was doing. Not long after that, when Phillips next walked past the house, she said the bedroom window was painted black and the air conditioning unit in the window was gone. 'I should have said something,' Phillips said Friday, sitting in a parked car outside the Gauvin home before leaving on an errand. 'I always saw him sitting on the front steps, drinking. Never saw her again.'","Arthur Gauvin, 58, has been arrested after his sister was found living in filth in their home .

"By . Paul Bentley . Strolling with her new husband in the sunshine, Muslim convert Lauren Booth looks as happy as you’d expect any newlywed to be. Her broad smile, however, betrays a controversy which has seen her branded a home-wrecker. The 45-year-old, who is Cherie Blair’s half-sister, married Sohale Ahmed, 49, in a Muslim ceremony earlier this year. Newlyweds: Lauren Booth and Sohale Ahmed going for a walk in north London . Booth and Ahmed were married earlier this year in a Muslim ceremony . He, though, is said to be still legally wed under British law to Faiza Ahmed, his wife of 16 years. Mrs Ahmed has accused Miss Booth of stealing her husband after being invited into their home as a guest and dishonouring her new religion with brash, flirty behaviour. Miss Booth and Mr Ahmed were seen stepping out together in Hampstead Garden Suburb, North London, where she lives in a £500,000 apartment with her two daughters. Her body almost totally concealed, Miss Booth mixed traditional clothing with modern items, wearing a patterned dress and a grey cardigan over what appeared to be a long loose-fitting black abaya. She also wore a pink hijab head-covering. Transformation: Lauren Booth cuts a very different figure now (left) than she did back in 1998 (right) In the shadows of his far taller new wife, Mr Ahmed wore a more conventional combination of jeans and jumper. Mr Ahmed’s first wife is now looking after their three sons in Texas after she left the family home in Greater Manchester to stay with her brother. The 37-year-old is separated from her husband, but says they have not divorced. She said: ‘Lauren destroyed my home. You can’t just put  on a hijab and say you are a good Muslim woman – it’s about having boundaries with men, and love and respect for women.’ Lauren and her half-sister Cherie Blair, have had a difficult relationship at times after Lauren was so publicly critical of Tony Blair's decision to take the UK to war in Iraq when he was Prime Minister . Faiza Ahmed is still legally married to Sohale Ahmed under British law . Mrs Ahmed claims her husband married Miss Booth in a secret nikah, or religious ceremony, which she only found out about in February when her husband called her to ask for a divorce. Islamic law states that Muslim men can marry four women. While a nikah is significant religiously, it is not recognised as legal marriage in Britain unless the couple have also registered at a UK Register Office. Miss Booth was formerly married to actor Craig Darby, with whom she had two daughters. They divorced after he suffered brain injuries in a motorbike crash. In October 2010, she announced she was converting to Islam, saying she was drawn to the religion because of ‘an appreciation of Muslim culture, in particular that of Muslim women’. Mr Ahmed said he disputed the comments made by his first wife. Booth has been accused of 'stealing' her husband by Faiza Ahmed .","Lauren Booth takes a stroll dressed in a veil with husband Sohale Ahmed .

"By . Louise Boyle . and David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Barack Obama shook hands with Cuban President Raul Castro today, an unprecedented gesture of friendship which occurred, fittingly, at the memorial service for Nelson Mandela – but left the U.S. president facing backlash that he had warmly greeted a 'murderer'. The handshake between leaders of the two Cold War enemies took place during a ceremony which honored the former South African President's powerful legacy of reconciliation. But members of the U.S. Congress were upset on Tuesday, led by Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican and son of Cuban immigrants. 'If . the president was going to shake his hand, Rubio told MailOnline, 'he should have asked him . about those basic freedoms Mandela was associated with that are denied . in Cuba.' Rubio has . been an outspoken critic of the Castro regime which he said earlier this year 'sponsors . terrorism abroad and against their own people.' 'It is nauseating, Florida GOP congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen told Fox News. 'I was born in Cuba, had to leave the homeland because of oppression... He shook the hand of a murderer, of a thug. And those are bloodied hands. 'If it's just a handshake that's not going to produce any change, I think Raul Castro should have listened to what Obama said' about human rights, she insisted.

The gesture seemed to show another small step toward rapprochement between the U.S. and Cuba, raising hopes the two nations could be . on the verge of a breakthrough in relations. But Ros-Lehtinen, who represents thousands of Cuban refugees who are now U.S. citizens, was so upset that she laid into Secretary of State John Kerry during an unrelated hearing about Iran. 'When the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of . a ruthless dictator like Raul Castro, it becomes a propaganda coup for the . tyrant,' she lectured him before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 'Raul Castro uses that hand to sign the orders to repress and jail . Democracy advocates. In fact, right now as we speak Cuban opposition leaders . are being detained and they're being beaten while trying to commemorate today, . which is International Human Rights Day.' Kerry deflected the criticism. 'Today is about honoring Nelson Mandela. And the . president is at an international funeral ... he didn't choose who's there,' he said. Ros-Lehtinen asked if Castro is honoring the human rights of . Cubans. 'No, absolutely not,' Kerry replied.

President Barrack Obama greets the crowd who stood for hours in torrential rain to say goodbye to their beloved Madiba . Obama opened his speech by thanking . Mandela's family, then continued: 'To the people of South Africa - . people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing . Nelson Mandela with us. 'Your dignity and hope found expression in his life, and your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy. 'Mandela taught us the power of action, but also ideas; the . importance of reason and arguments; the need to study not only those you . agree with, but those who you don't.' Referring . to the anti-apartheid icon's friendship with his own prison warders, . the President said: 'It took a man like Madiba to free not just the . prisoner, but the gaoler as well.' To the people of South Africa - people of every race and walk of life - the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us. His struggle was your struggle. His triumph was your triumph. Born during World War I, far from the corridors of power, a boy raised herding cattle and tutored by elders of his Thembu tribe - Madiba would emerge as the last great liberator of the 20th century. He was not a bust made of marble; he was a man of flesh and blood - a son and husband, a father and a friend. Mandela showed us the power of action; of taking risks on behalf of our ideals. Mandela understood the ties that bind the human spirit. There is a word in South Africa - 'Ubuntu' - that describes his greatest gift: his recognition that we are all bound together in ways that can be invisible to the eye; that there is a oneness to humanity; that we achieve ourselves by sharing ourselves with others, and caring for those around us. It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the gaoler as well; to show that you must trust others so that they may trust you; to teach that reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion, generosity and truth. He changed laws, but also hearts. There are too many of us who happily embrace Madiba’s legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us who stand on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard. We will never see the likes of Nelson Mandela again. But let me say to the young people of Africa, and young people around the world - you can make his life’s work your own. Over thirty years ago, while still a student, I learned of Mandela and the struggles in this land. It stirred something in me. It woke me up to my responsibilities - to others, and to myself - and set me on an improbable journey that finds me here today. And while I will always fall short of Madiba’s example, he makes me want to be better.","Obama greeted a long line of world leaders and heads of state in Johannesburg as thousands gathered to remember Mandela at the FNB World Cup stadium .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The mother of one of AOL's costly 'distressed . babies' has spoken out for the first time after CEO Tim Armstrong blamed her daughter's medical costs for employee pension cuts. Deanna Fei, whose daughter spent three months in intensive care after being born four months premature, today said the way Armstrong announced the 401(k) policy change was 'completely dehumanizing'. 'When I saw the headlines, it was sort of impossible to process he was talking about my daughter,' Fei told NBC Nightly News. 'It (was) a violation - for singling us out for using the health plan we paid for.' Fei's husband, Peter S. Goodman, is executive business editor at AOL-owned Huffington Post. The New York-based couple has a son and daughter. She did not give her daughter's name. Shocking: This gorgeous little girl was one of the 'distressed babies' AOL chief Tim Armstrong blamed for scaling back retirement savings plans . Shocked: New York couple Deanna Fei (left) and Peter Goodman (right) are still in shock at the way Armstrong announced AOL's pension policy changes . Armstrong recently came under fire after announcing policy changes which would have switched 401(k) matching contributions to an annual lump sum, rather than being distributed throughout the year with every paycheck. The switch would have cost employees who left mid-year and even those who stayed, since they would not see the benefits of compounding in their retirement accounts, Washington Post reported. When the embattled chief tried to explain the controversial plan during an employee meeting on Thursday, he made matters worse. Armstrong told a story about two women covered by AOL who had complicated pregnancies, forcing the company to shell out $2 million 'above and beyond' what was necessary. He said, with Obamacare potentially adding $7.1 million to AOL's costs in addition to the 'distressed babies', the company needed to find cost savings elsewhere and was forced to change 401(k) to protect itself. Armstrong reportedly earned $12m in 2012. The comments caused a publicity storm, with employees sending letters to Armstrong, and Huffington Post giving it big coverage. Fei told NBC she was appalled at Armstrong's 'implication that somehow we were greedy consumers of health . care benefits.' Big wigs: Peter S. Goodman executive business editor at AOL-owned Huffington Post, holding his son and speaking with Arianna Huffington . Writer: Deanna Fei is the author of 2010 novel, 'A Thread of Sky' As a result of the outcry, Armstrong yesterday apologized and agreed to restore the original 401(k) policy. 'The leadership team and I listened to your feedback over the last week. We heard you on this topic,' he wrote in an email to employees, according to Business Insider. 'And as we discussed the matter over several days, with management and employees, we have decided to change the policy back to a per-pay-period matching contribution.' However for Fei, author of 2010 bestseller 'A Thread of Sky', 'the damage to my family had already been done'. The mother-of-two wrote a heartbreaking first-person article for Slate in which she recounted the painful birth of her now one-year-old daughter and . reprimanded Armstrong for his thoughtless comments. 'I take issue with how he reduced my daughter to a 'distressed baby' who cost the company too much money. How he blamed the saving of her life for his decision to scale back employee benefits,' she wrote. 'How he exposed the most searing experience of our lives, one that my husband and I still struggle to discuss with anyone but each other, for no other purpose than an absurd justification for corporate cost-cutting.... 'Our daughter has already overcome more setbacks than most of us have endured in the span of our lives. Having her very existence used as a scapegoat for cutting corporate benefits was one indignity too many.' Backpedaling: AOL chief Tim Armstrong yesterday scuttled a plan to delay company contributions to employee retirement accounts and apologized for singling out two families for rising costs . In the harrowing piece, Fei explained how her little girl was born prematurely on October 9, 2012, with reddish-purple skin, bloody and bruised all over. 'One doctor, visibly shaken, described it as 'gelatinous',' she wrote. 'I couldn’t hold my daughter or nurse her or hear her cries, which were silenced by the ventilator. Without it, she couldn’t breathe.' Doctors told the couple their daughter might not survive one month or one week or one day. She also had at least a one-third chance of being severely disabled. In the toughest months, the little girl suffered a brain hemorrhage, her right lung collapsed and one morning, she stopped breathing altogether. She spent three months in the NICU, enduring blood transfusions, head ultrasounds, the insertion of breathing tubes, feeding tubes, and a central line extending nearly to her heart. 'Because the day of her birth was the furthest thing from a happy event, because so many of her first days were lived under the specter of death, I’ve never had the luxury of taking her presence for granted,' Fei wrote for Slate. 'It can be a struggle to set aside my lingering trauma amid the daily realities of coordinating her care to simply celebrate the fierce, beautiful girl who has completed our family. 'All of which made the implication from Armstrong that the saving of her life was an extravagant option, an oversize burden on the company bottom line, feel like a cruel violation, no less brutal for the ludicrousness of his contention.'","AOL chief executive Tim Armstrong recently changed 401(k) pension scheme, disadvantaging many employees .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Scroll down for video . Scientists say they have figured out a way to determine an entire city's sense of humor and have come up with a list of the 10 funniest cities in America. Although, if you think New York City and Los Angeles - cities typically known for their comedy clubs and improv schools - top the list, think again. The top three funniest cities in America are Chicago, Boston and Atlanta, respectively - according to researchers at the University of Colorado's Humor Research Lab. Hardy-har: Chicago has been ranked as the funniest city in America, over legendary comedy towns like New York City and Los Angeles . Bean Town: Touring comedians rank Boston high on their lists in terms of quality of audience, which is part of the reason it got the number two spot . Hot-lanta: It may not seem like it, but Atlanta, Georgia, is the third funniest city in America, according to science . 'I think what ends up happening is that the nature of New York City is . at a bit of an advantage when it comes to humor, but it’s also at a . disadvantage because there’s a lot of things to do in new York that . pulls the population in different directions,' Peter McGraw, the . professor who created the algorithm as part of “The Humor Code,” a new . book about what makes things funny, and why, told ABC News. According to McGraw, New York was near the top of the list in terms of a city that relies on humor to cope with stress. Additionally, the city is home to some comedic institutions, like Saturday Night Live and the Upright Citizens Brigade improv school. New York is also home to several late-night talk shows like the Late Show, The Daily Show, The Tonight Show and The Colbert Report, to name a few. McGraw also says that New York is a good place for a young comedian to get their start, given the large number of comedy clubs in the Big Apple. Poor showing: New York City wasn't even ranked in the top five, coming in sixth in the rankings for America's funniest cities . ""'If you want to continue training, go to New York,’” McGraw quoted comedian Marc Maron telling him. “‘If you think you’re ready to get in the ring, go to L.A.’” But McGraw says comedy isn't for everyone in New York the way it is in other cities. 'We wanted to look at not just what are the commercial and entertainment aspects of the comedy but how much the locals value it,' McGraw said. McGraw also explained how Boston isn't necessarily known for its comedy scene, but that touring comedians rate audiences in Boston amongst the highest in any city in America. In Chicago - which topped McGraw's list - there are several comedy troupes - like The Second City - that are favorites of many of the locals. Hollywood: Despite being home to some legendary comedy clubs, Los Angeles ranked seventh on the list . And Second City has put out its share of comedic stars - SNL has fed off of the troupe for more than 40 years, making stars out of Second City alums like John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray and Chris Farley. Soon-to-be Late Show host Stephen Colbert also is an alum of Chicago's Second City. Because quantifying something like humor is tough - if not impossible - to do, McGraw says he's confident in his rankings and says they were compiled with a great deal of debate over how to measure certain aspects of a city and make it fair for all cities. In addition to analyzing a city's professional comedy scene, McGraw also polled people on things like how much their workplaces valued humor. 'I want people to want to be number one because this is such an . important part of life,' he said. 'Who wouldn’t want to live in the city . that is ranked as the funniest?'","The rankings were compiled by researchers from the University of Colorado's 'Humor Research Lab'

"By . James Chapman . Tony Blair was accused of an ‘embarrassingly simple-minded analysis’ yesterday after urging Britain to set aside its differences with Russia to fight radical Islam. The former prime minister insisted tensions with President Vladimir Putin over his annexation of Crimea should not prevent cooperation to address religious extremism in the Middle East. Mr Blair said the West’s failure to send troops to Syria – a move violently opposed by his successor Ed Miliband – was a historic mistake for which Britain and its allies would pay a ‘heavy price’ Let's be friends: Then-Prime Minister Tony Blair pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007. Mr Blair has called for Britain to set aside its differences with Russia over Crimea and Ukraine to fight radical Islam . He also insisted further Nato action is needed in Libya as part of a ‘titanic’ struggle against radical Islam, that seeks to thwart democracy. Mr Blair, now the West’s ‘envoy’ to the Middle East, used a speech in London to argue that the rise of political Islam is a common thread running throughout the region, from Libya to Iran. He insisted that while the ‘ideology coming out of Shia Iran and that of the Sunni Muslim Brotherhood may seem to be different, in reality they amount to the same thing’. Failure to shake off the legacy of Iraq and ‘take sides’ in support with moderates in the Middle East could mean the 21st century is dominated by conflict rather than peaceful co-operation, he warned. Mr Blair described a global crisis with its roots in ‘a radicalised and politicised view of Islam, an ideology that distorts and warps Islam’s true message’. He conceded that partly as a result of controversy over his warsin Iraq and Afghanistan, governments in Europe and America had become ‘curiously reluctant to acknowledge’ the threat from Islamic extremism. ‘On this issue, whatever our other differences, we should be prepared to reach out and cooperate with the East, and in particular, Russia and China,’ he added. ‘On this issue also, there is a complete identity of interest between East and West. China and Russia have exactly the same desire to defeat this ideology as do the USA and Europe.’ Mr Blair said the UK should take a ‘very strong position’ over Russia’s annexation of part of Ukraine but insisted it was a ‘separate issue’. Blair speaks at Bloomberg's offices in London yesterday: He said the failure to send troops to Syria - a move opposed by his successor Ed Miliband - was a mistake for which Britain and its allies would pay a 'heavy price' Conservative MP Julian Lewis, a former shadow defence minister, said Mr Blair’s analysis was ‘two-dimensional’ and ignored the potential threats from Russia. ‘One can agree greatly with his analysis of the threat of totalitarian Islamism, but he is very light touch indeed, in fact there’s hardly a mention of the more conventional threat from Russian ambitions to try and reconstitute at least part of the former Soviet empire. ‘I agree that it’s a generational struggle, but in dealing with generational struggles, you’ve got to decide which is better: interventionism or containment. Containment proved itself in a 50-year confrontation with communism, and containment is the best way to deal with a generational struggle against Islamism too. ‘It does take more than us to decide to avoid east-west confrontation with Russia, it takes the Russians to do it as well. And if they’re going to try and take over countries by force and subversion - which is what they’re trying to do, and if God forbid they then have their eyes on the Baltic states or Poland that are member states of Nato - then frankly, important as this topic is about Islamism, that will become even more important.’ Shadi Hamid, a fellow at the Saban Centre for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institute, said that Mr Blair’s speech demonstrated ‘some of the most embarrassingly simple-minded analysis I’ve seen from a mainstream politician.’ He said he made ‘a valid point’ about an ideological battle going on in the Middle East but his understanding of the different streams of political Islam was ‘reductionist’. ‘He basically comes to the conclusion that Islamism is so dangerous that we have to ally ourselves with authoritarian regimes. He has become one of the West’s main apologists for what has become a brutal regime in Egypt,’ he added.","Tony Blair used speech to issue warning about the rise of 'political Islam'

"By . Taylor Auerbach . and Candace Sutton . Star Olympic swimmer Geoff Huegill and his wife Sara have been charged with drug possession after security guards at Randwick Racecourse allegedly found them with cocaine in a private suite at the races on Saturday. Huegill, 35, was at the newly-renovated racecourse with his wife Sara Hills, 30, late on Saturday afternoon around an hour after the last race had run when police and security guards watched CCTV of the couple entering a disabled toilet together. The Huegills, who are the parents of two daughters, Mila, 2, and a three month old baby girl, were guests at the running of the Australian Turf Club's $400,000 race, the Champagne Stakes, which is sponsored by Moet & Chandon. Police noticed the couple stayed in the toilets for some time. When the Huegills re-emerged and returned to the Moet & Chandon private box, police interviewed and around 5.45pm allegedly took possession of a small bag of cocaine. A day at the races: Geoff Huegill and his wife Sara Hills in a picture posted on Instagram of them in a private box at Royal Randwick racecourse where they allegedly were arrested in possession of cocaine . Champagne Stakes: Geoff Huegill's picture posted on Instagram taken at the running of the Champagne Stakes at Royal Randwick Racecourse where he and his wife Sara were arrested and charged with possession of cocaine . A group of police then made a detailed search of the area with a sniffer dog. Through their lawyer, Paul Hunt, the couple has declined to comment about the charges which are due before court next month. Mr Hunt issued a statement confirming the couple has been ordered to face court. It is uncertain now whether Huegill will make an appearance alongside some of Australia's most prominent sports men and women at the inaugural Sporting Legends lunch in Sydney this Friday. Huegill also runs his own fitness business, Club Skip, and represents the vitamin company, Swisse. An extremely close friend of Geoff Huegill's reacted with shock when MailOnline told him of the charge. 'You're kidding me aren't you,' he said when informed of the Saturday afternoon nab. 'I didn't have a clue, I'm sorry to hear that. He called me this morning, I had a missed call from him, I'd rather not comment further.' Geoff Huegill and his wife Sara Hills will appear in court next month after they allegedly were in possession of cocaine in a private box at Randwick racecourse . Charged: Geoff Huegill and wife Sara were charged after allegedly being found with white powder on Saturday . Racegoers were at Randwick for the final Saturday of the Sydney Autumn Racing Carnival. 'Police were patrolling Randwick Racecourse as part of their normal duties,' a NSW police spokesman told the MailOnline. 'They were directed to a suite in the grandstand by security guards where a 35-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman were allegedly found with a small quantity of white powder, believed to be cocaine. 'They were issued with a field court attendance notice for the offence of possessing an illegal drug.' The Daily Telegraph reported Huegill was seen being escorted from the Moet & Chandon lounge by police on Saturday. Huegill has credited his wife, a former publicist who he married in 2011, with turning his life around after a battled with obesity, drugs and depression. Comeback: Geoff Huegill holds his bronze medal after coming third in the men's 50-metre butterfly at the FINA World Championships in Shanghai in 2011 . Back in the pool: a toned and trimmed down Huegill back in the pool in 2012 Australian Olympic Swimming Trials in Adelaide a year after his marriage at Sara Hills, who he credited with turning his life around after he succumbed to drugs, alcohol and depression after his swimming career stalled . He revealed then that he had taken drugs and suffered from depression when he retired from swimming after the 2004 Athens Olympics.Free of the discipline of 4am starts, Huegill engaged in binge drinking and became so hooked on fatty food that he put on 45kg. He also said he had suicidal thoughts.'My life from about 2005 to 2007, I experimented with many different things. I guess that's a story that's in my past,' he told the Nine Network. Huegill was the world record holder in the 50m butterfly between 2000 and 2003. Four years ago, a slimmed down Huegill made a successful comeback and won gold medals at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, and a bronze at the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai. Sydney lawyer, Paul Hunt, issues a written confirmation 'that on Saturday 26 April 2014, while attending a function at the Royal Randwick Racecourse, my clients Geoff and Sara Huegill were each issued with a Court Attendance Notice by NSW Police in relation to an alleged offence. 'As the matter is not yet resolved, my clients do not intend to make any further comment atthis point in time.' The Australian Turf Club declined to comment, 'as it is a police matter' but said the club 'has a zero tolerance policy on illicit drugs'. The pair will front Waverly Local Court on May 14 charged with possession of a prohibited substance.

Its name is an acronym for Building, Antenna, Span and Earth â€” the types of fixed objects from which a person can jump. Mount Kinesava is a plateau, approximately 3,000 feet from top to bottom, with a 1,000 foot sheer cliff on its east-facing side. The hike to the top of Kinesava takes approximately half a day and the peak is currently covered in up to 10 inches of snow.","Amber Marie Bellows, 28, died when her parachute failed to open during a BASE jump in Zion National Park in Utah on Saturday .

By Sunday night, the Powerhouse Fire around the Angeles National Forest in Southern California engulfed about 22,400 acres, endangering some 1,000 homes in the Lake Elizabeth and Lake Hughes area. Nearly 2,100 firefighters struggled to contain the fire, which more than tripled in size from Saturday to Sunday. Nearly 3,000 people have been evacuated and the blaze has already destroyed at least six homes by Sunday night. At the same, the Tres Lagunas Fire in the Pecos wilderness in the Sanata Fe National forest near Santa Fe, New Mexico, has consumed roughly 7,000 acres and forced residents of 150 homes - as well as several campgrounds - to flee the area.

"By . Alex Greig . A Florida appeals court judge has ruled that an insurer is not liable for damages that occurred to an apartment after a neighbor's dead body 'exploded.' Judy Rodrigo battled State Farm for almost six years, arguing that the insurer of her Jupiter condo should pay for the clean-up of her apartment. She argued that the Keystone Condominium Association left the neighbor's corpse so long that the body's fluid leaked into her apartment. 'Putrid effluvia': Judy Rodrigo's apartment was damaged by her neighbor's corpse, which rotted, undiscovered, for two weeks before 'exploding' Rodrigo's civil lawsuit against State Farm stated that 'another unit owner's body exploded thereby causing blood and bodily fluids to go into the adjoining condominium and the unit owned by Judy Rodrigo.' The neighbor's body was discovered an estimated two weeks after her death after a foul odor filled the adjacent units. The elderly woman's puppy had been feeding on the corpse, according to the Courthouse New Service. The body was so decayed that gases caused the abdomen to bloat and eventually burst, releasing fluids. 'I don't know how the dog stayed alive. It must have been at her for some time,' neighbor Nicholas Colangelo told Court House News in 2009. State Farm offered Rodrigo a sum for the clean-up, but she refused it, seeking full coverage. She argued that her policy covered personal property damage, including 'explosions.' Not covered: The judge ruled that the neighbors body bursting during decomposition does not constitute an explosion . State Farm argued that a decomposing body does not constitute an explosion - and Judge Melanie May agreed. 'Rather than stretching common sense, the trial court correctly gave the term ""explosion"" its ""plain and unambiguous meaning as understood by the man on the street,""' May wrote. 'The plain meaning of the term ""explosion"" does not include a decomposing body's cells explosively expanding, causing leakage of bodily fluids.' May wrote that Roderigo's attempt to prove the body exploded was 'novel' but ultimately ruled against her.","Judy Rodrigo fought insurer State Farm for almost six years for damages after her neighbor's corpse 'exploded'

"By . Anna Edwards . The documentary film-maker is believed to have succumbed to hypothermia while making a film about the homeless . A young filmmaker is believed to have frozen to death while making a documentary about sleeping rough on the streets as he tried to impress television bosses. Lee Halpin planned to spend this week on the streets of Newcastle experiencing and filming what life is like for those who are living rough. In a video explaining his project, he claimed he was applying for a position on a Channel 4 investigative journalism programme. He said that as he had to show the channel he could be 'fearless' - a key 'value' of the broadcaster - he planned to spend a week 'immersed' in the world of homelessness, and wanted to 'sleep rough and scrounge for food.' But three days after embarking on the project talented Lee, who lived with his family in Heaton, Newcastle, was found dead in a boarded-up hostel on Westgate Road, Newcastle. It is not yet known how he died, but it's feared the 27-year-old may have succumbed to hypothermia. The hopeful journalist said that he had spoken to homeless charity Crisis, and wanted to see what was available for homeless people in the North East. Haplin said: 'I am about to go and spend a week being homeless, I will sleep rough for a week, scrounge for my food. 'I will access the services that other people in the west end (of Newcastle) use. 'I will interact with as many homeless people as possible and immerse myself in that lifestyle as deeply as I can. He was discovered in a boarded-up hostel on Westgate Road, Newcastle. Mourning friends have paid tribute to the talented director . 'This seems to be a fearless approach to a story. 'It has caused a huge amount of trepidation among my friends and family.' He also said that he wanted to investigate whether the coalition government's much-criticised bedroom tax would impact on people in Newcastle, and whether it would lead to homelessness. A Met Office spokesman confirmed the lowest recorded temperature for Newcastle early on April 3 was around -4.2C. Friends . have since paid tribute to the 'thoroughly excellent bloke' and have . spoken of his death as the 'ultimate sacrifice' in raising awareness of . homelessness. Lee had spoken with his friends about . looking forward to the project and on Sunday was asking his 1,500 . Twitter followers if anyone had a sleeping bag he could borrow. In . his last Tweet - on Sunday at 11.05am - Lee asked his followers: 'If . anyone has got an old phone I can have for a week, I'd be very . grateful.' Lee's . friend of 10 years Daniel Lake said: 'I was just talking to Lee on . Saturday, having some banter talking about football and how excited he . was about going out filming. Just three days after embarking on the project Lee was found dead in a boarded-up hostel on Westgate Road, Newcastle . 'Lee was a great guy, a character and was well known. His big things were creative writing and poetry. 'He was making a documentary about homeless people living in Newcastle's West End. 'No one knows how he passed away, but we think it could have been hypothermia. 'He made the ultimate sacrifice trying to raise awareness about what was happening to other people.' Lee, was discovered in the vacant Summerhill Hostel just before 10am on Wednesday. A . Northumbria Police spokesman said it was believed no third party was . involved in his death, adding: 'Police were informed the body of a man . believed to be in his 20s had been found in a derelict building in . Westgate Road. 'A report will be prepared for the coroner.' Paramedics were also called to the property. Since Lee's death, tributes have come in from friends and those who knew him. One friend described Lee as 'a great advocate for the north-east arts scene'. The Channel 4 website explains how they want applicants to show how they are 'fearless' Having completed his creative writing MA at Newcastle University, Lee went on to become a founder editor of Novel, a magazine covering all aspects of North East culture from performances and exhibitions to launch parties and talent. And for almost a year, he'd featured on the airwaves with his The Weekend Starts Here Show on Radio Tyneside, on Fridays from 8pm till 10pm. On Twitter, tributes have been paid by those who worked with and knew Lee. Staff at Intimation Creative said: 'We're very sad to hear that Lee Halpin passed away. 'Our thoughts go out to Lee's family and many friends.' Dan Howarth described Lee as a 'talented, courageous and thoroughly excellent bloke', adding: 'Shattered by the news of the death of Lee Halpin. A massive loss.' The channel's Investigative Journalism Programme works with their current affairs programme Dispatches to give aspiring journalists the opportunity to work within a production company and develop ideas for Dispatches. The successful applicants are given a contract for up to 12 months and will 'learn the fundamentals of investigative journalism and how new technologies and social media can help you to bag your biggest scoops'. Entrants submit a video, answer a questionnaire and explain, in a video, why they are 'fearless' - an attribute that the broadcaster says is one of its key values. Leslie Morphy, chief executive of Crisis, said: 'I was extremely saddened to hear the news of the death of Lee Halpin. My thoughts are with his friends and family at this difficult time. 'His tragic death highlights just how dangerous sleeping rough can be, especially during the freezing weather we are currently experiencing, which is why we would never encourage that anyone voluntarily put their life at risk in this way. 'Research for Crisis showed that the average age of death for homeless people is just 47. 'Unfortunately homelessness is on the rise with a 31 per cent rise in rough sleeping across England over the last two years. The combination of the economic downturn and cuts to benefits mean that we sadly expect this to continue to rise further.' A Channel 4 spokesman said: 'We are saddened to learn of the tragic death of this aspiring young journalist. Our thoughts are with his family.' Police have made two arrests in connection with the death of Lee Halpin. A spokesperson for Northumbria Police said: 'Officers have arrested two men aged 26 and 30 on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of a controlled drug. 'They have been bailed pending further enquiries and a report into the death of the man is is being prepared for the coroner.'","Fears that Lee Halpin may have succumbed to hypothermia .

"By . Ben Spencer . Little blonde Maria was being groomed by her gipsy captors to be a child bride, Greek police believe. The distinctive blue-eyed girl was discovered in a Roma settlement during a police raid a week ago, when officers noticed she looked nothing like the couple posing as her parents. DNA evidence has shown she is not related to Eleftheria Dimopoulou, 40, and her husband Hristos Salis, 39, who have been charged with child abduction and procuring false identity documents. Child bride: Little Maria may have been married off at 12 for a substantial dowry. She is pictured with Eleftheria Dimopoulou, and husband Hristos Salis . Police now believe that Maria, who is thought to be four or five, was being prepared for marriage at the age of 12. Her pale skin, near-white hair and blue eyes would have made her a ‘prize bride’ among the gipsy community. She would have fetched Salis and Dimopoulou a large dowry, according to police sources. Officers investigating the case believe the prospect of a bridal pay-off is why Maria had not yet been sold. She was treated as an ‘investment’ to be nurtured and protected until she reached the traditional Roma ‘coming of age’ - usually at the age of 12. Police now believe that Maria, who is thought to be four or five, was being prepared for marriage at the age of 12. Right, a file picture of a child at a gipsy wedding . Maria was given her own room in the brick-built house where she was discovered, in the gipsy settlement of Tabakou on the edge of Farsala, central Greece. There is growing evidence she was used by Salis and Dimopoulou to beg and dance for money. They also made money from child benefit payments she entitled them to. Neighbours say the couple purchased Maria for as little as £850 from a Bulgarian couple when she was a baby. Detectives are now looking into the possibility that she was offered cheap by a gang on the run from police. The gang, smuggling children from Bulgaria into Greece, may have intended to sell her to a wealthy Greek couple for up to £22,000. They are looking at case files of three illegal adoption circles that were dismantled by police between 2009 and 2011. The earliest operation is said to be of most interest. The 2009 operation led to the arrests of 11 members of a gang operating in central and northern Greece. The circle featured a Bulgarian ‘middle man’ who employed a local gipsy couple to locate potential buyers. The case is of particular interest . because when he appeared in court on Monday Salis provided officials . with the name of a Bulgarian ‘mediator’ and his mobile phone number and . urged the court to trace him. In a separate case, Greek police . yesterday arrested three gipsies on the Greek island of Lesbos on . suspicion of abducting a two-month-old baby. Arrested: Salis, 39,  left, and Dimopoulou, 40, right, charged with child abduction and forging documents . They believe a young couple - a 21-year-old man and 19-year-old woman - and an older woman, 51, had obtained the child in Athens. The Greek birth registration system has come under close scrutiny since Maria was discovered last Wednesday. Konstantinos Tzanakoulis, mayor of Larissa, the closest city to the camp she was found, said yesterday that it was ‘pure luck’ that her case was uncovered at all. ‘Who knows how many such cases exist?’ he asked, blaming a system he said was riddled with loopholes. ‘We may never know.’","Maria's pale features would make her a 'prize bride' among gipsies .

"By . John Stevens . and Francesca Infante . A Mother-to-be died after trainee surgeons took out an ovary instead of her appendix in a weekend operation. Maria De Jesus was five months  pregnant when she was admitted to hospital with serious abdominal pain. Doctors correctly diagnosed appendicitis only to remove the wrong organ on the operating table. They discharged their 32-year-old . patient from hospital but – two weeks after the initial operation – . readmitted her because she was still in great pain. Maria De Jesus, 32, pregnant with the the baby she miscarried days before she died of multiple organ failure. She was suffering from appendicitis but unsupervised trainee surgeons removed one of her ovaries by mistake . By now, a pathology report revealing . the failure to remove her dangerously inflamed appendix had been . available for a week. Yet, incredibly, doctors had not read it. They only looked at the report, and realised their mistake, two days later – when Mrs De Jesus had a miscarriage. By now she was suffering sepsis, a severe blood infection caused by the untreated appendicitis. She had an emergency operation to . remove septic fluid but died 48 hours later on the operating table when . surgeons finally removed her appendix. She had suffered major organ . failure. Yesterday her husband Adelino said a . ‘litany of errors’ had been made during his wife’s treatment and he . planned to take legal action against Queen’s Hospital in Romford, East . London. ‘My wife’s death could have been . prevented, I am sure of it,’ said the 53-year-old. ‘By the time they . realised how serious the situation was – and they promised us all the . best consultants – it was too late. ‘This is neglect, this is an unlawful . killing. If my wife had been given treatment by fully qualified staff . and people were informed of the mistake earlier she could still be . alive. ‘She went to hospital with stomach pains and we were told she needed to have her appendix out. ‘She had the operation, and left . hospital eight days later, but the pain continued. We wouldn’t have ever . imagined what they had done.’ Mrs De Jesus' condition failed to improve after the mistake was noticed and she died on the operating table at Queens Hospital, Romford (pictured) after medics finally removed her appendix - 19 days after the wrong procedure. She had developed severe sepsis as a result of the appendicitis . At an inquest last week, coroner . Chinyere Inyama spoke of a ‘lost window of opportunity’ that could have . saved Mrs De Jesus’s life. The hearing in Walthamstow, North-East . London, was told the operation was carried out on Sunday, October 23, . 2011, by two trainee surgeons without the supervision of a consultant. Eight days later tests showed they had . bungled but it was not until November 9 – and when Mrs De Jesus had . been back in their care for two more days – that doctors read the report . and realised the appendix had not been dealt with. Dr Sunita Sharma told the hearing she . examined the pathology results because she was ‘puzzled’ that Mrs De . Jesus was still in pain. ‘It didn’t make sense that a healthy . young woman with appendicitis wasn’t recovering after the appendix had . been removed,’ she said. ‘I looked at the results and it showed . that her ovary had been removed and not her appendix. I could not . believe it, I was shocked.’ Barking, Havering and Redbridge Hospital . Trust has admitted liability for Mrs De Jesus’s death on November 11, . 2011. Chief executive Averil Dongworth said: . ‘The trust fully accepts the inquest verdict. I would once again like . to apologise unreservedly to Mrs De Jesus’s family for their loss. ‘We have admitted liability in this case. The staff involved in Mrs De Jesus’s care have been deeply affected by her death. ‘An extensive trust-wide action plan . was drawn up following Mrs De Jesus’s death in 2011 to ensure that such a . tragic incident will not happen again. ‘We have kept Mrs De Jesus’s family . fully informed about the investigation into her death and the subsequent . wide-ranging work which has taken place to improve systems and patient . safety.’ Liability: Mrs de Jesus's husband said 'My wife could still be alive' The General Medical Council is . investigating eight hospital staff, including senior surgical consultant . Dr Babatunde Coker over the case. Mrs De Jesus, a teaching assistant from Dagenham, East London, would have been 34 this month. Her daughter Catarina, ten, said: ‘We . have put the balloons up because it was mum’s birthday and it’s good to . celebrate it.’ Her son Pedro, 16, said: ‘It feels like such a big . injustice.’ The coroner recorded a narrative verdict. Shocking findings published last month . revealed that patients who have planned operations at the weekend . rather than a Monday are 82 per cent more likely to die. Researchers from Imperial College . London looked at four million elective operations in NHS hospitals in . England between 2008 and 2011 with at least one night spent in hospital. Elective surgery normally involves . procedures such as heart bypass, hip and knee replacements, gastric . operations and hysterectomies. Altogether 27,500 patients died within 30 . days of surgery, with the risk lowest for those having it on Monday and . rising on each subsequent day of the week. The extra risk on Tuesday was minimal, . but went up to 15 per cent on Wednesday, 21 per cent for Thursday . patients and 44 per cent on Friday – all compared with Monday. Almost . one in 20 operations was performed at a weekend, when the increased risk . reached 82 per cent, said the study published online at bmj.com. Further pressure on hospitals at . weekends has come from patients flooding casualty units because of the . problems accessing out-of-hours GP care.","Maria De Jesus was admitted for surgery at Queen’s Hospital in Romford .

It’s hard to get excited about superhero games, let alone one starring a character many would not have heard of. But interestingly, it’s Deadpool’s relative obscurity compared to the likes of Batman, Superman and Spiderman that will help him stand out from the crowd. For those who haven’t heard of Deadpool (real name, Wade Wilson), he’s a mentally unstable Marvel comic character known for his big mouth and affection for weapons. He also has the tendency to ‘break the fourth wall’, meaning that he is aware of the audience, and can interrupt the story at will for humorous effect. Wild ride: It doesn't take long to realise that there's something different about this Marvel character . It’s this latter reason that made the 45-minute playthrough so enjoyable. Voiced by Uncharted star Nolan North, Deadpool’s unpredictability is as charming as it is intriguing. The fact that you never know what he’s going to do or say helps give the game a distinctive feel. He’ll shout insults at you if you’re doing something he doesn’t like. Tap on the screen and mock you for following on-screen prompts. This is his game, and you play by his rules – not the other way around. The danger of setting the standard so high with such a well-executed character, is that the gameplay faces a hard task to catch up. It’s no surprise, then, that combat is not as interesting. There’s no denying that Deadpool has a wide range of authentic moves and weapons to wield, but it all feels very familiar. Certain parts of the demo simply involved walking from room to room, wiping out as many not-too-bright baddies in the most stylish way possible. Thankfully, there’s an upgrade system, so you’re encouraged to string-together the best combos and there are plenty of rooms to explore and load-up on collectables. Always outnumbered, never out-gunned: The harder it is, the more Deadpool seems to enjoy himself . But for what Deadpool may lack in innovative gameplay, it makes up in spades by having such an interesting lead character. One that is well worth getting excited about. Deadpool is released on June 28. Follow us on Twitter: @DailyMailGames and on Facebook: Daily Mail Games.","Boasts one of the most interesting lead characters of recent times .

"By . Harriet Arkell . At first glance, the 200-year-old books are handsomely bound, with the edges of their pages painted in gilt. Look more closely, however, and you will see a beautiful and intricate painting hidden on the edges of the pages. Known as 'fore-edge paintings' (the fore-edge is the opposite of the spine), their existence at all has lain a secret to many since the practice began centuries ago. This fore-edge of the 1837 book Winter by Robert Mudie, shows how the paintings reveal themselves . This is the fore-edge painting on Robert Mudie's Summer, and depicts a seasonal scene in the countryside . Now, however, staff at the University of Iowa have taken a series of photographs showing how the pages of historic books may contain more than just the story written within. Colleen Theisen, a Special Collections librarian at the University of Iowa, revealed the books' secrets in an online posting entitled 'It's a secret to everybody.' The edges of the books' pages have been painted in gilt, but what is not immediately obvious is that the margins of each page have also been painted in such a way that when the book is fanned slightly, a picture of a scene emerges. Ms Theisen used the University's Special Collections and Archives' set of four nature books, published in London in 1837 and entitled Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, by Robert Mudie, to show how the paintings were hidden. She said: 'Each has a landscape painting of the season hidden until you begin to read it and bend the pages to turn them.' Ms Theisen told MailOnline how the paintings were done, using a clamp. She said: 'In order to paint the edges the book has to be clamped in the fanned position to make a flat surface to paint on.  When the clamp is released, the image disappears.' This scene with golden leaves depicts autumn on the book of the same name - but is hidden when it's closed . Robert Mudie's Spring has an incredibly detailed rural scene of horses ploughing a field . The librarian took a picture of the painting hidden within the pages of each of the four books, which were donated to the University of Iowa by Charlotte Smith, for the website ThisisColossal.com. The artist who painted the images is unknown. Fore--edge painting dates back to the 10th century, but the practice of disappearing fore-edge paintings, when they are hidden when the book is fully closed, is thought to date back to 1649. Initially the paintings featured symbols or family crests, but in the latter half of the 18th century, specialist fore-edge painters began to paint scenes or detailed landscapes, or even erotic pictures. The pictures were painted first, before gilt was applied later to the very edges to mask the picture's existence. This photograph of a gilt-edged book shows how disappearing fore-edge pictures look when the book is closed . But when the pages are fanned slightly, a detailed picture of the River Thames in London appears .","'Disappearing fore-edge paintings' can only be seen when pages are fanned .

Federal authorities have lodged two criminal charges against a Phoenix, Arizona woman accused of throwing a shoe at Hillary Rodham Clinton while she gave a convention speech at a Las Vegas Strip resort. Alison Michelle Ernst, 36, didn't respond to a phone message on Monday about the charges of trespassing and violence against a person in a restricted building, which were filed Sunday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, Nevada. She could face up to a year in federal prison on each charge if she's convicted. A court date wasn't immediately set, and it wasn't clear if Ernst had a lawyer. Scroll down for video .

A disorderly conduct conviction could get Ernst up to six months in county jail. Ernst immediately surrendered and was arrested after the incident Thursday in a ballroom at the Mandalay Bay resort. The federal charges accuse her of . bypassing security to enter the ballroom and committing a violent act by . throwing the shoe that police say she pulled from a purse and hurled . about 60 feet toward the former secretary of state.

"By . John Stevens . Ukrainian blonde: Mother-of-one Anna Avramenko, 25, who canoe conman John Darwin met up with on Saturday night . Canoe fraudster John Darwin is up the creek again after a failed effort to find a Ukrainian bride. The 63-year-old has been dumped by a woman less than half his age who labelled him a ‘sex-starved criminal’. Darwin, who is on parole from prison, travelled to Ukraine to go on a date with Anna Avramenko, 25, after they met through a foreign brides website for women seeking a rich husband. But she says she never wants to see him again after she found out that he can expect to be jailed when he returns to Britain. Darwin broke the conditions of his parole by travelling the 1,700 miles from his home in Hartlepool to visit her in the industrial town of Sumy. He was jailed in 2008 for faking his death and fraudulently claiming £500,000 in insurance money with his then wife Anne, 61. Yesterday Miss Avramenko, whom he met for dinner on Saturday evening, said she did not know he was a criminal. The tall blonde said she agreed to meet Darwin after he bombarded her with sleazy messages, which included boasts that he could ‘satisfy any woman’ and requests for a threesome. He boasted that hundreds of women wanted to meet up with him and claimed he had received 240 messages in one day, she said. Miss Avramenko, who has a six-year-old daughter, said that during their three-month email exchange, Darwin told her that one of his favourite hobbies was kayaking. He also allegedly tried to persuade her to sleep with him by saying Westerners often have sex on the first date. When they met, he kept encouraging her to come to his room to drink champagne. But she took him to dinner with two of her friends instead and went to him with a bar afterwards as he again pestered her to come back to his room. She told The Sun: ‘When John first wrote to me it was just general chatting, but later he started sending more private letters, some of which were inappropriate, too sexy – even embarrassing. ‘He kept mentioning that he can satisfy any girl and claimed that his first sexual experience was when he was eight with an older woman. Canoe conman: John Darwin, 63, who pestered Anna Avramenko with hundreds of desperate emails online . ‘Some of his messages were disgusting. I only eventually agreed to meet him because he was so persistent. ‘But I regret going to see him because he was just interested in trying to have sex with me. ‘I didn’t know about him being in jail. I would never have met him if I knew.’ Darwin, whose marriage ended in divorce after he and his wife were jailed, told Miss Avramenko he wanted to remarry and live abroad. ‘I’m looking for a wife, not simply a hot date with you or any other girl on this site,’ he said. When confronted by a reporter during their date, Darwin said he had a migraine. Trip: John Darwin, left, who was jailed for orchestrating a life insurance scam with his wife Anne, right, was seen on a dinner date with Anna Avramenko, 25, in Ukraine . Told that it was likely the . authorities would want to question him on his return to Britain, he . replied: ‘Well, I’ll have an even bigger headache then.’ It is understood that a warrant will be issued so he will face arrest as soon as he returns. Darwin was declared dead in 2003, a year after apparently drowning on a canoe trip. His . family claimed £500,000 in insurance money, yet all the while he was . living in a hidden part of the home he shared with his wife. Journey: Darwin travelled 1,700 miles from Britain to Sumy in north-eastern Ukraine for his date. He was last night thought to be in Kiev . Canoe: Darwin's boat was recovered from the sea in March 2002 but there was no trace of him for five years . The . swindle deceived the police, a coroner, a number of financial . institutions and even their sons Mark and Anthony. The pair eventually . moved to Panama, planning to start a new life with their money. But in December 2007 Darwin walked into a London police station claiming he had amnesia. He was jailed for six years and three months but released in 2011. He now lives in a £100,000 bungalow in Seaton Carew, near Hartlepool, and survives on a pension of £138 a week. Home: The house in Hartlepool where the Darwins lived before moving to Panama . It . is unclear which travel documents he used to visit Ukraine as it was . thought his passport was not due to be returned to him until next March. Under . the terms of his early prison release on licence, Darwin is not allowed . to leave the UK without Probation Service permission. The . Ministry of Justice has advised that offenders who breach the terms of . their licence will be returned to prison to serve the rest of their . sentence. A spokesman said: . ‘Any offender subject to licence supervision is required to gain . permission from probation to travel outside of the UK. Permission is . only granted in exceptional circumstances. ‘Any . offender who travels without this permission will be subject to recall . to custody. In these circumstances, the Probation Service works closely . with the police to implement the recall.’","Darwin, 63, described as a 'sex-starved criminal' by Ukrainian blonde .

"By . James  Nye . and Ap . Charged: Alison Ernst, 36, has been charged with disorderly conduct after throwing a shoe at the former Secretary of State . Authorities say a Phoenix woman accused of throwing a shoe at Hillary Rodham Clinton during a Las Vegas speech has been freed after being given a misdemeanor disorderly conduct summons. Prosecutors said Friday that 36-year-old Alison Michelle Ernst was freed by Las Vegas police after being questioned by U.S. Secret Service agents in the Thursday incident at the Mandalay Bay resort. As Ernst was taken into custody, she said she threw a shoe and dropped some papers. She didn't say why. Ernst's jail booking photo shows she wore blonde wig at the time. The 36-year-old made her way up to the stage at the Mandalay Bay Hotel-Casino where Clinton was addressing a crowd at a Scrap Recycling Industries meeting. The Las Vegas Review Journal reported that Ernst threw the shoe overhand before being taken away by security. She also threw a stack of papers in the air and a spectator who said it appeared to be a confidential Defense Department report from 1967 that detailed an operation called 'Cynthia' that took place in Bolivia. Ernst, whose mugshot shows has short brown hair, was pictured being escorted away while wearing a long platinum blonde wig and a figure-hugging blue and black dress. Clinton ducked but did not appear to be hit by the object, and then joked about the incident. 'Is that somebody throwing something at me?' Clinton asked. 'Is that part of Cirque du Soleil?' Later reports revealed that Ernst had a single shoe in her purse when she went into the event but security guards did not get a chance to ask her about it beforehand because she avoided the security checkpoints. This is not Ernst's first run in with the law, and she appears to have a history of causing scenes around controversial figures. Scroll down for video .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Thoroughbred Toffee was bridesmaid at the wedding of her owner Alex Wells, 28, to Graham Sales, 29 . A horse-mad bride chose her thoroughbred to be one of her bridesmaids at her wedding. Alex Wells, 28, was attended by her friend Lianna Bourne, 28, and her 17-year-old horse, Toffee, when she married Graham Sales in her childhood home in Nottinghamshire. Unlike Miss Bourne, Toffee had to stay outside the church during the service, but was waiting when the happy couple emerged from All Saints Church in Coddington, and took her part in the line-up for the official photographs. Mrs Sales, who grew up in Coddington and events competitively on her thoroughbred, said: 'Toffee is part of the family and is so important to me, I even asked her permission to get married.' Her husband, who judging by the photographs does not share perhaps quite the same passion for Toffee as his new bride, admitted he was 'definitely behind Toffee' in the pecking order. Mr Sales said: 'Alex goes to see Toffee twice a day and will spend weekends with her, so I am always competing with her for attention.' From this neigh forward: Newly-weds Graham and Alex Sales with bridesmaids Toffee and Lianna Bourne . Tolerant groom: Mr Sales is not quite as mad about Toffee as his bride is - and the feeling seems to be mutual . The couple, who are both metallurgists and met through work, have been together for five years - not a patch on the bride's 13 years with Toffee. Toffee was brought down from the coupleâ€™s home in Elsecar, South Yorkshire, for the service, and wore a purple bridle to match the other bridesmaid's dress.  She also had her mane and forelock plaited with purple ribbons. Miss Bourne, of Kilmarnock, Scotland, said: 'Toffee took longer than me to get ready.  She was definitely in the spotlight.' The Reverend David Anderton, who led the wedding service, said an equine bridesmaid was a new one on him in a decade of marrying couples. He said: 'I have never seen any animal of any sort being a bridesmaid, but I was glad Alex didn't ask if she could bring her down the aisle - I was happy to have her in the churchyard.' Can't wait for the wedding cake: Toffee lunges at the tempting churchyard grass when she should be posing .","Alex Wells, 28, had Toffee as bridesmaid at wedding to Graham Sales, 29 .

"By . Bianca London . The day the children finally leave home for good has traditionally been seen as a sad time. But rather than seeing the empty nesting period as a moment to mourn, it seems parents are making the most of the opportunity. Make way for the 'escaping nesters': a new breed of over-50s who are making the most of the lack of responsibilities at home and heading abroad to fulfill their travel dreams. And they're off! It seem that over 50s are making the most of their children leaving home and use the time to travel . It seems that for over half of respondents, it is not a time tinged with sadness but one of great excitement and a time to remember what they wanted to do with their life before children. A recent survey has shown that over 60 per cent are happy to leave any responsibilities they may still have at home behind in favour of pursuing their travel dreams. A resounding 90 per cent feel that now is the time to visit their dream destinations whilst they are still fit and healthy and over 40 per cent feel they can indulge in their passion for travel because their children have finally left the nest. Not a care in the world: The survey reveals that over 60 per cent of over 50s are happy to leave any responsibilities they may still have at home to pursue their travel dreams . The over 50s are a travel-hungry and adventurous bunch with the top wish list destinations being New Zealand and the Canadian Rockies, followed by Norway Northern Lights, Galapagos Islands and even Alaska.

"By . James Chapman . Updated: . 02:40 EST, 20 December 2011 . 'Building bridges': German Foreign Minster Guido Westerwelle (right) said Britain were 'indispensable' partners within the EU as he appeared . at a press conference with William Hague, left . Germany launched an extraordinary charm offensive to try to get Britain back to the EU negotiating table last night despite George Osborne’s refusal to contribute billions to a Brussels begging bowl. Guido Westerwelle, the German foreign minister, used a visit to London to extend an olive branch, lavishing praise on the UK as an ‘indispensable partner’ and promising a ‘hands-off’ approach to our financial services industry. There are increasing signs Germany is prepared to go behind France’s back and contemplate giving David Cameron the special protections for the City of London that were refused at a crunch summit this month, prompting the Prime Minister to veto an EU-wide power-sharing treaty. Mr Westerwelle, speaking alongside Foreign Secretary William Hague, promised a prosperous future for the City. He said Germany wanted the EU’s next steps to involve all 27 member states, adding: ‘My main message is for the British people – you can count on us, and we can count on you. ‘There is no doubt that we want to make the next steps in the EU together as 27. I am here to show you that we are willing to build bridges over troubled water.’ The remarks about ‘building bridges’ were in stark contrast to days of aggressive rhetoric from the French, who appear keen to see Britain exit the EU altogether. Ministers were privately appalled by suggestions from France, which looks likely to lose its gold-plated credit rating within weeks, that the UK should be downgraded first. The Chancellor risked heightening tensions last night as he confirmed Britain will not sign up to a 200billion-euro package of European loans to the International Monetary Fund, the world’s economic rescue service. Mr Osborne is refusing to expose more British taxpayers’ cash through the IMF to a eurozone bailout package, despite suggestions that we should contribute about £25billion. In a conference call with 26 other EU finance ministers, Mr Osborne repeated the Government’s position that the UK is prepared to increase contributions by up to £10billion, but only when EU leaders boost their own bailout fund and not for any scheme specifically for the single currency. ‘The UK has always been willing to consider further resources for the IMF, but for its global role and as part of a global agreement,’ a Treasury spokesman said. A Government source said no one in Europe should be surprised at Britain’s stance, which had been clear for several weeks. ‘It’s called “doing what you say you’re going to do”. Get used to it,’ the source said. Conciliatory plea: German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle told the press conference: 'My main message is for the British people - you can count on us, and we count on you' Eurozone countries appear to have cobbled together their own 150billion-euro boost for IMF resources – nowhere near enough to bail out Italy, Spain or other debt-stricken economies in peril. Warning: European Central Bank president Mario Draghi openly warned of . the risk of currency collapse for the first time in an interview yesterday . To the frustration of British officials, the European Central Bank again rejected suggestions that it should embark on a programme of quantitative easing – effectively printing money – in order to help governments repay their debts. The bank has refused to do so, insisting it is up to national governments to put their houses in order. ECB president Mario Draghi said EU rules ‘forbid monetary financing of states’ by the central bank. A report from a key UN body yesterday warned the world is heading for a repeat of the Great Depression of the 1930s. The UN Commission for Trade and Development issued the strongest warning yet from a major international organisation. It said: ‘Unless there is a rapid policy turnaround, the world is in danger of repeating the mistakes of the 1930s. In today’s highly integrated global economy, the contractionary contagion will affect all countries. Emerging and developing economies need to prepare contingency plans.’ Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the IMF, warned the EU’s firewall to staunch the spread of the crisis ‘doesn’t really exist’. No magic solution: Boris Johnson, pictured at the Harry Potter . attraction in Hertfordshire yesterday, warned that he euro is unlikely to . last another 12 months . Crisis talks: George Osborne will use a teleconference today to discuss boosting the world's economic rescue service . A 500billion euro European Stability . Mechanism would only be operational in months when ‘the question is a . question of weeks’, he added. ‘It appears today as a debt crisis. More than that, it is a growth crisis. 'Behind the growth crisis is a leadership crisis. 'The problem is they don’t have exactly the same view and I’m not quite sure that [Angela] Merkel and [Nicolas] Sarkozy clearly understand each other. The problem is they are still in denial.’ Italy, which has a massive national debt that has prompted market turmoil in recent weeks, was last night reported to have committed 23 billion euros to the IMF scheme. There were claims the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), an existing EU bailout fund, may have to lend money to Italy so it can give money to the IMF which it in turn will give to EFSF and to Italy. ■ A senior Church of England bishop warned yesterday against British isolation from Europe. The Bishop of Guildford, the Right Reverend Christopher Hill, who speaks for his colleagues on EU matters in the House of Lords, intervened in the row following followed David Cameron’s veto of the new EU treaty this month. He said: ‘It will be disastrous if we were actually isolated from the rest of Europe, economically and in terms of international relations.’ He added: The structures need reform and accountability, but you don’t do that by stepping out.’ ■ Business leaders claim millions of British jobs will be lost if the country does not fight to keep its place as a key player in Europe. A group of tycoons and entrepreneurs, including Sir Richard Branson, have written an open letter to the Government urging David Cameron to ‘re-engage in the decision-making process in Europe’. Signatories say at least three million could find themselves unemployed if Britain continues to isolate itself from the EU. Co-ordinated by the lobby group Business for New Europe, the letter will put extra pressure on Mr Cameron at a time when he stands accused of trying to appease Europhile party members.","European Central Bank president Mario Draghi says he is NOT prepared to back currency with bond purchase .

"By . Katy Winter . If you think cheerleading is synonymous with overly-peppy wholesome American teenagers, think again. A cheerleading group in Arizona are smashing through age stereotypes as they delight audiences with their acrobatic and high-energy routines, despite all being over 55-years-old. London-based photographer Todd Antony recently spent some time in Sun City, a retirement city with 37,000 residents close to Phoenix, Arizona, where he captured The Sun City Poms in action. Sun City Poms member Lois shows off her impressive flexibility- despite being over 55-years-old . Greta shakes her pom poms for a picture in front of a cactus in Arizona, where the group was started in 1979 . The group perform at over 50 venues a year, ranging from sports centres and high schools to conventions and fundraiserss . Although their grey and white hair might slightly jar with the tight colourful lycra outfits, these ladies show that despite their age, they don't lack enthusiasm ... or flexibility! They were very happy to be photographed striking a pose, with some ladies even raising their legs above their heads, against the backdrop of their sunny paradise. Antony says: ‘Spending time with these ladies made me consider how Americans view the aging process; at one end of the spectrum are the child beauty pageants with children trying to fast-track their years whilst at the other end are these fabulous pom pom ladies who are successfully and gracefully holding back the years.' The Sun City Poms were started in 1979 cheering for the Sun City Saints women’s softball team, and now consist of a marching unit and supporting unit along with the main performing unit. Prospective Sun City Poms must also possess: 'dance skills of rhythm, agility, poise, energy, and showmanship for performing' The Poms are smashing through age stereotypes as they delight audiences with their acrobatic and high-energy routines . The website states that as well as being over 55, prospective Sun City Poms must also possess: ‘dance skills of rhythm, agility, poise, energy, and showmanship for performing’, while ‘acrobatics and baton twirling are a plus.’ The group perform at over 50 venues a year, ranging from sports centres and high schools to conventions and fundraisers. The Sun City website states: ‘Fry’s Sun City Poms come from all walks of life, and are more than entertainers.  They represent the fulfilment of life at any age. 'Performing with the spunk and energy of their youths, these ladies are having the time of their lives while sharing positive aspects of retirement and ageing, and shattering conventional images of “senior citizens.”’","The Sun City Poms are a cheerleading group all aged over 55 .

"By . Ap . and Daily Mail Reporter . Ohio is to boost the dosages of its lethal injection drugs even as it stands by the January execution of an inmate who made unusual snorting and gasping sounds that led to a civil rights lawsuit. The state's new policy, announced on Monday, considerably increases the amount of the sedative used in its two-drug combination and raises the amount of the painkiller, which are injected simultaneously, according to a court filing. The state said it was making the changes 'to allay any remaining concerns' after the last execution. The Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said its review of the Jan. 16 execution of Dennis McGuire determined he was asleep and unconscious a few minutes after the drugs were administered and his execution was conducted in a constitutional manner. Humane: Ohio officials say that the drug used in the execution of Dennis McGuire was humane, despite taking 26 minutes . Killer: McGuire (pictured) was sentenced to death for the rape and murder of Joy Stewart in 1989 . 'He did not experience pain, distress or air hunger after the drugs were administered or when the bodily movements and sounds occurred,' the state said. The department said it 'finds no harm in increasing the dosage levels of its drugs,' after consulting with its medical expert and examining other states' practices, spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said. The state's policy change comes 30 days before the next scheduled execution on May 28, when a man convicted of killing a Cleveland produce vendor in 1983 is set to die. McGuire's fitful 26-minute execution was the longest since Ohio resumed putting inmates to death in 1999. His adult children complained it amounted to torture, with his son saying: 'Nobody deserves to go through that.' lawsuit: McGuire's son, Dennis, has filed a lawsuit against the state for the unusually slow death of his father during his execution . The McGuire family's attorney criticized the state's report, saying it relied on a medical expert who predicted before the execution that McGuire wouldn't experience air hunger, desperate attempts to catch one's breath while suffocating. 'That causes some concern as to whether they looked at it from both sides,' defense attorney Jon Paul Rion said. The state's execution policy calls for it to use a specialty dose of the powerful sedative pentobarbital, made by non-federally regulated pharmacies, as its first choice. If that can't be obtained, as has happened twice, it goes to a backup method of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. The state said its review found high doses of hydromorphone commonly cause people to stop breathing, as does midazolam. With the drugs given together, it said, the effect 'is much greater.' Snorting: During McGuire's execution, witnesses heard him snorting and gasping for air, which is why his son is suing the state . In about two weeks, the state must say whether it has found pentobarbital for the May 28 execution of Arthur Tyler or must go to the backup method. In a rare move, Tyler's attorneys and prosecutors are asking for him be spared, though for different reasons. States are in a bind for two main reasons: European companies have cut off supplies of certain execution drugs because of opposition to capital punishment in Europe. And states can't simply switch to other chemicals without triggering legal challenges. Texas has struggled to obtain execution drugs and has had to change its three-drug protocol to a dose of pentobarbital.","There were questions about the January 16 execution of Dennis McGuire, who was convicted of the 1989 rape and murder of Joy Stewart .
It took McGuire about 25 minutes to die after he'd been injected with the lethal dose of chemicals .
Despite the amount of time it took McGuire to die, the state has ruled that the execution was not unconstitutional ."
"By . David Mccormack . Ex-Minnesota Vikings . punter Chris Kluwe has said he is ‘pretty confident’ that he was cut . from the team last May for being an out-spoken advocate for same-sex . marriage. Kluwe has also . accused Vikings coach Mike Priefer - currently a contender to . become the team’s next head coach - of being a bigot who repeatedly used . homophobic language in front him and told him he would ‘wind up burning . in hell with the gays.’ The . player, whose playing stats were above average, believes his . problems began in the fall of 2012 when he started to speak out against . the Minnesota Gay Marriage Amendment which attempted to have marriage . defined as ‘only a union of one man and one woman.’ Ex-Minnesota Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, right, claims coach Mike Priefer, left, told him 'we should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows' Along with a group called Minnesotans for Marriage Equality, Kluwe helped have the amendment voted down. Same-sex marriage is now legal in Minnesota, but Kluwe says he lost his career because of his beliefs. He . has written a scathing account of his final months at the Vikings in an . article posted to Deadspin entitled I Was An NFL Player Until I Was . Fired By Two Cowards And A Bigot. He . savages several of his coaches, but saves his worst criticism for . special teams coordinator Mike Priefer, who he claims would use anti-gay . slurs around him and unfairly criticize his performance. ‘It’s . my belief, based on everything that happened over the course of 2012, . that I was fired by Mike Priefer, a bigot who didn’t agree with the . cause I was working for, and two cowards, [head coach] Leslie Frazier . and [general manager] Rick Spielman, both of whom knew I was a good . punter and would remain a good punter for the foreseeable future, as my . numbers over my eight-year career had shown, but who lacked the . fortitude to disagree with Mike Priefer on a touchy subject matter,’ he . writes. During his final season as a Vikings player, Chris Kluwe was an outspoken advocate for same-sex marriage . Kluwe cites one example where Priefer told him in front of his teammates that 'We . should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it . until it glows.' He . continued: ‘Mike Priefer also said on multiple occasions that I would . wind up burning in hell with the gays, and that the only truth was Jesus . Christ and the Bible. 'He said all this in a semi-joking tone, and I . responded in kind, as I felt a yelling match with my coach over human . rights would greatly diminish my chances of remaining employed.’ Kluwe . also claims that Priefer instructed him to start kicking shorter punts . with more hangtime because his coverage team was so slow. When Kluwe . followed those instructions, Priefer gave him negative scores in his . evaluation. Kluwe, who . acknowledged that his revelations would mean he will never get another . NFL job, said his motivation was ‘to make sure . that Mike Priefer never holds a coaching position again in the NFL, and . ideally never coaches at any level.’ Cowards: Kluwe has also spoken out against General Manager Rick Spielman, left, and Leslie Frazier, right, who was fired as head coach on Monday . The . Vikings sacked head coach Frazier at the end of 2012 after they . failed to make the play-offs and Priefer has been described as 'the only . in-house candidate with a chance' at the head-coaching job by Pioneer . Press. ‘It's inexcusable . that someone would use his status as a teacher and a role model to . proselytize on behalf of his own doctrine of intolerance, and I hope he . never gets another opportunity to pass his example along to anyone . else,’ wrote Kluwe. The Vikings have previously denied cutting Kluwe for off-field reasons. Last June, Priefer refused to go into specifics about Kluwe’s release, . but said he felt 'very strongly' that the Vikings needed to part ways . with the punter. 'It was . more consistency and productivity,' Priefer said in a response to a . question about what factors, statistical or otherwise, contributed to . the decision. Asked if Kluwe could have improved his production, Priefer said simply, 'I just felt like we needed to make a change there.' Kluwe did make the point that team owner Zygi Wilf had voiced his support for Kluwe’s public stance. Chris Kluwe has demanded anonymity for any teammates willing to speak out, so their careers won't be jeopardized as his was .","Kluwe, who was cut from the Vikings in May, says he believes it was because he was an advocate for gay marriage .

"By . Sean Poulter . Residues of toxic chemicals have been found in children’s clothes and shoes made by major brands including Disney, Burberry, American Apparel, GAP and Primark. The products involved include items sold in the UK, according to research by Greenpeace. There is no evidence that the levels of chemicals found would cause harm to children wearing them, however Greenpeace argues they should be removed on a precautionary basis. Higher levels were found in products from Disney, Burberry, American Apparel and C&A . It is particularly concerned for the health of workers involved in making the products in countries stretching from China to Italy, Tunisia and the U.S. Eighty-two items of children’s clothing from 25 countries around the world were sent to research laboratories at the University of Exeter, who co-ordinated the testing. Residues were found in all but six, according to a research report titled ‘A little story about the monsters in your closet’, which was published today. Three out of four items bought in the UK contained chemical residues, including a hooded sweatshirt from American Apparel, a shirt from Burberry and sweatpants from Primark. Also a Chelsea children’s football sale in Colombia was found to contain traces of a suspect chemical. Residues of toxic chemicals have been found in children¿s clothes and shoes made by major brands including Disney, Burberry, American Apparel, GAP and Primark . The chemicals highlighted by the group include Nonylphenol ethoxylates(NPEs), which were detected in 50 of the products. Higher levels were found in products from Disney, Burberry, American Apparel and C&A. These are said to have the potential to accumulate in the body and disrupt hormones. The tests ound phthalates, which are used to soften plastics, in many products. These have been at the centre of controversy over suggestions they can disrupt the hormones of developing children. Also found were Per and poly-flurinated(PFOAs) chemicals, which are said to have an impact on the reproductive and immune systems. Animal tests have identified them as a potential cancer risk. One Adidas swimsuit contained higher levels of PFOAs than permitted in the company’s own Restricted Substance List, while printed fabric on a Primark children’s T-shirt contained a high phthalate reading. Antimony, which has many similarities to arsenic, was found in some garments. It is known to trigger dermatitis and breathing problems. Primark said it is working to remove chemicals from the production process . Fungicide chemicals, known as organotoxins, were found in socks, shoes and sports clothes. Exposure at high levels can harm the immune and nervous systems. Chih An Lee, Detox Campaigner at Greenpeace East Asia, said: ‘This is a nightmare for parents everywhere looking to buy clothes for their children that don’t contain hazardous chemicals. ‘These chemical ‘little monsters’ can be found in everything from exclusive luxury designs to budget fashion, polluting our waterways from Beijing to Berlin. For the sake of current and future generations brands should stop using these monsters.’ An Lee said: ‘Parents, fashion fans and local communities can help end this toxic nightmare by speaking out against polluting brands.

Burberry said it is working with Greenpeace to tackle the issue. A spokesman said: ‘The safety and welfare of our customers is paramount and Burberry complies with all international environmental and safety standards. Burberry products do not pose a danger to customers.’ Primark said it is working to remove chemicals from the production process. It said: ‘We have a stringent chemical management policy in place which complies fully with EU legislation. ‘However, Primark has long recognised the importance of continuing to reduce the environmental impact of manufacturing processes.’ Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium said: ‘Members providing  children’s clothing are ensuring that products meet and exceed current legal requirements. ‘We have not seen the full data but looking at the text in the executive summary there are some concerns, especially that the report does not highlight any instances of products on sale which are illegal. ‘Current chemical test methods are very sophisticated and can detect chemicals at extremely low levels so, although detected, this does not mean that the chemicals would cause health problems to children and may only be present  as very low level contaminants.’","Products include items sold in the UK, according to Greenpeace .

"By . Lydia Warren . Chilling drone footage taken just moments after a massive tornado ripped through Arkansas has revealed the extent of the devastation. Flattened homes, upturned storage units and scattered cars can be seen on the aerial video, which shows the wreckage just south of Mayflower, Arkansas after a half-mile-wide tornado - just one in a series of deadly storms on Sunday - barreled through Interstate 40 at around 7.30pm. At least person was killed in the city and the grounded power lines and trees made it hard for emergency services to find stricken areas in the dark, officials said. In the footage, rescuers can be seen picking through the debris of one home, and as darkness falls, they are seen continuing their search. The film was shared on YouTube by storm chaser Brian Emfinger, who wrote that it was 'shot just moments after the tornado moved through'. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: Aerial footage shows the devastation inflicted just south of Mayflower, Arkansas after tornadoes pummeled the area on Sunday . Search: Rescue teams search for survivors among the wreckage of a building dumped beside Interstate 40 as darkness creeps in on Sunday . 'It's extremely . hazardous here right now,' said Will Elder, an alderman in the city. 'The power lines are down, roads are blocked and they will have to . proceed with caution.' The tornadoes . ripped through the south-central U.S. on Sunday, killing at . least 18 people in Arkansas and Oklahoma and wiping out entire . neighborhoods. The small town of Vilonia - about 20 miles from where the video was shot - was particularly badly hit. The storm was 'at least a half mile wide,' Greg Johnson, an author and storm chaser, told Mashable, adding that it came nearly three years to the day that a tornado killed four people in Vilonia. 'The scene here is incredible,' he said. 'Entire town destroyed and the damage is definitely F5 caliber. Many killed and injured. There are thousands of volunteers and emergency personnel on the ground searching. Entire homes swept off their foundations. Strong brick homes. Complete devastation.' Nothing left: Another area of the wreckage shows destroyed storage containers and warehouses near to Mayflower, where the worst storms hit . Deadly: At least one person is believed to have died after tornadoes ravaged the area - and at least 15 other people were killed across Arkansas . Strikes: A map of the Midwest highlights where the tornadoes hit on Sunday . The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management confirmed early on Monday that at least 16 people had died in the state, while an Oklahoma county sheriff's dispatcher reported that one person had died in the town of Quapaw. Fox News said another person died in Keokuk County, Iowa. Searchers . were continuing to dig through rubble in Vilonia and a spokesman for . the County Sheriff's office said there was a 'mass casualty situation'. 'An . entire neighborhood of 50 or so homes has been destroyed. Many homes . are completely gone except the foundation... There is more devastation . like this in other parts of Arkansas,' U.S. Representative Tim Griffin . told Reuters. Brandon Morris, a . spokesman for the Arkansas Emergency Management Agency, said Mayflower . and Vilonia appeared to have been the hardest hit communities, and the National Weather Service in North Little Rock said it was virtually certain that the storm would be rated as the nation's strongest twister to date this year. 'It has the potential to be EF3 or . greater,' said meteorologist Jeff Hood. EF3 storms have winds greater . than 136 mph. 'Based on some of the footage we've seen from Mayflower and . where it crossed Interstate 40, things were wrecked in a very . significant way.' The Arkansas National Guard was . deployed to help out in the state. From communities west of Little Rock . to others well north of the capital, emergency workers and volunteers . were going door-to-door checking for victims. Tornado . watches - which means twisters could develop but are not an immediate . threat - are in effect for states as far west as New Mexico and as far . east as Tennessee and the system produced storms that were moving . through the region in waves.

Sunday . was the third anniversary of a 122-tornado day, which struck parts of . Mississippi, Alabama, Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia and killed 316. Before this weekend, the country had been experiencing the slowest start to tornado season on record (with no fatalities), likely due to the polar vortex during the winter.","A video taken over Mayflower, Arkansas by a storm chaser moments after a tornado barreled through on Sunday evening shows destroyed homes, upturned cars and flattened trees - and rescuers searching for victims .

"By . Associated Press . Prosecutors have filed six first-degree murder charges against a Utah woman accused of killing six babies after giving birth to them, and keeping their bodies in boxes in her garage. The charges were filed Monday morning shortly before 39-year-old Megan Huntsman appeared in court for the second time. She was informed of the charges during the brief hearing. Prosecutors say Huntsman is the only suspect in the deaths of the babies. Bound and shackled: Megan Huntsman, accused of killing six of her babies and storing their bodies in her garage, appears in court Monday, April 28, 2014, in Provo, Utah . Charged: Prosecutors have filed six first-degree murder charges against Huntsman . The infants dead bodies were found hidden in cardboard boxes in 39-year-old Megan Huntsman's former garage in Pleasant Grove, Utah by her estranged husband. They say a seventh dead infant found in the garage appears to have been stillborn. Investigators believe Huntsman's estranged husband, Darren West, is the babies' father, though they are awaiting DNA results to confirm that. West is not a suspect. Huntsman is being held on $6 million bail. Huntsman's estranged husband, Darren West, discovered one of the infant corpses in the garage of their Pleasant Grove home on April 12. Police then responded and found a total of seven tiny bodies in cardboard boxes. Standing trial: Megan Huntsman, right, who is accused of killing six of her babies and storing their bodies in her garage, appears in court with one of her defense attorneys Doug Thompson . Tragic: Huntman admitted strangling six of them and wrapping their bodies in towels before hiding them at home. The other child was not alive when it was born . Police said Huntsman acknowledged that from 1996 to 2006, she strangled or suffocated six of the babies, put them in plastic bags and packed them inside boxes in the garage of her home south of Salt Lake City. She told police a seventh baby was stillborn. Investigators believe West is the father of the babies, though they are waiting on DNA results to confirm that, Buhman said. West lived with Huntsman during the decade she says this happened, but he was in federal prison on drug charges from 2006 until January. Prosecutors said they hope to soon meet again with West, who Buhman said has been cooperative and is not considered a suspect. After an initial interview, West obtained an attorney and has not met with investigators again. Authorities say they think they know her motive, but they have declined to reveal it publicly.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . Searchers in airplanes, boat and on foot were looking on Monday for a father and his two children who haven't been heard from since sending out a text on Saturday that they were lost in the vast woods and swamps of the Congaree National Park east of Columbia. Crews were carefully marking each patch of land they cross over and have searched about a third of the 27,000-acre site, park spokeswoman Dana Sohen said on Monday afternoon. J.R. Kimbler sent a text message to a friend on Saturday around 9:30 p.m. saying he and his kids were lost. The friend called the children's mother, who called authorities. J.R. Kimbler, 43, sent a text message to a friend on Saturday around 9:30 p.m. saying he and his kids were lost in the Congaree National Park east of Columbia . Missing: Dakota, 10, and his sister Jade, 6. Kimbler had been out of his children's lives for a few years, but recently started to get them on the weekends . A search party was immediately sent out. A few people at the park have reported hearing someone yelling for help, Kimbler's family said, but Sohen said authorities haven't been able to confirm any contact since the text message. Officials closed the park on Monday afternoon so they could fully concentrate on finding 43-year-old J.R. Kimbler, his 10-year-old son, Dakota, and 6-year-old daughter, Jade. Also, an investigate team from the National Park Service was checking on leads outside the park in case the family members weren't actually lost while hiking, Sohen said. ‘We haven't dismissed any possibility,’ Sohen said. The mother of the two children, Tammy Ballard, has been at the park the past two days, walking down trails, calling their names. The mother of the two children, Tammy Ballard, has been at the park the past two days, walking down trails, calling their names . ‘It's been tough. I see so many footprints out there,’ Ballard said. The search was going to continue until dark on Monday and then resume at daylight on Tuesday. But after two days of mild, tranquil weather, heavy rain and storms were forecast to move into the area. Also, there is no indication Kimbler took any camping gear or other items for an overnight stay. The taxi driver left his cigarettes in his cab that was still parked near the visitor's center on Monday and his daughter's inhaler and other medicine were in the hotel room where he lived, his family said. ‘I hope for the best, but it looks bad every hour that goes by. I'm worried they won't ever come home,’ said Chris Ballard, stepbrother of the missing children. Since news of their disappearance search parties have scoured the vast woods and swamps of the Congaree National Park east of Columbia . Kimbler had been out of his children's lives for a few years, but recently started to get them on the weekends, Chris Ballard said. He took them to the skating rink and the zoo in recent weeks. The trip to Congaree National Park was the first time he had been out there, he said. The park has marked trails, but beyond the paths are tangles of old growth trees, swamps and underbrush. The land has become even more rugged since an ice storm in February knocked down thousands of trees and limbs. ‘Many of the trails you can't see to navigate right now,’ Sohen said. Maybee Harris said she has no doubt her cousin is still lost in the woods with his children. She thinks they might have run off the trail to look at something and got lost, then Kimbler's cellphone died. ‘They can't convince me he would do something to harm them,’ she said.","J.R.

"By . Lydia Warren . A woman who was lost in Oregon's mental institutions for nearly five decades before she was tracked down by her filmmaker brother has died aged 59. Molly Daly, who was the subject of an award-winning documentary, 'Where's Molly?', in 2007, succumbed to respiratory failure after a visit to the emergency room on Friday, her brother said. Jeff Daly produced and directed the documentary about his sister and Oregon's mental institutions. He was by her side as she passed away, he told the Oregonian. He said . that her death came nearly 10 years to the date that he reunited with . his sister, who had been sent away by his parents when she was two and . he was six. Loss: Molly Daly, left as a child with her brother and right with him in 2010, was lost for nearly 50 years in mental institutions before he tracked her down in 2004. Molly has now passed away . Missed: After Molly, right, was taken away, Jeff would often ask for her - but was told to forget about her . 'Everybody . that knew Molly agreed that our lives were enriched from having the . opportunity to share her love, laughter and friendship,' he said. 'And . Molly asked for so little in return - a kiss and a hug, sing her a song . or just simply take her for a stroll in her wheelchair, or as she called . it, ""a walk'um"".' She . had been born with apparently mild disabilities, including a lazy eye . and a clubfoot, but she was sent away after the impediments troubled her . mother, who wanted to keep up good appearances. One day, the little girl vanished and she was put in what was then known as Oregon Fairview Home, which has since closed. Whenever Jeff Daly asked his mother, 'Where's Molly?', she would tell him not to ask, and he soon forgot about her. Old days: Molly, center, only had minor disabilities - including a lazy eye and a clubfoot - but was sent to a mental institution when she was two because her mother, right, wanted to keep up good appearances . Forgotten: Molly is pictured aged five, left, and right as a teenager after being sent away to the home . New home: Molly was sent to 'the Oregon State Institution for the Feeble-Minded', pictured . But his . father continued to visit his sister. After staff told him not to return . because Molly would get too upset when he left, he returned repeatedly . under the guise of a clown. The visits . eventually stopped and Molly became institutionalized, only inflicted . with the disabilities she portrayed because she was brought up in such . surroundings, her brother previously told CBS. Jeff . only began thinking about her again in 1994 when he rekindled with a . childhood sweetheart, Cindy, who asked him how his little sister was . doing. He was ashamed that he had no idea where she was. After he and Cindy married and his parents passed away, they began looking for Molly. Family: Her father, left, continued to visit her but was told not to come back because it upset Molly so much - so he only returned in a clown costume. Jeff went looking for his sister when his parents, right, died in 2004 . Close: Jeff Daly said he felt guilty for not seeing her but they went on to develop a great relationship . Support: Jeff sought out his sister with the help of his childhood-sweetheart-turned-wife, Cindy, left . In . 2004, they discovered a secret file in his father's belongings with the . contact details for her new home in Hillsboro and promptly found out . where she was. They reunited days later. 'I wasn't . sure what to expect,' he told CBS. 'But the first time I saw her, it was . pain. I felt pained that I hadn't seen her. I knew that I was wrong.' But he rebuilt a relationship with her, visiting her frequently. 'He has, as one person said it, ""filled a hole in his soul."" And it really did,' his wife Cindy told CBS. In his email to the Oregonian, Jeff Daly said he was glad for the decade he did get with his sister. 'Now . we will remember how many lives my little sister was able to touch, how . many families she helped to re-unite and how fortunate we were to be . able to know and learn from her,' he wrote.","Molly Daly was the subject of an award-winning documentary, 'Where's Molly?', produced and directed by her brother Jeff in 2007 .

"By . Joel Christie . Student organizations at Duke University have started a movement against words they believe you just shouldn't say. The 'You Don't Say' campaign determines common slang phrases such as 'Man Up', 'That's So Gay' and 'Dont Be a Pussy' as offensive language that dehumanizes and marginalizes people and groups at the North Carolina college, specifically the LGBT community. But critics aren't convinced, saying that word discouragement is an attack on free speech and public policy. 'Language is a reflection of how we think about others and view the world,' Jay Sullivan, a student leader of the campaign, told The College Fix. Think before you speak: The 'You Don't Say' campaign at Duke University confronts everyday expressions that center around gender and sexual orientation and has gained national publicity, especially from critics . 'My goal is to help facilitate discussion about how language affects many social issues, from race to gender and sexuality.' The campaign is made up of a series of black and white posters, most of which appear only online, featuring students pledging why they will not say the street talk they have deemed offensive. Among the banned words are 'homo', 'bitch', 'tranny' and 'fag', mostly because all are oppressive terms. The campaign is a collaborative effort between a newly formed group at Duke University called Think Before You Talk and Blue Devils United, a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer student advocacy group. The campaign has gained national publicity and plenty of supporters, but the detractors are equally as fervent. A new word-discouragement campaign at Duke University has labeled phrases such as 'Man Up', 'That¿s So Gay', and 'Don¿t Be a Pussy' as offensive language that marginalizes homosexuality . 'I can’t say anything about an individual person, because it might be construed as offensive to a larger group … even if I had no intention of offending a larger group,' one Facebook critic posted. Others said it was unrealistic to try and put a stop on language that is so everyday. 'As a thinking individual, I don’t and didn’t need some children from Duke University admonishing me for ''thinking any gender is inferior'',’ another Facebook user said. 'Do you see what they did there? ‘'Any gender''. Not ‘'either gender''. It’s all about redefining terms, redefining life.' Grove City College professor Dr. Mark Hendrickson said while there is a need for consideration when choosing one's language, the 'You Don't Say' campaign has a narrow focus. 'With anybody advocating the banning of a certain word or phrase… would they be willing to publicly say, ‘'I promise in return to never hinder a speech by a political figure with whose political philosophy I disagree?” Hendrickson told The College Fix. The project was developed by Think Before You Talk and Blue Devils United, two student organizations at Duke University .","New Duke University campaign called 'You Don't Say' targeting offensive phrases on campus .

"By . Adam Duggan . Inspired by the classic arcade game Whack-a-Mole, a pet owner has taken the game to the next level with Whack-a-Kitty. With moles hard to come by these days, they instead cut six holes on the top of a box, filled it with kittens and got whacking. The YouTube video has been gaining traction across social media since being uploaded earlier this year. Too cute: the first kitten pops their head through, only to be softly whacked back into the box . Although it may look like a cute game, is there a downside? Kristina Vesk, Cat Protection Society of NSW CEO, was more worried about the wellbeing of the cats featured in the video than their welfare: 'My first reaction was to wonder where the mother cat was and that I hope she will be desexed now, as there are so many kittens and not enough homes.' 'The toy being used is clearly soft and the person is dealing with it gently.' Sydney Dogs and Cats Home spokersperson Claire Garth agrees, and told MailOnline: ‘There are a lot of cute, and a lot of not-so-cute animal videos on the internet, we'd put this one in the cute category.’ Too scared to pop out: two kittens peer through the holes, carefully planning when they would pop their heads through . Be careful: As one of the kittens pops it's head up, another retreats after getting a gentle whack back down . ‘We always encourage people to be careful when filming their animals, and we generally find most people are.' World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) spokesperson Tom Shennan told MailOnline: 'It is difficult to determine whether or not the kittens in the video are in distress.' 'If the kittens were forced to participate in this game an extended period of time, it's possible that they could become distressed' Had enough: one of the kittens is sick of playing, refusing to lower itself back into the box . Had enough: this kitten refuses to play anymore, clawing their way out of the box instead . 'While games are an important stimulation for pets, animals must not be forced into participation, particularly when they can involve being put inside a closed box,' WSPA spokesperson Tom Shennan said. Cat Protection Society of NSW CEO Kristina Vesk agrees: 'I don’t think it would be the favourite game of the kittens – better to play games with them that they would really enjoy.' But do you lose points if one of the kittens escapes? Considering how difficult it is not to let the cat out of the bag – or box, in this case – we’ll let it slide.","Pet owner uploads video playing Whack-a-Mole with kittens .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Purposeful pregnancy: Janet Vertesi actively tried to keep any mentions of her pregnancy offline to prove a point about invasive internet marketers . A sociology professor has taken her latest lesson out of the classroom by actively trying to keep her internet browser from figuring out she was pregnant in order to avoid marketing schemes. Janet Vertesi is a sociologist with a focus on science and technology at Princeton University and she actively fought to keep her pregnancy from the internet. She avoided buying anything on the internet and called her friends and relatives to tell them the news of her pregnancy rather than announcing it on Facebook or via email. In the call, she told all of her friends and family about the project and urged them to keep all of their upcoming comments on her social media accounts free of any baby mentions. One uncle failed to follow the rules, and prompted got un-friended. She spoke about the experience at a technology conference in Brooklyn on Friday, telling how she has 'a very personal perspective of what it takes to avoid being collected, being tracked and being placed into databases'. Ms Vertesi's experiment wasn't motivated by a vendetta against federal privacy infringement, but rather the invasive marketing tactics used by firms who use internet data collection as a way to predict spending patterns. 'This became especially important in my life about nine months ago because pregnant women, as you may know, are incredibly valuable to digital marketing databases,' she said at the Theorizing The Web conference, according to Mashable. Cash only: She and her husband avoided online shopping, but some purchases couldn't be stopped, and in those instances they used cash to buy Amazon gift cards that were not associated with their names or addresses . Her ideas about the value of pregnant mothers to marketers is based in facts, as an average non-pregnant person's data is worth 10 cents to marketers, while the identity and information about a pregnant woman is $1.50. 'This is because we are making decisions for the first time about particular kinds of consumption patterns that are going to dictate our lives for the next number of years,' Ms Vertesi said. Prenatal items and maternity wear were all purchased in cash, in person, and though she and her husband tried to do that throughout the nearly nine months that the experiment has gone on for, some things were unavoidable. For the instances where online was the only option, they purchased Amazon gift cards in cash and then used the coupon codes to purchase baby-centric items online. Valuable: Internet marketing firms are able to sell data about pregnant women to interested companies for 150% more than their non-pregnant counterparts . As an extra precaution, they had said items shipped to a specially-purchased locker so that it couldn't be connected to her real address. When her husband went to get upwards of $500 in Amazon gift certificates to purchase their stroller, they ran into some slight legal trouble when he realized that New York laws dictate that Rite Aid has to report the 'excessive transactions' to the authorities since it is a practice associated with shadier dealings. Another darker twist came when she turned to Tor, an untraceable internet browser that has been associated with illegal dealings like that of drug dealers or bitcoin exchanges. 'Those kinds of activities, when you take them in the aggregate ... are exactly the kinds of things that tag you as likely engaging in criminal activity, as opposed to just having a baby,' she said.","Janet Vertesi is a sociology professor at Princeton and used her pregnancy to make a point about the excessive marketing geared towards mothers .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Congressman Michael Grimm has been charged with 20 criminal counts addressing different fraud allegations after turning himself in to FBI headquarters in Manhattan on Monday morning. The Republican representative from Staten Island has entered a not guilty plea to a U.S. Magistrate in connection to all 20 counts which include several fraud charges relating to a health food store that he ran before running for Congress. He is charged with mail fraud, wire fraud and tax fraud, all of which are connected to his involvement in an Upper East Side restaurant where he was an investor before launching into his political career in 2010. The lengthy indictment charges Grimm with two different types of fraud- mail and wire- as well as obstruction of justice, perjury, employing illegal immigrants, and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Scroll down for video . Facing charges: Congressman Michael Grimm turned himself in to the FBI this morning (pictured) after it became clear that they will be filing charges against him in connection to a restaurant he was involved in before being elected to Congress . Run in: Grimm was caught on camera in January threatening NY1 reporter Michael Scotto (left) when he was asked about the campaign finance investigation . The bulk of the crimes themselves took . place before he was a Congressman, and he is accused of concealing more . than $1million in receipts, as well as hundreds of thousands of dollars . that were kept away from employees. While helping run the Manhattan restaurant, Healthalicious, Grimm is accused of keeping two sets of payroll records. The one he turned over to the restaurant's accountants, who used them as the basis for their tax returns, showed lower payouts to employees than he was actually paying them- as he opted for cash payouts of either half or all of their earnings so that there was no trail. The perjury charge, however, comes from a deposition in January 2013 where he allegedly lied under oath. Past practices: Grimm, 44, has been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee since the fall pertaining to his campaign fundraising practices but today's charges are expected to be unrelated (pictured in January) Laying out their case: U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch is one of the prosecutors who came up with the 20 counts that Grimm now faces, focusing the investigation on his time before running for office . Dirty dealings: The prosecutors looked into his involvement with a health food restaurant on the Upper East Side called Healthalicious after former employees complained of getting less than minimal wage . The deposition came when former employees accused Grimm of paying them less than minimum wage. During that meeting, he reportedly said that he did not pay them in cash nor did he have access to an email account that investigators have linked him to. 'Rep. Grimm billed himself as a patriot and an American hero... but Rep. Grimm was anything but an upstanding citizen. He cheated, evaded and then lied,' said the head of the FBI's New York office George Venizelos. Grimm, 44, is familiar with the FBI headquarters as he worked for the agency for more than a decade before leaving in 2006. 'As . a former F.B.I. agent, Representative Grimm should understand the . motto: fidelity, bravery and integrity,'  F.B.I. assistant director . George Venizelos said in a statement. 'Yet . he broke our credo at nearly every turn. In this 20-count indictment, . Representative Grimm lived by a new motto: fraud, perjury and . obstruction.' Grimm was expected to turn himself in . at some point this morning, and the news of the Congressman's appearance . at the lower Manhattan headquarters was reported shortly after 8am. His case: The Republican congressman has been released on bond after entering a not guilty plea . To many, . his involvement with the restaurant was not the most expected source of . his legal troubles, as Grimm has been under investigation for months for . questionable fundraising practices relating to his congressional . campaigns. Grimm and his lawyers have maintained his innocence throughout. The restaurant was reportedly fined $88,000 for failing to adequately pay workers according to state wage laws. Last . week, Grimm's lawyer William McGinley made it clear that the . Congressman and his staff were well aware that federal prosecutors . intended to file criminal charges against him. 'We . are disappointed by the government's decision, but hardly surprised. From the beginning, the government has pursued a politically driven . vendetta against Congressman Grimm and not an independent search for the . truth,' Mr McGinley said. Connections: Grimm was an investor in this Upper East Side health food restaurant and someone related to the restaurant is believed to be the connection between the Congressman and his alleged campaign finance issues . 'After . more than two years of investigation plagued by malicious leaks, . violations of grand jury secrecy, and strong-arm tactics, the U.S. Attorney's Office has disclosed its intent to file criminal charges . against Congressman. 'Congressman Grimm asserts his innocence of any wrongdoing. When the dust settles, he will be vindicated.' The . House Ethics Committee publicly announced their investigation into . Grimm in the fall, stemming from the donations he received from . followers of an Israeli rabbi named Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto. Rabbi Pinto is believed to be one of the ten wealthiest rabbis in Israel though his base of global operations is New York. Grimm's . team admitted that their campaign received between $250,000 and . $300,000 from the rabbi's supporters- some of whom admitted to making . tens of thousands of illegal contributions. Investigation: Diana Drumond (right) who was previously in a romantic relationship with Grimm (left) was charged on Friday with lying to the FBI and making up false donors to illegally funnel his campaign money . Ofer Biton, who was the liason between Grimm and the rabbi's followers, pled guilty to an immigration fraud case in August and then three days later, the FBI filed a sealed criminal complaint against one of Grimm's former lovers for using straw donors to make illegal contributions. That woman, Diana Durand, was charged on Friday in relation to those accusations as well as an additional charge of making false statements to the FBI. The issue has been a sensitive one for the Republican, who was elected into office at the height of the Tea Party and relied heavily on the group's support during the 2010 race. He came under fire following the State of the Union this year when a reporter asked him about the campaign contribution investigation on camera. Grimm stormed off before returning and threatening to 'break (the reporter) in half' if he ever asked about the situation again.","Republican Congressman turned himself in to the FBI this morning .

"By . Lydia Warren . In 1938, London stockbroker Nicholas Winton decided to use his two weeks vacation to get to work. As violence began escalating against Jewish people in Europe, the 29-year-old traveled to Prague and ended up saving the lives of 669 children, mostly Jews, from almost certain death. Winton - now 104 - has spoken to CBS' 60 Minutes about his incredible story, which included theft, forging documents and even blackmailing officials to get his way. 'It worked, that's the man thing,' he said, grinning. Some of the children saved by Winton have also come forward to reveal they did not know that this humble man was responsible for rescuing them until five decades after. Scroll down for video . Heroic: Nicholas Winton, a former stockbroker from London, spent his 2 weeks vacation in 1938 saving hundreds of Jewish Czech children by organizing for them to be sent to England . As the Nazis marched into Czechoslovakia, Winton - who had no experience or connections in this sort of work - decided that he would travel to Prague to see if he could save people. He had actually booked a vacation to go skiing in Switzerland, but changed his plans at the last minute when a friend involved in Jewish refugee work asked him for help. 'All I knew was that the people that I met couldn't get out,' Winton, who was born to German Jewish parents in London, told CBS' 60 Minutes in a special interview. 'And they were looking of ways of at least getting their children out... I work on the motto that if something's not impossible, there must be a way of doing it.' Unassuming: Winton was 29 when he went to Prague and made a list of children to be saved . He set up shop in the city and people soon started coming to him, forcing him to work late into the night, historian David Silberklang told CBS. When he returned to London, he had lists of hundreds of children and got to task convincing the British authorities to take them. He pretended to be more official than he was by taking stationery from an established refugee organization, adding 'Children's Section' to its header and making himself chairman, CBS reported. He admitted it took 'a little smoke and mirrors' to convince authorities to believe him - but he said it mostly took getting a printing press to print the paper. He continued his work as a stockbroker by day, before returning to the office to work on getting the children to the UK. His mother and volunteers also helped at the office. He said he contacted American authorities to take the children, but they said they were unable. But British authorities said they would take them if Winton found each one a home, so he got to work advertising their pictures so that families would take them. When he had secured them homes, the youngsters were ready to leave - but he found that the British authorities were slow to issue their travel documents. Plot: He had no experience in such matters so when he got back to the UK, he got a printing press and forged headed paper saying he worked for the Children's Sections of the Committee for Refugees . Rescuer: Winton, pictured in Prague in 1938 with a young boy, kept his involvement quiet for 50 years . Desperate to help the children get out, he forged their documents and also paid off officials, he said. 'Took a bit of blackmail on my part,' he admitted. 'It worked. That's the main thing.' The first children left Prague on March 14, 1939 - just hours before German troops occupied Prague. Eventually, seven trains carried more than 600 children to Holland, where they caught ferries to England. The Nazis allowed them to leave, happy that the country was being 'cleansed' of Jews. Another train was scheduled to leave on September 1, but was stopped by the declaration of war. Winton said he has reason to suspect not many of those children survived. One of the children who did escape, Hugo Meisl, recounted the moment he was put on a train by his parents. Saved: Among the children saved were 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, left, and 10-year-old Hugo Meisl, right . Thankful: Alice, who now lives in Bethesda, Maryland, said she only heard Winton's name after 50 years . Survivor: Meisl said he was always hopeful that he would return home and find his parents . 'I remember that they told us that we were going to England maybe two or three months,' he said. 'It would be a holiday for us. And that they would join us very shortly thereafter...' But his parents never came for him, and their names are now painted on the walls of Prague's Pinkas Synagogue, where every Czech Jew who was murdered in the Holocaust is remembered. Also among the children was 14-year-old Alice Eberstark, now 88 and living in Bethesda, Maryland. She recounted her mother handing her items, including a delicate, embroidered nightgown, to take on the train when she left for England. She never saw her parents again. 'Many survivors feel guilty for having . survived - I feel very grateful to my parents,' she said. 'Our parents' courage, I think, is the most . important because most people said, ""We will go together or not at . all"".' After the war, Winton trained pilots for . the Royal Air Force, married, raised a family and lived comfortably. He . cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly. After the war, Winton married, cared for mentally handicapped people and built homes for the elderly . Recognized: He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2002 (pictured) and has been the subject of a film. Next month, his daughter is releasing a book about her father . But he hardly told anyone about what he had done. 'I didn't really keep it secret,' he told CBS. 'I just didn't talk about it.' But in 1988, his wife Grete found a scrapbook in their attic listing the names of the children, their parents and the families that had taken them. Later that year, the BBC learned about the story and he went on a show, where he met scores of the children he had saved. In 2002, he was knighted, and he was also celebrated in a documentary called 'Nicky's Family'. Next month, his daughter is releasing a book about her father. But he doesn't care for the attention. 'I'm not interested in the past,' he said. 'I think there's too much emphasis nowadays on the past and what has happened. And nobody is concentrated on the present and the future.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . A Bronx man was arrested after a motorist captured him hanging off the side of a speeding cab he tried to carjack early Monday morning. Matthew McCorkle, 27, hung on for dear life as the cab careened up the Bruckner Expressway as fast as 70 mph just after 2.00 a.m. Monday, witness Vlane Carter told MailOnline. McCorkle banged on the cab’s window while hanging on for dear life until jumping off and trying to steal another car, he was arrested a short time later, police sources said. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Just another Monday morning in the city: Matt McCorkle was seen by Vlane Carter hanging off the side of this cab on the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx . Fast and furious: McCorkle is shown hanging on for dear life as the cab speeds up the Bruckner Expressway . The man’s terrifying ride through the Bronx almost cost him his life. ‘The man’s feet was dragging on the ground and he almost fell twice,’ said Carter. ‘The man would have been dead if he fell at that speed, especially after being run over by other cars.’ Carter called the taxi driver reckless, and said he sped up every time the man’s feet hit the ground. McCorkle can be seen repeatedly banging and kicking the kick, begging it to stop, but the taxi driver sped on. ‘The taxi sped up to maybe 65, 70,’ Carter told WCBS. ‘I was, like, really getting nervous, because the guy was on the hood at this time, on the top of the car. Lucky to be alive: The thief's feet hit the ground several times on his journey up the highway . Fearing for his life: The driver said he sped off because he didn't know if the suspect had a knife or gun - 'my safety first' ‘Then he was on the back, then he was trying to break the glass with his hand, and then the car was swerving. So it was like a Hollywood movie, almost.’ Driver Mohammed Millogo told WCBS the would-be carjacker frightened him. ‘This guy tried to get in my car. If he got in my car or he’s going to try to – I don’t know what he can have,’ said the driver. ‘He can have a weapon. He can have a knife. Anything can happen to me – my safety first. ‘Then I called the police and even I slowed down for him because I don’t want him to get hurt.’ Carter also called the police, but McCorkle jumped off the cab when it hit traffic. The thief stole another car after pulling the driver out but crashed while trying to make a getaway, police said. More relaxed: McCorkle appears more relaxed at this moment, when the cab drove upwards of 60 mph up the highway . Cruising: McCorkle was somehow not injured during the death-defying ride, but he was eventually arrested . Authorities arrested him shortly after. He has been charged with driving while intoxicated, robbery and grand larceny. McCorkle is no stranger to the NYPD. Just last month he was charged with menacing and harassing a woman. He has been accused of a litany of other crimes in his criminal career including criminal possession of a stolen weapon and multiple drug charges, records showed. The criminal luckily suffered no injuries, but is being held without bail while undergoing a psychiatric evaluation.","Matthew McCorkle was seen by Vlane Carter hanging off the side of a taxi while trying to break the window to get in .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 04:22 EST, 1 March 2012 . A senior Scientologist, who says she was imprisoned and tortured by the controversial religion's tyrannical leadership, has reiterated her testimony in a damaging TV interview. Debbie Cook, who was one of Scientology's top brass executives before she quit in 2007, is involved in a legal wrangle with the Church, after sending a shock email denouncing the Chairman, David Miscavige. The message, which accused the chairman of hoarding and mismanaging funds, went out to 12,000 members just . minutes after midnight on New Year's Day. The Church immediately sought an injunction. But continued efforts to silence her appear to have backfired. Cook has now repeated claims that she made in court that she was held prisoner for 45 days in a crowded, ant-infested trailer in the California desert. Scroll down for video . Top brass: Debbie Cook was one of the organisation's most respected executives before she quit in 2007 . The 50-year-old claims that she was forcibly taken by two large men to 'the hole' a pair of double wide trailers at  Scientology International Base in the southern California desert. Cook told ABC News 'When I was there it had bars on the windows and security guards posted at the one door for entering and exiting. 'And this was where a number of executives from management level were held for varying lengths of time.' She was made to stand in a trash can while her captors poured water over her to elicit confessions, she claims. 'People screaming at you, sometimes slapping you, in some cases, sometimes you're made to stand in a trash can and water is poured over you.' She also repeated accusations directed at Scientology chairman . David Miscavige, a friend of celebrity follower Tom Cruise, who she says she saw punch . another senior executive in the face before wrestling him to the ground. She explained to ABC News: 'I've never seen anything like this before. It was inconceivable.' Prison: The 'hole' consisted of two double wide guarded trailers in the California desert, Debbie Cook claimed . Captive: The Scientology insider claims she was held at a place called 'the hole' at Scientology International Base in Southern California for seven weeks . 'Tyrannical': Mrs Cook claimed to have witnessed Scientology chairman David Miscavige (pictured) punch another senior executive in the face before wrestling him to the ground . He never hit her, but ordered his secretary to hit her so hard she fell to the ground, she told the station. The alleged attack came 'because he was displeased about how I was answering a question. It wasn't what he wanted to hear.' The former leader had previously made both allegations in court. In the ABC News interview, Cook said that her problem is not with the Church but with the current leadership. She said: 'I have never lost my passion or love for the church and all that it . stands for, and all that it does to help others,' Cook said. 'That is my . life and I loved doing it, so I'm not bitter. It's really out of that . passion and love and care that I am doing this to rid it of a situation . that has grown out of control â€¦ it needs to get confronted and it needs . to get handled. It can't go on. You know, I know that L. Ron Hubbard . would never approve of it.' But the continuing publicity adds to the embarrassment . for the Church, which took legal action to . prevent her from revealing the exact details its lawsuit has now allowed . her to expose in court.  They claimed breach of a confidentiality agreement she signed when leaving the Church in 2007. The organisation then suddenly withdrew from the legal proceedings after Mrs Cook's blistering testimony on the stand. Mrs Cook claimed in court that in the summer of . 2007 she was one of 100 Scientology executives imprisoned in a large . trailer known as The Hole. Describing the conditions, she said: 'It had bars on the windows and the one entrance was guarded by security 24 hours a day. 'The place was infested by ants, so . ants would crawl on you, and there was a two-week period when the . electricity had been shut off, as ordered by Mr Miscavige. This was of . course in summer in the desert so the temperature was about 106F [41C].' Mrs Cook described forced  'confession' sessions during which she stood in a dustbin for . two hours while water was poured over her head and abuse screamed in . her face. One senior executive who upset the Scientology leadership was made to lick a dirty floor for half an hour, she said. On the stand: Former senior Scientologist Debbie Cook tells a San Antonio, Texas, court how she was locked up, beaten and tortured by the controversial religion's tyrannical leadership . In her New Year's day email Cook accused Mr Miscavige of turning the Church . into a tyrannical regime in direct conflict with the doctrine laid down . by founder L Ron Hubbard in the 1950s. Writing under a banner of 'Keep . Scientology Working', Mrs Cook called out Mr Miscavige for 'hoarding' more than $1billion acquired through fundraising and then spending . millions on building unnecessary, lavish facilities that lie empty. The Church applied for an injunction, . claiming this email breached a confidentiality agreement she signed when . leaving the organisation with a $50,000 (Â£32,000) pay-off in 2007. But Mrs Cook told the court this had been signed under severe emotional duress, so broken was she after her treatment. She said: 'I would have signed that I stabbed babies over and over again and loved it. I would have done anything.' She claimed she was 'imprisoned' at a Florida compound during her final months with the Church. Actor and Scientologist Tom Cruise (left) hugs Church leader Mr Miscavige, who was labelled an autocrat in an email Mrs Cook sent to 12,000 worshippers . Followed everywhere she went, Mrs Cook said: 'I called my mother and told her if I wasn't out in three days to call the police.' In her New Year's email, Mrs Cook . confirmed her continued commitment to the Church and called on her . fellow worshippers to usher in an era of change. It is thought that the reason she . emailed thousands of worshippers was to get around the 'long and harsh' disciplinary action endured by those who question Mr Miscavige's . methods. She claimed it was her conscience that caused her to speak out. Mrs Cook was once a leading member of . Scientology's Sea Organisation before becoming a captain at its Flag . Service Organization spiritual headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. She . left that position a few years ago but remains a highly-respected member . of the Church. The Church has explained its reason for withdrawing its application for an injunction against Mrs Cook and her husband. A statement said: '[Its withdrawal] is . to preclude the court being used further as a forum for the defendants . to violate the rights of the Church and its members with more false and . disparaging statements.'

"By . Associated Press . and Francesca Chambers . Louisiana GOP Rep. Vance McAllister won't seek re-election this fall after being caught on video kissing a married female aide. He will, however, serve out the remainder of his term, which concludes the first week of January 2015. The recently elected Congressman said he would not resign because he did not want the people of his district to be left with a vacant seat again. Scroll down for video . Republican Rep. Vance McAllister, right,  who got caught on a security tape cheating on his wife Kelly, left, said Monday that he will not resign. He not seek re-election this fall, however . 'The past few weeks have been a trying time for my family,' McAllister said in a statement, according to POLITICO. 'As . I've said before, there's no doubt I've made a mistake. I've failed . those I care most about and let down the people who elected me to . represent them.' McAllister was elected fewer than six months ago after then-Rep.Rodney Alexander left Congress unexpectedly to take a job with Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal. A businessman with no political experience, McAllister won a special election in November 2013 to represent the districts, surprising the GOP by handily defeating the Republican establishment candidate. McAllister, his wife Kelly, far right, and their five children. Kelly said on Monday that she was behind her husband 100 percent . He put his family and his faith at the center of his campaign for Congress, appearing with his wife and their children in one commercial and vowing to 'defend our Christian way of life' if elected. To win the seat, McAllister largely self-financed his election bid and got a boost from endorsements by his most famous constituents, the bearded Robertson men of the cable television hit Duck Dynasty. The first-term Congressman's fledgling political career came came to an abrupt halt earlier this month a north Louisiana newspaper released a grainy security tape showing McAllister . kissing Melissa Peacock, an aide and family friend, in the congressman's . district headquarters. McAllister . apologized and Peacock resigned, along with the congressman's district . director who was suspected of releasing the video. But top Republican . officials in the state, including Jindal, called on the congressman to . step down. Disgraced Christian lawmaker Vance McAllister was caught on video in a steamy clinch with a female staffer. The video showed McAllister, a married father-of-five, kissing married staffer Melissa Peacock inside his darkened office . Peacock, 33, has since 'voluntarily resigned' from her position . The Louisiana Congressman has . stayed out of public sight since the scandal erupted, canceling events . for therapy sessions and saying he was spending time with his family . during Congress' Easter recess. Before boarding a plane for . Washington with his wife Kelly on Monday, McAllister told The News-Star he was 'committed to serving the 5th District to the best of my ability through . this term, but I also have to take care of my family as we work . together to repair and strengthen the relationship I damaged.' 'Our family is together and better and stronger than we were before,' he said. McAllister's wife told the news publication that she was committed to her relationship with her husband. 'I'm behind him 100 percent.' Top Republicans in the state, who had called McAllister's behavior embarrassing and hypocritical, welcomed McAllister's resignation. 'While . we still believe the best course of action would have been for . Congressman McAllister to resign so he can focus on his family, we are . pleased Congressman McAllister and constituents in the district can . begin the process of putting this unfortunate situation behind them,' GOP Gov. Bobby Jindal said in a statement. Likewise, . state Republican Party Chairman Roger Villere said that while he would . have liked to see McAllister 'close this chapter sooner, I was happy to . hear of his decision to do what is best for his family and his . constituents.' A spokeswoman for former Rep. Alexander, whose resignation forced the 2013 special election, said Monday he will not seek election to his old seat. State Rep. Robert Johnson, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for the seat against McAllister last year, continued to call for the congressman to resign on Monday, saying he has been neglecting his office's responsibilities during the scandal. 'He's not doing his job. He isn't communicating with other elected officials. He isn't communicating with his constituents. For all practical purposes, the people of our district are without representation in the United States Congress,' Johnson said in a statement.","Vance McAllister won a special election to Congress in November after then-Rep.

A mother has been praised for her inspirational open letter to an internet troll who branded her son, who has down syndrome, 'ugly'. Megan Mennes, from Houston, Texas, posted a picture of her son Quinn on Instagram after he was recovering from an illness. The photograph showed him playing happily in the garden with the caption: 'It's been a long week of illness for this one but it looks like he's finally on the mend.' However, she did not expect a cruel response from an internet troll. The person left a one-word comment underneath the photo which read 'ugly'. However, the proud mother was quick to respond and posted an open letter to the person who made the offensive comment. She wrote on her blog site: 'I don't want to make assumptions about you, but I can guess from your immaturity and ignorance that you know little about the helplessness that parents feel when caring for a sick infant with respiratory issues. 'Quinn was sick last week, but was feeling much better by Friday. 'We decided to sit in the backyard and soak up the sun after school. 'There aren't many things in this world more beautiful than seeing your recently-ill child light up in a smile, and I snapped a few photos to celebrate his recovery, then posted them on Instagram with the hashtag â€œ#downsyndrome. 'The fact that you find my child ugly is one thing. 'You are entitled to your opinion.

'It will not be the last time someone makes a joke at his expense, but to actively seek out actual people to tease goes beyond cruel. It's inhuman.

"By . Wills Robinson . Every day for 21 years, Billy Ray Wheelock woke up behind bars while the world outside moved on without him. So when the 51-year-old was granted clemency by President Obama, he decided to make up for what he had missed. After his release from a halfway house in Denver, Colorado, he refused to be 'free and unhappy', so he got married, had a Starbucks, got his hair cut and went for his first swim in nearly two decades. Free man: Billy Ray Wheelock walks away from a halfway house in Denver after serving 21 years in prison . Now he is on the 'other side of the wall' he is planning on starting a consulting service to help prisoners stay out of trouble and help them apply for clemency. After his release, he told the Denver Post: 'I never accepted my life sentence. I never got institutionalized because I never let the system be my life.' Mr Wheelock was 29-years old when he got life in prison for possession of and conspiracy to distribute 99.62 grams of crack cocaine. When he was jailed in 1992, sentencing laws were harsher because the substance was deemed to be dangerously addictive. He has been in custody ever since and and has been forced to watch his children grow into teenagers from the confines of his cell. 'I watched the world change, I saw TV and everything. I just wasn't a part of it,' he said. It took him under a minute to say his goodbyes to guards at the correctional facility and walk through a rusty gate to where his fiance, mother-of-two Berna Lang, 64, was waiting. Two days later the pair, who met on a Muslim dating website, tied the knot after being engaged for a year in Englewood, Colorado. He has moved into a small apartment with her and claims she won his heart because she accepted that 'life means life'. Tying the knot: After his release, he married Berna Lang, 64, who he met on a dating website, and enjoyed their first dance during the reception in Englewood, Colorado . The sentence will stay on his criminal record despite his release, but he claims the term handed to him by a Texas Court in 1993 was too harsh. He said: 'I would've still been in prison today if I had not been granted executive clemency. I'm not claiming innocence. 'I wasn't granted a pardon. I'm just saying the punishment I received wasn't warranted. It was overkill.' In his first five years, Obama has granted 40 out of 10,001 clemency and pardon petitions received. Mr Wheelock's successful application came after severe mandatory minimums enacted in 1986 for crack offenders were reduced in 2010. Testing the water: Still wearing his ankle monitor, he also took his first swim in nearly two decades . He did not know he was eligible to apply for clemency until 2005, after someone mentioned it in passing. So, in a bid to be released, he turned himself into a model inmate by enrolling in education programmes and staying out of trouble. He was told his application was successful in December, after the President said there had been a 'disparity' in his sentence. Obama shortened the terms of Wheelock and seven other men and women serving long prison terms for cocaine-related crimes. The President wrote: 'Commuting the sentences of these eight Americans is an important step toward restoring fundamental ideals of justice and fairness.But it must not be the last.' Yielding to changes in public perception, Congress and Obama in 2010 passed the Fair Sentencing Act that changed that formula to treat one gram of crack cocaine like 18 grams of powder. Congress is now considering the Smarter Sentencing Act of 2014 that would make reduced sentencing available to those convicted before the 2010 law change.

"By . Bianca London . Struggling to understand why you can't keep a fella? Well, is it because you always pinch his smokes, or you just don't know enough about current affairs? It could be if a vintage dating guide is to be taken seriously, in which a famous movie star of the era shares six top tips for 'enchanting a man'. The guide, penned by Hungarian-American actor and film director Cornel Wilde, is from the October 1950 issue of Woman's Own and sheds light on the dating game during that time. A 1950's guide to pulling: A hilarious extract from a 50s issue of Woman's Own outlines six ways to 'enchant a man' Cornel, described by the magazine as a . 'tall, dark and handsome film star', shares what Woman's Own said 'every . woman ought to know about enchanting a man.' In his article, Cornel says that the best quality to have, in his advice, isn't an 'exciting hat, exotic perfume or admirable circle of friends' but charm, which he says is what most men look for in a woman. He explains that charm makes a man feel 'wonderful' and that the little things, such as a warm smile, soft voice, taking interest in sport, considering a man's pocket and getting on well with their mother, are what enchants a man. He adds: 'Take care to be punctual. Please, that's so important because it really is the nicest compliment to the man you're meeting.' And it sounds like today's selfie craze and penchant for showing off online would not have gone down well with the fellas in the 50s as Cornel said:  'Above all, the charming and enchanting woman is the one who is completely natural.'I've seen women ruin any chance of . making the right impression simply because she is trying to impress him, . or, to put it more bluntly, showing off.' Top tips: In his article, movie star and director Cornel says that the best quality to have, in his advice, is charm, which he says is what most men look for in a woman . Cornel, who died in 1989 and was twice married and twice divorced, then goes on to outline his six top tips for enchanting a man, which he says will 'weave a spell tightly about a man and help towards making him entirely yours.' His first tip is being thoughtful and surprising your man with, for example, tickets to the theatre. He also shares his advice on how to react when a man asks you to meet his friends. 'A charming woman smiles sincerely, remembers names, finds out what kind of job the other person does, is genuinely interested in them,' he writes.

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Few women know as well as J.K. Rowling that the pen is mightier than the sword – but when it comes to fashion she has revealed little compares to the power of the stiletto. The Harry Potter author has spoken of her passion for shoes – the taller the better – and confessed herself no exception to the millions of women ‘obsessed’ by footwear. ‘Naturally. I’m not a pumps girl, I’m not a sensible flats girl’, Rowling, 48, said before speculating on ‘the power and myth of the shoe’, which she described as the most ‘mythologised, fetishised’ fashion item of all. Well-heeled: The Harry Potter author has often made public appearances in towering shoes. At the premiere of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, left, she wore towering Christian Louboutins, while at the Pride of Britain awards two years previously, right, she was seen in a commanding red-and-black pair . 'Power of the shoe': Rowling told Radio 4 that she was no exception to the women who were 'obsessed' by footware . Indeed, so caught up in the allure of the high heels is Rowling that, when offered a the chance to guest edit a Radio 4 programme, she dedicated a portion to exploring their history and literary significance. The light-hearted segment, which the 5ft 4in author commissioned as the first guest editor of Woman’s Hour, followed items on women’s rugby, medical research and her children's charity, Lumos. The piece saw two fashion experts recount the history of the high heel from an 18th-century horse-riding aid to the often-sexually-charged piece of footwear it is today. High society: Rowling's love of heels was also on show outside 10 Downing Street at a G20 Dinner, left, and in 2012 at an event at the Southbank Centre in London to promote her novel The Casual Vacancy . Introducing the segment, she said: ‘There are far more important things in life than shoes. But having said that, I like shoes and I have often wondered in a vague way why women are so obsessed with this particular item of clothing. ‘And I think it is undeniable that probably shoes do come first in the most mythologised, fetishised item list, I’d say. ‘So I thought this was a great opportunity to investigate that, and I thought how often shoes turn up in stories and fairy tales and why is that. What is the power and myth of the shoe?’ Rowling has shown off her taste for . daring heels before – she was pictured in towering, gold Christian . Louboutin shoes at the premier to Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince . in 2009, as well as a black and red pair at a 2007 awards ceremony. A shoe-in: Rowling poses left in 2006 before winning a British Book Award, and right when launching the Pottermore fan website in 2011 . A visit to the G20 Dinner at 10 Downing Street in 2009 also saw Rowling don an eye-catching silver pair, while at the British Book Awards in 2006 she paraded her heels on the red carpet before honing in on them as a mark of her success. She told the audience: ‘My first award was a Nibbie, but that night I was wearing much, much cheaper shoes.’ However, she admitted that – even for her – flats have their place. She said: ‘I do own some flat boots, because there does come a point when it gets a little bit ridiculous – you need to be able to walk the dog, and I do walk the dog, and I don’t do that in stilettos.’","Harry Potter author spoke of how millions are 'obsessed' by footwear .

"By . Darren Boyle . and Lucy Crossley . Pompeii has been brought back to life only to be destroyed again in a £60million epic film focussing on the last hours of the ancient Roman city. Director Paul WS Anderson toiled to make a historically accurate replica of the settlement for his recreation of the 79 A.D. Mount Vesuvius eruption which killed thousands, and buried Pompeii under layers of volcanic ash. The British filmmaker, 49, also studied volcanic eruptions and other disasters, including tsunamis, to ensure his new film, Pompeii - starring Keifer Sutherland and Game Of Thrones star Kit Harington - was a faithful rendering of the city's final hours. Scroll down for video . Accurate: Film director Paul WS Anderson hired a team of craftsmen to recreate Pompeii, only to destroy it again in his £60 million movie . Recreation: The filmaker used historical documents and archeological evidence as well as the latest scientific knowledge to inform his disaster movie . Inspiration: The director said he was particularly proud to have included a tsunami as part of the film as this was documented in an account of the disaster by Pliny . Under the instructions of Mr Anderson, with the help of an advising Roman historical expert, craftsmen faithfully recreated the city - right down to the details of the mosaics, wall paintings and hand-shaped cobblestones. Time was also taken to ensure that loaves of bread eaten by the characters were just like those preserved among the ruined city by the ash, and a fish stall in the film only sold the types eaten at the time of the eruption. Mr Anderson also hired a volcanologist to help with the film, studying active volcanoes and more recent natural disasters such as tsunamito ensure that his vision was not only entertaining, but also accurate. According to historical records, including an account by Pliny The Younger written 25 years after the event, Pompeii was not only subjected to the volcano but also an earthquake and a tsunami. Ruins: The ancient city of Pompeii as it looks today. Two-thirds of the 165-acre settlement has been uncovered by archaeologists . Findings: More than 1,000 casts made from impressions left by bodies as they were coated by ash have been recovered, giving historians a glimpse into life in Pompeii, and how the victims met their deaths . Pliny, who provided the first known account of the disaster, having seen the eruption from a distance, had described water being drawn out of the Bay of Naples, and Mr Anderson said this had led him to include the tidal wave in his film. 'I think what really fascinated me is that Pompeii was the greatest historical disaster of the ancient world and it had never really been put on a film correctly,' the director told I Am Rogue. 'There were three threats that hit Pompeii. There was the earthquake, the tsunami and then the pyroclastic surge when the volcano blew its top and Pompeii was buried for almost 2,00 years. I wanted to tell the true story of the disaster, a spectacular story. 'The fictitious part of the story is about the characters. But many of the characters are based on plaster casts of the people who were left. One of the most famous images is the two entwined lovers. I was facinated by that.' Precise: Filmmakers used laser scans of streets and houses and computer technology to ensure that building dimensions of the recreation were the same size as those destroyed almost 2,000 years ago . He . said that new computer technology, as well as his research, has enabled him to bring an authenticity to the disaster that . was not possible for earlier directors. Despite most moviegoers will be coming to the film in the knowledge that Pompeii will be wiped out, Mr Anderson said there is still enough action and drama in his epic to to keep people guessing. The director, who was born in Wallsend, Tyneside, the home of the eastern end of Hadrian's Wall, said some characters survived the disaster despite the widespread destruction. When the volcano erupted, a cloud of ash and stones was thrown into the air, some 20 miles high, as well as molten rock and pumice spewed out over the course of two days. It is thought the blast released one hundred thousand times the thermal energy released by the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945, and an estimated 16,000 people were killed. More than 1,000 casts made from impressions left by bodies as they were coated by ash have been recovered, giving historians a glimpse into life in Pompeii, and how the victims met their deaths - including the 'lovers' who inspired Mr Anderson. 'A lot of what you see is real. The actors are in there with the flames and ash. Unpleasant for them, . but very realistic,' he told The Observer. Mr Anderson, who is married to model and actress Milla Jovovich, said that one thing he was particularly proud of was the inclusion of the tsunami as part of the disaster as this had been documented in the ancient texts. Lovers: One of the inspiration behind the film was a pair of casts left by the bodies of two entwined lovers . Performance: Actor Kiefer Sutherland stars in the historical epic which is a joint UK Canadian production . Doomed: Despite most moviegoers will be coming to the film in the knowledge that Pompeii will be wiped out, Mr Anderson said there is still enough action and drama in his epic to to keep people guessing . Rising star: The film also features Kit Harington, pictured, who plays Jon Snow in Game of Thrones . His team spent six years researching the doomed city, using laser scans of streets and houses and computer technology to ensure that building dimensions of the recreation were the same size as those destroyed almost 2,000 years ago. Mr Anderson said that he also wanted to show how sophisticated life in Pompeii had been prior to the explosion, pointing to the fact that many Roman buildings enjoyed underfloor heating and fresh water plumbed into peoples' homes. 'They really were an incredibly technologically advanced society, and yet, in the face of Mother Nature, it just didn't mean anything,' he said. According to the IMDB database the movie had a £60 million budget and made £6 million during its opening weekend in the US.

"By . Joel Christie . The veil was made from ribbon and tulle from the gift shop, wedding music played from an iPod through borrowed speakers and an elastic hair tie from one of the nurses was strung around the bride's wrist to signify 'something blue'. A North Mississippi couple have been treated to a special wedding after almost three decades together thanks to the generosity of some hospital staff and in light of some grave circumstances. Annie Turner was diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer five months ago and, having spent 28 years with her partner Charles Nicholson, decided the time was finally right to say their 'I do's'. 'He asked me a long time ago, but I said no,' Annie told WMC TV. Wedded bliss: After 28 years with her partner, Charles Nicholson, cancer patient Annie Turner decided there was no other time like the present to get married, and did so from her hospital bed at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Oxford, North Mississippi . Annie was pushed from her room and down the hall to the lobby where her groom was waiting. The whole service was planned by hospital staff who had been 'touched' by the couple . The ring symbolizes Annie's hope for the future despite her grave illness. She is battling terminal cervical cancer . 'He had been so good to me all those years. 'He asked me again, and I said yeah.' But as Mr. Nicholson tried to make arrangements for the nuptials, he couldn't get any confirmation about when his bride-to-be would be discharged from Baptist Memorial Hospital in Oxford, with doctors saying her status was 'day-to-day'. As word of their wishes spread on April 10, many members of the Baptist staff expressed a desire to help the couple plan their special day. During Annie's hospital stay, the pair made an impression on many — from nurses to patient-care associates to social workers. 'They’re just really sweet, humble people,' head nurse Brittney Goolsby told Hotty Toddy. 'She never imagined anyone would want to do something like this for her. It made us want to do it for them that much more.' 'Life happened and they never had the chance to get married. 'They just wanted to make that commitment to each other.' Charles Nicholson sits by his bride Annie Turner, surrounded by the hospital staff that planned their special ceremony . When the pair agreed to be married in the hospital, the staff excitedly started planning the occasion - for the next day. The gift shop prepared the veil and lent some speakers, staff members purchased a delicate shawl and arranged for a bouquet and a boutonniere. The bride’s Baptist caregivers served as her attendants, helping her get ready for the ceremony. After being contacted by the hospital, an employee at the Yalobusha County Courthouse volunteered to drive the marriage license to Oxford after she finished work for the day. She arrived with the legal document around 7 p.m. With the last piece in place, the ceremony could begin. As the music started, Annie was pushed from her room, down the hall, and into the fifth-floor lobby, where her groom, their son and the hospital chaplain were standing ready. The hospital gave Annie this wedding gift - a gold necklace with the letter 'C' engraved it on it for her husband, Charles . The bride of course carried a beautiful bouquet of flowers . 'We are still talking about it how nice it was, just the way (the staff) put their hearts into it,' Mr. Nicholson said. 'It was just uplifting, especially for her.' The vows were toasted with raspberry lemonade and the newly-married couple cut a strawberry cake - Annie's favorite - prepared by the cafeteria. As a gift, staff bought the bride a necklace with a charm marked with the letter 'C' for Charles. Not long after the wedding, Annie Turner Nicholson was moved to a rehab facility in Water Valley, where her husband stays by her side. 'I’ll never be able to be grateful enough,' Mr. Nicholson said.","Annie Turner was diagnosed with terminal cervical cancer five months ago .

"By . Sean Poulter . Virtual: Cash is being used less and less and banks keep developing new, easy ways of using debit cards . Cash is being killed off by the banks as they push customers to switch to cards, automated payments and a new service which is linked to mobile phone numbers. Notes and coins now account for only £17.99 of every £100 spent, down by £3.03 on a year ago, according to the Halifax. The banks are keen to push for the demise of cash and cheques because these are much more expensive for them to transport, handle, count and process than electronic payments. From today they will also put further pressure on cash with the launch of a service that allows quick electronic payments to be made using mobile phone numbers linked to current accounts. Called Paym, it is backed by all the high street banks and initially will be available to 30million people before being extended to nine out of ten accounts by the end of the year. However, virtual money is not universally welcomed by customers, because many do not trust banks to ensure the electronic payments system is reliable and secure. There have been a number of instances in recent years of customers being locked out of their bank accounts and blocked from using cards at tills by serious bank IT failures. Banks and stores have also made it increasingly difficult for customers to use cheques, banning them from many petrol  stations and supermarkets, while energy firms impose charges on those who pay using cheques. In time, this pattern is likely to be repeated for cash. However, the Halifax director of personal current accounts, Anthony  Warrington, insisted such change is being led by customers rather than the industry. ‘Cash continues to decline as more customers prefer the convenience of paying on plastic and automated payments,’ he said. Convenient? Halifax claims the gradual move away from cash is driven by customers favouring convenience . The Halifax figures show debit cards account for £28.87 in every £100 of spending, direct debits for £19.90, cash for £17.99, so-called ‘faster payments’, which covers internet and smartphone transactions, for £12.81, cheques £11.28, standing orders £7.82 and other bill payments at £1.34. The Paym service – pronounced ‘pay em’ – has been described as the first industry-wide collaboration in the UK which could potentially link up every bank account with a mobile number. It will allow cash to be transferred . on a mobile by using the recipient’s phone number rather than a bank . account number and sort code. The system will be integrated into . customers’ existing mobile banking apps. Generally, . users will be able to transfer up to £250 a day. Those who want to . receive money will need to register their mobile number with a current . account. The Payments Council, which is overseeing the initiative, said: ‘Paying someone back just got easier for millions of people.’ However, research by Consumer Intelligence shows half the population – 47 per cent – have no intention of using it. The majority of these – 71 per cent – had concerns about security, while  39 per cent were worried what would happen if their phone were stolen and 32 per cent had fears about paying the wrong person. David Black of Consumer Intelligence said: ‘It’s clear the banking industry has a job to do to educate customers that mobile payments are a safe and consumer-friendly development.’ Barclays already operates a mobile phone payments service called ‘Pingit’. Another scheme, called Zapp, is set for launch this autumn, while PayPal, the internet payment specialist owned by eBay, has its own system. Initially, Paym can be used by Halifax, Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC, Santander, Bank of Scotland, TSB, Cumberland Building Society and Danske Bank customers. A voluntary industry code will help people who accidentally send money to the wrong account to get it back, but there is no guarantee of a refund. If you're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching, there are plenty of incentives to move.This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are. Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit. First Direct pays . £100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, . the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a . further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 . months. The Co-op, too, has introduced a £100 cash incentive for new customers. It will also donate £25 to charity on your behalf.

"By . John Hall . Modernisers: David Cameron has been urged to abandon the 'futile' war on drugs by a Tory think-tank . David Cameron has been urged to abandon the 'futile' war on drugs by a group of Conservative party modernisers who think reform would appeal to young and ethnic minority voters. Among plans put forward by the influential Tory think-tank Bright Blue is the partial legalisation of drugs in the twin hope it attracts a new generation of voters to the Conservatives, while also saving the country millions of pounds in policing costs. Bright Blue is backed by senior ministers including Theresa May, Francis Maude and the former minister Andrew Mitchell, and is well-known for its relatively liberal, modernising policy ideas. The proposal to make partial legalisation a key pledge in next year’s general election manifesto is outlined by an article in the Independent newspaper today. It is likely to be the most controversial element proposal among several put forward by Bright Blue in a report titled The Modernisers’ Manifesto. Others reportedly include abolishing universal winter fuel . payments and excluding students and highly skilled workers from the . Government’s net migration target. It also suggests introducing a . requirement for new teachers to have at least a 2:1 degree in core . subjects and abandoning automatic pay rises for doctors and nurses. The idea of partial legalising some drugs reflects a growing international trend following the legalisation of cannabis in a number of U.S. states. The Liberal Democrats have already expressed a desire to overhaul Britain's laws on drugs, with several Labour members voicing their support for the plans. Change: The idea of partial legalising some drugs reflects an international trend following the legalisation of cannabis in a number of U.S. states. In this photograph a man smokes cannabis in Colorado . The Independent quoted Ryan Shorthouse, director of Bright Blue, as saying it was important for the Conservative modernisers to join the Lib Dem and Labour and enage in the debate. 'What is clear is that much more needs to be done on the development of drugs policy in the UK as the current situation is both economically and socially damaging,' he said. 'We believe that the Conservatives at the next election need to be seen to be taking on the big, difficult issues facing society and not be distracted by the Ukip agenda of Europe and immigration,' Mr Shorthouse added.","Influential Bright Blue think-tank urges Prime Minister to rethink drug policy .

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A dog stolen from the backyard of a Milwaukee home, burned over most of her body and then left in the cold received a skin graft surgery on Monday involving pigskin â€” a procedure usually done only in humans. The 5-year-old black Chihuahua mix, named Beatrice, was snatched March 13 and found 11 days later outside a casino with burns over 90 percent of her body. Her whiskers and eyebrows were also singed. The hourlong surgery performed Monday involved putting pigskin over the dog's burns to let them heal. It will eventually come off. Helping man's best friend: Beatrice the dog underwent skin graft surgery on Monday after turning up outside a casino with burns to 90 per cent of her body . The foot-long piece of pigskin was donated, as was the time of Dr Marla Lichtenberger, a veterinarian, and Dr John Weigelt, a surgeon from Froedtert Memorial Lutheran Hospital and the Medical College of Wisconsin. Lichtenberger estimated it would have cost around $4,000 if the services and skin weren't donated, on top of the owner's estimated $5,000 in vet bills. Lichtenberger, of Milwaukee Emergency Center for Animals in Greenfield, said people wanted to help because they were moved by the dog's story. 'Everyone has this sense of love for something that just isn't fighting back and has no fight back and has no say because they can't talk, they can't get away, they can't do anything,' Lichtenberger said after the surgery. She has never used pigskin before for burns and said she has been unable to find any reports of anything similar on dogs. Dr Weigelt says they will monitor Beatrice's condition over the next 10-14 days. Right now, I am a lot more hopeful than I was two weeks ago,' Dr Weigelt told Fox 6. Revolutionary surgery: Veterinarians believe this was the first time a dog has received grafts of pigskin. Beatrice is pictured above with Dr Marla Lichtenberger on Monday . Earlier this month, Milwaukee police said they had identified a 21-year-old man they think is responsible for burning Beatrice. He's being held in the Waukesha County jail on unrelated charges. The Milwaukee County district attorney is still considering charges. Beatrice's owner, Karen Burns, 61, said she had let Beatrice and her two miniature Doberman pinchers out March 13, but had called one back. While tending to that dog in the house, she heard Beatrice bark twice and her other dog 'go crazy.' She looked out and Beatrice was gone. Beatrice will need wound care and additional skin grafts to heal completely, Weigelt said in a statement. It will take days to figure out of the surgery worked. Beatrice pictured above on March 24 after the attack . The idea of the pigskin came up after Lichtenberger asked a friend at Froedtert for advice 'out of sheer frustration that her skin wasn't healing,' she said. Only about 40 per cent of the burn skin had healed. Burns was hopeful the surgery would help. 'She is not completely defeated by this,' Burns said. 'She's still got a good spirit.' Even so, she hasn't been acting normally at home, Burns said, and at least one of her other dogs seems to know Beatrice needs extra care. 'The male of the two has been giving her licks and he has been cleaning her ears for her,' she said. Animal Fairy Charities is raising money to help with Beatrice's medical bills.","Beatrice, a Chihuahua-mix, was snatched on March 13 and turned up 11 days later at a casino with burns to 90 per cent of her body .

"By . Bianca London . With the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's time in Sydney well behind us, it's time to muse on Kate's impeccable Royal Tour wardrobe and celebrate her evolving style from girl-next-door to a very modern - and stylish - princess. Now one of the most famous women in the world, the last three years have been a time of huge change for the former Kate Middleton - so could it all be down to one lady? Introducing Natasha Archer. Natasha - or Tash as she is fondly known within the royal circle - has been helping Kate remodel her style. Who's that girl? Natasha Archer - or 'Tash' as she is fondly known within the royal circle - is described as a Kensington Palace PA but has reportedly been helping revamp the Duchess of Cambridge's wardrobe . Natasha, also described as a 'Kensington Palace PA', was part of Kate’s close entourage on tour and, according to Grazia, has been helping Kate, 32, look more 'regal' as per the Queen's request. Natasha first caught the world's attention last July when she was one of the only people - aside from the Royal family - seen entering the Lindo Wing after the birth of Prince George. The PA, who studied Hispanic Studies at King's College London, was seen carrying a dress bag and baby car seat, leading the world to question whether she hand-picked the now iconic blue and white polkadot dress that Kate stepped out in. She was also spotted landing in Wellington, New Zealand with Kate’s hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, as the royal family embarked on the first leg of their tour last fortnight. Part of the crew: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attended a rugby union match in Sydney on Saturday and Natasha was by Kate's side . Close confidante: The source revealed that Natasha and Kate get on very well and the PA has reportedly always supported and advised Kate . Natasha has reportedly been helping Kate with her outfit choices since last summer. A source told the fashion magazine: 'Natasha’s main role is as a PA, but over the last few months she has assisted Kate as a style adviser. 'Natasha and Kate get on very well. She has always supported and advised Kate - and the Duchess loves Natasha’s style, so it seemed like an obvious appointment. Natasha has been helping Kate pick outfits for the tour.’ The source also added that Natasha orders lots of clothes - particularly from Topshop and Asos - online for Kate. Royal entourage: Natasha, second from front,  was seen carrying clothes as she arrived at Wellington Airport on April 7 at the start of the Royal Tour . First spot: Natasha was seen last July entering Lindo Wing after the birth of Prince George with Kate's hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, right . And it seems that with Natasha's . advice, Kate, who has worn outfits by the likes of Emilia Wickstead, . Erdem, Alexander McQueen, Jenny Packham and Roksanda Illincic throughout the tour of Australia and New Zealand, has . dressed to impress. Australia's top fashion designers have . heaped huge praise on the Duchess of Cambridge's royal tour wardrobe - despite her snubbing all but one of them. Classic . designer Carla Zampatti - who has met the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince . Edward, Prince Charles and Diana - applauded Kate's 'wonderful taste' and the fact she was a 'hard working royal', as she attended a reception . for the Royal couple at Parliament House, Canberra. Ms Zampatti even went so far as to label the 32-year-old 'the best promotion of the fashion industry' she can think of. Royal dresser: Natasha apparently helped select Kate's Royal Tour outfits - like this elegant white Lela Rose cocktail dress she wore on her last night in Sydney . Dazzling Duchess: The Duchess has worn dresses by the likes of Jenny Packham, left, and more high street options such as this L.K. Bennett dress, right . And it isn't just the designers praising Kate's style - it seems the general public love it, too. The 'Kate Effect' was in full force . after the Duchess of Cambridge stepped out in a Diane Von Furstenberg . wrap dress for the second day of the royal couple's visit to Australia. Kate . wore a £292 new season blue and white patterned wrap dress from the . high-end designer to visit the Blue Mountains town of Winnmalee, just . outside of Sydney. The 31-year-old is . known for making fashion fly off the shelves as fans aim to emulate her . style, but the blue and white wrap dress sold out at a particularly . surprising speed of just eight minutes, according to fashion website Go Fug Yourself. Celebrity stylist, Jade Elliott, says she has it spot on: 'Kate's graduated from princess finishing school - no more . student chic, she's a ""royal"" - its official!' His wife may be better known as a . style icon but it seems that Prince William spent his time in New Zealand and Australia trailblazing a new trend - . and he probably isn't even aware. While . all eyes were on the Duchess of Cambridge's dazzling dresses, her . husband William was  quietly championing the hottest new hipster . trend: normcore. Plain . tees, comfortable shoes, understated anoraks and dad jeans are . apparently no longer simply tolerated by the fashion community, they are . applauded. Bland, it appears, is the new black and just blending in with the crowd a la Prince William is totally en vogue. Prince of style: William has been adhering to the 'normcore' trend of scruffy trainers and chinos during his time in New Zealand - but is it just a coincidence? A hybrid of the words 'normal' and 'hardcore', The Telegraph's Ellie Pither outlines the normcore rules. She . writes: 'The normcore uniform is as follows: Teva sandals (those . foam-soled sandals with Navajo patterned velcro straps); Patagonia . waterproof jackets; New Balance trainers; white athletic socks; boxy . stonewash mum-cut jeans; Uniqlo roll-necks; beige Gap chinos.' And . it seems that William, 31, has got the look spot on - save for his . Onitsuka trainers, which could be replaced by some on-trend all-black . New Balance or Air Max - and voila: Prince normcore. Catwalk worthy: Karl Lagerfeld sent Cara Delevingne (left) and Kendall Jenner down his Chanel runway in an understated look . Trendsetters: Cara Delevingne (left) and Rihanna . are firm fans of the normcore trend - a style Cara has been championing . since she hit headlines . Normcore seems to have emerged as an . offshoot of fashion's love affair with all things Nineties. Marc . Jacobs . and Prada both created high fashion versions of Teva hiking sandals for . spring 2014, Topshop is selling 'mum' jeans and even Chanel . sent models, including Cara Delevingne and Kendall Jenner, who both . embrace the trend in their downtime, down a supermarket aisle clad in . sweatpants and sneakers. The result is that brand-less . stonewash denim, nondescript zip-up tops and bulky white trainers have . suddenly become cool, and lining shelves at stores from Acne and APC to . Madewell and ASOS. Even President Barack Obama is being hailed as a style icon for the normcore set. Normcore originals: Jerry Seinfeld's Nineties attire defines the emerging new trend for all things bland .

Best foot forward: High-fashion interpretations . of Teva hiking sandals were seen at the spring 2014 shows in September, . including Marc Jacobs (left) and Prada (right) Fashion . writer and blogger Simon Glazin isn't, however, convinced that William . is on trend and his New Zealand wardrobe is just a coincidence. He said: '""Normcore"", ""American tourist"", call it what you will, but really it's nothing new. 'This . is the ""trend"" (I use inverted commas because quite frankly I can't . bring myself to call it something fashion noteworthy) that A-listers . like Ashton Kutcher have been trying to make cool for a long time. 'By all means men, wear chinos with . trainers and an Oxford shirt, it can be a ""cool"" look, but I think in . William's case it's more accidental style than anything else' 'Do we actually think William wakes up . in the morning, splashes some royal water over his face, looks into his . wardrobe and says to himself: ""How can I age myself by 40 years today?"" 'No. It's more tradition with him than anything else. As next in line to the . throne, and with his dad as his style icon, he needs to remain . ""vanilla"". 'Harry . pushes things a bit further by a) wearing no clothes at all, and b) actually looking good most of the time in what he does chose to put on. 'By . all means men, wear chinos with trainers and an Oxford shirt, it can be . a ""cool"" look, but I think in William's case it's more accidental style . than anything else.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Avoidable tragedy: Gillian Astbury, 66, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in 2007 after a fall but died when nurses failed to note that she was diabetic . Scandal-hit Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust has been fined £200,000 for the 'avoidable' death of a 66-year-old diabetic who was not given insulin due to poor record-keeping. Gillian Astbury lapsed into a fatal diabetic coma while being treated for a fractured arm and pelvis at Stafford Hospital in April 2007. She was put under the care of a team of nurses who did not bother to read her medical notes and failed to realise she needed regular doses of insulin. The NHS Trust, which pleaded guilty to breaching health and safety law last October, apologised for its 'dreadful' care of Mrs Astbury. Sentencing, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave blasted the 'effectively broken' system of handovers, reiterating that the tragedy was 'wholly avoidable'. The responsibility, he added, lay with the senior managers at the Trust, who have all since left. He told Stafford Crown Court: 'This was a wholly avoidable and . tragic death of a vulnerable patient who was admitted to hospital for . care but died because of the lack of it. 'As . repeated investigations have revealed, there was a systemic failure at . Stafford Hospital in relation to two of the most basic tenets of patient . care: proper hand-overs between nursing shifts, and proper . record-keeping. 'These failures put legions of patients at Stafford Hospital at serious risk. 'The simple fact is that Mrs Astbury died because she was not given the insulin that she needed.' The Trust was ordered to pay £200,000, plus £20,000 costs. During the trial it emerged that there was just one senior nurse in charge of 84 beds at the time, following a cost-cutting programme by bosses. The court heard Mrs Astbury suffered a catalogue of errors in three different wards. She was assessed on arrival in 2007 and described as a ‘brittle’ Type-1 diabetic, who needed daily injections of insulin to control her blood sugar. Sentenced: The scandal-hit Trust was today fined £200,000 after pleading guilty to health and safety breaches . However, the chart monitoring her blood glucose level was not completed for several days, a referral to a dietician was never acted on, forms were not signed by senior staff, and the ambulance crews’ record – containing key information – was never attached to Mrs Astbury’s medical notes. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said responsibility for the failures lay with senior managers at the Trust. His remarks follow a public inquiry which found the Trust 'routinely' neglected of patients between 2005 and 2009. The judge said: 'The underlying causes of the breaches and the malaise were fundamental organisational and managerial failures, which can be traced to the very top of the organisation.' The court heard that the hospital had undergone radical change since Mrs Astbury’s death. The entire senior management in post at . the time of the death no longer work at the Trust, which is set to be . dissolved later this year. Peter Galsworthy, the Health and Safety Eexecutive’s head of operations in the West Midlands, said: 'Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust failed to implement a proper handover system, or to oversee the proper completion of nursing records and the monitoring of care plans. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave told Stafford Crown Court the senior managers at the Trust were responsible . 'In doing so, they put Gillian Astbury at risk. 'The Trust’s systems were simply not robust enough to ensure that staff consistently followed principles of good communication and record keeping. Gillian’s death was entirely preventable. She just needed to be given insulin. 'We expect lessons to be learned across the NHS to prevent this happening again.' Jeff Crawshaw, deputy chief executive of Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'On behalf of the Trust, I want to again express our deepest and most sincere apologies to Mrs Astbury’s family for the unacceptable care she received at Stafford Hospital in 2007. 'Today marks the final stage in what has been a thorough and long-running investigation into the failings which led to her tragic death. 'From the very beginning, we have acknowledged the failings in Mrs Astbury’s care, and we have never shied away from our responsibility for what happened to her. 'It has been recognised by all sides in this distressing case that our Trust is a very different and much better organisation now than it was when this tragedy occurred.'","Gillian Astbury fell into fatal coma while being treated for fractures .

"By . John Hall . Temperatures are set to plummet over the Bank Holiday weekend, falling to as low as -3C as a blast of cold air moves in from the Arctic and potentially lasts for up to a fortnight. Forecasters say that parts of Britain will experience heavy overnight frosts, with the North facing a windchill factor of -5C and the potential for snow on hilltops by the end of the week. The impending cold snap follows one of the mildest winters in recent years, although the wettest January for 250 years led to widespread flooding - particularly in the South-West. Cold: Frosty scenes like this in south London's Richmond Park could return as a blast of cold air moves in from the Arctic and potentially lasts for up to a fortnight . Speaking to the MailOnline, Met Office spokesman Simon Partridge said high pressure building up in the North would cause rainfall, although the Bank Holiday weekend itself is expected to be dry. Colder air will begin moving down from the North on Wednesday, reaching southern England by the weekend and causing heavy frosts, he added. 'In fact we've been telling gardeners over the last few days that they should move new or vulnerable plants indoors if possible,' Mr Partridge said. Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather, told the Express: 'We are looking at northerly flow of air coming in from the Arctic. With windchill this could push thermometers as low a -5C.' 'Temperatures are going to sink decidedly below average for the time of year, with the risk of very sharp frosts and a cold and bracing Bank Holiday next Monday'. Enjoying the weather: The impending cold snap follows one of the mildest winters in recent years . Pleasant: The predicted cold snap contradicts forecasts from earlier in the month that said Britain was set for a six-week heatwave from the end of April and into May . 'This is certainly looking like the last taste of winter and it could hold out like this for at least the next week and perhaps up to two,' he added. The predicted cold snap contradicts forecasts from earlier in the month that said Britain was set for a six-week heatwave from the end of April and into May. A Met Office report read: 'Latest predictions for UK-mean temperature favour above-average temperatures for April and April-May as a whole.' The warm conditions had been expected to bring a quarter of a million visitors to the South-West - providing a Â£54million boost for local businesses that were badly hit by flooding earlier in the year.","Arctic winds are expected to hit Scotland and the North by Wednesday .

"By . Leon Watson . Prime Minister David Cameron's brother Alex claimed today a major fraud trial should be thrown out - because of legal-aid reforms . Prime Minister David Cameron's barrister brother claimed today a major fraud trial should be thrown out because of legal-aid reforms introduced by his sibling's government. Alex Cameron QC, who is representing seven defendants free of charge, argues that his legally aided clients could not find barristers 'of sufficient competence'. Scott Crawley, 35, is said to have masterminded a £5million scam between 2008 and 2011 through the firms Plott UK, European Property Investments (EPI) and Stirling Alexander. He is accused alongside Daniel . Forsyth, 30, Ross Peters, 27, Aaron Petrou, 46, Ricky Mitchie, 24, Adam . Hawkins, 28, and Brendan Daley, 38, of conspiracy to defraud. Mr Cameron does not represent Mr Forsyth. The . eighth defendant, solicitor Dale Walker, 53, is facing fraud charges . and an allegation of money laundering in relation to the case. The . charges arose out of Operation Cotton, a Financial Conduct Authority . investigation into the activities of the land banking firms. All . three firms involved have now been wound up, either voluntarily or in . the face of civil proceedings brought in the last two years by the FCA. Today, Mr Cameron asked for the prosecution to be stopped, blaming the situation created by legal-aid cuts. He told Southwark Crown Court: 'The . issue before the court today comes down, it seem to us, to this - . whether the court accedes to the defence application, that the case . should be stayed, or whether it accedes to the Crown's response to that, . that there should be an adjournment... of eight months until January. 'The . problem of lack of adequate representation or potential lack of . adequate representation has been apparent since at least, we would . submit, 14 November, 2013. 'The . state has failed to provide adequate representation to enable the trial . to take place today, or indeed in this window, and it is now agreed . that a trial cannot take place without adequate representation.' Mr Cameron said there appeared to be no available lawyers of 'sufficient competence and skill'. He said the title 'Queen's Counsel' was 'a kite-mark' of quality but that not enough could be found, who . were willing to for the Public Defender Service. Nor could independent barristers be found, since they are refusing to work under current legal-aid rates. Mr Cameron asked for the prosecution to be stopped, blaming the situation created by legal-aid cuts . 'At the moment we understand that there is only one identified silk available at the moment to conduct this trial, were it adjourned until January.' He added: 'Two unidentified silks' might be available later in the year, but this was still inadequate. Something has to give. 'What we submit is that in this case, the state has known about the problem, hasn't addressed the problem... so that it's now forced to ask for an adjournment.' David Cameron's Government has overseen wholesale reform to the legal aid system, leading to dismay from the Criminal Bar . Mr Cameron said the Crown wished to put the case 'on the never-never'. But he made clear he was concerned with the broader implications of the argument. 'We do attribute the fault to the state more widely,' Mr Cameron said. 'The problem is this case is not the only case that has this problem. 'At the moment there is a finite resource [of barristers] and too much capacity required. 'Is the position going to be that this case should swallow up the available silks...so that these other cases are adjourned or stayed?' Prosecutor Ben Emmerson QC replied: 'The situation that now faces the court is an unusual one. 'A stay is not an appropriate order and certainly never [is], when there is an alternate remedy available. 'Neither of the standard categories of abuse [of process] apply.' Mr Emmerson made clear that a recipient of legal-aid 'is not entitled to a choice of representation'. Judge Anthony Leonard QC asked whether a defendant may be entitled to choose from a 'pool' of barristers instead. Mr Emmerson replied there was nothing in the jurisprudence to support this idea. The Justice Secretary, Chris Grayling, has overseen wholesale reform to the legal aid system, leading to dismay from the Criminal Bar. Barristers and solicitors have already been hit with 30 per cent fee cuts in the most serious cases, prompting walk-outs and demonstrations. Further reforms are set to introduce a two-tier contracting arrangement that vastly reduce the amount of law firms able to claim taxpayer funding. Mr Grayling has previously said: 'As everybody knows this government is dealing with an unprecedented financial challenge and I have no choice but to look for the savings I have to make across the full range of the MoJ's work. 'I cannot exempt legal aid from this, but that doesn't mean I don't understand how challenging these reductions will be. 'Legal aid is a vital part of our justice system but we must ensure it is sustainable for those who need it, for those who provide legal services as part of it and for the taxpayer, who ultimately pays for it.' Crawley, of Beckenham, Kent, Forsyth, of Bromley, Peters, of Penge, south London, Petrou and Mitchie, both Orpington, Kent, Walker, of Brighton, Daley, Chislehurst, Kent, and Hawkins, of New Eltham, are all facing charges of conspiracy to defraud and carry on a regulated activity when not authorised. Walker faces a separate charge of money laundering. The hearing continues.

"By . Katy Winter . You can't buy me love, goes the song - but it appears that money, or lack of it, can keep you in a dead relationship. Nearly one in five people in the UK say they have had to sustain a romance for longer than they wanted because they could not afford to break it off. A new poll has found that nearly a fifth (19 per cent) of adults have at some stage in their lives remained with a partner purely because of their financial situation. This is equivalent to more than 9.5 million people across the country. A fifth of people have stayed with a partner longer than they wanted too because breaking up was too expensive . Of those who have stayed in relationships for longer than they wanted to, one in five (20 per cent) did so for up to three months. However, the majority stayed with a partner they no longer wanted to be with for far longer. The realities of shared bills, rent and mortgages mean that separating is no longer just an emotional exercise . Worryingly, more than two-fifths (43 per cent) of respondents admitted they had stayed in a relationship for a year or more after they thought it should end because their financial situation meant they didn’t feel they could leave. And a shocking quarter (24 per cent) of these respondents remained in the romantic partnership for more than three years after things went stale. Those aged between 25 and 34 years old are the most likely to remain with a partner just because of their joint finances, with nearly a third (31 per cent) of this age group revealing they have done so at some point. This might be because it’s at this age that people are most likely to take their first steps on the property ladder or start a family, and it compares to less than one in 10 (8 per cent) over-55s who have done the same. London has the highest proportion of couples admitting they have stayed together for the finances – and little else. More than a third (36 per cent) of respondents in the capital revealed they have remained in a relationship for just this reason in the past, compared to just one in 10 (12 per cent) people in the West Midlands. Spokesman for Debt Advisory Centre, who conducted the study, Ian Williams says: 'It’s shocking to hear that so many people feel forced to stay in a relationship for longer than they want to because of their finances, but it’s perhaps not that surprising. Those aged 25- 34 years old are the most likely to remain with a partner because of their joint finances, perhaps because it's when people are most likely to take their first steps on the property ladder . 'It’s tough to end the bonds we create in a relationship, and financial ties can often be the hardest to break. 'Joint debts, mortgages or rent and childcare costs all play a part in people choosing to stay in a relationship when love breaks down, if they think they’d be unable to afford these costs alone. Data for Debt Advisory Centre last year revealed 12 per cent of people seeking debt help did so as a result of a relationship break-up. 'If finances start to spiral out of control when a relationship ends, the sooner people seek help with their debts, the sooner they can start to work towards getting back in control of their money.”","Many now stay in a relationship after the love has gone due to finances .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . Brave: Lance Corporal James Collins, from Dundee, stood on a live grenade to save his comrades - then went on to play professional football for 15 years . A First World War soldier stood on a live grenade to save his comrades - and then went on to play professional football for 15 years. Lance Corporal James Collins, from Dundee, was advised to have his right foot and lower leg amputated after being seriously injured in the blast on the Western Front. But the soldier refused to allow medics to remove his limb - and instead, underwent 14 operations over the next two years. Astonishingly, he then went on to play for Swansea City FC for 15 years - and even rose to the level of captain. Now, his rare Albert Medal - awarded to him for his heroic actions - has sold at auction for nearly £22,000. Before the war, L/Cpl Collins was a promising footballer who played for his local Dundee team, St Joseph’s FC. He subsequently enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps and . served with the 14th Field Ambulance at the advanced dressing station at . La Bergere, near Monshyn-le-Roux, France. By standing on the live grenade on November 11, 1917, he saved the lives of two colleagues, who managed to escape the explosion unscathed. According to a citation published in the London Gazette, L/Cpl had been escorting a ‘lunatic’ soldier through the trenches when the captive escaped. It . states: 'Collins ran after him, and when he got near him the man . threatened to throw a bomb at him. Collins closed with the man, who then . withdrew the pin from the bomb and let it fall in the trench. 'In . an endeavour to save the patient and two other soldiers who were near, . Collins put his foot upon the bomb, which exploded, killing the lunatic . and injuring Collins severely. 'Fortunately the two soldiers were not hurt. Collins, who could easily have got out of the way, ran the gravest risk of losing his life in order to save others.' L/Cpl Collins suffered severe injuries in the blast - with his foot and lower right leg riddled with shrapnel. But despite his injuries, he made his debut as a defender for Swansea City FC in 1920, before leading the Welsh team to an FA Cup semi-final and the old Third Division Championship. Award: The soldier was later awarded the Albert Medal by King George V at Buckingham Palace for his heroic actions. Above,  L/Cpl Collins is pictured with his mother outside the Palace following the award ceremony . 'For gallantry in saving life': The Albert Medal is a rare award which is the civilian version of the Victoria Cross . During his 15-year career, he also scored a hat-trick against Bristol Rovers in an 8-1 win. L/Cpl Collins was later awarded the Albert Medal, a rare medal which was replaced by the George Medal and is the civilian version to the Victoria Cross. King George V presented the soldier with the prestigious medal at Buckingham Palace. After retiring from professional football, L/Cpl Collins became a football coach, before volunteering for service with the with the Royal Engineers during the Second World War. Sale: L/Cpl Collins's medal has been sold at Spinks auction house (pictured) in London for nearly £22,000 . He died in Dundee in 1963 aged 67. The soldier's medal was bought by an unnamed collector at Spinks auction house in London for a hammer price of £18,000 - with added fees taking the total to £21,600. Oliver Pepys, a medal expert at Spinks, said: 'It was a very selfless thing what he did and a splendid act of cold courage. 'Although . the medical advice was to amputate his foot, he was clearly desperate . to one day resume his footballing career and wasn’t going to let some . doctor tell him otherwise. 'He was quite young when he went to the Western Front and still had many years ahead of him to play football.'","Lance Corporal James Collins saved two comrades by standing on bomb .

"By . James Slack, Home Affairs Editor . Foreign nationals arrested by the police – including EU citizens – will be deported even if they are not convicted of any crime. The move follows a pilot scheme in London under which 2,091 migrants have been kicked out, including more than 100 from Poland and Romania. It can be hard to remove EU nationals because of free movement rules, but the crackdown will use European law stating that if people want to remain here, they must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient. This could be used to tackle groups such as the notorious Park Lane beggars, a group largely from Eastern European countries such as Romania which has haunted the central London area. Rough sleepers: Romanian migrants near Park Lane in London. Beggars could be targeted by Operation Nexus . Now, police who arrest EU nationals for offences such as begging will hand their cases over to immigration officials. They will then be kicked out and barred from returning for at least a year. There will be border guards in police stations across England and Wales to check the immigration status of those arrested. In some cases, they will be joined by officers from Romania and Poland to spot known offenders from overseas. Anybody who is wanted abroad or is here illegally will be fast-tracked for removal under the Operation Nexus project. On top of this, it will also target suspected criminals against whom there is insufficient evidence for a prosecution. James Brokenshire: 'Foreign nationals who break the laws of this country have nowhere to hide' It will use intelligence gathered by police to make a case that they should be booted out of Britain because their presence is not in the public interest. In London, border guards have recently removed 44 Polish nationals, 64 Romanians and two Bulgarians, all either suspected offenders or foreign criminals. A further 142 European Union nationals, or those with EU rights, are being investigated with a view to removal. Immigration minister James Brokenshire said: ‘The success of Operation Nexus shows that foreign nationals who break the laws of this country have nowhere to hide.’ Police and border guards began the London pilot in September 2012 after it emerged that a quarter of suspected offenders arrested in the capital were foreign nationals. Immigration officials in police stations can put an immediate block on any applications suspects may have lodged for British citizenship. Their cases are then fast-tracked. Evidence of criminality – including convictions before their latest arrest – will be used against them in immigration tribunals. The extension of Operation Nexus nationwide is part of the Government’s organised crime strategy.Criminals removed under the London pilot included Frezel Poku, a Ghanaian national and convicted robber arrested while driving a stolen vehicle. Immigration officers used a police dossier to prove he was a high-risk individual. Pro-migrant groups have criticised Operation Nexus, saying it will damage community relations.","Pilot scheme has already deported 2,091 migrants .

And Manchester City striker Aguero posted a picture on Twitter alongside five-time FIFA World Player of the Year Marta saying 'No to racism. We are all equal'. Chelsea trio Oscar, David Luiz and Willian posted a short video on Luiz's Instagram account including the hashtag 'zero discrimination'. Later, Tottenham duo Mousa Dembele and Nacer Chadli and Brazil international Hulk also posted pictures as they joined the campaign alongside others who used social media to speak out against the incident. Barcelona released a statement condemning the incident and urged other clubs to continue fighting in order to eradicate racism from football. 'FC Barcelona would like to underline the civil, cultural, social and sporting importance of two messages which UEFA remind us of before every game: Respect and No to Racism.

Alves made light of the incident following the game, saying 'I don't know who threw the banana but I want to thank him. It gave me the energy to put two more crosses in for our goals.'

Chairman Charlie Mayfield — only the fifth boss in all that time — presides over a £10 billion turnover and 91,000 staff (or partners, as they are known), 31 department stores, the Waitrose chain and a booming website. Scroll down for video . This 1890 ladies' walking suit (left), which would cost £130 today, was ill-named because its long skirt made it difficult for women to travel far. Meanwhile, high-end versions of this 1910s parasol (right) cost £1, or £99 today . The first electric iron in the 1920s had a 'hot point' at the tip - giving Hotpoint its name - and weighed 2.5kg . In honour of the anniversary, I was invited into the depths of the archives at Odney, a country estate near Cookham, Berks, designed for the enjoyment of the lucky employees. It’s so civilised I keep expecting someone to bring me a warm scone or a cushion. The store was founded in 1864 by John Lewis, an apprentice linen draper from Shepton Mallet, Somerset, whose father died when he was eight. It started life as a haberdasher’s in Oxford Street and founded its reputation on quality silk that undercut its rivals on price. The first handheld hairdryers (left), costing £11 in 1925, were so heavy women's arms would usually tire before their hair had dried. Right, this heater was one of John Lewis's Christmas Gift Guide's most coveted gifts in 1926 The size of a desk fan, heat radiated from one bulb. But many homes didn't have the electricity it required. The Jantzen Sports Swimwear range, launched by John Lewis in 1922, marked the moment when women were first allowed to show their legs in public. Attitudes to women's fashion were at last changing . But it wasn’t always as serene as you might imagine. After a fierce battle over rent with his landlord, Lord Howard de Walden, the man who founded the temple of modern manners spent three weeks in Brixton prison for contempt of court. It was his handsome eldest son, John Spedan Lewis, who, in 1925, came up with the principle and slogan for which John Lewis is famous ‘Never knowingly undersold’ — meaning customers could be confident they were not paying more than they would at other stores. Early machines in the 1920s (left), costing £60, mimicked the hand movements of a woman washing clothes on a washboard. Until then, housewives used two tubs of water, weighing up to 50lb each. Right, in 1932,  John Lewis launched its own range of fitted kitchens, displaying one of them in the window of its Oxford Street store . The Fifties saw the trend for labour-saving gadgets take off, with John Lewis starting to stock the Dualit toaster in 1953 - and Dualit's design has barely changed since . He also dreamed up a creative way to annoy a self-made autocratic parent who still retained an orphan’s fear of poverty. He decided his father had more money than was good for him and that John Lewis profits should be distributed among the staff. Given that his father had total control over the company until his death in 1928 at the age of 92, he had to wait to put his plans into practice. The teasmade (left) - a kettle with a tube leading into a teapot, heated by an electric element - became a mass hit when it arrived in John Lewis stores in 1966. Right, the first microwave was built in the US in the Forties and was 6ft high. Within 20 years, the first counter-top ovens had hit John Lewis, costing £3,000 in today's money . Fondue originated in Switzerland as a way of using up stale cheese. By 1974, they were a John Lewis must-buy . He placed shares in an independent trust and awarded bonuses to all, so they could share ‘gain, knowledge and power’. Spedan . hoped the partnership system would increase motivation, morale and . retention rates, ensuring the company would grow successfully — and he . was right. John Lewis Partnership outstripped all its rivals. Big sellers of the first home computers were IBM, Sinclair and Alan Sugar's £500 Amstrad . You can trace the British mood of the times through the catalogues in John Lewis’s archives. It’s fascinating to explore the rabbit warren of shelves, where cardboard boxes are stacked high, documenting a lifetime of retail. In true John Lewis fashion, archivist Judy Faraday says ‘We never make a fuss about royal things’, as she lets me hold a tiny piece of embroidered lace and velvet. It’s a bonnet that looks as if it could fit a child, but it once belonged to Queen Victoria, who sent it to Caley’s of Windsor (once a John Lewis outpost, now shut) to be copied in the 1890s during the gloom of her interminable mourning for Prince Albert. Pictures from around this time show the store had a ‘Foreign Fancy’ department devoted to parasols, china, carpets, stuffed birds... anything that took the buyers’ fancy. There was also the rich, colourful fabric — printed by hand  — commissioned in 1910 by the White Star Line for the state rooms of the Titanic. Sketches in the catalogue of this time advertise corsets to give the extraordinary top-heavy Queen Mary silhouette (they have names such as ‘Millicent’ and ‘Bertha’). Long-handled parasols, to shield ladies from the sun or unwanted attention, were a sell-out.By the Twenties, the illustrations are of slim and elegant flappers. A shimmering metal brocade evening wrap is 14 guineas — £750 today. In the 1990s, the age of the £25 sandwich toaster arrived. It was pioneered by Australian firm, Breville . A wooden . hat stretcher was used in the millinery department to make sure the . fashionable bell-shaped cloches weren’t too tight. The store also . boasted a fur department of luxurious pelts. In . the home department, there were innovations as the servant class . diminished: the first hairdryers, electric irons and washing machines. Coffee has always been a mainstay of John Lewis sales. Jewel in today's crown is the Jura Giga 5 one-touch bean-to-cup machine at £3,750 . In 1932, John Lewis launched fitted kitchens — no longer a place for the mere preparation of food, but now seen as the heart of the home. Come wartime, the tone of the catalogues changes. Tea towels carry war propaganda. In 1939, you could buy ‘a combined handbag and gas mask carrier, with purse and mirror in morocco leather’, which cost almost ten shillings (£30 today) and had a pocket for your identity card. There are ‘bright new curtains to banish the blackout’ and ‘siren suits’ — feminine boiler suits marketed as the perfect item to slip into before heading to the air raid shelter. Parcels for the troops from Waitrose (bought by John Lewis in 1937) included lobster, brown Windsor soup, a fruit cake and foie gras. In the bleak post-war years there was a longing for colour. Pat Albeck’s Daisy Chain floral fabric was a John Lewis bestseller as trays, tea towels, tablecloths, curtains, chair covers, dresses and dog cushions. For the 150th anniversary, her daughter-in-law Emma Bridgewater has reworked the pattern on a teapot. Perhaps sales of coffee machines best tell the John Lewis story. Electric percolators arrived in the Sixties, with filter machines in the Seventies. Today, the top-end Jura Giga 5 one-touch bean-to-cup coffee machine costs £3,750. Certainly not cheap, but definitely good quality and sold with charm and good sense. Just like everything else in John Lewis since 1864.

"By . Bianca London . It seems that sex and rock 'n' roll really are kindred spirits as new research reveals that rock music fans are most likely to pursue an affair. Researchers questioned people who admitted to being adulterous on their music preferences and 41 per cent choose rock 'n' roll as their favourite genre. The survey found that pop music came second with 16 per cent of cheating Brits citing it as their favourite music, country music received 11 per cent, classical music got 7 per cent, and rap and hip-hop received 2 per cent. Rock fan? You're more likely to cheat! A new survey revealed that fans of music by the likes of Ozzy Osbourne, left, have more affairs, while fans of Jay Z and hip hop artists are the least likely to do the dirty . The research also found that 70 per cent of Brits wouldn't date someone who has . vastly different music tastes to their own. The rule doesn't apply if you're Irish though. Unlike England, Scotland and . Wales, Irish affair seekers seem to favour country music (33per cent). A spokesperson for IllicitEncounter.com, who commissioned the research, said: 'I am not surprised that rock 'n' roll music came out on top. Country bumpkins: The cheaters of Ireland prefer to listen to county music like Dolly Parton, left, and Billy Ray Cyrus . 'Rock music has a long been associated with sexual appeal, risk taking and living life on the edge. 'Many of our members would have grown up under the influence of bands such as the Rolling Stones, The Who, Led Zeppelin and Fleetwood Mac and it is very possible that these songs have had an influence on their lifestyle.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . 'Murderer': David Gikawa, 39, stands accused of stabbing Linah Keza, 29, to death in her flat . A man 'motivated by jealousy' and 'out for revenge' stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death just days after she made a statement in which she said she was petrified of him, a court heard. Linah Keza, 29, was stabbed to death after David Gikawa, 39, used a key she gave him to sneak into her flat at 4.20am before launching into a 'brutal stabbing'. the Old Bailey was told. The cause of death was given as stab wounds to the chest, the jury heard. Gikawa, 39, denies murdering Ms Keza . while she was with her young child at her flat in Leyton, east London on July 31 last year. He used to live with Ms Keza in the flat, but that she had kicked him out the night before and was planning to change the locks, prosecutors said. Jurors later heard from a witness how Ms Keza screamed and begged a neighbour to kick the door down as she was stabbed to death, while her young daughter shouted ‘leave my mummy alone’. The 'systems in place failed to prevent' the death of Ms Keza, who had been in contact with both the . police and social services, Peter Finnigan QC, prosecuting, told the court. Mr Finnigan said Gikawa drove from a bar where he had been drinking with friends to Ms Keza's flat where the 'brutal stabbing' took place. The incident was described by neighbour Gideon Bello, who told the court he went to investigate after hearing the shouts from the flat. He told how he knocked on the door after hearing a young girl saying: 'Leave my mummy alone'. Mr Bello said he then heard Ms Keza shouting: 'Please kick down the door, please kick down the door.' He said: ‘[Gikawa] was holding her with his arm around her neck. I saw his hand moving around as if he was hitting her. He then told how a blood-stained Gikawa ran away after he challenged him. Mr Finnigan earlier said the victim wanted to start afresh and be 'free from the fear, threats and control'. But, he said, Gikawa was 'determined to prevent it' claimed he would rather kill Ms Keza and himself than see her go out with another person. Together: Jurors heard how Gikawa, left with Ms Keza, was heard by a witness stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death . 'Turbulent relationship': Jurors at the Old Bailey heard how Ms Keza had tried to escape the control of Gikawa, and that she drafted a statement telling lawyers she was 'petrified' of him . Characterising the relationship, Mr . Finnigan said: ‘He had both used and threatened violence and even death. That was his way of maintaining or controlling the relationship and to . some extend he succeed. ‘Linah . found it difficult to break away from him. Latterly, as his behaviour . degenerated and threats became worse she took increasing action against . him to leave her alone.’ Their . relationship, which began after they met in 2009, had been 'turbulent . from an early stage' and Gikawa had a 'darker side', the court heard. Mr Finnigan said: 'He had in the past attacked her and beaten her.' The jury was told about one incident when a knife was allegedly put inside Ms Keza's mouth. Police were called but she did not want to go to court and the case was dropped, the jury heard. Mr . Finnigan said that just a few days before her death Ms Keza sought a . non-molestation order from the court. He then read from the witness . statement she gave. 'Very controlling': Ms Keza wrote in her statement how Gikawa had attacked her before. He allegedly sneaked into her flat - to which he still had keys - at around 4am and stabbed her . It said . Gikawa was 'very controlling' and she said she could not speak to her . family because they would 'disown' her if they knew she was pregnant . before being married. Reading from the statement, Mr Finnigan said: 'I'm petrified of him. I don't want a life of violence any more. I just want to live a safe life.' The statement also told how in April 2011 Gikawa allegedly attacked her at his home in Edmonton, north London, after she found out he had been cheating on him with another woman. ‘He pushed me on the bed, he pushed the pillow on to my head and punched the pillow several times,’ she wrote. The jury heard that the police were called on July 29 - two days before Ms Keza's death - three times. Mr Finnigan said that police said during a conversation with them Ms Keza alleged that Gikawa 'carries a kitchen knife that he had sharpened'. Gikawa, of Leyton, East London, denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","David Gikawa, 39, allegedly killed Linah Keza, 29, in a 'brutal stabbing'

"By . Lizzie Parry . Glamorous images of Hollywood stars and U.S. presidents found in the dusty filing cabinet of a British photographer are set to be exhibited for the first time. Thousands of images, many in black and white, were unearthed at the Brighton home of George Douglas, after the photographer passed away. The unique collection includes images of Breakfast At Tiffany's actress Audrey Hepburn, English actor Sir Dirk Bogarde as well as former U.S. president Harry Truman, James Bond star Roger Moore and Peter Sellers. The images, which span three decades . from the 1940s to 1960s, were discovered by fellow photographer and Mr . Douglas's neighbour Roger Bamber, who inherited his friend's home . following his death. Thousands of images - including this of Breakfast At Tiffany's actress Audrey Hepburn - were discovered at the Brighton home of photographer George Douglas after his death . Thirty of the images are set to go on display for the first time in May as part of Brighton's Artists Open Houses event. This photograph of Angela Lansbury is part of the collection found in a dusty filing cabinet by Mr Douglas's friend and neighbour Roger Bamber . The negatives, which had lain buried for years, include social and historical images from the period, including the Queen's rat-catcher and Britain's first female chimney sweep, Mr Bamber said. Thirty images from the archive will go on display at Mr Douglas's former home as part of Brighton's Artists Open Houses festival in May. Photographer Nigel Swallow, who is now living in the property, said he is expecting it to take him at least a year for himself and Mr Bamber to sort through the photographs, and that he has taken advice as to how it can be properly archived. Mr Swallow said: 'It's something that should be taken very good care of and I am chuffed that I have been asked to look after the archive. 'The first priority is making sure we preserve George's work.' Mr Douglas, whose nickname was Speedy George due to his fast-paced work ethic, worked for many years at Picture Post magazine. He spent much of his time in California, but would spend his summers in Brighton, Mr Bamber said. He retired to live in his house full-time in 2007 until his death in December 2010 at the age of 88, he continued. George Douglas, whose nickname was Speedy George due to his fast-paced work ethic, worked for many years at Picture Post magazine .

This photograph shows a performers on Santa Monica beach . English actor and comedian Tony Hancock, captured by George Douglas with a group of penguins. Mr Douglas worked for Picture Post for a large part of his career . The collection includes this series of pictures of actor Peter Sellers . Mr Bamber . said Mr Douglas, who was born in Rottingdean, East Sussex, but moved to . Dallas, Texas, in 1939, trained in aeronautical design engineering but . his heart was not in it. He . said: 'The Leica camera he bought from a pawnshop consumed his spare . time and once he had sold his first picture, for 30 US dollars, he . handed in his notice. 'He . sold his first photographs to the Los Angeles Times in the 1940s and . moved to Sun Valley, Idaho, in 1948, where he was in charge of . photography for the Sun Valley News Bureau, taking pictures of famous . visitors including Gary Cooper and President Harry Truman. 'In 1949 he moved back to LA and began his career as a celebrity photographer with a picture of Angela Lansbury for Life magazine. 'But it was an English magazine that intrigued him. He noticed that Life photographers he admired had trained in London on the Picture Post, which specialised in 35mm photography and a documentary style. 'He set off for England in 1950. A set of pictures of two children with their pet boa constrictor got him through the door and became the first of many assignments he undertook for Picture Post. 'He fell ""more than a little in love"" with Audrey Hepburn when he spent a fortnight photographing her in New York as she prepared for the Broadway production of Gigi, and became friends with the novelist Paul Gallico and the actor Peter Sellers.' Picture Post closed in 1957 and George turned to women's magazines and the TV Mirror, Mr Bamber said. He went on: 'In 1964, the Beatles asked him to become their photographer on the set of A Hard Day's Night. 'Paul McCartney had been impressed by George's portraits of his then girlfriend Jane Asher; but two weeks at the Twickenham Studios besieged by screaming teenagers was enough to persuade George that he was not cut out for pop photography.'","Thousands of images were unearthed at the Brighton home of photographer George Douglas, who died in 2010 .

"By . Brendan Carlin . Boris Johnson has issued a stinging rebuke to Michael Gove for daring to suggest that he is ‘unfit’ to succeed David Cameron. The London Mayor fired off a thinly veiled message to the Education Secretary to concentrate on  getting Mr Cameron re-elected and stop gossiping about the talents of other top Tories. Mr Johnson also fuelled speculation that he will soon announce his intention to return to the Commons at the General Election next year. Smiling for the camera: Gove with Boris Johnson last year . The Mail on Sunday revealed last month how Mr Gove, seen by some Tories as a future leadership  contender, had launched an extraordinary verbal assault on Mr Johnson’s own credentials. The Education Secretary stunned guests at a private dinner at the London home of Rupert Murdoch with a wine-fuelled attack, saying: ‘The whole Boris routine will wear thin the electorate very quickly if he became PM. And he can’t make tough decisions.’ A ‘tipsy’ Mr Gove added: ‘Boris is incapable of focusing on serious issues and has no gravitas. He isn’t a team player and plays to the gallery the whole time.’ But challenged to respond to the attacks, Mr Johnson made it clear he thinks it is the Education Secretary – not him – who is no team player. In an interview with Paul Waugh and Sam Macrory of Total Politics magazine, Mr Johnson declared: ‘I’m at one with the vast majority of the population that wants to hear a lot less about what other Conservatives have got to say about each other and much more about what we’re going to do to win the Election.’ He implied that senior party figures speculating on each other’s abilities only detracted from the ‘mission’ of getting Mr Cameron re-elected. And of his own ambitions, he said: ‘People want to hear a lot less about my career and anybody else’s career, and they want to hear a lot about how we are going to stop Ed Miliband, who would be a disaster.’ Boris made his attack in an interview with Total Politics magazine, pictured . Only last week, Mr Cameron stepped up his appeal for Mr Johnson to return to Westminster, sparking reports of a ‘bidding war’ among party activists in safe Tory seats desperate for Boris to be their MP. But asked about Mr Cameron’s desire to see him ‘back on the pitch’ at Westminster, Mr Johnson replied: ‘My job is to help the Tory cause in any way that I can, by running London to the best of my ability.’ One of the main objections to Mr Johnson returning as an MP – and being able to stand in a Tory leadership contest – is that his term as London mayor still has two years to run. But he appeared intrigued by the fact that Ken Livingstone had spent one year being both a Labour MP and running City Hall. ‘Did he?’ asked Mr Johnson, before insisting his focus was on being Mayor. Reports last week linked him with at least two safe Tory seats that will be vacant at the next Election - North-West Hampshire and Louth and Horncastle in Lincolnshire. But Mr Johnson would not be drawn on whether he would stand outside the capital, saying: ‘I’m playing no such games.’ He also laughed off suggestions that he could do a ‘job swap’ with dashing Zac Goldsmith, Tory MP for Richmond Park on the outskirts of London, joking: ‘The biggest supporters of that are all the women in my office. In a very insulting way, they’ve told me in no uncertain terms the sooner I can swap with Zac Goldsmith the better.’","London Mayor told Gove to concentrate on getting PM re-elected .

Sir Alex Ferguson has spoken of his anguish at the way David Moyes’s sacking was handled by Manchester United. Speaking to an audience of 300 at a charity lunch in Manchester, Ferguson said he found it ‘upsetting the way it came out’. Moyes learned of his imminent sacking when the story broke on Monday afternoon — 16 hours before he was officially informed by the club. VIDEO Scroll down for End of an Era at United? Fans have their say about Moyes . Upset: Sir Alex Ferguson is unhappy with how Manchester United dealt with the sacking of David Moyes . Sacked: David Moyes has now agreed a pay-off deal with Manchester United after being sacked on Tuesday . Ferguson clearly finds that regrettable when he was responsible for luring his fellow Scot to Old Trafford from Everton, where he had enjoyed 11 successful years prior to 10 torturous months at United. United’s handling of the situation might cost them dearly when it comes to negotiating Moyes’s exit terms. The League Managers Association, who are assisting Moyes, have already blasted the club for behaving in an ‘unprofessional manner’. Their chief executive Richard Bevan said: ‘The LMA is very disappointed with the nature of David’s departure.’ Old guard: Giggs (left) has taken over until the end of the season and is being assisted by Paul Scholes . That view was endorsed on Thursday by West Ham manager Sam Allardyce, an LMA committee member, who called the process ‘flawed’ and ‘a great shame for David and for United’s brand’. It is highly significant that the LMA will not comment further until Moyes’s compensation deal has been finalised. It is understood the 50-year-old believes United delayed sacking him to save millions of pounds in compensation. The axe fell two days after defeat at Everton, which meant United could no longer finish in the Champions League places. Moyes has told friends he believes this was motivated by a clause in his contract stipulating that failure to finish in the top four would limit his pay-off to £4.5million — a year’s money. Final straw: United's defeat to Everton last Sunday proved to be Moyes' last game in charge of the club . Moyes is convinced United decided to sack him weeks ago — something that has been corroborated by club sources this week. But had he been dismissed when there was still a chance of finishing in the top four, his pay-off could have been at least £9m. United maintain they did everything by the book and have adhered to stock-market regulations. A club spokesman said: ‘We do not accept that it was handled in an unprofessional manner. The decision was not taken until late Monday night and was communicated face-to-face first thing on Tuesday morning.’ It is understood Moyes is bitter towards executive chairman Ed Woodward. He wanted daily contact with the club’s senior executive but sources say communication ‘sometimes wasn’t even weekly’. Bitter: Moyes did not have the contact with Ed Woodward (left) that he wanted during his reign .","Sir Alex Ferguson was speaking at a charity lunch in Manchester .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Breakthrough: Scientists in the UK and US have been able to grow artificial skin which could replace animals in drug and cosmetics testing in a laboratory (file photo) Artificial skin which could replace animals in drug and cosmetics testing has been grown in a laboratory for the first time. Scientists in the UK and US were able to produce one centimetre-wide fragments of epidermis - the outermost skin layer - from stem cells with the same properties as real skin. The epidermis forms a protective barrier between the body and external environment, preventing water from escaping while keeping out microbes and toxins. Until now, tissue engineers have been unable to grow an outer skin layer with the functional barrier needed for drug testing. Scientists believe that in the future, lab-grown skin could be used for testing medicinal lotions and creams or cosmetics without causing suffering to animals. It could also provide a model for investigating skin conditions such as eczema. Testing cosmetics on animals is banned in the UK and as of last month it is illegal to import or sell products containing ingredients tested on animals within the European Union. However, cosmetics testing continues in other parts of the world, including China and the US. Dr Dusko Ilic, who led the British team from King's College London, said: 'Our new method can be used to grow much greater quantities of lab-grown human epidermal equivalents, and thus could be scaled up for commercial testing of drugs and cosmetics. 'Human epidermal equivalents representing different types of skin could also be grown, depending on the source of the stem cells used, and could thus be tailored to study a range of skin conditions and sensitivities in different populations.' The artificial skin was derived from induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells created by genetically altering donated fibroblast cells from adult connective tissue. Kinder: Scientists believe that in the future, lab-grown skin could be used for testing medicinal lotions and creams or cosmetics without causing suffering to animals . IPS cells have the same properties as . embryonic stem cells, including the ability to develop into virtually . any kind of tissue in the body. A step-by-step process in the . laboratory transformed the iPS cells into keratinocytes - the dominant . cell type in the outermost layer of the skin - and then pieces of actual . skin. The scientists called . their constructs '3D epidermal equivalents'. Tests showed no . significant differences in structure or function between the artificial . patches and real human skin. Dr . Ilic added: 'When you produce a new cream you need to know how much of . it goes through the skin, because if there's too much it can cause . damage. Ambition: Dr Dusko Ilic, who led the British team from King's College London (pictured) said the new method could be scaled up to allow for commercial testing . 'If you imagine the skin as a three or four-storey building with a roof on top, other people have made the roof but their roofs are always leaking. They could not get their tiles together. We are the first to achieve this. 'Our approach is cost-effective, because once you have the iPS cells you can grow an infinite number."" He . said it would be a simple matter to create skin patches measuring 10 . square metre rather than one, but pointed out that small fragments might . be more useful. The research is published in the latest edition of the journal Stem Cell Reports. Properties: IPS cells have the same properties as embryonic stem cells (pictured), including the ability to develop into virtually any kind of tissue in the body . As well as testing drugs and cosmetics, the artificial skin could also be used to study eczema and other conditions that involve the skin failing to provide an effective barrier. US co-author Dr Theodora Mauro, from San Francisco Veteran Affairs Medical Center, said: 'The ability to obtain an unlimited number of genetically identical units can be used to study a range of conditions where the skin's barrier is defective due to mutations in genes involved in skin barrier formation, such as ichthyosis (dry, flaky skin) or atopic dermatitis (eczema). 'We can use this model to study how the skin barrier develops normally, how the barrier is impaired in different diseases and how we can stimulate its repair and recovery.'","Scientists able to produce one centimetre-wide fragments of epidermis .

Three generations of the family were killed in the fire. Mr Hussain Kayani said: 'I believe the mother of the children, I think she was in the house. 'She managed to escape.

Qurban Hussain, Labour councillor for Sharrow, said: 'I have known the family for the last 40 years. They were a very kind, loving and peaceful family. 'I came down last night when I heard about what had happened. When I saw the fire, I didn't think anyone would have survived. 'The smoke alarms were going off and the neighbour heard them and called the fire brigade. The neighbour was banging on the door, shouting, and that seemed to wake the family up. 'The grandmother came running out of the house, but when she realised the children were still inside she went back in to try and get them out. 'The children's father and grandfather are both taxi drivers and they were both out working at the time. They are very hard working and they're always out earning money for their family. 'They weren't there so they couldn't do anything to help. 'It is such terrible news. They were such a peaceful, loving family and they were very kind people. They didn't interfere with anyone else and they were very nice and loving.' Stuart Jones, head teacher at Lydgate Junior School in Sheffield, where two of the children who died in a house fire studied, said: 'Both boys were very dear to us, and they had many friends here, having been together as a year group for some years. 'They had a sparkle in their eyes and most often a smile on their faces. They brought joy and a liveliness to our school and everyone who worked with Amaan and Adyan enjoyed doing so.'

"By . Ian Drury, Defence Correspondent . An army sniffer dog who died alongside her handler in Afghanistan is to be awarded the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Sasha, a four-year-old yellow Labrador, will receive the PDSA Dickin Medal posthumously for saving countless lives on the battlefield. The pooch was killed by a rocket-propelled grenade while on patrol with Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe, 24, in a Taliban ambush in July 2008. Sasha and her handler Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe. When they were put together in early 2008 they were thought of as one of the best dog-handler teams in the region . She had uncovered 15 bombs and hoards of weapons - thought to be more than any other dog in the conflict. Commanders said Sasha had 'undoubtedly' prevented many soldiers and civilians from being murdered or maimed by insurgents. Soldiers risking their lives on the frontline said her calm presence and wagging tale were comforting and reassuring. L/Cpl Rowe, from Newcastle, served with the Royal Army Veterinary Corps's 104 Military Working Dog Squadron, attached to the 2nd Battalion the Parachute Regiment. He was killed taking part in a mission in Sangin, a Taliban stronghold, in Helmand Province. Sasha and Lance Corporal Rowe, they were killed when the Talbian ambushed their patrol in July 2008 . His mother Lyn Rowe, 54, said: Kenneth always adored animals and loved working with his dogs. He took his role protecting his fellow solders very seriously. We are so proud of him, and he would be incredibly proud that Sasha's bravery is being recognised with the Dickin Medal.' Sasha's key role in the warzone was to sniff out hidden arms caches, improvised explosive devices and bomb-making equipment. On one occasion she detected two mortars and a large quantity of weapons, including explosives and mines. During their time together, L/Cpl Rowe and Sasha 'forged a unique bond', said commanders. The pair were considered the best handler and dog team in the region. The soldier had been due to leave the frontline the day before he died but he had volunteered to stay on because he was worried about his base not having enough search cover for comrades. PDSA director general Jan McLoughlin said: 'We are extremely proud to be awarding a posthumous medal to Sasha. The award is even more poignant as we approach the centenary of World War One and are reminded of the huge debt we owe the animals who serve in times of conflict. 'Sasha’s exceptional devotion to duty in Afghanistan saved many lives, both soldiers and civilians. This medal honours Sasha's unwavering service and her ultimate sacrifice.' The Dickin medal is seen as the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. Sasha will be only the 65th animal to be given the prestigious award . Colonel Neil Smith, director of Army Veterinary and Remount Services, said the unit was 'delighted' that Sasha had been honoured. He said: 'This prestigious award recognises how her devotion and skills undoubtedly saved the lives of many troops in Afghanistan. The award will give us the opportunity to once more celebrate L/Cpl Rowe and Sasha’s immeasurable contributions to military operations.' Sasha's accolade will be presented at a ceremony attended by L/Cpl Rowe's family in London next month. The Dickin Medal is the highest accolade that an animal can receive for saving human life while serving in a warzone. Sasha's posthumous presentation brings the total number of Dickin Medals awarded to animals in war to 65. Since it was introduced by PDSA founder Maria Dickin in 1943 it has been awarded to 29 dogs, 32 Second World War messenger pigeons, three horses and one cat.","Sasha will be posthumously given Dickin medal at a ceremony next month .

"By . Matt Barlow . Follow @@Matt_Barlow_DM . Franz Beckenbauer hailed Louis van Gaal as one of the world’s best coaches and the ‘perfect’ fit for Manchester United because of his experience, ambition and personality. German icon Beckenbauer watched from close quarters as Van Gaal won the double with  Bayern Munich in 2010, only  missing out on the Champions League trophy in the final against Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan. ‘He would be perfect for Man United because he is an internationally experienced coach and he understands English football,’ said the Bayern legend, who served the club as captain, manager and president. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch profile of Louis van Gaal . Kaiser: Franz Beckenbauer (R) insists Louis van Gaal (L) would be perfect as Manchester United's next manager . Heir to the throne? The Dutchman, pictured with Alex Ferguson (R), is hot favourite to take over at United . ‘I don’t know if it’s a rumour or if they’re really trying to sign him but if they agree with Louis I think it would be a good part of the future. He won a lot of titles so he is experienced and he is ambitious. He has the personality. He has everything.’ As for Van Gaal’s reputation for arrogance, which played a part in his exit from Bayern in 2011, Beckenbauer admitted: ‘If you ask him a stupid question then it can be that his answer is a bit arrogant, but if you treat him with respect, then respect comes back to you. ‘I like him. He was also very successful with Bayern Munich. In the end there was a little discussion about the way he was handling his job so that’s why they went separate ways — but for me he’s one of the best coaches in the world.’ Beckenbauer was speaking to Sportsmail as an ambassador of Gazprom’s ‘Football for Friendship’ initiative, which brings children from different European countries together and takes some to Lisbon to attend next month’s Champions League final. Having beaten United in the quarter-final, Bayern are attempting to become the first team to defend the trophy in the modern era, although they are a goal down to Real Madrid going into the  second leg of the semi-final in Munich tonight. ‘It was not a perfect result, but Bayern Munich can be very happy it was only a 1-0 defeat when it could have been two or three,’ said Beckenbauer, who is not the greatest fan of Pep Guardiola’s possession-based brand of football. Fancy a pint: Van Gaal is sprayed with beer after winning the German Cup with Bayern Munich in 2010 . Winner! Van Gaal had great success with Bayern Munich before leaving due to tensions with the board . ‘He is a master for keeping the ball and there’s always been a philosophy that if you are in possession, the opposition are not able to score goals, but it is not the most attractive part of the game. ‘To score from 30 metres is spectacular, more attractive than to keep possession but it’s the philosophy of Guardiola and it has been successful with Barcelona and Bayern Munich.’ Bayern’s team is largely based around those who won the European title last year under Jupp Heynckes, who was ousted to make way for Guardiola. They are aiming for a third successive Champions League final. ‘I like to watch the wingers, Franck Ribery and Arjen  Robben,’ said Beckenbauer. ‘Manuel Neuer is probably the best goalkeeper in the world and Bastian Schweinsteiger is wonderful for team interest. German engineering: Bayern are on course for a third successive Champions League final after beating United in the quarter-finals . Wing men: Beckenbauer enjoys watching wide players like Arjen Robben (L) and Franck Ribery (R) ‘Jupp Heynckes was really popular and he still is. He won the  treble, the most famous titles in football, but he is 69 years old and so he is not the future. The future is Guardiola and if you have a chance to sign him which Bayern Munich did, I think it was the best move that can ever happen.’ Even so, Bayern cannot expect to dominate the competition as they did in the 1970s, when Beckenbauer’s team won a hat-trick of European titles from 1974-76. ‘You can see how difficult it is to play in this competition because no team have won it twice in a row,’ he said. ‘New teams are getting stronger. It is a different game, different lifestyle and different materials. Everything is much more professional than it was 40 years ago.’ Homegrown: Many United supporters would like to see Ryan Giggs get the job permanently . Portugeezer: Beckenbauer may not love Jose Mourinho, but he accepts he's one of the world's best coaches . If Bayern make it past Real Madrid tonight, they could face Chelsea in the final. Beckenbauer once claimed Jose Mourinho was ‘rude and with no education’ but he admires him as a coach. ‘Jose is Jose, I wouldn’t say the best but if you have Guardiola and if you have Jose Mourinho it can’t be better,’ he said. ‘I like personalities. I like these kinds of people and he is one of the most successful coaches in the whole world. ‘Yes, he can win it again, why not? Chelsea have the chance to beat Atletico at home, then they are in the final and in one game  anything can happen.’ Click here to find out more about Football for Friendship .","Franz Beckenbauer believes Louis van Gaal would be perfect for Man United .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . Katie Hill discovered she had a 2.5stone cyst while pregnant . A 'miracle' baby has survived despite his mother suffering from a two stone cyst while pregnant with him. Doctors feared the huge growth could be cancerous and warned Katie Hill it would kill her and her unborn son Alfie if it burst. She had her partner Ricky Collier had been trying for a baby for 18 months and were delighted when they discovered Ms Hill was pregnant last July. But a few weeks after the 12 week scan last September she experienced sharp, cramping pains down her left side. Doctors discovered a small cyst and drained four litres of fluid from it, but just after her 20 week scan, Ms Hill was recalled to hospital and told a huge second cyst had been found. She said: 'My consultant told me that there was debris inside this cyst and it could be cancerous, so they would have to operate to remove it. 'They told me they were going to leave me until I was 25 weeks pregnant before they operated to give the baby the best chance of survival. 'By this point I was in so much pain with the cyst because it was so heavy and they put me on painkillers. 'They told me it was if I was carrying twins at 30 weeks, as the cyst had made me so much bigger than I should be at that stage of pregnancy. 'However, it was only after they operated that we found out it was a lot worse than that. 'I was absolutely huge and if the cyst had burst or ruptured, both me and the baby would have died.' Ms Hill, 25, was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital in December as she struggled to breathe and had a temperature. She was losing blood internally, given an emergency transfusion and booked in for the emergency operation to remove the cyst. Ms Hill pregnant with the cyst (left) and after it was removed (right). Doctors had warned it could rupture, killing her and her unborn child . Ms Hill underwent a three-and-a-half hour operation to drain 12 litres of fluid from it and, to her relief, no cancer was found. The cyst had not been a common ovarian one but developed inside her left fallopian tube, which had expanded massively as it had grown. Ms Hill had regular scans to check on her baby as doctors feared that being so squashed by the cyst might have affected his growth but he seemed fine. Baby Alfie survived the surgery as he wriggled lower into his mother's womb . Ms Hill added: 'Once they removed the cyst, they removed my left fallopian tube as well. 'The doctors told me: 'We don't know how you survived. Thankfully, there was no cancer.' Ms Hill then continued with her pregnancy and three months after the operation, her son Alfie was born slightly prematurely, but otherwise well. A month on, he is now doing well at home in Preston, Lancashire. Ms Hill, a clerical officer for the NHS, said: 'Alfie is an absolute joy and we cannot believe he is here after everything we have been through. 'It is frightening to think that if the cyst had ruptured, both Alfie and I could have died. 'We experienced some very frightening times but now Alfie is here, we are both so happy, as he is just so perfect.' Alfie survived the surgery as he wriggled lower into her womb and Ms Hill returned home after a few days in hospital. The couple faced further anguish after 30 weeks of pregnancy when a scan showed enlarged ventricles to the baby's brain. Ms Hill was referred to specialists in Manchester who offered to test for Down's syndrome. She said: 'We felt there was no point having the test, as it was not an issue. Alfie was going to come anyway.' Ms Hill went into hospital on March 24 to be induced, but doctors told her she had already started labour and she had to be sent for an emergency Caesarean section. When she came round her first words were: 'Is my baby alive?' and she was told that Alfie was in intensive care. She said: 'Once I came round, they took me up in my bed to see Alfie. He was all wired up and in an incubator.' After having the cyst removed, Ms Hill (with partner Ricky) went on to have baby Alfie slightly prematurely . Alfie, who was born on March 25 weighing 7lb 7oz, began gradually getting better, and after seven days in hospital he and his mother were allowed home. She said: 'Alfie is now a month old and is doing really well. 'He's a perfect miracle and we are just amazed that he is here. We just keep looking at him and crying.' His father added: 'Alfie is perfect. We just can't stop looking at him and checking on him.' Sanjeev Prashar, clinical director of women's health at Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'A cyst that weighs more than two stone is certainly quite unusual and removing a large cyst during pregnancy can be a difficult operation. 'We wish Katie, Alfie and the family well for the future.'","Katie Hill, 25, was told at her 20-week scan she had 2.5 stone cyst .

"By . Bianca London . A tech entrepreneur has come under fire after creating a website that encourages lecturers to have sex with their university students. Tom Thurlow, 23, from Gloucestershire, created shagatuni.com to help students meet like-minded others for casual sex. Since its opening in September 2012, the site has attracted thousands of users, with 2,000 students signing up per day in its first few months. Entrepreneur: Tom Thurlow, 23, created Shagatuni.com to help students meet like-minded others for casual sex but has come under fire after many claimed it was 'encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power' But the website has come under fire after many claimed it was 'encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power', when a recent poll found that more and more were joining. In a statement on the site Shagatuni said: 'Since the beginning of 2014 we've seen an even bigger uptake to the site by university professors. 'We recently polled 1,773 of our members and over half of them (54 per cent) admitted to having been sexually attracted to their lecturer. 'And of these horny students, three fifths (61 per cent) confessed to indulging in ""flirtatious behaviour"" with the lecturer in question. 'To put it simply, there are students in vast numbers who want to get it on with the person who stands in front of the blackboard. In a statement on the site Shagatuni said: 'Since the beginning of 2014 we've seen an even bigger uptake to the site by university professors' - which has caused outrage . 'It could be a power thing or perhaps they just prefer someone with experience in the bedroom? 'At ShagAtUni we're extremely accommodating and we see no good reason why not to encourage student and lecturer relations.' It was followed by a list of advice to lecturers using the site, including the tip: 'Try and avoid hooking up with a student you teach to avoid any discrepancies over exam results or degree grades. 'Lecturers who create an account on ShagAtUni.com during 2014 will now be granted free membership for an entire year (worth £25 per month),' adds the post. Tom said he saw nothing wrong with encouraging lecturers to sleep with students. 'I get that some will find it controversial, but that doesn't mean lecturers and students don't sleep with each other,' he said. 'Shag At Uni is the biggest site for students and sex so it's only right that we lead the way in facilitating this naughty trend.' But many have slammed the move by the website, with one university lecturer saying he was 'appalled' by the website. The 31-year-old, who asked not to be named, said: 'I think it's utterly wrong that this website is encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power. Controversial: 'We feel that there are definitely sensible ways to court a relationship that some prudes in society might frown upon,' writes the site. 'So we’ve decided to create our own Code of Conduct for lecturers to use as a guide when using ShagAtUni.com' 'You're . talking about students who are still finding themselves in life and . perhaps a bit naive and and this site is, it could be argued, taking . advantage of them. 'Obviously . the students have to be looking for it in the first place to join the . site, so it's not as though they're being seduced, but they're still . young and could very likely regret getting together with a lecturer . later in life.' Abi Thomas, a student from Cheltenham called the website 'creepy'. The . 20-year-old said: 'I don't agree with what Shag At Uni is doing. Personally, I think there should be a line between teachers and . students. 'It's creepy. Lecturers shouldn't be trawling the internet looking for students for sex. 'I . know there are students who are 18 and think it's somehow cool and . daring to sleep with their lecturer, but they'll probably regret it . later in life, and this is just encouraging them to do it.' His view: Tom said he saw nothing wrong with encouraging lecturers to sleep with students, adding: 'I get that some will find it controversial, but that doesn't mean lecturers and students don't sleep with each other' Tom said he got the idea to include lecturers after he came across many who had slept with their own while at university. He said: 'I know lots of students personally who fancy their lecturers. One (who shall remain nameless) even told me he slept with his twice. 'So this got me searching on my site for this trend. Lo and behold he isn't the only one getting some extracurricular.' Explaining how the site works for lecturers, he added: 'So they can browse through the users of my site just like a student can.

"By . Alison Smith Squire . Ellie Fairfax and sister Siobhan whose baby she's carrying . When Siobhan Terry was told she could not have any more children after battling cervical cancer, she was left heartbroken. Life-saving treatment meant the mother-of-one would be left infertile and unable to give her daughter Saoirse, two, a little brother or sister. But the 31-year-old and her husband Dean, 51, had not counted on the selfless actions of her sister, Ellie Fairfax. On hearing the terrifying news that her younger sibling would die if she did not have the treatment, Miss Fairfax did not hesitate to volunteer as a surrogate. ‘Ellie gave me a hug and I broke down when she said simply, “well I’ll have a baby for you”,’ Mrs Terry recalled. And the 33-year-old trainee cardiac physiologist has been true to her word. Now pregnant using Mr Terry’s sperm, she is counting down to the birth next month when she will hand over her first child – a little boy – to her sister. ‘Having a baby for Siobhan feels completely natural,’ said Miss Fairfax. ‘Watching my sister battle with cancer was hard enough. But it’s almost more upsetting to know she couldn’t have another baby. ‘So having a baby for her was an easy decision.’ Ellie will hand over her first child - a son - to her sister, she says the decision feels totally natural . The sisters have always been close, left, and their bond grew even stronger after Siobhan was diagnosed . The sisters, from Beckenham in south-east London, are the eldest of four and have always been close. But their bond grew stronger when Mrs Terry was diagnosed with cancer in December 2012 after a routine smear test. She said: ‘I urgently needed intense radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Dean and I desperately wanted a sibling for Saoirse but it would destroy my eggs and leave my uterus too scarred to carry a baby.’ When she told her family the heartbreaking news, her sister instantly volunteered to carry a baby for her. Dean and Siobhan Terry with their daughter Saoirse . ‘As soon as I said it, it felt right,’ said Miss Fairfax. ‘We’d always adored being one of four and I couldn’t imagine her just having one child.’ By last August Mrs Terry had successfully completed her treatment and the sisters announced their plans to their parents, Patricia, 60, a clinical physiologist, and Peter, also 60, a retired teacher. Miss Fairfax recalled: ‘My mum was overwhelmed with emotion and incredibly proud.’ The sisters bought an artificial fertilisation kit on the internet. On the second month of trying Miss Fairfax discovered she was pregnant. ‘Incredibly I found out on Siobhan’s birthday. We were out walking in the park with Saoirse when I broke the news. ‘Although biologically the baby is my own child, I’ve always felt I’m not having him for me. So I’ve never worried I won’t be able to hand him to Siobhan when the time comes.’ Mrs Terry, who now has the all-clear from cancer, said: ‘My mum and I will be at Ellie’s side when she gives birth while Dean will wait outside the delivery room. ‘I would never have considered surrogacy with anyone other than my sister but it feels right our little boy will grow up with all of his family around him. ‘I am so thankful to Ellie – it’s a dream come true.’ The sisters are telling their story to raise awareness of cervical cancer: Find out more at www.jostrust.org.uk.","Siobhan Terry, 31, was diagnosed with cervical cancer and told that treatment would leave her infertile .

Andrew Sentance, who is now senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said the UK could leapfrog France by the end of the year as the recovery picks up pace. The prediction came as a report by rival accountancy firm Grant Thornton showed business confidence is at its highest level for more than 20 years. Senior economic adviser at PricewaterhouseCoopers Andrew Sentance says the UK economy could leapfrog France by the end of the year . The survey found 83 per cent of senior executives in the UK were optimistic about the future - up from 71 per cent at the end of last year, and the highest score since records began in 1992. In a further boost to Chancellor George Osborne, who has staked his political reputation on the recovery, official figures are today (TUES) expected to show the economy grew strongly in the first three months of 2014. The Bank of England believes gross domestic product (GDP) - the total size of the economy - grew by 1 per cent in the first quarter, and expects the second quarter 'to be only a little weaker'. The last time the economy grew by around 1 per cent for two quarters in a row was in mid-2007 before the meltdown at Northern Rock. Meanwhile, the pound surged to as much as $1.6856 yesterday - its strongest reading against the US dollar since 2009 - as the brightening outlook pushed the currency higher. Harry Adams, managing director of currency trading firm Argentex, said: 'There is a simple explanation for the pound's appreciation and that is the UK economy is exceeding nearly every economist's expectation.' The Bank of England believes gross domestic product (GDP) - the total size of the economy - grew by 1 per cent in the first quarter . Mr Sentance said that the UK economy is currently the sixth largest in the world but will overtake France 'in the next couple of years' based on forecasts by the International Monetary Fund. But he added that it could happen even sooner given the pace of the recovery in the UK and the weakness of the French economy. 'The UK economy now appears set to regain the position it enjoyed in world economic rankings before the financial crisis - fifth place behind the US, China, Japan and Germany,' said Mr Sentence, who sat on the Bank's interest rates setting monetary policy committee from 2006 to 2011. 'All these economies have bigger populations than us - so fifth place in the world will be as good as it gets for Britain in the modern global economy. 'With the French economy struggling, and the pound appreciating against the euro, the UK should resume its fifth position soon, quite possibly by the end of this year. That should be a cause for national celebration.' The growth spurt means that the economy is just weeks away from clawing back all the losses made during the what the IMF has called the Great Recession. GDP crashed 7.2 per cent in 2008 and 2009 and was still 1.4 per cent smaller than the pre-recession peak at the end of last year. Simon Kirby, an economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said most of the remaining lost ground has now been made up. 'I think GDP will surpass its pre-recession peak at some point in the next few months,' he said. Scott Barnes, chief executive of Grant Thornton, said business optimism 'has continued to bound ahead' in recent months in a sign 'the recovery is moving onto a more sustainable footing'. He said: 'It's immensely encouraging that the data for the UK has broken its previous record high for business optimism and provides strong hope that the recovery is truly taking hold. 'Mirroring the uptick in optimism across other parts of the world - particularly the US, China, Japan and Germany - suggests the major global economies are back on track and headed in the right direction which bodes well for British exporters.' The CBI last week reported that confidence among British manufacturers was at its highest level since 1973. Katja Hall, chief policy director at the CBI, said: 'Confidence is rapidly rising among British manufacturers, with a real sense of business optimism. Our industrial base is seizing a bigger role in the UK's economic recovery, with output, orders and hiring all on the up. 'There are still bumps in the road ahead. However, expectations for growth in the coming three months are positive and manufacturers plan to significantly ramp up investment in the year ahead.'","Andrew Sentance said UK could leapfrog .

"By . Mark Prigg . Even though North America is a full month into astronomical spring, the Great Lakes have been slow to give up on the harsh winter, Nasa has revealed. The space agency today published this stunning picture of the Great Lakes, showing a third of their expanse is still covered in ice. Lake Superior was found to be the most affected, and was found to be 63.5 percent ice covered on April 20th. On April 20, 2014, Nasa¿s Aqua satellite captured this natural-color image of Lake Superior, which straddles the United States¿Canada border. At the time Aqua passed over, the lake was a record 63.5 percent ice covered. Averaged across Lake Superior, ice was 22.6 centimeters (8.9 inches) thick; it was as much as twice that thickness in some locations. The great lakes in sunnier times: A third of their expanse is still covered in ice . The stunning image was taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite. It captured a unique natural-color image of Lake Superior, which straddles the United States–Canada border. At the time Aqua passed over, the lake was 63.5 percent ice covered, according to the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab (GLERL). Averaged across Lake Superior, ice was 22.6 centimeters (8.9 inches) thick; it was as much as twice that thickness in some locations. Researcher George Leshkevich said that ice cover this spring is significantly above normal. For comparison, Lake Superior had 3.6 percent ice cover on April 20, 2013; in 2012, ice was completely gone by April 12. In the last winter that ice cover grew so thick on Lake Superior (2009), it reached 93.7 percent on March 2 but was down to 6.7 percent by April 21. Average water temperatures on all of the Great Lakes have been rising over the past 30 to 40 years and ice cover has generally been shrinking. (Lake Superior ice was down about 79 percent since the 1970s.) But chilled by persistent polar air masses throughout the 2013-14 winter, ice cover reached 88.4 percent on February 13 and 92.2 percent on March 6, 2014, the second highest level in four decades of record-keeping. Based on data from Environment Canada, this graph shows the 2014 conditions for all of the Great Lakes in mid-April compared to the past 33 years. Lake Superior ice cover got as high as 95.3 percent on March 19. By April 22, it was reported at 59.9 percent. Air temperatures in the Great Lakes region were well below normal for March, and the cool pattern is being reinforced along the coasts because the water is absorbing less sunlight and warming less than in typical spring conditions. Lake Superior ice cover got as high as 95.3 percent on March 19. By April 22, it was reported at 59.9 percent; Lake Huron was nearly 30.4 percent. News outlets noted that as many as 70 ships have been backed up in Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie, waiting for passage into ports on Lake Superior. The U.S. Coast Guard has been grouping ships together into small convoys after they pass through locks at Sault Ste. Marie, in order to maximize ice-breaking efficiency and to protect ships from damage. Superior is the world’s largest freshwater lake by area (82,100 square kilometers or 31,700 square miles) and the third largest by volume. The waters average 147 meters (483 feet) in depth, and the basin is believed to hold about 10 percent of the world’s liquid fresh water. As many as 70 ships have been backed up in Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Erie, waiting for passage into ports on Lake Superior.

"By . Fiona Macrae . Slimmers, be warned. Having a few drinks can wreak havoc with your waistline – even if you’ve switched to a low-calorie tipple. Just one boozy session a week can lead to us taking on enough calories to put on 2lb, say experts. And most of the flab comes from food we polish off when we’ve been drinking, rather than from the alcohol itself. A mixed doner shawarma kebab: Feasting on fatty takeaways after the pubs have shut and combating a hangover with a full English breakfast can see men alone put away an extra 5,000 calories, research warns . Feasting on fatty takeaways after the pubs and clubs have shut and combating a hangover with a full English breakfast can see men alone put away an extra 5,000 calories. Even if we otherwise stick to a healthy regime, a regular once-a-week night out could make us pile on two stone over a year. Slimming World, which commissioned a survey into drinking habits, says more needs to be done to highlight alcohol’s role in weight gain and wants cans and bottles to clearly display calorie counts. The YouGov poll of more than 2,000 Britons reveals how drinking is contributing to the UK’s obesity crisis, which is now the worst in Europe. The average man reaches 'tipping point' - the moment we start to drink and eat more than intended - after 10.5 units of alcohol, or about four pints of beer, according to the study commissioned by Slimming World . It found that the average man reaches ‘tipping point’ – the moment we start to drink and eat more than intended – after 10.5 units of alcohol, or about four pints of beer. The female 'tipping point' is eight units - just two to three large glasses of wine: Beyond that, women consume an extra 5,725 calories . The extra drink after this point, combined with fatty food such as chips, kebabs, pizzas and hamburgers, leads to him packing away an extra 6,940 calories. This is more than three times the recommended daily intake for men and the equivalent of 38 bags of crisps. Drink adds 1,795 calories, while 3,126 comes from food eaten that evening. Eating unhealthy food the next day adds another 2,025. The female ‘tipping point’ is eight units – just two to three large glasses of wine. Beyond that, women consume an extra 5,725 calories – almost three times the daily recommended intake and the equivalent of nearly two dozen jam doughnuts. Almost 60 per cent of those surveyed said they pass their tipping point at least once during a typical weekend. With 3,500 calories roughly equal to a 1lb gain in weight, millions of Britons could be piling on the pounds because of nights out. Inactivity while nursing hangovers adds to the problem. Dr Jacquie Lavin of Slimming World said alcohol leads us to make unhealthy choices because it stimulates appetite and lowers inhibitions. Luciana Berger, Labour’s public health spokesman, called for ‘bold action’ but the Department of Health said it was making progress with the issue.","Boozy takeaways and hungover full English breakfasts can add 5,000 cals .

"By . Ian Ladyman . and Nick Harris . Ryan Giggs wants to show Manchester United he should be their next permanent manager. The United legend will begin his short stint as the club’s interim boss on Saturday and has already promised to ditch any players who don’t live up to Old Trafford standards. But it is understood Giggs covets the vacancy created by David Moyes’ dismissal and wants his former team-mates to give him four successive victories to make his case. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ryan Giggs introduced as 'David' by mistake . Give it me! Ryan Giggs (next to Phil Neville, Nicky Butt and Paul Scholes) wants the Man United job full-time . All smiles: Giggs is relishing the start but insists he will not underestimate Norwich . Task to come: Giggs leaves after his first press conference as interim manager at Carrington . Relishing: Giggs can't wait to get going as United interim boss against Norwich on Saturday . Club legend: Giggs speaks to MUTV for the first time since being appointed United intern boss . He said: ‘I have a chance to show what I can do, what I am capable of as a manager in a short space of time. It has been a frustrating season and I want to end it on a high.’ And he appeared to receive backing from Sir Alex Ferguson, who said: ‘He’s the one man they should have gone to. He’s got 20-odd years of experience at United. I signed him as a kid at 13. ‘He’s gone through all the gamut of  emotions at the club; he’s experienced all the highs and lows. He knows exactly what’s needed to be a United player.’ Giggs knows a bandwagon of public opinion will start rolling if United beat Norwich comfortably this evening in the Barclays Premier League. His appointment as temporary boss at his one and only club is a sentimental story and the  40-year-old played to the theme yesterday as he vowed to bring dashing, attacking football back to Old Trafford. Beneath that, though, lies a determination to be taken seriously as a candidate as United continue their attempts to lure No 1 choice Louis van Gaal from Holland. As it stands, Giggs has no chance of getting the job but he warned the players he will not tolerate failure. Ringing endorsement: Giggs admitted he called Sir Alex Ferguson first to gain advice . Sacked: David Moyes has now agreed a pay-off deal with Manchester United after being sacked on Tuesday . ‘I know the stadium will be bouncing . for this game,’ he added. ‘The players have been really good in training . this week and they are all excited as well. ‘There . will be no prouder person than me walking out at Old Trafford. The . hairs on the back of my neck will be standing up and I can’t wait. ‘I just want the players to enjoy themselves and give fans something to smile about in the remaining  four games. ‘We . have dropped below Man United standards this season. I want to bring . those standards back up to where a Manchester United player should be. And not just for one game, for every game. Every time you pull on the . red shirt you give everything you have got, otherwise you’re coming off. ‘We . have got four games to show what the players are capable of. That is my . focus. After that, it is another conversation — we’ll see where it . takes us.’ Giggs worked . under Moyes as player-coach this season but has been as dismayed as . anybody by how poor the performances were under the Scot. Old guard: Giggs (left) has taken over until the end of the season and is being assisted by Paul Scholes . Spot the difference: RVP with Giggs on Friday (left) and in a heated discussion with Moyes in October (right) Keeping up appearances: Giggs showed he's still got it during a break in training . Now the club’s most decorated player has a chance to put his stamp on things after first calling up Ferguson for advice. ‘I . played under Sir Alex for so long,’ said Giggs. ‘He was the first . person to call and I wanted advice and who better to ring? Why wouldn’t . I? ‘He’s been through . everything you can go through as a manager — as a young manager, as an . experienced manager, as a successful manager. ‘Yeah, . he’s given me advice, he’s told me that he’s always at the end of the . phone and that’s obviously given me a lot of comfort and it’s good to . know I can turn to the manager if I ever need him.’ Ferguson also praised Giggs’ move to reunite more members of the Class of 92. He . said: ‘I was so pleased he brought Paul Scholes back in, and Nicky Butt . of course — two great professionals. They understand the club. They are . hard workers. They are straight as a die. So you have got the right . combinations there. ‘It is what we were doing in the last few years with bringing Butt into the fold, Ryan into the fold, Scholes into the fold. ‘Gary Neville was offered a position but he decided to go into television. He could easily come back.’ Ferguson, . speaking at a charity event, praised Scholes in particular. ‘Paul is . one of these guys who has few words but the few words are so succinct, . accurate and to the point, he is brilliant at it. ‘Many . times I would bring in the older guard to discuss certain things that . we maybe wanted their opinion on. Scholesy had three or four words — . bang, bang, bang ... he was such a revelation for me for a young man to . be so positive, a decision maker. ‘Ryan . will get the benefit of that now. That was the first thing Ryan did, he . phoned up Scholesy, he was on holiday and called him back.’ Thumbs up: Giggs (right) moved Manchester United's press conferences to their academy building . First day: Giggs arrived for training as the new Manchester United interim manager on Wednesday . ON MOYES . 'I'd like to thank David for giving me my first chance in coaching. It was something I'll always remember when he rang me in the summer and asked me to come on board. Obviously I was still playing but he's given me my first opportunity of a coaching role. Secondly to say how proud I am to be managing Manchester United for the remaining games. 'It's a club I've been associated with for 25 years and it's a proud moment for me and one I will enjoy. I've enjoyed the week and I'm proud more than anything. It's probably the proudest moment of my career and one I'm going to enjoy for the remaining two and a half weeks of the season and bring back some smiles onto the faces of the fans.' ON MATCH AGAINST NORWICH . 'I'll just look forward to the game just as I did as a player. You prepare yourself during the week and can't wait for Saturday to come, 5.30pm against Norwich, I know the stadium will be bouncing. 'The players have been really good in training this week and they are all excited as well. Everyone is looking sharp and I just want them to enjoy themselves and give fans something to smile about in the remaining four games. It's been a frustrating season and I want to end it on a high. 'It has been a difficult week for the club and it was a shock to me on Tuesday when I spoke to Ed and he informed me David was leaving and then asked me to take over. It's been a bit of a whirlwind week for me but one I've enjoyed - it has been different, chaotic and I've been getting a little taste as it's my fourth day in the job. I can never imagine what you have to do and things it entails being a Manchester United manager.' ON BECOMING PERMANENT UNITED BOSS . 'I'm just concentrating on a short time, the four games remaining, that's the main focus on Saturday and Norwich as it's going to be a tough game with them fighting for their lives. After that, I've not really thought about it. 'I've just given myself a five-year contract! While I can! I haven't done much this week but am still involved as a player as well. I've trained OK this week and looked sharp, to be fair! No, everyone has looked sharp, 20-odd players are in with a chance. ANY MESSAGE FOR THE PLAYERS? 'I'll tell the players just to try to enjoy yourself, express yourself. I don't know if I'd be saying that as manager last week because the performance wasn't great but I've come into the job and my immediate aim is to win on Saturday and I felt just the way to do that is to make training as enjoyable as I can so they can go out and play and they have done that. 'It's going to be my philosophy, obviously the Manchester United philosophy as I've been here for all my career. I want players to play with passion, speed, tempo and be brave with imagination,  all the things that are expected of a Manchester United player. To work hard but, most of all, enjoy it. As a player I know if I'm enjoying the game I can express myself a lot more and that's what I'll be doing with the team tomorrow. 'It's been a frustrating season for everyone. We win together and lose together and in these remaining four games, I want to bring the positivity back. Three home games at Old Trafford, where the home form hasn't been great, and I want to see goals, tackles, players taking players on and getting the crowd up. I want the passion that should come with being a Manchester United player.' SUIT OR TRACKSUIT? 'I haven't decided.

"By . Bianca London . It was a stylish yet sombre affair at St. George's Church in London this afternoon as fashion's most powerful figures celebrated the life of the late Beatrix Miller. Beatrix, who passed away aged 90 in February, was editor of British Vogue between 1964-1986. Today's guests included American Vogue editor Anna Wintour, current British Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman, supermodel Twiggy, designer Jasper Conran and Bianca Jagger. Memorial: Anna Wintour attends a memorial service for former British Vogue Editor Beatrix Miller at St George's Church, who died aged 90 in February 2014 and was the editor of British Vogue from 1964 to 1986 . Other attendees included legendary photographers Terry O'Neill and Mario Testino. Miss Miller, as she was known to her employees, was born on in 1923 and began her journalistic career at The Queen, a British society magazine, where she started out as a secretary and worked her way up features editor. She relocated to New York in 1956, and joined Vogue as a copywriter. Fashionable friends: Current Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman, left, who says she looks back to Miller's work for inspiration, attended the event, as well as supermodel Twiggy, right . Good friend: Grace Coddington, centre, creative director of American Vogue, dressed in a casual black outfit for the event . Later, in 1958, she returned to The Queen as editor - revamping it and transforming it into a glossy magazine aimed at young women, rather than the older socialites who had previously made up the readership. She landed the role of editor of British Vogue in 1964, where she worked tirelessly. The proof was in her final issue of the magazine; the largest ever at 470 pages. Miss Miller never married and her employees said she dedicated her life to Vogue. She retired in 1984 and joined forces with Terence Conran and Jean Muir to establish a think tank, which linked the government and fashion industry. Roll call of fashion's most famous faces: Bianca Jagger, former model and ex-wife of Mick Jagger, left, and Welsh designer Jasper Conran, right, also made an appearance . Her favourite snappers: Renowned fashion photographers Terry O'Neill, left, and Mario Testino, arrived at St. George's . Colourful outfit: Zandra Rhodes, CBE, English fashion designer, ensured all eyes were on her at the event, left, and Nicky Haslam, interior designer and socialite also made an appearance . She died on 21 February 2014. Opera director Patrick Kinmonth wrote for Vogue in her memory: 'Her permanent influence hangs over all of us like the smoke from her cigarettes: a strange and fascinating cocktail of intimidating school matron, hyper-dignified spinster, brilliant and imaginative headmistress, all electrified by a low threshold of boredom, a genuinely acute literary mind, and an almost total lack of interest and confidence in her own appearance. Legend: Miss Miller, as she was known to her employees, was born on in 1923 and began her journalistic career at The Queen, a British society magazine, where she worked as a secretary . 'But when she laughed her rare, shy, intimate, genuine laugh, she could be utterly captivating, even if her hair gave her grief and she had no interest in personally dressing the part of Vogue.' Current Vogue editor, Alexandra Shulman, added: 'I often look back at her Vogues for inspiration and of course because, like myself, her career was rooted in journalism not fashion. 'I find the most wonderful articles alongside the fashion images, so many of which are now so famous. She saw Vogue as a chronicler of a particular world and she did a wonderful job.' Finding fame: Her journalistic coup came when she landed the role of editor of British Vogue in 1964, where she worked tirelessly.

"By . Mark Prigg . Samsung has come under fire for preloading its handsets with its own apps which can leave customers with just half the amount of advertised storage on flagship  models. Researchers have found that the so-called 'bloatware' is rarely used by consumers, with many spending just seconds on the apps before deciding to use downloaded apps instead. Samsung supplies everything from chat to password apps, some pre-installed with the device and the remaining accessible via Google Play and Samsung App stores. Samsung has come under fire for the amount of 'bloatware' it preloads on its handsets, with claims the apps are rarely used by consumers . Despite Samsung's heavy push in content and apps,  Galaxy S3 and S4 users look beyond its ecosystem for the vast majority of apps. Bloatware is the name for any unwanted software or apps that are preinstalled onto phones, tablets, or computers. As well as taking up space that can be used for photos and other personal files, bloatware can also slow down your device. Bloatware can also refer to extras that come with wanted software including browser toolbars, desktop widgets or other unwanted additions. 'Despite Samsung’s  heavy push in content and app strategy through Samsung App Store, Media Hub, and in-house apps,  Galaxy S3 and S4 users look beyond its ecosystem for the vast majority of on-device usage,' said Strategy Analytics, which analysed the data. Based on AppOptix March 2014 US panel data on 250-plus Galaxy S3 and S4 users, the total time spent across key Samsung Apps on its flagship devices - Galaxy S3 and S4 – came just under 7 minutes, whereas the same Galaxy user spent 149 minutes amongst three of Google Apps. 'In terms of content discovery and updates, Samsung Hub and Samsung App Store, its primary channel for content downloads, is again lagging behind the segment leader by a wide margin. ,' said the firm. Recent tests by Which? magazine found that unwanted bloatware and system files still occupy 46 per cent of the phone's internal storage - eight months after intial concerns were raised. At the opposite end of the scale, Apple's iPhone 5C was the best performing handset, assigning a relatively low 21 per cent of storage to built-in apps and the iOS operating system. Google apps, by comparison, were a huge hit with Samsung customers . Bonny Joy, Chief, Consumer Telemetry Platforms, said:  “Clearly, Galaxy Sx series have succeeded in creating more engagement by growing the overall pie, but its own content and media strategy is faring low at the moment. 'Galaxy S5 is a step-upgrade from the Galaxy S4, but as far as content and media is concerned, little has changed to draw consumer attention to its latest launch.' AppOptix data shows a typical Galaxy S3/S4 user spends 64 minutes/month (combined) on Google Play, whereas the same figures for Samsung Hub and Samsung App store are just 0.6 minutes. However, in terms of overall usage, Galaxy is a top performing device, where Galaxy S3 and S4 users (combined) consume 14% more video and 24% more data above the industry average. Barry Gilbert, Vice President, said: 'Our data shows that Galaxy S4 users on average have 21 more apps (includes pre-installed and downloaded) than the industry average. 'Obviously, Samsung’s dominant position in the market is an ideal vehicle to drive own-branded content services across its installed base, but Samsung should develop a differentiated set of apps that will resonate with its key user base.' One of Samsung’s famous apps, ChatOn, which is said to have crossed the 100 million users mark, was used for just 6 seconds per month by the users. In comparison, users spent over 151 minutes on Instagram and over 11 hours on Facebook per month. In January, Which? magazine tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets from Samsung, Apple, BlackBerry, LG, HTC and Google, pictured. Samsung's Galaxy S4 was the worst performing handset, with only 54% (8.56GB) of available storage, while Apple's iPhone 5C was the best, with 79% (12.6GB) Bloatware includes apps and files . that are added to handsets by the manufacturers and networks before they . are sold to customers. Which? magazine recently tested the eight most popular 16GB handsets including Apple's iPhone 5S and 5C, Samsung's Galaxy S4, Google's Nexus 5, the Sony Xperia Z1, BlackBerry's Z30, the HTC One Mini and LG's G2. The . S4 offers just 8.56GB of available storage, down from 8.8GB in tests carried out in May. Apple's iPhone 5C has 12.6GB, while the iPhone 5S offers slightly less at 12.2GB. LG's G2 and HTC One Mini have just short of 11GB of available space each - 10.37GB and 10.44GB respectively. Some of the preinstalled Samsung files are needed for its new features, such as eye tracking, air gestures and voice commands. Some of the preinstalled Samsung files on the S4, pictured, are needed for features such as eye tracking, air gestures and voice commands. Others, however, are unnecessary or unwanted utility apps, games and the S Travel and S Health hubs. Many of which can't be removed . Others, however, are unnecessary or . unwanted utility apps, games and the S Travel and S Health hubs. To add . insult to injury, many of these apps and hubs can't be removed. It's . likely the difference between Apple's models are due to the iPhone 5S . running more advanced features than the 5C, and the extra files needed . for the fingerprint scanner. As technology researcher Jon Barrow explained in a blog post: . 'The reality is every phone has to sacrifice some of its internal . memory to the operating system - they never live up to the sales talk of . 8,16 or 32GB. 'But . many manufacturers further stuff their phone with pre-loaded apps, skins . and bloatware. And no phone has more piping, braiding and frills than . the Samsung Galaxy S4.' Apple's iPhone 5C, pictured, has 12.6GB of available space, while the high-end iPhone 5S offers slight less, as 12.2GB. It's likely the difference between Apple's models are due to the 5S running more advanced features than the 5C, and the extra files needed for the fingerprint scanner . The Samsung findings show the handset has not improved since tests last May - and has actually got worse. Samsung responded to criticisms at the time advising people that a solution that to the problem is to buy a MicroSD card if they want extra storage: 'For the Galaxy S4 16 GB model, approximately 6.85 GB occupies the system part of internal memory, which is 1 GB bigger than that of the Galaxy S3, in order to provide a high resolution display and more powerful features to our consumers,' explained the Korean firm. 'To offer the ultimate mobile experience to our users, Samsung provides a microSD slot on Galaxy S4 for extension of memory.' Yet, as Barrow points out, the three phones that topped the latest Which? tests - Apple's iPhone 5C, 5S and Google's Nexus 5 - don't have memory card slots meaning that although they offer more overall, this can't be expanded like the S4.","Owners spent less than seven minutes a month using Samsung apps .

"By . Eve Mcgowan . Recent warnings that alcoholic drinks are high in sugar were depressing for those fond of a tipple. With four teaspoons of sugar in a pint of bitter and two-and-a-half in a glass of prosecco, experts say drinking can dramatically up your sugar consumption – the detrimental effects of which have lately been compared to tobacco. Doctors now agree that reducing sugar intake  is key to good health and losing weight, and last month the UN’s World Health Organisation slashed the daily recommended amount by half to about six level teaspoons of added sugar a day. Great British Booze Swap: Debbie Lawrence, 31, swapped her two bottles of wine per week for beer, and her boyfriend Dan Bartholomew, 31, went from whisky to lager . Experts are advising people watching their weight and sugar intake to cut down on all alcohol. ‘It’s important people realise alcohol is a major source of calories and sugar,’ says Graham MacGregor, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the Wolfson Institute, Queen Mary University of London, and chairman of Action on Sugar. ‘While a glass of red or white wine is a nice accompaniment to a meal, it means extra calories.’ But is cutting out alcohol a realistic goal – or even really necessary?  With such a broad spectrum of sugar content, from only a trace in gin and rum to 10g in a pint of premium lager, clearly not all drinks are detrimental to your waistline. Changing tipple: London teacher Becky Swain, 30, switched her real ale for red wine while her partner Sri Sothall, 30, lost weight when he started drinking spirits . ‘It’s hard to avoid sugar when you drink but  you can limit the damage by being careful,’ says nutritional therapist Jackie Lynch (well-well-well.co.uk). 'Spirits and red and dry white wine have far less sugar than beer or lager, so your choice of tipple makes a difference.’ However, it’s important to remember that per millilitre, spirts are still the highest in calories as alcohol contains more calories than sugar – and high alcohol consumption carries severe health risks. ‘I encourage clients to swap to a single shot of vodka with a slimline mixer. 'That avoids the peer pressure (and self-denial) of not drinking, yet you’ll consume up to four teaspoons less sugar than from a large glass of wine or beer.’ We set out to investigate whether you could change your health (and weight) by changing what you drink. We asked two couples to swap their drinking preferences for a month. Each couple drank two to three units of their chosen alcohol four times a week and stuck to their usual dietary and exercise routines. Jackie then helped explain changes in their weight. The couples used Tanita body composition monitor scales to measure their weight, fat and visceral fat – the fat around internal organs measured on a scale from 1 to 59: a rating of 13 or over indicates excess levels.","Debbie Lawrence, 31, swapped her two bottles of wine per week for beer .

"By . Wills Robinson . A British tourist left with half a head after falling from the balcony of a Thai hotel has had his skull rebuilt - with the same metal used in space shuttles. Lee Charie, 32, from Stansted Abbots in Hertfordshire, was discovered lying on the floor with the left side of his skull smashed in after the falling 22ft from a hotel walkway in Koh Tao in 2012. Sixteen months after the plunge, he has had a six-inch titanium plate fitted to cover the dent, and now hopes to find a 'beautiful wife' and win the lottery. Scroll down for video . Before and after: Lee Charie, 32, had to have part of his skull removed after falling 22 feet from a balcony in Thailand two years ago . Tough: The plate now in his skull is made from strong titanium, the same material used in space shuttles . After the horrific incident, paramedics . managed to resuscitate the extra from The Only Way is Essex after two . days without showing any signs of life. But to allow his brain to recover, doctors removed a quarter of his smashed skull. When he was well enough to be transferred back to Britain two weeks later, he was handed the missing chunk of his head in a box and carried it in his luggage. Now the swimming pool maintenance worker's head has been fixed - with a plate made from metal normally found in the fuselage of space shuttles and passenger jets. Mr Charie said: 'There's a big slab of titanium in my head now and I've got the nickname 'space shuttle head' from my mates. 'The first thing I thought when I got it was that when I go through metal detectors at the airport it's going to go off. 'There has been lots of positives since having the implant. I do feel more confident with it. 'But physically I still have to be really careful with it and it can be painful. I can't party like I used to. Consultation: Experts at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge then used the bone to mould the plate in place . 'When I think about the accident I still get emotional. I think about my parents and family and what they had to go through. 'The worst part of the whole ordeal was realising emotionally that I died and they brought me back to life. 'Now I am just thinking about moving on with my life and moving into a new place. The whole thing has given me perspective.' He had planned to spend 30 days in Thailand as part of a return trip to the country. But while staying in the Tommy Resort, in Koh Tao, he fell from a second floor walkway smashing the side of his skull. He had to have part of his skull removed while in intensive care for a fortnight and his family were told he could be paralysed down his right-hand side. Size: The plate is around six inches long and is made from the same material used to construct giant passenger jet . But luckily the 32-year-old was strong enough to be transferred back to Britain on January 18. He brought the fragment back to the UK in a sterile box in hand luggage which was guarded by his doctor. Experts at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge then used the bone to mould a new titanium plate to be fitted in his head. The plate is around six inches long and is made from the same material used to construct giant passenger jets and even space ships. During the four hour operation, surgeons had to cut open his head and use three screws to fit the titanium plate over the gap in his skull . During the four hour op surgeons had to cut open his head and use three screws to fit the titanium plate over the gap in his skull. The procedure would normally use four screws but Thai surgeons cut his skull too far back and there wasn't space to fit the final screw. Now Lee hopes he can finally move on with his life after a year of operations and rehabilitation. He said: 'You can't beat yourself up about something, at the end of the day I am here and I made it through. 'Now I just want to get a beautiful wife and win the lottery. Yeah, loads of money and beautiful women. No, I am just glad to be back. 'Last year I didn't have the chance to go out a lot. I couldn't stay awake for long periods of time. 'I used to be able to drink six or seven pints before getting drunk, now it's about three and I'm gone. 'So now I am just enjoying seeing my mates and doing normal things. Enjoying the things I have missed out on. Ambitions: Now the plate has been fixed, he wants to find a wife and win the lottery . 'I'm looking forward to going out a lot more this year and spending good times with good people.' Christine Harkin, Clinical Nurse Specialist for Neuro Trauma, said surgeons even used 3D imaging equipment to make sure the mould was a perfect fit. She said: 'The plate is made of titanium and is manufactured at the hospital by the Maxillo Facial Technicians. 'They use the part of the patient's bone that has been removed and use it to create a mould. 'The titanium is then hand-tempered and moulded into exactly the right shape to fit the patient's head. 'Modern techniques mean specialists can also use 3D imaging equipment to make sure the fit is 100 per cent accurate. 'Techniques are now changing and specialists are also looking at using different types of materials. 'On average, a plate like this would take several days to make and would cost around £900 to produce.'","Lee Charie, 32, smashed his skull while in Koh Tao in December 2012 .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . You might think the future of driving will be limited to ‘boring’ driverless cars that take us from place to place. But Toyota has other ideas in mind with their FV2 bike that looks like something out of the film Tron. They claim the bike, while autonomous, will be ‘driving fun in the future’ by reading your emotions and providing information on its augmented reality display. Scroll down for video . Although teased before, the bike has now been unveiled at the New York Auto Show, which runs from 18 to 27 April. If you think it looks like something plucked out of the realms of science fiction, you wouldn’t be wrong. The FV2, which stands for ‘Fun Vehicle 2,’ is intended to give us a glimpse of a future where vehicle interaction between man and machine is greater than ever. Length: 3 metresWidth: 1.6 metresHeight (sleep mode): 0.99 metresHeight (driving mode): 1.78 metresWheelbase: 2.36 metresSeating capacity: 1 . The bike has four wheels: one at the rear, two in the middle and one at the front. At the top of the bike is a sliding panel that closes when the bike is not in use. ‘Unlocking’ the bike will slide the panel up, allowing you to sit in the middle and also provide an interactive display on the panel’s interior. Using this display you can then give the bike a destination you wish to travel to. The 2010 movie Tron: Legacy features 'light cycles' that look fairly similar to Toyota's FV2 . The bike's display uses augmented reality to display real-time information, and the windshield also changes colour from red to green according to your mood . The bike seems to offer a number of different positions for a rider to be in, from kneeling to standing. How the rider would remain stable in some of these positions is unclear, but perhaps Toyota are planning to include safety handles of some kind. It’s also unclear what will power the bike, although an electric engine seems most likely. The sizeable rear of the bike could house the engine, or perhaps provide space for luggage as well. From the specifications the bike also seems quite large and fast – this is certainly something intended for road use rather than bike lanes or pavements. While the hardware specifications are still unknown, Toyota has been busy touting the interactive functionality. As mentioned earlier, the interior of the upright panel has an interactive display on which, among other things, you can enter destinations and view traffic reports. But the FV2 also reads emotions and can adjust its driving accordingly. The windshield, for example, changes colour with your mood. If you’re angry it will appear red, alerting other drivers to your agitated state of mind. It will only turn green when you’re in a better mood. And if you were upset, the FV2 might suggest going to one of your favourite spots to relax. Whether this will be more distracting than innovative remains to be seen. A model presents a Toyota FV2 concept vehicle on the media day of the 2014 Canadian International Auto Show at the Metro Toronto Convention Center in Toronto, Canada, 13 Feb 2014 . The Toyota FV2 is seen during the 2014 New York International Auto Show in New York, United States on 16 April 2014. The auto show will be open to the public on 18 April and will run through to 27 April . But don’t think the bike is all about automation. You can also direct the bike to enter ‘driver mode’, where you can control it by tilting your body from side to side. About halfway through the video, Toyota also shows how the interactive screen can be used to display augmented reality directions. No release date for the bike has been announced yet, and whether it would be allowed on main roads is unknown. But the design at least provides a glimpse of a future where driverless vehicles may be commonplace. For now, there is a 'Toyota FV2' app available on iOS and Android that lets you try driving the bike in a virtual environment. Toyota says their unique interactive FV2 bike design will be 'driving fun in the future' The FV2 bike can read your emotions and take you to your favourite places, according to Toyota .","The car giant has unveiled its futuristic FV2 automated bike design .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Britain’s nuclear dump in Cumbria is ‘virtually certain’ to leak radioactive waste and contaminate the coast, according to a report. Experts are concerned that the Drigg Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR), near Sellafield, will be eroded by rising sea levels, an internal Environment Agency document reveals. While there is no cause for immediate concern, scientists believe the repository will start leaking in a few hundred to a few thousand years’ time. An imposing sight: Experts are concerned that the Drigg Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR), pictured, will be eroded by rising sea levels leading to a leak of radioactive materials in a few hundred years' time, an internal Environment Agency document reveals . The Drigg Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) is the UK's national low level radioactive waste disposal facility. It is located in the West Cumbrian coastline and is one of 19 sites owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), operated by LLW Repository Ltd. Established in 1959, the site has disposed of the UK's low level waste for over 50 years, which is stored in containers. Low Level Waste is material that is contaminated by radioactivity through its use. It includes paper, plastics, clothing and scrap metal as well as building rubble from old nuclear facilities. Very Low Level Waste is also stored at the site from hospitals and universities. Low Level waste is the least dangerous category of radioactive waste and makes up 90 per cent of the UK's nuclear waste by volume, but because the radioactive content of the material is low, it contains less than 0.1 per cent of the total radioactivity. The waste arrives in containers, which are filled with grout to make a solid structure so that they can be stored safely in vaults. The large containers are stacked on top of one another in a similar way to those in a port. The Environment Agency document, obtained by The Guardian, suggests that it was a mistake to position the waste site so close to the Cumbrian coast because of the risk of flooding. ‘It is doubtful whether the location of the LLWR site would be chosen for a new facility for near-surface radioactive waste disposal if the choice were being made now,’ it reads. The site is not part of Sellafield, but is used by the nuclear reprocessing site and other nuclear facilities to store . material contaminated by radioactivity through its use, such as clothes . and tools, rather than spent nuclear fuel itself. High level nuclear waste is currently shipped to be processed abroad and the largest shipment to be sent from the UK so far has just arrived in Japan. A total of one million cubic metres of low level radioactive waste produced over the last 55 years is housed at the site, which could, in ‘a few hundred to a few thousand years from now’ work its way into the sea of west Cumbria. Experts are concerned that tiny particles to objects like tools which have been contaminated during use at nuclear sites, could find their way onto beaches in the future. A plan is being considered to house another 800,000 cubic metres of waste from power stations, nuclear submarines and weapons at the Drigg site over the next 100 years but environmental groups argue that given the potential for future leaks, such a move would be unethical and potentially dangerous. LLW Repository Ltd, the company that . operates the site, has reportedly described the risks as ‘insignificant’ and the Environmental Agency has stressed that the site is currently . safe. A total of one million cubic metres of radioactive waste produced over the last 55 years is housed at the LLW Repository (marked as Drigg), which could, in 'a few hundred to a few thousand years from now' work its way into the sea of west Cumbria. The repository is located nearby Sellafield, but is separate from the nuclear processing plant . The document, dated January 9, is the most recent risk assessment of coastal erosion at the waste repository. Experts think that erosion caused by storms and rising sea levels is all but inevitable as the site is between just five and 20 metres above sea level and the company behind the repository is already considering extra flood defences. Ian Parker, the Environment Agency’s group manager in Cumbria said: ‘It's highly probable the coast will erode and the waste will be disrupted,’ after detailed technical examinations. Tempestuous future? An Environment Agency study suggests that it was a mistake to position the waste site so close to the Cumbrian coast because of the risk of flooding. Whitehaven harbour is pictured during the January 2014 period of storm surge, which saw high tides and winds batter the Cumbrian coastline . He told The Guardian's Rob Edwards that the agency took ‘a very conservative approach’ its study. An Environment Agency spokesman told MailOnline:'Existing sites such as this must operate in line with our high expectations, along with our requirements and guidance, which are periodically reviewed and updated to reflect current best practice. 'The Low Level Waste Repository (LLWR) can continue to be operated safely; an Environmental Safety Case was made for dealing with the waste. 'We will not agree to any increases to the volume of waste that can be brought to this, or any other new site unless we are convinced it is safe to do so and all our requirements are met. The site is located near Sellafield (pictured) but is separate from the nuclear processing plant. It stores items like clothing and tools that have been contaminated with radiation, but are considered low level, as opposed to spent fuel rods . 'The operator must demonstrate that they can meet all the environmental safety criteria we set out for disposal sites, taking all relevant factors into account.' While no final decision about whether the site will be continued to be used is due until next year, LLW Repository Ltd has already places restrictions on the amounts of radioactivity that can be disposed of at the site to make sure that if there was a leak, people would be exposed to small doses of radiation. Dr Richard Cummings, the company’s head of science and engineering, explained that they work within incredibly strict regulations so that the effects of a future leak would be insignificant.","Experts are concerned that the Drigg Low Level Waste Repository, near Sellafield will be eroded by rising sea levels .

"By . Ben Spencer . Music really is the food of love, scientists have found. A woman's musical taste changes when she is at her most fertile, making her more responsive to men who are able to produce more complex music. The study, carried out at the University of Sussex, suggest that women only preferred better musicians as short-term lovers - not as long-term partners. Study: Scientists have found that a woman's musical taste changes when she is at her most fertile, making her more responsive to men who are able to produce more complex music . The research support naturalist Charles Darwin's theory that music's primary function is in sexual courtship. The study, published today by the Royal Society, might suggest why creative individuals are considered so desirable for short-term sexual relationships. Benjamin Charlton, the paper's author, said: 'The findings of this study provide the first support for Darwin's original contention that music evolved via sexual selection. 'These results suggest that women may acquire genetic benefits for offspring by selecting musicians able to create more complex music as sexual partners.' Results: The research support naturalist Charles Darwin's theory that music's primary function is in sexual courtship . Dr Charlton's study of nearly 1,500 women, with an average age of 28 years, who were not breastfeeding, pregnant or using hormonal contraception, involved two experiments. Women were asked to choose which of four thematically similar piano compositions, played by music software, was the most complex. The melodies progressed from a few chords and a simple rhythm to a greater variety of chords and a syncopated, off-beat rhythm. Another group of women were asked whether they would prefer the composer of the first simple or second more complex melody, either as a short-term sexual partner, or a longer-term partner in a committed relationship. Nature: Charles Darwin argued that birdsong and human music, having no other clear role in survival, must have had a role in sexual selection . The results showed that women only preferred composers of more complex music as short-term sexual partners at the point in their menstrual cycle when the chance of conception was at its highest. No preference was shown when women chose which composer they would prefer as a long-term partner in a committed relationship, the results revealed. The role of music in human evolution has long been a mystery to scientists. Charles Darwin argued that birdsong and human music, having no other clear role in survival, must have had a role in sexual selection. Whereas the role of music in the natural world has been accepted by zoologists, this is the first study that supports Darwin's views of music in human reproduction. Dr Charlton said: 'The ability to create complex music could be indicative of advanced cognitive abilities. 'Consequently, women may acquire genetic benefits for offspring by selecting musicians able to create more complex music as sexual partners.' He said: 'I suggest that music may have manifested itself in courtship contexts by allowing both men and women to display specific adaptive qualities. 'For instance, the ability to play an instrument could reflect excellent physical condition and learning capacity. 'Men and women may also have sung to each other to show how they can improvise novel melodies and perhaps display their creativity and ability to innovate.' But he added: 'Because women did not prefer composers of more complex music as long-term partners, however, it appears that the ability to produce complex musical sounds does not reflect skills valued in long-term mates, ie. increased ability to acquire material benefits such as food and shelter.' Success: A separate study published last year found that playing music to an egg in a dish in an IVF lab increased the chances of it being fertilised by 5 per cent . A separate study published last year found that playing music to an egg in a dish in an IVF lab increased the chances of it being fertilised by 5 per cent. Researchers from the Marques Institute fertility clinic in Barcelona said the tiny vibrations produced by the music helped fertilisation.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Poverty, drugs and alcohol may seem like the obvious causes of crime - but some scientists believe we should add lead to the list. For a number of years, researchers have been stating that the presence of toxic lead in the environment can damage a child’s brain, making them more likely to be violent later in life. They claim that lead could be a factor in explaining the dramatic surge in crime in England and Wales in the late 80s, which peaked in 1993 – and the fall in crime in recent years. For a number of years, researchers have been stating that the presence of toxic lead in the environment can damage a child¿s brain making them more likely to be violent later in life. When the amount of lead in the environment increased, this graph shows a corresponding rise in violent crime two decades later . In a BBC radio 4 programme last night, Dominic Casciani revisited the theory by looking at how crime rose from the mid-20th century before peaking in the early 90s and then falling back sharply. Previous explanations for this change include decline in the use of crack cocaine, the rise of zero-tolerance policing and even the legalisation of abortion. But in the early 1990s, U.S. economist and housing consultant Rick Nevin calculated the rise and fall of the presence of lead from petrol and he compared that curve to the modern history of violent crime. When the amount of lead in the environment increased, Mr Nevin showed a corresponding rise in violent crime two decades later.  When the amount of lead in the environment fell, violent crime reduced about 20 years later. In Britain, males ages 12-14 in 1958, born as leaded gas use rose after World War II, had higher index crime 'caution and conviction' rates than older teens born before that rise in lead exposure . Tetraethyl lead was used in early model cars to improve performance and reduce wear. Due to concerns over health risks, this type of petrol was slowly phased in the 1970s. Today, the most common way young children are exposed to lead is though contaminated household dust, ingested via normal hand-to-mouth activity as they crawl. Heavily-leaded circa-1900 paint can deteriorate by 'chalking', causing lead dust hazards, and lead-contaminated dust from lead paint in older homes. The leaded share of U.S. paint fell from nearly 100 per cent in 1900 to 35 per cent by the 1930s, but the the country didn’t ban lead paint until 1978. Lead-based paint in the United Kingdom was banned from sale to the general public in 1992, apart from for specialist use. Lead can be absorbed into bones, teeth and blood and be devastating to the human body, inhibiting oxygen and calcium transport as well as altering nerve transmission in the brain. Studies in the 1970s revealed that even low concentrations of lead in children can cause permanent damage including reduced IQ, learning disabilities, aggressive behaviour and shortened attention span. Lead-based paint in the UK was banned from sale to the general public in 1992, apart from for specialist use. Many cities in the U.S. removed lead from petrol in the mid-1970s and from paint a decade earlier. At the same time violent crime began to fall in the 1990s and has continued to fall since. Since then, the data for the lead theorists has become more detailed. Separate studies found a statistical correlation between lead levels and violence in Chicago, Minneapolis, San Diego and other U.S. cities. Today, the most common way young children are exposed to lead is though contaminated household dust, ingested via normal hand-to-mouth activity as they crawl. Heavily-leaded circa-1900 paint can deteriorate by 'chalking', causing lead dust hazards, and lead-contaminated dust from lead paint in older homes . Researchers took other causes such as social, economic and legal factors into account, including drug use, poverty, policing effort and incarceration rates. Mr Nevin told the MailOnline: 'My 2007 study shows the same relationship between lead exposure and both property crime and violent crime trends in the USA, Canada, Britain, France, Finland, Italy, West Germany, Australia, and New Zealand. 'Across all nine nations, the statistical best-fit time-lag for the impact of lead exposure was 18 years for property crime, 23 years for violent crime, and 19 years for overall index crime. 'The time lags are the same within each nation even though the rise and fall of gasoline lead occurred at different times in different nations.' Tetraethyl lead was used in early model cars to improve performance and reduce wear. Due to concerns over health risks, this type of petrol was slowly phased in the 1970s . Professor Howard Mielke, of Tulane University in New Orleans, who has studied the effect of lead on children, said there was a ‘strong association’ between criminal activity and lead in different parts of the city. He added that police were even using the data on lead to target specific areas of New Orleans where they expected crime to be higher. This would allow them to focus resources at particular crime hot spots where lead poisoning had been higher in the past. Dr Bernard Gesch told the BBC that the data now suggests that lead could account for as much as 90 per cent of the changing crime rate during the 20th Century across all of the world. But the BBC notes that this only remains a theory because nobody could ever deliberately poison thousands of children to see whether they became criminals later in life.","Global studies show when the amount of lead in an environment increased, there was a corresponding rise in violent crime two decades later .

"By . Mark Prigg . Netflix is to raise its prices for the first time in three years as the battle for online TV domination heats up. The increase, to take place sometime before July, will hike prices by $1 or $2 per month for new customers, and will help pay for more Internet video programming such as the smash hit 'House of Cards'. It comes amid fierce competition with Amazon and Hulu, while Microsoft and Yahoo have also revealed plans to produce their own shows. House of Cards with Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood and Robin Wright as Claire Underwood: amazon hopes to repeat the success of the show - but is increasing its fess to pay for it. The company added another 2.25 million Internet video subscribers during the first quarter to end March with 35.7 million U.S. customers. The company attracted another 1.75 million subscribers in Canada and overseas, leaving it with 12.7 million international customers. Netflix said current U.S. subscribers will continue to pay $8 per month for a 'generous time period' - but did not say how long that was. The move was announced as part of Netflix's first-quarter earnings report illustrates the financial pressures mounting on the company as its spends more money to license compelling content. The efforts are aimed at warding off competitive threats from Amazon.com Inc. and Hulu.com while Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc. also are gearing up to buy Internet video programming from Hollywood studios. Amazon recently raised the price of its Prime service, which includes an expanding Internet video library, from $79 to $99 annually. Investors evidently like the prospect of Netflix bringing in more revenue. Netflix's stock surged $22.12, or more than 6 percent, to $370.61 in extended trading after Netflix announced its plans. However, price increases are a risk for Netflix. The company was stung by a customer backlash in 2011, when it boosted rates by as much as 60 percent for U.S. customers who wanted to continue to Internet video and DVD-by-mail services. Netflix lost about 800,000 subscribers after the 2011 pricing change was announced, rattling investors so much that the company's stock plunged more than 80 percent before starting to rebound in August 2012. The price rise comes amid fierce competition with Amazon and Hulu, while Microsoft and Yahoo have also revealed plans to produce their own shows. Netflix has been on a roll since the backlash subsided. The company added another 2.25 million Internet video subscribers during the first quarter to end March with 35.7 million U.S. customers. That's up nearly 50 percent from 23.9 million U.S. subscribers in July 2012 while the company was still trying to sooth customers irked by the last price increase. The company attracted another 1.75 million subscribers in Canada and overseas, leaving it with 12.7 million international customers. Netflix's comeback has been propelled by the company's increasing emphasis on exclusive programming such as 'House of Cards,' an acclaimed series starring Kevin Spacey as a cunning politician with a ruthless plan to become President of the United States. Netflix released all 13 episodes in 'House of Cards' second season on Feb. 14, midway through the first quarter. Another popular Netflix series, 'Orange Is The New Black,' is returning with new episodes June 6, toward the final month of the current quarter. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said the company needs to charge higher prices so the Internet video service can afford to bid against its rivals for programming -and reach its long-term goal of 60 million to 90 million U.S. subscribers. 'If we want to continue to expand, to do more great original content, more series, more movies, we have to eventually increase prices a little bit,' Hastings said in a question-and-answer session streamed in an Internet video. Netflix Inc. earned $53 million, or 86 cents per share, during the first three months of the year. That compared to $2.7 million, or 5 cents, last year. The latest quarterly earnings exceeded the average estimate of 81 cents per share among analysts surveyed by FactSet. Revenue rose 24 percent from last year to $1.3 billion to match analyst projections.","Increase of $1-$2 per months for new customers .

"By . Mark Prigg . The world's last uncontacted tribes could be monitored using satellites and online service, researcher have said. A US team has already used Google Earth images to assess the demographic health of a village of isolated people on the border between Brazil and Peru. They say mapping sites could hold the key to remotely keeping an eye on the tribes without contacting them. Members of an uncontacted tribe in the Brazilian state of Acre, as seen from satellite images. Photo courtesy of Government of Brazil. The researchers were able to find the area on Google maps and estimate the population. Lowland South America, including the Amazon Basin, harbors most of the last indigenous societies that have limited contact with the outside world. Studying these tribes, located deep within Amazonian rainforests, gives scientists a glimpse at what tribal cultures may have been like before the arrival of Europeans. Researchers at the University of Missouri used satellite images to assess the demographic health of one particular village of isolated people on the border between Brazil and Peru. Remote surveillance is the only method to safely track uncontacted indigenous societies and may offer information that can improve their chances for long-term survival, the team claim. They used Google Earth satellite imagery to estimate the area of the fields and the size of the village belonging to the tribe. The team was also able to ascertain as the living area of the tribeâ€™s temporary housing, and compared their data with similar estimates for 71 other Brazilian indigenous communities have have been monitored in the past. 'We found that the estimated population of the village is no more than 40 people,' Rob Walker, who led the study, said. Pictures from Survival International of what they say are uncontacted Indians seen from a Brazilian government's observation aircraft in the Brazilian Amazon. researchers are now using Google Earth to estimate populations . The Indians appear be to healthy and could be running from Peru due to a invasion of their lands by loggers. 'A small, isolated village like this one faces an imminent threat of extinction. However, forced contact from the outside world is ill-advised, so a non-invasive means of monitoring the tribe is recommended. 'A remote surveillance program using satellite images taken periodically of this group would help track the movements and demographic health of the population without disrupting their lives. Surveillance also can help locate isolated villages, track patterns of migration over time, and inform and create boundaries or buffer zones that would allow tribes to stay isolated, Walker said. 'Close to 100 uncontacted groups are thought to currently exist in Amazonia. 'Deforestation, cattle ranching, illegal mining, and outside colonization threaten their existence. 'Most of these tribes are swidden horticulturalists and so their slash-and-burn fields are observable in satellite images. 'But, they do move around, sometimes in response to external threats, and this movement requires constant monitoring if there is to be any hope of preserving their habitat and culture.'","100 uncontacted tribes are believed to exist in the Amazon .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Robots may have the upper hand when completing complex, repetitive tasks – but when it comes to human interaction, they still have a lot to learn. Now one droid, named Charlie, is hoping to change all that by copying the body language of humans to get people to do exactly what he wants. Standing at five feet (152cm) tall, with two large arms that mimic the range of motion of a human arm, Charlie has now mastered the task of handing an object to someone. Scroll down for video... Researchers are programming robots to communicate with people using human-like body language and cues. Pictured is  AJung Moon, a PhD student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at British Columbia University with Charlie . The $400,000 ($238,000) humanoid robot, picks up a water bottle, briefly glances at the drink and then extends the bottle, with its two camera eyes rising to meet the gaze of the human. It might sound like a simple task, but the two-second act is the result of months of painstaking research and programming. Past studies have shown that people have difficulty figuring out when to reach out and take an object from a robot because droids fail to provide appropriate nonverbal cues. ‘We hand things to other people multiple times a day and we do it seamlessly,’ said AJung Moon, a PhD student at the University of British Columbia in Canada. School can be a daunting place for children with autism – with many struggling to communicate with peers and stay focused. But one school think they have found a solution – robot teachers. Topcliffe Primary in Birmingham is the first in the country to use humanoid robots to help teach pupils with autism. The knee-high machines, which are designed to move in the same way as children, can be programmed to have conversations, play games, dance and even take classes. But unlike human teachers, Max and Ben have blank features, no emotions and standardised expressions and responses. It is this, according to head teacher, Ian Lowe that makes the robots much easier for autistic to children to relate to and understand. ‘Getting this to work between a robot and a person is really important if we want robots to be helpful in fetching us things in our homes or at work.’ Ms Moon and her colleagues studied what people do with their heads, necks and eyes when they hand water bottles to one another. They then tested three variations of this interaction with Charlie and the 102 study participants. Programming Charlie to use eye gaze as a nonverbal cue made the handover more fluid. Researchers found that people reached out to take the water bottle sooner in scenarios where the robot moved its head to look at the area where it would hand over the water bottle. People also took the cue to reach out for the bottle when Charlie looked to the handover location and then up at the person to make eye contact. Understanding the human-robot interaction could inform everything from rehabilitation for ailments like stroke applications such as factory production and manufacturing. ‘We want the robot to communicate using the cues that people already recognise,’ said Ms Moon. ‘This is key to interacting with a robot in a safe and friendly manner.’ Standing at five feet (152cm) tall, with two large arms that mimic the range of motion of a human arm, Charlie has now mastered the task of handing an object to someone .","Humans have .

"By . Mark Prigg . They are an incredible glimpse into how long plants have existed on Earth. Artist Rachel Sussman spent a decade tracking down the oldest living things on the planet, photographing each one. She found everything from a 2,000 year old shrub in the Atacama desert in Chile to stromatolites in Australia, primeval organisms tied to the oxygenation of the planet and the beginnings of life on Earth. Scroll down for video . This dense flowering shrub, a relative of parsley, is more than 2,000 years old, and was found in the Atacama desert in Chile. It contains thousands of branches with tiny leaves, and is so dense you can stand on top of it. Author Rachel Sussman tracked down each plant for the book. The cover shows a 9,500 year old pine tree in Sweden. The trunk in the center shot up in the last 50 years, thanks to a warming climate, Sussman said. Called 'The Oldest Living Things in the World', the book is described as 'an epic journey through time and space'. Over the past decade, artist Rachel Sussman worked with biologists to identify each of the plants, then travelled the world to photograph them. The idea for the book was to include only continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older. Sussman said the project was inspired by a holiday to Japan.'I was travelling in Japan and heard about a 2,180 year old tree.'When I was home in New York, I was thinking about the tree and got the idea for the book.' The project is part art and part science, said Sussman, who was recently named a 2014 Guggenheim Fellow. 'I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age as we consider it year zero.'she said one of the most interesting areas was Greenland. 'Visiting Greenland as like travelling back in time, I was dropped off by boat ona Fjord and couldn't find the researchers I was supposed to meet, and had no idea what to do. 'We went fishing in a glacial stream, the fish were so abundant, you cold reach in and grab a foot long trout - it was like visiting a more innocent time on the planet's life.' Other plants include Greenlandic lichens that grow only one centimeter a century, to unique desert shrubs in Africa and South America, a predatory fungus in Oregon, Caribbean brain coral, to an 80,000-year-old colony of aspen in Utah. Stromatolites, which are the oldest living organisms on the planet, and some scientists believe were the first living things on Earth. These examples are 2-3,000 years old, and are in Western Australia . Sussman also journeyed to Antarctica to photograph 5,500-year-old moss; Australia for stromatolites, primeval organisms tied to the oxygenation of the planet and the beginnings of life on Earth; and to Tasmania to capture a 43,600-year-old self-propagating shrub thatâ€™s the last individual of its kind. 'I'm often asked if there are animals - and they just aren't old enough, the oldest animal is 175,' Sussman said. 'These plants are a barometer of our future. 'They have survived for millenia, they had withstood untold natural perils, and now some are in jeopardy. 'I hope we can draw attention to them, and help play a part in their continued longevity.'

The discovery was made at Blackfriars - an area of to the west of Leicester city centre which archaeologists have been digging since January . The Corieltauvi were a tribe of people who controlled most of the East Midlands and the whole of Lincolnshire in the Late Iron Age (100 BC-AD 50). Previous investigations have suggested that the area was likely to have been of great importance during the Iron Age. Inside a ditch at the site, researchers unearthed high-status late Iron Age pottery along with a number of fragments of coin mould. Previous investigations have suggested the Blackfriars area in Leicester was likely to have been of great importance during the Iron Age . The Corieltauvi were a tribe of people . who controlled most of the East Midlands and the whole of Lincolnshire . in the Late Iron Age (100 BC-AD 50). They are thought to have been largely agricultural people and from the start of the 1st century, they began to produce inscribed coins. The tribe is thought to have produced gold and silver coins for the coveted Hallaton Treasure. This is the largest hoard of British Iron Age coins and was discovered in 2000 in southeast Leicestershire. The Corieltauvi had no centralised government, but it is thought they maintained an independent local government structure. Archaeologists believe it is possible that some of the coins in the Hallaton Treasure were minted at the site. The Hallaton Treasure, the largest hoard of British Iron Age coins, was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton in southeast Leicestershire. Several years ago, the 2,000-year-old remains of three large dogs were found buried at the Iron Age site. The dogs were average height for Iron Age canines and this led to speculation that they were guard dogs buried to safeguard the treasures. Leicester's significance continued after the arrival of Rome, with the town being the Civitas capital located on the Fosse Way. The site at Blackfriars has provided evidence of timber buildings and associated late Iron Age and early Roman pottery. Then in the 2nd century AD, possibly prompted by the visit to Britain of Emperor Hadrian in AD 122, the town was heavily re-planned, with many of the timber buildings being removed and replaced by larger, stone-structures. Blackfriars is an area off to the west of Leicester city centre. The site at Blackfriars has provided evidence of timber buildings and associated late Iron Age and early Roman pottery . Blackfriars has revealed the remains of a substantial Roman building including its sizeable outer walls, internal floors and column bases of a colonnade. The building itself appears to have changed form and function over time, with structural alterations and multiple floor layers being identified. Eventually the building fell into disuse before being heavily robbed of its masonry during the medieval period for the construction of the townâ€™s religious and public buildings. Other finds from the site, which are being documented in a blog by Wardell Armstrong Archaeology, include Roman tweezers, brooches, coins and painted wall plaster.","Discovery was made at Blackfriars, an area west of Leicester city centre .

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated  Press Reporter . Shamed Yankees drugs cheat Alex Rodriguez has made good on his promise to take the fight against his historic ban to court. The suspended slugger filed a lawsuit Monday in federal court against both Major League Baseball and the player’s union seeking to overturn his banishing for the 2014 season. The lawsuit also made public the entire 33-page decision made by arbitrator Fredric Horowitz after a series of contentious hearings between A-Rod, the league, the player’s union and Tony Bosch. A man of his word: Alex Rodriguez vowed Saturday in a statement to take the fight to federal court . ‘We recognize the standard to overturn an arbitration is a high one,’ attorney Jordan Siev, part of A-Rod’s legal team, told ESPN. ""But we think this proceeding was so flawed from beginning to end, including obvious bias from arbitration Horowitz in favor of MLB, which is put forth in our complaint.' The suit comes only one day after ’60 Minutes’ aired a shocking interview during which Mr Bosch admitted to personally injected steroids into Mr Rodriguez, directing his doping regimen and even drawing blood from him in a Miami nightclub bathroom stall. ‘Given the intense public interest in this matter and Commissioner Selig's disclosures last night on '60 Minutes,' it's difficult to imagine that any portion of this proceeding should be under seal,’ U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III said during the hearing. ‘Mr. Rodriguez is directed to file his unredacted complaint with the attached exhibits,’ he added. The third baseman’s legal team had originally brought a redacted lawsuit ‘in an abundance of caution,’ according to Mr Siev, who said Mr Rodriguez and his lawyers were afraid of running afoul of the collective bargaining agreement between the players union and the league. Out in the open: The lawsuit comes only one day after Tony Bosch spilled the beans to '60 Minutes' ‘We're perfectly content to unredact and file the entire complaint,’ Mr Siev continued. Players Association lawyer Dave Prouty unsuccessfully argued in favour of the redacted complaint, saying ‘the [union] believes that those matters should stay confidential, that is, the decision and the underlying proceedings.’ ‘We're thrilled,’ said Mr Siev. ‘We want the entire record to be public. We want everyone to be able to see exactly what Bosch said.’ A-Rod legal team frontman Joe Tacopina had to participate in the hearing via telephone, ESPN noted, but MNr Siev picked up right where his co-defense council left off last night on ’60 Minutes.’ ‘The introduction of triple, quadruple hearsay, inauthentic documents, documents that were stolen not once, but twice that were presented out of order, that were presented in incomplete fashion that Bosch couldn't even identify - all of this was relied on without question by (Horowitz),’ Mr Siev griped. Mr Rodriguez’s team was denied access to the actual Blackberries. ‘MLB had two experts that were allowed to examine those Blackberries with unfettered access. We didn't get one,’ Mr Siev continued. No refuting: MLB COO Rob Manfred told '60 Minutes' that A-Rod never tried to defend himself against Mr Bosch's allegations during the arbitration hearings that resulted in the 162-game ban . The lawyer then bashed MLB Commissioner Bud Selig for talking to ’60 Minutes’ but not testifying during the hearing, which famously caused Mr Rodriguez to storm out in a fit. ‘One thing that was very interesting was whenever we had discussions on ways to resolve this, MLB was adamant that they wanted 162 games,’ said Mr Siev. ‘Lo and behold, where did this decision come out? It is all in the complaint.’ MLB chief operating officer Rob Manfred was quick to point out that the 14-time all-star never testified during the arbitration hearings in his own defense, he never tried to refute Mr Bosch’s claims. The ballplayer claimed in a statement issued shortly after the suspension was announced that the arbitration process was unfair and that the deck was stacked against him. Running out of options: A-Rod has no where else to turn should this lawsuit not go his way . 'This is one man's decision, that was not put before a fair and impartial jury, does not involve me having failed a single drug test,' the former MVP said. The league will almost certainly call him to the stand during the upcoming civil trial – and he can be asked about anything, including steroids, human growth hormone and whatever else he may have ingested. The only way Mr Rodriguez is likely to get his suspension overturned is by testifying under oath or submitting a sworn document he didn’t take the drugs he is accused of taking, a New York Daily News legal analyst said. Should he go that route and be found guilty of taking the banned substances, the next chapter in this saga would be a criminal trial. The player fans deride as A-Roid will finally have his day in court either way, but the truth may set him free or see him locked up.","Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez was suspended for the entire 2014 season including the playoffs .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . and Candace Sutton . Geoff Huegill has broken his silence and issued a brief statement to reporters outside his Darlinghurst home in the wake of being charged, alongside wife Sara, with possessing cocaine on Saturday. The pair will face court on May 14 over possessing an illicit drug. 'I realise that this has caused some commotion,' he told reporters this afternoon. 'Some people feel that they have been let down and I deeply apologise for that. But I would ask everyone to understand that a this matter is before the courts I won’t be making anymore other statements until the matter has been resolved. 'Thank you very much and we will speak to you again soon.' MailOnline revealed this morning that Heugill was dropped as a national ambassador for AustSwim - Australia's peak water safety and training body - after the allegations became public. This morning, AustSwim CEO Gordon Mallet told MailOnline the move came after 10 years' service from Huegill and described the situation as 'regrettable'. Scroll down for video .

Fall from grace: Huegill issued a brief apology despite his lawyer saying yesterday he wouldn't be talking . Charged: Geoff Huegill and wife Sara were charged after allegedly being found with white powder on Saturday . 'At the moment we've suspended his activities for us, pending the outcome of further legal outcomes,' Mr Mallet said. 'The alleged incident is out of character but Austswim has zero tolerance and we've suspended the relationship to let natural justice take its course' Mr Mallet said he has shared written correspondence with Huegill since the drug charge became public and that 'he's extremely upset and remorseful'. Huegill, 35, was at the newly-renovated racecourse with his wife Sara Hills, 30, late on Saturday afternoon around an hour after the last race had run when police and security guards watched CCTV of the couple entering a disabled toilet together. He is still listed as an ambassador on the Austswim website.

The Huegills, who are the parents of two daughters, Mila, 2, and a three month old baby girl, were guests at the running of the Australian Turf Club's $400,000 race, the Champagne Stakes, which is sponsored by Moet & Chandon. Police noticed the couple stayed in the toilets for some time. When the Huegills re-emerged and returned to the Moet & Chandon private box, police interviewed and around 5.45pm allegedly took possession of a small bag of cocaine. A group of police then made a detailed search of the area with a sniffer dog. Through their lawyer, Paul Hunt, the couple had previously declined to comment about the charges which are due before court next month.

Free of the discipline of 4am starts, Huegill engaged in binge drinking and became so hooked on fatty food that he put on 45kg. He also said he had suicidal thoughts. 'My life from about 2005 to 2007, I experimented with many different things. I guess that's a story that's in my past,' he told the Nine Network. Huegill was the world record holder in the 50m butterfly between 2000 and 2003.

"By . David Wilkes . Nearly seven decades have passed since Sir Patrick Moore’s fiancée was killed by a Nazi bomb. But the passage of time has clearly done little to quell the eccentric astronomer’s deep-seated feelings towards Germans. ‘The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut,’ the 89-year-old has declared in an interview to mark the 55th anniversary of his star-gazing TV show The Sky At Night. The comment, apparently delivered with the utmost seriousness, may seem shocking to younger generations but the scars run deep for Sir Patrick. Scars that run deep: The passage of time has clearly done little to quell eccentric astronomer Sir Patrick Moore's deep-seated feelings towards Germans. He is pictured, right, as a 17-year-old RAF officer . Scarred by tragedy: His fiancée Lorna, a nurse, was killed in an air raid on London in 1943, three years after they met (file photo of the Blitz) His fiancée Lorna, a nurse, and he were both 20 when she died in an air raid on London in 1943, three years after they met. Sir Patrick, who served with the RAF during the war, has previously told how he was so deeply in love that he entered into a life of bachelorhood after the tragedy as ‘there was no question of anyone else’. In his interview for the latest edition of Radio Times magazine, on sale today, he suggests that Germany still thirsts for world domination, saying: ‘We must take care. There may be another war. The Germans will try again, given another chance. A Kraut is a Kraut is a Kraut. And the only good Kraut is a dead Kraut. ‘A German general said to me at the end of the war, “You won two wars. You won’t win the third. And that’s the economic war.” I hope he’s wrong.’ 'No question of anyone else: The astronomer previously told how he was so deeply in love that he entered into a life of bachelorhood after the tragedy . Outspoken: The presenter of The Sky At Night made his controversial remarks in an interview for the latest edition of Radio Times magazine . He admitted there ‘can be good, free, honourable, decent Germans’ only to add: ‘I haven’t met them myself, but I’m sure they exist.’ He continued: ‘I’m no European. Why? Go to Europe and look around. The Germans tried to conquer us. The French betrayed us. The Belgians did very little and the Italians made us our ice cream. ‘Just look at the world now and look at it when we had a bigger say in it. The English are best. Stand up for England!’ Monocle-wearing Sir Patrick, who began presenting The Sky At Night in 1957 – said he had had ‘a rather interesting war’. ‘Reliable rumours’ of his derring-do include how as a Flight Lieutenant he once climbed over the dead bodies of his pilot and co-pilot to land his Lancaster bomber safely. Then there is talk of a distinguished career in intelligence. He confessed that he ‘fiddled’ his way into the RAF on the outbreak of war by lying about his age – he was 16 at the time, a year younger than the minimum for air crew volunteers with parental consent – and hiding a childhood heart problem.",Eccentric astronomer told interviewer: 'The only good Kraut is a dead Kraut'
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . NFL players could soon be allowed to use marijuana to treat pain if they are in states where the drug has been legalized for either medical or recreational use, the league's commissioner said last week. Currently, marijuana is on a list of banned substances prohibited under the NFL's substance abuse program. However, the marijuana recently has been legalized for medical and recreational use in a number of states, including Colorado, Washington and Arizona. But because the drug is on the league's list of banned substances, players living in those states could face consequences from the NFL even if they are using the drug legally. NFL Commissioner Roger Godell said last week that he was not entirely opposed to allowing NFL players to use marijuana in places where it is not illegal . 'I don't know what's going to develop as far as the next opportunity for . medicine to evolve and to help either deal with pain or help deal with . injuries but we will continue to support the evolution of medicine,' NFL Commissioner Roger . Goodell said in an interview with the Associated Press on January 7. Marijuana has been approved in several states to treat varying ailments, including chronic pain. Given the addictive qualities of other pain medications NFL players often are given to treat the pain caused by injuries sustained on the field, there is a growing number of people advocating the use of marijuana, which doesn't have the same addictive qualities. 'I would just think that the use of marijuana for pain management, it . would be a far better outcome to me than it would be for the abuse of . heavy narcotics like pills of [Vicodin] or Percocet  or whatever the pill of . choice is for pain in the NFL,' 7-time Pro-Bowler and Super Bowl champion Lomas Brown said on the Morning Show after Goodell made his comments about being open to allowing players to use marijuana. Half: Former Pro Bowler Lomas Brown says he suspects that as many as 50 percent of NFL players currently use marijuana . Due to the physical demands of playing in the NFL, players often suffer painful injuries and are forced to treat the pain with narcotic prescription drugs, on which they can become dependent. In 2006, then-Dallas Cowboys receiver Terrell Owens overdosed on Hydrocodone. One player who could benefit tremendously from the NFL allowing marijuana to be used to treat pain is Seattle Seahawks wide receiver Percy Harvin, whose chronic migraine headaches have sidelined him at several points throughout his career. Marijuana, experts say, is highly effective in treating the pain caused by migraine headaches. Brown adds that he suspects several NFL players currently use marijuana. Pain: Much of Percy Harvin's career has been plagued by migraine headaches, which could be treated by medical marijuana . 'The NFL, they have to protect their logo, they have to protect their image, but I say at least 50 percent of the players smoke,' Brown says. For now, however, marijuana is still a banned substance in the NFL. And despite Goodell's comments, the league doesn't appear to be willing to change that any time soon. 'The use of medical marijuana is not permitted and the medical advisers . to our joint substance abuse program with the Players Association do not . believe it should be permitted,' a league official said in an emailed statement to the website Fusion.net.","Medical marijuana is a banned substance in the NFL, even for players in states where it is legal .

"By . Belinda Robinson . This is the incredible model railway that covers a couple’s entire home in Honiton, Devon. The labour of love took over 10 years to . construct and cost £32,000 - which the couple paid for themselves. The remote-controlled train set is estimated to be the length . of a football pitch (130 yards) and weaves all over their garden. It took three tons of concrete and shale to lay the . track in their back yard and they are constantly tinkering with it to make it . bigger and better. The set belongs to Roger Stimpson, 73, and his wife Barbara who have been collecting model trains for a decade in their three bedroom semi-detached house which costs £220,000. Football pitch: Mr Stimpson stands in the middle of his handy work - which is estimated to be the length of a football field (130 yards) Incredible detail: The railway has an incredible amount of detailed models in it - including a coach, tractor and train line . A miniature town: A fun fair is pictured behind a miniature town  and a blue coach can be seen driving through the bottom right of the scene . Over . the years, their passion for trains has meant that their home has become crammed full of train sets. The couple reveal that they have . sets in their loft, garden and garage and have built each one by paying attention to every single detail. Most of the track in the loft has been made from plywood and some of the . models dotted around the set are handcrafted. The . model train-enthusiasts even have replicas of the Eurostar, First Great . Western and a reproduction of Babbacombe Cliff Railway in Torquay among their fleet. All aboard: Roger Stimpson holds onto a model train above the model railway that he built in his loft . Hidden gem: Mr Stimpson gets to be a kid again as he sits and lays his hand on top of a red train inside his home . The couple's friend, Gary Broom helped the couple to put the set together in their garden. He said: ‘I . never had a particular interest in model trains before, but since I’ve . been helping out here that has changed. I have been completely sucked . into their world. ‘I haven't measured it but it must . stretch the length of a football field by now. We put in the bridge overlooking the track and we extended the track itself the changes we have made . over the last couple of weeks have really stepped it up.' The train-set owners pair have been married for 53 years and have one daughter. After building their ultimate set in their garden, Mr Stimpson decided he was keen to use it to raise funds for Devon Air Ambulance service. The couple will . open their home to the public to raise money for the service on June 15. Visitors will be admitted into the garden for free and the couple have organised a burger van and candy floss machine to provide . food and drink on the day. The generous . couple have already held two similar fundraising events in the past, . raising around £2,000 for the air ambulance service. Local . officials, Mayor David Foster and Town Crier Dave Retter are expected to be among . the visitors in June. However, the fundraising event also has special meaning for the couple. Mr . Stimpson suffers from Parkinson's and his wife has Motor Neurone . disease and their ill-health has meant that they have both had to use the air ambulance service. Mr . Broom added: ‘They really are an exceptional couple and what they have . managed to do with their garden is amazing. ‘It is all Barbara's design - . without the old photographs she showed me I would not have known where . to start in putting it all together. ‘They . are not doing it because they have to - it is because they really want . to do it. They have put so much into it and any donations on the day . will be greatly appreciated.’ Mr . Stimpson, a former electrician, said: ‘Being able to open up my garden . is a great way for me to be able to give something back.’ Park: In this train set, people can be seen walking past a park, the couple spared absolutely no detail whilst putting the set together . Fun fair: A carousel, merry-go-round and helter skelter are all lined up behind a train that can be seen shooting past this beautiful scene .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . A new video offers a glimpse into Victoria Beckham's recent trip to South Africa, in support of the Born Free foundation - a charity aiming to eradicate the transmission of HIV from mother to child by 2015. During the trip, which was captured by Annie Leibovitz for Vogue, Mrs Beckham, 40, came to learn about a revolutionary pill for pregnant mothers infected with HIV, which has only been available for a few years. 'The fact that there is a tablet that a woman who is infected with HIV can take, that will mean that that baby will be born free of HIV - that's incredible,' she says in the Vogue video. Humanitarian: Mrs Beckham (pictured), shot by Annie Leibovitz for the May Issue of Vogue, was personally invited to collaborate by the magazine's editor, Anna Wintour . The fashion designer and mother of four - who was personally invited to collaborate by the magazine's editor, Anna Wintour - looks elegant and understated, dressed in a crisp white shirt and wearing soft, fresh make-up, with her glossy dark hair tied back into a sleek ponytail. The film also takes viewers behind the scenes of Vogue's photo story, starring statuesque Ethiopian-born model Liya Kebede and shot by legendary Ms Leibovitz. In the accompanying feature article on VOGUE.com, writer Jonathan Van Meter describes spending time with Mrs Beckham, who tells him it's been a long time since she has found a charity she really feels 'a connection' with. Spreading the joy: Stunning Ethiopian-born model, Liya Kebede (pictured in South Africa), starred in Vogue's accompanying shoot . Touching: The designer and mother-of-four describes her visit to the Tygerberg Hospital in Cape town (pictured) as 'very upsetting' but it also made her realize how 'truly blessed' she is with her own healthy family . Referring to the breakthrough pill, Mrs Beckham says: 'I had no idea that this pill existed, and because of these pills, we are now at a statistic of 97 per cent of babies born free of HIV. 'Obviously I am a woman and I am a mother, and this touched me.' Just recently, Mrs Beckham shared her photo diary from the 'life-changing' trip, which she described as 'powerful' and 'heart-wrenching'. Mommy and me: Mrs Beckham has also designed a mother-and-daughter set of dresses for Born Free (pictured left, the $220 design for mothers and right, the $120 design for children) Devoted mother: Mrs Beckham (pictured with daughter Harper, two) pointed out that it felt 'appropriate' that women in fashion, many of whom are mothers, should be lending support to the cause . 'The creative community has led the HIV/AIDS response for many years,' she says.

"By . Tamara Cohen . and Francesca Infante . and Lucy Osborne . Bailed: Eric Joyce left Belgravia police station without comment this evening after spending 20 hours in police custody. He was bailed to return at a later date in March after being arrested during a fracas in the Houses of Parliament . The predecessor to MP Eric Joyce, who was arrested last night during a fracas in the Houses of Parliament, has branded him 'arrogant' and demanded he resign. A dozen police officers were called to a . fracas at the Sports and Social bar in the Houses of Parliament last . night, where Eric Joyce was at a karaoke night. The MP for Falkirk, who now serves as an independent after he was forced out of the Labour Party, was reportedly wrestled to the ground by officers in front of onlookers and loaded into a police van. Mr Joyce has now been banned from buying or being served alcohol anywhere in the Palace of Westminster. He left Belgravia police station without comment this evening, speaking only to say he had not been charged, after spending 20 hours in police custody. He was bailed to return to a central London police station on a later date in March, the Metropolitan Police said. Police said the MP, who was initially arrested on suspicion of assault, was further arrested while in custody on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The 52-year-old former soldier was arrested last February over a brawl at the nearby Strangers’ bar in Parliament where he headbutted Tory MP Stuart Andrew. He pleaded guilty to four counts of common assault and was fined £3,000 by magistrates. A House of Commons spokesman said: 'The . Serjeant at Arms has confirmed that yesterday evening the Member for . Falkirk was detained following a disturbance on the Parliamentary . Estate. Scroll down for video . Eric Joyce is restrained and handcuffed before being taken away by police last night . 'The House authorities take their responsibility for the welfare of . those who work in and visit the Commons estate very seriously. The . authorities promote responsible alcohol use and have policies in place . to encourage staff and Members to consume alcohol accordingly. 'Alcohol-related incidents on the Estate are rare, and the serious incident last night was counter to the policies in place. Dennis Canavan has called for the MP to resign and that the incident was embarrassing . 'Given the Member for Falkirk has previously been found guilty of an . alcohol-related incident on the Parliamentary Estate, the Speakers and . House authorities have agreed that with immediate effect the Member for . Falkirk will be prohibited from purchasing and being served alcoholic . beverages from all Parliamentary facilities. This ban will be indefinite . subject to the outcome of police investigations.' Predecessor Dennis Canavan, today said Mr Joyce he should to 'do the decent thing' and resign his seat immediately. Mr Canavan, 70, speaking at his home . near Stirling, said: 'It's a sad situation. It's sad for Eric Joyce but . it's even sadder for the people of Falkirk. 'For over a year now they have had no effective representation in Parliament and they don't deserve this. 'I . said last year it was time to go for the sake of his constituents and . for his own sake, because obviously he has a serious problem and he . needs help, and he needs to seek help. 'Being a member of parliament can be very stressful at times, and it requires someone who is fit for the job. 'His serial misconduct shows that he is not fit for the job. 'He has brought himself into disrepute, he has brought Parliament into disrepute, and he has brought Falkirk into disrepute. 'He should do the decent thing and go now. 'He is just a huge embarrassment, and is . incapable of doing his job. I am sure the majority of people in Falkirk . and in Scotland would agree with me.' Last night onlookers at the Sports and Social said Mr Joyce brought two officers to the ground and knocked another’s hat off. Police said the MP, who was initially arrested on suspicion of assault, was further arrested while in custody on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm . Arrest: The 52-year-old former soldier was arrested last February over a brawl at the nearby Strangers¿ bar in Parliament where he headbutted Tory MP Stuart Andrew . It is believed he arrived at the venue earlier in the evening after drinking in a Westminster pub with one of his staff. Initial . reports suggest an altercation began between Mr Joyce and another man, . which was continued outside the bar. Witnesses called the police who . arrived at 10.45pm. They had to call for reinforcements to deal with the incident. Mr Joyce was eventually pinned him to the ground and handcuffed. He was said to have been bundled through the members’ entrance to the Palace of Westminster and driven away. Eric Joyce being escorted by police away from the bar in Parliament last night . One . witness, Robin Lines, 31, a student who was at the bar as a guest of a . friend, told the Mail Mr Joyce had an altercation with another customer . inside the bar. He said . a police officer arrived and spoke to the customer who walked outside . but Mr Joyce followed them both and continued the dispute outside. He . said: ‘I was standing outside having a cigarette and the next thing I . knew Eric was on top of both the man from the pub and the policeman. Everyone was shouting “Come on Eric, get off him”. Then everyone was . told to evacuate through the back entrances by police.’ Police closed the bar and interviewed parliamentary staff who witnessed the incident. A Metropolitan police spokesman said: . ‘Police were called shortly before 10.30 this evening to reports of a . disturbance within a bar within the Houses of Commons. ‘Officers . attended and a man aged in his fifties has been arrested in connection . with the incident, he remains in custody and inquiries continue.’ Tony Grew, a journalist from the PoliticsHome website, told ITV the incident happened during a karaoke night in the bar, which was packed with about 150 people. He said Mr Joyce entered the room 'obviously agitated' and pushed his way forward to the bar. When he followed him out of the bar he saw Mr Joyce on the ground 'wrestling with two police officers'. 'He appeared to have one of the officers in an armlock, he put his arm around the officer's neck, and the other police officer was on top of him,' said Mr Grew. Speaking . at a press conference following the European Council summit in . Brussels, Mr Cameron said he still wanted to introduce 'recall' powers . to allow voters to oust MPs who misbehave. Asked . whether Mr Joyce should be allowed to remain an MP, Mr Cameron said: 'I . haven't been able to follow every aspect of this story, as I've been in . a room with my 27 colleagues. 'But . I do support the recall proposals that were in our manifesto. I still . think it is right, if we can find a way of putting this in place. I . think it's an important idea. 'As for Eric Joyce, I think this is . going to have to be properly looked at and I'm sure that the authorities . both inside and outside of the House are more than capable of doing . that.' One MP last night expressed concern for Mr Joyce’s welfare. Tory . Penny Mordaunt wrote on Twitter: ‘MPs done great stuff for mental . health but must ensure that colleagues who need help get it, esp if they . are now sans party.’ A . parliamentary aide who witnessed the incident described scenes of . ‘mayhem’ as Mr Joyce was ‘dragged’ away by police. She said: ‘The bar . was really busy but everybody pushed outside. Everyone knew what was . going on. ‘Everyone . was just saying is it Joycey, is it Joycey?I saw maybe five or six . officers, the police were so quick, he was pushed to the floor but he . resisted a lot. ‘I saw him dragged off by three police man, there was one on each side of him holding his elbows and another behind him. ‘It was complete mayhem, police had to wrestle him to the floor, there must have been 50 people stood around outside watching. ‘It . was like something you would see outside a very raucous bar or club on a . weekend.’ She said the bar was popular with Commons staffers, . especially on karaoke nights, but did not usually attract MPs. Mr . Joyce resigned from the Labour Party after headbutting Tory rivals Mr . Andrew and Ben Maney in the incident in a Commons bar last February. Inside the Sports and Social Bar at the House of Commons . He also punched Tory councillor Luke . Mackenzie and Labour whip Phillip Wilson while going berserk and abusing . officers. After leaving Mr Andrew with a bloodied nose, Mr Joyce told . police: ‘He deserved it.’ The MP, who accepted he was . ‘hammered’ on red wine during the brawl, launched into a frenzied attack . after shouting that the Strangers’ Bar ‘was full of f****** Tories’. He . walked away from Westminster Magistrates’ Court with a fine and pub . banning order after admitting four counts of common assault. He was fined £3,000 and ordered to pay £1,400 to victims after he entered early guilty pleas. Mr . Joyce was also given a 12-month community order – banning him from . entering pubs and licensed premises for three months – and handed a . curfew order from Friday to Sunday. After the hearing, the MP admitted he was lucky to avoid jail and said he was ‘deeply apologetic’. He served in junior government posts and was shadow Northern Ireland minister in 2010.

"Sea levels have risen by about 20cm . (8in) over the past century . By . Damien Gayle . West Antarctica is warming almost twice as fast as previously believed, a new study shows, heightening fears of a catastrophic thaw that raise water levels from San Francisco to Shanghai. Annual average temperatures at the Byrd research station there have risen 2.4C (4.3F) since the Fifties, it said, one of the fastest gains on the planet and three times the global average. West Antarctica holds enough ice to raise world sea levels by at least 3.3m (11ft) if it ever all melted. Melting: A new study raises the alarm over rising sea levels due to climate change in the Antarctic . Heating up: On this map, the colour intensity indicates areas around Antarctica that are likely experiencing comparable warming to Byrd Station, which is marked by the star . That process would take centuries, but even a much more modest thaw could threaten low-lying areas and coastal cities across the planet. 'Continued summer warming in West Antarctica could upset the surface mass balance of the ice sheet, so that the region could make an even bigger contribution to sea level rise than it already does,' said David Bromwich, professor of geography at Ohio State University and senior research scientist at the Byrd station. 'Even without generating significant mass loss directly, surface melting on the WAIS could contribute to sea level indirectly, by weakening the West Antarctic ice shelves that restrain the region's natural ice flow into the ocean.' Low-lying nations from Bangladesh to . Tuvalu are especially vulnerable to sea level rise, as are coastal . cities from London to Buenos Aires. Sea levels have risen by about 20cm . (8in) over the past century. The . United Nations panel of climate experts projects that sea levels will . rise by between 18 and 59cm (7-24in) this century, and by more if a thaw . of Greenland and Antarctica accelerates. Byrd Polar Research Center, pictured in 1960: Due to its location some 700 miles from the South Pole and near the center of the WAIS, Byrd Station is an important indicator of climate change throughout the region . Andrew Monaghan, study co-author and scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that the new findings place West Antarctica among the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The rise in temperatures in the remote region was comparable to that on the Antarctic Peninsula to the north, which snakes up towards South America, according to the U.S.-based experts writing in the journal Nature Geoscience. Parts of the northern hemisphere have also warmed at similarly fast rates. Several ice shelves - thick ice floating on the ocean and linked to land - have collapsed around the Antarctic Peninsula in recent years. Once ice shelves break up, glaciers pent up behind them can slide faster into the sea, raising water levels. Patchy data: Since its establishment in 1957, . Byrd Station hasn't always been occupied and even after it was automated . it has been subject to frequent power cuts, so . scientists were forced to reconstruct readings . 'We've already seen enhanced surface . melting contribute to the breakup of the Antarctic's Larsen B Ice Shelf, . where glaciers at the edge discharged massive sections of ice into the . ocean that contributed to sea level rise,' Dr Monaghan said. 'The stakes would be much higher if a similar event occurred to an ice shelf restraining one of the enormous WAIS glaciers.' We could refreeze the Arctic, and it wouldn't even cost that much, a scientist claims. Two recently published studies explore the possibility that a technological solution could be found to the problem of global warming melting the ice caps on the North Pole. The scientist who is lead author on both claims that 'any significant nation' could find the resources to carry out the operation. The only significant question, he says, is whether we should. The amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean shrank to an all time low in September (see graphic above), with the total area covered now half what it was in the Eighties. David Keith, professor of applied physics at Harvard University, is lead author on papers published in Nature Climate Change and Environmental Research Letters which speculate as to how we could restore the polar ice. He used climate models to suggest  injecting reflective particles into the atmosphere could reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth, engineering a regional effect that could bring ice back to the Arctic. His paper claims that by reducing the penetration of sunlight by just 0.5 per cent is could be possible to restore the sea-ice around the North Pole back to pre-industrial era levels. His second paper suggests the whole operation could be accomplished with just a few modified Gulfstream jets, costing somewhere in the region of $8billion a year. However, while he believes action must be taken to tackle the amount of pollution spewed into the Earth's atmosphere, he doesn't yet advocate the kind of action his papers suggest. Researchers consider the West . Antarctic ice sheet especially sensitive to climate change, explained . Ohio State University doctoral student Julien Nicolas. Since the base of the ice sheet rests below sea level, it is vulnerable to direct contact with warm ocean water. Its . melting currently contributes 0.3mm to sea level rise each year â€” second to Greenland, whose contribution to sea level rise has been . estimated as high as 0.7mm per year. Due to its location some 700 miles . from the South Pole and near the center of the WAIS, Byrd Station is an . important indicator of climate change throughout the region. In the past, researchers haven't been able to make much use of the Byrd Station measurements. Data was often incomplete because nearly one third of the temperature observations were missing for the time period of the study. Since its establishment in 1957, the station hasn't always been occupied. A year-round automated station was installed in 1980, but it has experienced frequent power cuts, especially during the long polar night, when its solar panels can't recharge. Professor Bromwich and two of his graduate students, along with colleagues from NCAR and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, corrected the past Byrd temperature measurements and used corrected data from a computer atmospheric model and a numerical analysis method to fill in the missing observations. Aside from offering a more complete picture of warming in West Antarctica, the study suggests that if this warming trend continues, melting will become more extensive in the region in the future, Professor Bromwich said. While the researchers work to fully understand the cause of the summer warming at Byrd Station, the next step is clear, he added. 'West Antarctica is one of the most rapidly changing regions on Earth, but it is also one of the least known,' he said. 'Our study underscores the need for a reliable network of meteorological observations throughout West Antarctica, so that we can know what is happeningâ€”and whyâ€”with more certainty.'","Average temperatures have risen 2.4C since the Fifties, study shows .

Abuse: Mohammed Karrar, 38, left,  and his . brother Bassam Karrar, 33, right, are facing long jail sentences after being found guilty of raping and trafficking young vulnerable girls . Mohammed, who has four children by two different women, was arguably the most sadistic member of the sex gang. The 38-year-old groomed one of the girls from the age of 11, forced her to have an abortion and even branded her as his property. Known as ‘Egyptian Mo’, he claimed to be outraged by the allegations against him and tried to claim he had been victimised by the girls. He would admit only to receiving a sex act from one victim, once. Bassam, a 33-year-old security guard and university drop-out, was given the nickname ‘Sam The Rapist’ by one of the victims after he forced himself on her at a down-at-heel Oxford guest house in 2006. During the trial it emerged that, like his brother, Bassam relished beating and humiliating girls. Their father, an interpreter for the Home Office working with asylum seekers, said he wished he had been stricter with his sons when they were teenagers. Ambitious: Abdu Karrar, 78, chose Oxford in the hope his sons might one day win a place at its prestigious university, pictured . Speaking to the Mail from his semi-detached home in Oxford, he said: ‘I wanted to give my children the chance to get a good education. When I was in school my teachers always spoke to me about Oxford and Cambridge universities. ‘That’s why I decided to come to Oxford, even though I had family in London and I knew no one in Oxford. ‘I had high hopes for my sons and thought that they might one day go to Oxford. They never had a strict or religious upbringing, I regret that now. This is all very hard for us.’ Bassam’s father celebrated when he won a place at De Montfort University in Leicester to study media. Abuse was carried out at the Nanford Guest House in Oxford. Pictured is a room at the guest house . However, after two years he dropped out and started work on security at football matches. He was married to an Indian woman for four years but the relationship broke down because she was unable to provide him with children. Bassam went on to have a relationship with a woman called Paula Pitson, 28, with whom he has two children. Before he was found guilty, his father admitted Bassam was a ladies’ man. He said: ‘Even when he was younger he would have lots of young girls coming to the house asking for him. He’s a good looking boy and girls have always liked him.’ Mohammed has been married for seven years to a woman he met on holiday in Morocco. They have three children and he has a fourth child with an unknown English woman.","Abdu Karrar chose Oxford in hope his sons might win place at university .

"By . Arthur Martin . Updated: . 19:36 EST, 8 September 2011 . Jailed: Soldier Jonathan Haynes was caught after one of his victims tore out her hair and left it behind in his car . A soldier who raped three teenage . girls was jailed for a minimum of 11 years yesterday after a victim . trapped him using tactics she learnt from television crime drama CSI. In a six-month reign of terror, . balaclava-clad Lance Corporal Jonathan Haynes cruised the streets in a . car looking for young female targets who he attacked at knifepoint. Detectives said last night it was hard to put a figure on just how many offences the 30-year-old committed. He was finally convicted because one . of his victims remembered the importance of DNA evidence from U.S. series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation. After being bundled into the rapist’s . Audi car the 18-year-old girl pulled out strands of her hair and hid . them to ensure she left a trace of her DNA. She also spat on the . upholstery to leave behind more vital evidence. Later the girl drew a plan of a disused barracks area where she had been taken, to help detectives trap her attacker. Haynes, who served with the Royal . Logistic Corps, was convicted at Bristol Crown Court last month of six . counts of rape, two of kidnap and two of attempting to kidnap. Rapist on the prowl: Jonathan Haynes walks around the campus at Glamorgan University minutes before he raped an 18-year-old student in her accommodation . Yesterday, he was given an . indeterminate sentence with a minimum of 11 years. Police fear he could . have attacked many more women in Wales and the West Country. Passing sentence, Judge Neil Ford QC described him as a ‘clever and cunning predator’ and said he might never be released. Addressing Haynes, he said: ‘You have . expressed no remorse  and you still deny you were responsible for the . offences ... you remain an extreme and continuing danger to young . women.’ During the trial the jury heard how . the soldier meticulously planned his attacks, prowling the streets of . his home town of Chippenham, Wiltshire, late at night looking for young . victims. He would identify his targets before . putting on a balaclava and gloves and pulling his car – which he had . hired – alongside. He then dragged them into the car before driving them . 15 miles to the disused Hullavington Barracks where he raped them. Lurking: Haynes wanders around a university campus minutes before raping a student in her room . The soldier knew the area because he . had served at nearby Buckley Barracks. His first victim was a . 16-year-old who he snatched at 3.20am as she walked home from a . nightclub in Chippenham in September 2009. Two weeks later Haynes raped an . 18-year-old student after forcing his way into her room in a hall of . residence. The soldier also attempted to snatch two 14-year-old girls . from a   lane near Chippenham in February last year, but they escaped. Weeks after that, he kidnapped an . 18-year-old in Chippenham and repeatedly raped her at the barracks. It . was her DNA evidence which secured his conviction. Haynes tied his victims’ hands, covered their faces and said he would stab them if they screamed. The soldier then ordered them to wipe . themselves clean with towels or wet wipes to destroy forensic evidence. Inspiration: A scene from the hit U.S. television series CSI . Speaking about her ordeal, the final victim, now aged 20 and who cannot . be named, said that when she was pushed back into the car after being . raped she decided she wanted to help catch her attacker. ‘I thought that whether I get dropped . off at home or whether it’s worse than that, there is going to be an . investigation and I wanted to help,’ she said. ‘When I was in the car I pulled out . some of my own hair and I made sure I spat on the seat, so if it was . ever found there was proof I had been in the car.’ When asked why she did this, she said: . ‘It sounds silly, but I have always been a fan of CSI programmes. I’ve . watched so many of them, I know what to do and how things work.’ She also drew a plan of a secluded house next to where the attack took place. ‘I’m just disgusted by him,’ she . added. ‘I just think it’s horrible for a human being to have any . thoughts like that. To have something done to me that was out of my . control was the worst feeling in the world.’ Haynes was caught when the number plate of his hire car was recognised by a police camera. After the hearing, Detective Chief . Inspector Bob Hamlin said: ‘He is one of the most dangerous and evil men . I’ve dealt with in 32 years of work.’ A teenager raped by soldier Jonathan Haynes said she found it harder to trust men after being the victim of the sickening sex attack. The girl, who was 16 at the time of her kidnap and rape in September 2009, was snatched off a Chippenham street as she made her way home after a night working at a nightclub in the town. The teenager, who asked to be called 'Abbi' to protect her  identity, said she found it hard now to trust men because of one 'sick individual'. 'What happened to me has definitely changed me, I'm so much more aware of what's going on around me when I'm walking on my own, even in the daylight,' Abbi said. 'I try my best to never have to walk somewhere alone at night, seeing girls walking home or anywhere on their own at night is so irritating. 'I never thought something like that would happen to me but who does? 'I'm not saying it will, I just want girls, not just young girls but girls of all ages, to be aware of the sort of people that are out there. 'I thought I was safe, only seconds away from my house. I learnt the hard way, I wouldn't want anyone else to. 'It's harder to trust men, just because of one sick individual, which is sad. But I'm with someone now and I'm very happy, so you can get through, you just need the right support.' She said she was delighted when the jury found Haynes guilty after a three-week trial. 'When they gave the verdicts, I felt relief,' she said. 'I wasn't expecting the jury to give 10 guilty verdicts. It was very emotional. Although it still feels like it's not over. 'To anyone that has been through something the same or similar to what myself and the other girls went through, I'd advise them to come forward and tell someone. 'It needs to be reported to prevent the same happening to someone else.'","Lance Corporal raped three teenagers and tried to abduct two schoolgirls .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former police woman has relived the terrifying night she was shot five times at point blank range as she tackled a pair of psychopathic gunmen who were holding her boyfriend's family hostage. Petite Isabella Lovadina, 29, fought off the two thugs who had forced their way at gunpoint into the home of boyfriend Nick Koenig's grandmother, where Isabella had just enjoyed a relaxed family dinner. Four generations of Nick's family were staying at the St. Louis house during the terrifying raid in 2009 in which his cousin Gina, a single mother of two, was shot dead. Hero: Retired police woman Isabella Lovadina was shot five times tackling a pair of gunmen who were holding her boyfriend's family hostage . But the outcome could have been far worse had it not been for Isabella, who, despite being unarmed herself and having a gun at her head, threw herself at her attackers in a blind fury. This week in an interview with 48 Hours Mystery on CBS, Isabella recalled how a perfect evening had spiralled into a terrifying nightmare and why, despite the risks, she had felt compelled to act. Nick, a fireman, had met Isabella at an emergency medical training class. He invited her to his grandmother Ida's house to have a meal and then study afterwards. Ordeal: Angelina had been studying at the home of her then boyfriend fireman Nick Koenig. She was leaving for home at around half past midnight when two men pulled up in a car and drew guns . Scene: The home of Nick Koenig's grandmother Ida Rask in St. Louis Missouri. In the hours before the attack Isabella had enjoyed a pleasant dinner with her boyfriend's family . Isabella told CBS: 'I really felt comfortable in that house, there was just a really warm feeling. I'm sure the people that lived there, you know, Nick's family had a lot to do with that.' At around half past midnight the pair finished studying and Nick walked Isabella to her car. She put her gun and bulletproof vest inside the vehicle and went back to give Nick a goodnight hug. Suddenly they heard a screech of tyres and Isabella looked up to see two men with guns drawn walking towards them. One of the men demanded: 'Give me whatever you've got.' After Isabella told him she had nothing, the man pointed towards Nick's grandmother's home and demanded: 'who's in the house?' Victim: Mr Koenig's cousin, mother-of-two Gina Stallis (right) was killed in the raid . Nick pleaded with them to leave saying there were women and children asleep inside, but the two men forced them at gunpoint to walk back in. Isabella continued: 'They became very angry, it was ""put your f---ing head on the ground, I'll kill you."" 'My mind just went into police mode. What am I going to do to keep everybody in this house safe... and get them out? 'I was constantly peeking at them, trying to memorise their features, what they were wearing, any kind of description I could give to the police. 'One of 'em was wearing a red hoodie and dark pants. The other one was wearing a black hoodie.' With one of the men holding Isabella and Nick on the ground at gunpoint, the other went upstairs where grandmother Ida Rask, aunt Rose Whitrock, cousin Gina Stallis and her two children Sam and Ben were in bed. Gina awoke to a menacing black handgun being waved in her face and was ordered to carry a heavy, old-fashioned television downstairs set with her. Isabella recalled: 'I saw Gina carrying this large - older television down the stairs and the guy in the red hoodie had the gun pointed to her back. following her down. 'I couldn't believe she was able to even carry the television. And once she got downstairs and knelt next to me all she wanted, all she asked was if it was OK if she could check on her kids. 'They just yelled back ""I'll kill you bitch, shut up put your head on the ground.""' With tears streaming down her face Gina begged Isabella to do something. Isabella knelt on the floor with a gun trained at her head, certain that if she didn't act everyone was going to die. As the anger welled up inside her she decided she would go out fighting. Guilty: Ledale Nathan Jr, 16 at the time of the raid, received life without parole plus five life terms plus 75 years. Mario Coleman, 24, was sentenced to life without parole plus five life terms plus 90 years . 'I thought, ""I'm not gonna let this happen. I'm not gonna let somebody kill me while I'm on my knees with my head on the ground. I'm not going out that way."" 'I looked down the barrel of the gun... and with everything that I had in me, I lunged towards the guy with the black hoodie and -- and just began to fight.' Despite her relatively small size, such was the force of the impact that Isabella sent the gunman flying across the room into the front door. At that moment Nick jumped up and flung himself at the other man. Then all hell broke loose. Nick told CBS: 'I turn and all I see is Isabella on the floor in a fetal position, and the guy in the black hoodie is standing right over her, just shootin' her, shootin' her and shootin' her. 'Then I feel and explosion from my neck. And then right after that I can feel warm blood just dripping down the whole front of my chest. Then they were gone. They must have run out of the house.' As Isabella dragged herself towards him, Nick turned to see his cousin Gina lying with her eyes wide open. Her 10-year-old son Sam whimpered: 'Nick, is my mommy OK?' All Nick could think to say was that she'd fainted and would be alright. Honour: Isabella is awarded the Medal of Valour by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon . Nick's aunt Rose had managed to escape the house and had been tearing down the street banging on neighbours' doors and screaming for help. Meanwhile young Sam managed to find a mobile phone and coolly called 911. Ambulances were on the way, but for Isabella, who had been shot five times and was loosing a lot of blood, it would be touch and go. Thankfully the paramedics arrived in time and both Nick and Isabella were rushed to hospital. Nick had been shot three times. One of the bullets had hit him under the ear and had gone through the back of his neck and lodged in his spinal cord. Tragically Gina was dead. Across the city, one of the raiders walked into the emergency room at Barnes Hospital claiming he had been shot in the hand. A quick witted X-ray operator realised that something wasn't quite right and the hospital contacted the police who arrive to see the man walking out to his car next to which his accomplice is waiting. The cops followed the man to a nearby park where where they saw him throw something onto the ground. He is later apprehended and jewellery belonging to Nick's grandmother Ida is found in his pocket. Momento: Isabella's former boyfriend Nick Koenig shows the bullet he coughed up more than two years after being shot in the neck by one of the gunmen . Police recover a black handgun from the park. Officers determine that he was the man in the black hoodie. His name is Mario Coleman. The second man, Ledale Nathan Jr, is also arrested. Isabella was able to identify both men from a photo line-up from he hospital bed. Coleman, 24, was sentenced to life without parole for first-degree murder plus five life terms plus 90 years. LeDale Nathan Jr., received life without parole plus five life terms plus 75 years. Sadly Isabella's injuries meant she had to retire from the force. She was commended for her bravery, awarded the Medal of Valour by Missouri Governor Jay Nixon and even had a day named after her by the Mayor of St. Louis. Almost a year and a half after the shooting Nick was involved in a car crash in which he hit his head on the windshield. A few days later he felt a lump at the back of his throat and coughed out the bullet that had been lodged in his spinal cord. Isabella added: 'I look at my life differently now. I see how fragile it is and how it can be taken away so fast and without any notice. 'I don't have a new career picked out. 'I still know that I want to help people. It's just gonna be in a different way now.'","Hero cop Isabella Lovadina miraculously survived shooting .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Ever wondered what happens when you flush a toilet on a plane - or if interference from phones is the real reason they are banned on flights? A new book, written by airline pilot Patrick Smith, takes some of the most frequently asked questions and answers them in the form of anecdotes and rants. Called Cockpit Confidential, it features chapters on terrorism, fares, delays and common myths as well as giving an exclusive insight into how planes fly and what can cause them to crash. A new book called Cockpit Confidential, written by airline pilot and Patrick Smith, attempts to answer questions about planes, including how they fly, how the toilets flush and the 'truth about delays. This image shows a stock photo of a cockpit . There has been much debate about whether the energy emitted from mobile phones can cause electronic systems on planes, and even in hospitals, to crash or malfunction. On this subject Smith says in his book: 'Few rules are more confounding to airline passengers than those regarding the use of cell phones and portable electronic devices. 'Passengers should know that the restrictions pertaining to computers, iPods, and certain other devices aren’t about electronic interference. 'The main reasons laptops need to be put away is to prevent them from becoming high-speed projectiles in the event of an impact or sudden deceleration. 'Your computer is a piece of luggage, and luggage needs to be stowed so it doesn’t kill somebody or get in the way.' He continues that although cellular communication can 'potentially' interfere with cockpit equipment, 'in all likelihood' it doesn't. He also adds that the machines and electronics in airplanes and cockpits have been designed to shield against any interference. This means the authorities are 'erring on the better-safe-than-sorry side' because although there have been no proven cases where a phone has 'adversely affected the outcome of a flight', Smith believes that 'you never know.' In his book Cockpit Confidential, airline pilot Patrick Smith explains that although passengers are told to switch their phones off during flights because they can 'potentially' interfere with the plane's systems, 'in all likelihood' they don't and that authorities are erring on the side of 'better safe than sorry' One example Smith gives is if the shielding is old or doesn't work properly, then the protection could suffer and this could potentially lead to problems. 'The policy is clearly stated, but obviously unenforced, and we assume the risks are minimal or else phones would be collected or inspected visually rather than relying on the honor system,' said Smith. 'I’d venture to guess at least half of all phones, whether inadvertently or out of laziness, are left on during flight.  That’s about a million phones a day in the United States. 'If indeed this was a recipe for disaster, I think we’d have more evidence by now.' The book also tackles the subject of turbulence. Smith explained: 'Conditions might be annoying and uncomfortable, but the plane is not going to crash. Turbulence is an aggravating nuisance for everybody, including the crew, but it’s also, for lack of a better term, normal.' Smith's book goes into detail about airfares, congestion and plane delays. Talking about airline service, Smith said: 'The average passenger doesn't expect to be pampered. What he or she expects, and deserves, are convenience, respectful employees, and a modicum of comfort' Planes are engineered to handle turbulent conditions and the level of turbulence required to dislodge an engine or bend a wing spar is something even the most frequent flyer won’t experience in a lifetime of traveling.' During the 1980s, toilets on planes used a blue liquid that pushed waster from the bowl into a storage tank. This liquid added weight to the aircraft, which consumed more fuel, and if it leaked, frozen blocks of waste could end up falling over town and cities. On modern-day planes, such as the ones Smith flies, this toilet system has been replaced by a vacuum. When the toilet is flushed a valve opens to a sewer pipe and the waste is sucked into a tank. The waste is then stored in the tank until the plane lands and ground crew vacuum it out and dispose of it. And on the subject of doors opening mid-flight, Smith stresses the point that: 'You cannot – repeat, cannot – open the doors or emergency hatches of an airplane in flight.  You can’t open them for the simple reason that cabin pressure won’t allow it.  Think of an aircraft door as a drain plug, fixed in place by the interior pressure.'","Patrick Smith wrote the book to dispel common myths around flying .

"By . David Mccormack . The mayor of a small town in southwestern Missouri has resigned after angering local residents with anti-Semitic remarks he made in reference to three killings at Jewish community facilities in Kansas earlier this month. Dan Clevenger submitted a handwritten, one-sentence letter of resignation on Tuesday as mayor of Marionville, a town of 2,225 about 240 miles southwest of St. Louis. Clevenger had enraged the local community when he said in a televised interview last week that he ‘kind of agreed with’ the views of Frazier Glenn Cross, 73, who has been charged with murdering three people outside a Jewish community center and a retirement home in Overland Park, Kansas, on April 13. Dan Clevenger has resigned as mayor of Marionville, Missouri, after angering local residents with anti-Semitic remarks he made in reference to three killings at Jewish community facilities in Kansas earlier this month . Clevenger, who had only become mayor earlier this month, told KSPR that he had known Cross, who lived nearby, for years. ‘I kind of agreed with him on some things, but I don't like to express that too much,’ said Clevenger. ‘There's some things going on in this country that are destroying us. We've got a false economy and some of those corporations are run by Jews. The names are there.’ At a meeting of the Marionville Board of Aldermen on Monday, local residents took Clevenger to task over his comments and the board voted 4-1 to begin impeachment proceedings against him. Avowed white supremacist Cross, 73, shouted 'heil Hitler' at TV cameras as he was arrested . In his resignation letter to the board on Tuesday, Clevenger did not explain why he was stepping down, writing only: ‘I, Daniel R. Clevenger, do hereby resign as mayor of Marionville.’ His remarks had already promoted the local district attorney and an assembly woman to stand down. Avowed white supremacist Cross, also known as Glenn Miller, has been charged with the killings of Dr. William Lewis Corporon and his 14-year-old grandson, Reat Griffin Underwood, outside the Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City on Sunday 13 April. Cross shouted ‘heil Hitler’ at television cameras as he was arrested after the shootings. The three people killed were Terri LaManno, left, and Dr. William Lewis Corporon and his 14-year-old grandson Reat Griffin Underwood - all three victims were Christian . He is also accused of killing Terri LaManno at a nearby Jewish retirement complex shortly after the shootings at the Jewish Community Center. All three victims were Christian. Cross now faces a state charge of capital murder for the deaths of Corporon and Underwood and a count of first-degree premeditated murder for LaManno's death. The charges carry the death penalty as possible punishment and Cross is being held on $10million bond. Corporon and Underwood were at the JCC for the 'KC Superstar' competition, an American Idol-like singing contest for students. LaManno worked as an occupational therapist at the Children's Center for the Visually Impaired.

NBA legend Michael Jordan, perhaps the most celebrated player in the history of professional basketball, said he's both disgusted and outraged by the racist comments allegedly made by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. Jordan, now the owner of the Charlotte Bobcats, released a statement Sunday addressing the matter, in which he says that, as an owner, 'I'm completely disgusted that a fellow team owner could hold such sickening and offensive views.' As a former player, Jordan says 'I'm completely outraged.' Scroll down for video . Air Jordan: Michael Jordan, the NBA's most celebrated athlete, weighed in on Clippers owner Donald Sterling's alleged racist tirades . An audio recording obtained by TMZ alleges that Sterling made racist comments to a girlfriend, including urging her not to bring black friends to Clippers games. The NBA and the Clippers are investigating, including whether the male voice on the recording is in fact Sterling's. Jordan said he is confident that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver will investigate the matter fully and 'take appropriate action quickly.' 'There is no room in the NBA - or anywhere else - for the kind of racism and hatred that Mr. Sterling allegedly expressed,' Jordan said. 'I am appalled that this type of ignorance still exists within our country and at the highest levels of our sport. In a league where the majority of players are African-American, we cannot and must not tolerate discrimination at any level.'

'That's still there, the vestiges of discrimination. We've made enormous strides, but you're going to continue to see this percolate up every so often,' Obama said in Malaysia. The details of how the audio recordings made their way to TMZ are only starting to be revealed. V. Stiviano, the woman heard in the recordings, was recently sued by the Sterling family for embezzlement. She is a 'defendant in a lawsuit brought by the Sterling family alleging that she embezzled more than $1.8 million, who told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even.' Obama: The president weighed in on Sterling's comments, saying, 'When ignorant folks want to advertise their ignorance, you don't really have to do anything, you just let them talk' Clippers president Andy Roeser said in a Saturday statement on behalf of Sterling that served as the first official response to the recordings. Sterling was supposed to receive a lifetime achievement award in the coming week from the NAACP. However, NAACP interim President Lorraine C. Miller told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' on Sunday that Sterling was no longer getting the award. The league said Saturday it was investigating the recording posted on TMZ's website, calling the remarks made by Sterling to his girlfriend ‘disturbing and offensive.’","Jordan is the current owner of the Charlotte Bobcats .

"By . Louise Boyle . and David Mccormack . and Becky Evans . A little girl born to one of three women as she was imprisoned in a Cleveland home for a decade is 'happy and healthy' despite being brought up in captivity, authorities have revealed. After kidnap victim Amanda Berry, 27, courageously escaped the home on Monday, she told her grandmother that the child is her daughter Jocelyn, who was born on Christmas six years ago. Authorities believe that Jocelyn's father is one of the three brothers arrested in connection with the kidnappings and they are now carrying out paternity tests to confirm their suspicions. The six-year-old girl was home-schooled by her mother, possibly without the knowledge of the suspects, Ariel Castro, 52, and . his . two brothers Onil Castro, 50, and Pedro Castro, 54. Jocelyn, who escaped the home with Amanda and two other missing women, Gina DeJesus, 23, and Michelle Knight, 32, was pictured grinning in hospital alongside her mother and her aunt Beth. Reunited: Amanda Berry (center) at the Cleveland Hospital alongside her emotional sister (left) and daughter Jocelyn that she gave birth to during the 10 years she was held against her will . The little girl, who authorities said . enjoyed popsicles while being examined by doctors, is photographed . lying in a hospital bed and showing off her missing two front . teeth. 'She looks great, happy, healthy and . ate a popsicle last night,' Cleveland Police Deputy Chief Ed Tomba said. 'Seeing her mother smile made her smile.' He added that it was 'a good possibility' that one of the three suspects was her father. Police are now trying to determine what life was like for the little girl inside the house of horrors. They do not have a record of her birth and are trying to establish if she was born in the fortified home. Police sources said Jocelyn was occasionally taken out of the house and would visit Ariel Castro's mother, Lillian Rodriguez, who she called 'grandmother'. Grandmother: Jocelyn visited Lillian Rodriguez (pictured center), the mother of kidnapping suspects Ariel, Oneil and Pedro Castro, according to police sources. The little girl called her 'grandmother' Rodriguez was pictured returning from police questioning on Tuesday, but it is not known if she knew of the sick crimes allegedly carried out by her sons. She was also seen out recently at a . playground with Castro. When he was asked who the young girl was he told . neighbors she was his girlfriend's daughter. It is feared other babies were born inside the Cleveland house. At least five children may have born at the house, police sources told NewsChannel5. One victim suffered up to three miscarriages because she was so malnourished, while other sources told WKYC the . captors would beat the pregnant women, so that the . babies would not survive. It is unknown what happened to any children who were born at the home. FBI Special Agent Vicki Anderson told . ABC TV that the three woman had spent time together at Metro Medical . Center hospital, where they were taken after being freed. Found: Amanda Berry (left) and Gina DeJesus (right) were found alive in Cleveland on Monday afternoon . Missing: Michelle Knight, now 32, was also found inside the home, nearly 11 years after she went missing . She described them as being in very good spirits and said it was obvious that they were very close. 'You could see that they had a bond, that they had been through this together,’ she said. All three women were abducted between . 2002 and 2004, Berry and DeJesus were in their teens at the time of . their kidnappings and Knight was 20 years old. On Monday evening, Berry began . screaming from behind the locked front door of the home and was helped out by a neighbor. She fled the home and called 911. Authorities are now investigating how the horrors inside the home went undetected for so long. Neighbour Israel Lugo said other . neighbors had seen naked women crawling on all fours behind Castro's . house. Three men were in the garden and were controlling the women, he . said.

House of horrors: In a photograph taken in 2001, suspect Ariel Castro stands with a former girlfriend in front of a padlocked door, which led to the basement, at his home on Seymore Avenue, Cleveland . 'We thought it was funny at first, and then we thought that was weird so we called the cops,' neighbor Nina Samoylicz told CNN. 'They thought we was playing, joking, they didn't believe us.' Neighbors waited for police for two hours but no patrol cars showed up. Cleveland police said that the department has no records of a call for service to that home. But the claim is one of a . number of stories to have emerged from neighbors who say they reported . unusual goings-on at Castro's Seymour Avenue, Cleveland home to local . police who either didn't respond or didn't enter the house when they did . show up. Lugo said he also called police after . his sister saw a woman and a baby standing in a window at the home . which was half covered by a plank. Lugo also said his mother was puzzled when Castro would park outside the . home in his yellow school bus. He would go inside clutching bags of . McDonalds and sodas. This map shows the block, Lorain Avenue, in Cleveland where the three girls went missing, years apart. They were found Monday on Seymour Avenue, approximately three miles from where they were abducted . Solved: Michelle Knight, left, vanished in 2002. A year later, Amanda Berry, right, went missing a day before her 17th birthday. She is pictured with her mother, who died before knowing her daughter was alive . It has emerged that Ariel Castro . would allegedly use a sick game to 'train' the three girls not to run . away by pretending to leave the house, only to beat them if they tried . to run free. It is said to be just one of the . manipulative tactics he used to keep the three young women in his house . for up to ten years, in addition to frequent beatings and chains hanging . from the ceiling. But on Tuesday, Cleveland Police said: . 'Every single lead was followed up on no matter how small. We dug up . yards, canvassed neighborhoods. [The] real hero is Amanda Berry.' Until now the search for the missing . women had been fruitless, a series of false leads and bitter . disappointment for the desperate families. Michelle Knight, who was 20 years old . when she went missing in August 2002, was last seen at a cousin's house . near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue. Three years later, in April 2003, . Amanda Berry, disappeared after leaving her job at a Burger King - at . West 110th Street and Lorain. It was the day before her 17th birthday. Probe: Members of the FBI evidence response team carry out evidence from the home on Tuesday . Investigation: A truck is pulled out the driveway from the home where the three women were found . And a year later, Gina DeJesus, then 14 years old, was last seen leaving her middle school at West 105th Street and Lorain. All three were found safe on Monday . night after Berry bolted from a home on Seymour Avenue, about three . miles from where they were last seen. She told police that she and the . other girls were being held prisoner by Ariel Castro, 52, who has been . arrested along with his two brothers on suspicion of kidnapping. The Berry family has expressed their joy at having Amanda home. 'I didn’t know what to say. Best thing that ever happened to me. Best feeling I’ve ever had,' Amanda’s dad Johnny Berry told Newsnet5. Her grandmother, Fern Gentry, spoke to Amanda on the phone from her home in Elizabethton, Tennessee. Overjoyed: Fern Gentry speaks with her granddaughter Amanda Berry on the phone after her escape . Relief: Ricky DeJesus, brother of Gina, holds his head in his hand outside his family's home in Cleveland . Found: A sign outside the Burger King where Amanda Berry was last seen before her kidnap in 2003 . 'I'm glad to have you back,' Gentry told her, with Amanda responding: 'I'm glad to be back.' But . the discovery is also laced in sadness as Amanda's mother, Louwana . Miller, who relentlessly searched for her missing daughter, passed away . in 2006 without knowing she was still alive. The exact circumstances of the . abductions is currently unclear, and it is not known whether or not the . kidnapper deliberately targeted the block where all three victims were . taken. The Castro brothers are awaiting their arraignment on Wednesday morning, as authorities told ABC News that they plan to start questioning the men today. A judge gave police extra time to file charges against the brothers, extending the charging period from 36 hours to 48 hours.","Amanda Berry's daughter Jocelyn, 6, ate a popsicle while being examined and smiled when she saw her mother smile, authorities said .

"By . Fiona Macrae . Stars such as Kurt Cobain, formerly of hit grunge band Nirvana, are more likely to die young, according to new research . Fame really does have a price, research shows. An analysis of the lives and deaths of almost 1,000 successful people found that pop stars, sportsmen and actors were more likely to die young. The price of fame equated to up to seven and a half years of life, with military top brass living on average almost eight years longer than sports stars, singers and other performers, a medical journal reports. The idea that musicians die young has long been a source of fascination, with the deaths of the likes of Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison still fodder for books and films decades later. Using information from New York Times obituaries, the Australian researchers proved the trio to be far from from the exception to the rule. They took obituaries published between 2009 and 2011 and pulled out information such as age of death, cause of death and occupation. It was assumed that those deemed worthy of an obituary in the newspaper had had a successful career. The analysis showed that performers, including actors and singers, died the youngest. Their average age of death was 77 years and one month. In contrast, military personal were the longest lived, clocking up 84 years and 8 months, on average. Sportspeople also fared badly, dying on average at the age of 77 years and 5 months. Writers and other ‘creatives’ weren’t far behind, with an average lifespan of 78 and a half. In contrast, businesspeople and politicians tended to join army-types in living in to their 80, the article in QJM: An International Journal of Medicine reports. Early deaths were linked to accidents and infections, including HIV and cancer. Lung cancer deaths, which the researchers said were an indication of long-term smoking, were most common in those whose career was performance-based. Elvis Presley died in 1977, grossly overweight and addicted to drugs. In his prime he was the biggest music star the world had ever seen . The study’s authors said that young people considering chasing fame may face the choice of fulfilling their career potential or living longer. They added that while the results don’t prove anything, they raise some interesting possibilities, from pop stars indulging too much while famous, to them self-medicating afterwards. Professor Richard Epstein, of St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney, said: ‘First, if it is true that successful performers and sports players tend to enjoy shorter lives, does this imply that fame at younger ages predisposes to poor health behaviours in later life after success has faded? ‘Or that psychological and family pressures favouring unusually high public achievement lead to self-destructive tendencies throughout life? Too soon: Best-selling novelist Ernest Hemingway was just 61 when he killed himself . Waste: American rocker and musical pioneer Jimi Hendrix was just 27 when he died, apparently from an overdose. His career in the musical mainstream lasted just four years . ‘Or that risk-taking personality traits maximise one’s chances of success, with the use of cigarettes, alcohol or illicit drugs improving one’s performance output in the short term? ‘Any of these hypotheses could be viewed as a health warning to young people aspiring to become stars.’ Another recent analysis of rock and pop stars found that many of those who died young had been abused when young. The British researchers said that the trappings of a rock and roll lifestyle may be especially attractive to those who have had an unhappy childhood.","Analysis of successful people found those in the public eye died younger .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 15:57 EST, 8 September 2011 . The elfin child with the big personality and bright smile calls herself 'the first lady' and dreams of the future. But doctors say 12-year-old Ontlametse Phalatse has only another couple of years to live. 'I call myself a first lady because I'm the first black child with this disease ... Which other black child do you know with this disease?' she challenged. Ontlametse is the first black child diagnosed with progeria, a rare and fatal genetic condition that accelerates the aging process, the Progeria Research Foundation said. Ontlametse Phalatse, 12, was diagnosed with the rare, fatal and genetic aging condition progeria . The disorder is said to have inspired the Brad Pitt movie The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in which he is born an old man and ages backwards. Nobody knows how many kids in the world have it. She and mom Bella fly to the U.S. on school holidays funded by the Progeria Research Foundation at Children's Hospital Boston for cutting edge treatment . In a two-year campaign to identify them, . the Progeria Research Foundation says the number of children diagnosed . around the world has soared from 48 to 80 on five continents. The foundation's executive director, Audrey Gordon, says only two Africans have been diagnosed and both live in South Africa â€” Ontlametse and a 5-year-old white girl. That is probably because South Africa, an economic powerhouse, offers some of the best medical care on the continent. Gordon says there are several black holes on the map in her office studded with colored tacks where they have found children living with progeria. 'We know that there are children (with progeria) in Africa, in China and Russia, but we just can't seem to get to them,' she said in a telephone interview from the foundation's office in Peabody, Massachusetts. Ontlametse's mother, Bellon Phalatse, says her baby was born looking normal but that she realized early on that something was wrong. The baby suffered constant rashes and by the time she was three months old Phalatse thought she had a skin disease. Phalatse's father abandoned the family when she was three years old, years before her strange rashes and nail loss was diagnosed as the deadly disorder . Always a bright student Phalatse, right, hopes to be a psychologist one day so she can help other people with their problems . Before Ontlametse celebrated her . first birthday 'her hair was falling, her nails weren't normal, the skin . problems, we were going up and down to the doctors.' The disorder may have inspired The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, in which Brad Pitt is born an old man . As the child aged prematurely, her father abandoned the family when Ontlametse was three years old. Despite her frequent illnesses, . Ontlametse enrolled in school at six and proved a bright pupil. But she . was often scorned by classmates, teachers and others who thought she was . so small and skinny because she had AIDS. South Africa has the highest number of . people living with AIDS of any country but the disease still carries a . terrible social stigma. 'It was horrible, I don't know how to explain' what we went through, Phalatse said. It was not until two years ago that a doctor friend suggested she have Ontlametse tested for progeria, and brought her a book about the disease. It included pictures. Children with progeria look remarkably similar, despite different ethnic backgrounds: small and bald with oversized heads, eyes that bulge a bit, gnarled hands. They suffer from thinning skin which has a network of blue veins showing on the heads of white children. Phalatse said she knew immediately, and a doctor confirmed the diagnosis. One of the things on Phalatse's wish list is a wig. Here she is in her 'Hannah Montana' bedroom, created for her by the Reach For A Dream Foundation, which fullfills the dreams of kids with terminal illnesses . 'I'm very happy now that I understand what causes progeria,' Phalatse said. Phalatse has sensitive eyes and the disease's classic traits: small and bald with oversized heads, eyes that bulge a bit and thinning skin . The . diagnosis came with the news that most children with the disease die at . 13. But it also brought a better understanding of what they can do to . try to prolong Ontlametse's life, and it has brought her the specialized . care she needs. Each school holiday, Ontlametse and her . mom fly to the United States, where she participates in research funded . by the Progeria Research Foundation at Children's Hospital Boston. It . gives her access to cutting edge drugs that are not yet commercially . available. Back home, they struggle to feed her the . required healthy diet. Phalatse is unemployed and the two survive on . her daughter's government disability allowance. Ontlametse is unfazed: 'Sometimes when my mommy has money, she buys lettuce and cucumbers and I help her do salad.' At school, Ontlametse keeps her hat on her head, self-conscious of her bald head. One of the things on her wish list is a specially designed wig. She has two friends in her class but says not all her classmates are kind, but it doesn't bother her. Star student: Phalatse stands on a desk surrounded by her classmates at the Lorato Primary School  in Hebron, near Pretoria, South Africa . 'I don't care what people say about . me,' she says, making a throwaway motion with a hand misshapen with . arthritis, knobby fingers and discolored nails. In her rundown brick home in the small town of Hebron about 50 miles north of Johannesburg, Ontlametse ditches the hat. She does her homework, reading, watches TV and has daily chores like washing her socks and cleaning her shoes. She can't play sports or even a game of hopscotch because physical exercise tires her out. Asked what she would like to be, she breaks into a big grin that shows irregular teeth. Her classmates and teachers used to scorn her, assuming she had AIDS due to her small, skinny stature . She loves to read but he can't play sports or even a game of hopscotch because physical exercise tires her out too much . 'I would like to be a psychologist,' she . says, 'so that I can work on the problems of other people and so that . they can accept the way that they are because they can see that I accept . the way I am.' That she would live that long would require a miracle. Children with progeria die almost exclusively from heart disease between the ages of 8 and 21, commonly suffering high blood pressure, strokes, angina, enlarged heart and heart failure. Gordon said research into progeria has had remarkable success since her family founded the foundation in 1999, after her nephew was diagnosed with the disease. In 2003, the foundation was instrumental in the discovery of the progeria gene. Now they hope it can help provide answers about the ordinary aging process and cardiovascular disease.","Ontlametse Phalatse lives in South Africa with her mother and dreams of being a psychologist .

"By . Chris Pleasance . Tiwi has been suffering from the cold after a fight with another ostrich left her with a large bald patch . A zoo is appealing to Britain's knitters to help them keep one balding ostrich warm this winter. Tiwi, a female bird who lives on Folly Farm in Pembrokeshire, lost all the feathers on her back last summer during a fight with another ostrich. They have since failed to grow back, leaving Tiwi suffering from the cold and looking a little like a half-plucked chicken. Zoo manager Tim Morphew said: 'Most of the animals have grown glossy coats of furs or feathers to keep them warm this winter but Tiwi suffers from a rather large bald patch on her back meaning she is much more prone to feeling the cold than the other animals. 'We have tried to put blankets on her to keep her warm but if anyone is willing to knit her a jumper, I am sure she would appreciate it very much. 'We are also hoping that the warmth and natural fibres from a woolly jumper may stimulate the hair follicles in her back and cause her feathers to grow back.' Ostriches naturally roam across central and southern Africa, and so are poorly suited to the cold. In their arid home they derive most of their water from the food they eat, which includes plants, roots and seeds, as well as insects, lizards and other small creatures. The species, the world's largest bird, . also has the largest eye of any land animal, and contrary to popular . belief they do not bury their heads in sand when threatened. Instead they lie low to the floor, . perhaps giving the appearance of burying their head, before using their . long legs and fast pace to flee predators. Their legs are also useful for kicking, and can easily kill a human or lion with a single powerful blow. Keepers hope the jumper's natural wool fibers and the warmth it provides will mean the feathers grow back . As well as ostriches, Folly Farm zoo is home to a host of other birds, including emus and sacred ibis, whose distinctive long bills are used to probe mud for insects and beetles. Emus are related to ostriches, are similar in appearance and are also flightless. The emu is slightly smaller than its relation, and lives predominantly in Australia, rather than Africa. Like ostriches they will eat both plans and small insects, but will also swallow rocks in order to aid digestion.","Tiwi has a bald patch after fighting with another ostrich last summer .

"By . Steve Nolan . A Chinese woman miraculously survived a car crash which saw her head smash through the windscreen and become wedged in the hole. The unnamed woman was a passenger in the car when it hit the back of a truck in southern China's Guanxi province. The force caused the woman, who wasn't wearing a seat belt at the time, to fly forward into the windscreen. A woman in Guanxi province had another miraculous escape last week when her head became stuck in a car's windscreen during a crash . Horrific: The woman wasn't wearing a seat belt when the car crashed in southern China . Her head broke the glass and she became wedged in the hole. When fire crews arrived on the scene, they had to remove the car's unconscious driver from the car before they could painstakingly begin freeing the woman. Firefighters were then able to slowly enlarge the hole in the windscreen around her neck so that it was big enough for the injured woman's head to be safely freed. Bloodied and dazed, the woman was stretchered away by waiting paramedics and taken to a nearby hospital. Stuck: Rescuers had to cut the woman's male companion, who was driving the car, free from the vehicle before they could help her . Free: The woman is stretchered off to hospital having finally been freed from the wreckage of the car . Miraculously, both the woman and her male companion are said to be making a full recovery in hospital. The occupants of two vehicles had a lucky escape earlier this month when a 71-year-old driver fell asleep at the wheel in Taiwan and flipped his car through another motorist's windscreen. Kang and his family were travelling down a city road when the pensioner fell asleep at the wheel of his silver Daewoo. His car entered the opposite lane, the one which Kang and his family were driving on, and hit a tree front-end on. It then span 180 degrees through the air and the rear of the small hatchback went flying into their windshield. Kang and his family only suffered minor injuries while the driver of the Daewoo also made it out alive.","The crash happened earlier this week in southern China's Guanxi province .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Decade of abuse: Yemeni woman Noora Al Shami was forced to marry a violent man three times her age when she was 11 years old because her parents did not want her to live in poverty . A Yemeni child bride who was forced to marry a violent husband three times her age when she was just 11 has spoken of the shocking sexual abuse she suffered at his hands for more than a decade. Noora Al Shami was given away to a distant cousin in his 30s because her parents did not want her live in poverty. As young girl, she was excited to be the centre of attention at a lavish three-day wedding party in the port city of Al Hudaydah where she was allowed to wear 'three really beautiful dresses' for each day. But almost as soon as the celebrations had ended she was quickly thrust into a world of physical and psychological abuse from which she could not escape. She told The Guardian: 'It was at the end of the wedding that the fear and horror set in. 'He was three times my age and saw marriage as a means to act like a depraved animal.' She told how she 'immediately began to quiver and cry' when she was driven to the house her husband shared with his father. When the clerical worker first took off his clothes, she ran away in terror and desperately avoided sex for 10 days. And when she was eventually pressured into consummating the marriage, she said her body went into shock and she was rushed to hospital. She described being 'treated like a sex object' but said no one was interested in helping her because she was 'legally his wife'. Noora, who is now 35, went on to have two miscarriages within a year before giving birth to a son, Ihab, when she was 13, a daughter, Ahlam, a year later and then another boy, Shibab, at the age of 15. She said her husband 'thought nothing of hitting me' when she was pregnant and even attacked the children. On one occasion, he banged two-year-old Ahlam on the floor by her feet forcing her to need hospital treatment for bleeding. Child bride: The practice of marrying young girls is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international rights groups seeking to pressure the government to raise the minimum age to 18 . Eventually, a decade after her wedding in 1989, she sought refuge with a project run by Oxfam and the Yemei's Women's Union which helps victims of domestic violence. She said: 'I managed to get a lawyer and then filed for divorce. But after getting divorced, I faced a new reality. 'Who would feed my three children and take care of my elderly parents? I had to find a job and worked as a maid while I was studying for my high school diploma. My neighbours used to harass me and say I was a bad woman for getting divorced. 'As a Yemeni woman, I faced many challenges, but I had to stay strong and fight to improve my situation. 'I started to tell people about the psychological and physical impact child marriage had upon me. I miscarried twice due to the abuse, and I was lucky to survive.' Noora Al Shami . The practice of marrying young girls . is widespread in Yemen and has attracted the attention of international . rights groups seeking to pressure the government to raise the minimum age to 18. Yemen's . poverty plays a role in hindering efforts to stamp out the practice of . child marriage, as poor families find themselves unable to say no to . 'bride-prices' for their daughters that can be worth hundreds of . dollars. More than a quarter of Yemen's females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry. Tribal . custom also plays a role, including the belief that a young bride can . be shaped into an obedient wife, bear more children and be kept away . from temptation. In . September 2010, a 12-year-old Yemeni child-bride died after struggling . for three days in labour to give birth, a local human rights . organisation said. Yemen . once set 15 as the minimum age for marriage, but parliament annulled . that law in the 1990s, saying parents should decide when a daughter . marries. Noora's story also comes weeks after unconfirmed reports emerged that an eight-year-old child bride died of internal injuries on her wedding night. Call for change: Noora's story comes weeks after unconfirmed reports emerged that an eight-year-old Yemeni child bride called Rawan (claimed to be pictured above) died of internal injuries on her wedding night . The Yemeni girl called Rawan allegedly died after being forced into marrying a man five times her age, however recent reports have suggested she is still alive. Noora, whose mother married at nine and was divorced a year later, is now lobbying the Sana'a parliament to bring in legislation to end the plight of child marriages. She said: 'During the dialogue, I had the opportunity to visit parliament to push for a law setting eighteen as a safe minimum age of marriage. 'This law has been raised many times in Yemen, but has never been approved by the government. I’m currently lobbying to ensure the rights of women and children are included in the new constitution. 'Many Yemeni women still lack understanding about their rights and entitlements, and even educated women are afraid to speak out. We need civil society organisations to carry out awareness campaigns about the impact of child marriage in rural and urban areas to empower women. 'I want to make my voice heard and change the lives of women in Yemen. Women shouldn’t have to be victims. I suffered domestic violence but now I’m speaking out. 'I refuse to live under the ruins of my past.' Growing crisis: A 40-year-old bridegroom and his 11-year-old bride during their wedding in Damarda, Afghanistan. Many countries have no lower age limit for marriage . Following reports of the . Rawan case, the European Union's foreign policy chief, Baroness . Catherine Ashton, called on the Yemeni government to investigate and . make arrests. Days later, Yemen's human rights minister has asked parliament to pass a law setting a minimum age for marriage. The minimum age was 15 years old until the 1990s when the government overturned the law. There are currently 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. At this rate, the figure is expected to rise to 140 million by 2020. It . is a common custom among poorer families who rely on their daughter to . help herself and the rest of the family to build their income. In Yemen, more than a quarter of females marry before age 15, according to a report in 2010 by the Social Affairs Ministry. In Africa, 42 per cent; Latin America and the Caribbean, 29 per cent. In India, almost half the population (46 . per cent) of girls are married by the time they reach 18, according to . the National Family Health Survey-3.","Noora Al Shami's parents gave her to distant cousin to escape poverty .

They were . apart and he was engaged to someone else, but he was the father of her . son. I felt a huge sympathy towards her. ‘I . am hurt and angry. Having been left to raise Jack on her own, I . wouldn’t have expected her to place me – someone who had been kind to . her – in a similar position.’ Fusilier Rigby, 25, was murdered in the . street close to his barracks in Woolwich, South London, last May by . Islamic fanatics Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale who are . awaiting sentence. Miss . Kirkwood said she had offered sympathy and support when Mrs Rigby . visited her and her husband in Cyprus. ‘Around three months after Lee’s . murder, Rebecca came to Cyprus where David and I were based,’ she told . the Sunday Mirror. ‘One evening she arrived at our house with a friend. Rebecca broke down and poured her heart out. However David was already married to Rebecca's friend Emma Kirkwood. He has now left her and their 15-month-old daughter Lilly Mae in order to start his new life . David (centre) - who appeared weeping on TV after Lee's killing - abandoned another of his wives in order to start a relationship with Emma in 2009 . ‘She . said she loved Lee and that they had been about to get back together. I . had no idea whether that was true, but I tried to comfort her as best I . could. To start a relationship with my husband within weeks of that . night is devastating.’ On their return to the UK Mr George moved out and . stopped answering his phone and emails. Miss . Kirkwood heard rumours he had been seeing Mrs Rigby and confronted him . during a meeting in London. She said: ‘I looked at him as he held our . daughter and asked if he was seeing Rebecca. ‘He . looked me in the eye and swore on Lilly-Mae’s life that he hadn’t seen . her for weeks. I knew he was lying. That’s the last either of us has . seen of him.’ Miss Kirkwood . said she also confronted Mrs Rigby who flatly denied an affair. But her . fears were confirmed last week when the couple were pictured together . shopping in Halifax. Lee was murdered in a street in Woolwich in May last year by Michael Adobolajo, 28 (left) and Michael Adebowale, 22 (right), who will be sentenced later this month . She . said that when she first got together with Mr George he had claimed to . be single, but was actually married with a son. Miss Kirkwood added: . ‘His first wife will be laughing at me now, thinking I deserve this, but . if I’d known he was married in the first place he’d never have got near . me. ‘At 23, he’s left two . wives and two of his own children behind. As well as thinking about what . they’re doing to my family, Rebecca might want to think about his track . record for her own sake and her son’s.’ No one was in to comment at Mrs Rigby’s home in Halifax.","David George, colleague of Lee Rigby, is dating his widow Rebecca .

"By . Wills Robinson . This is the shocking moment a reckless father and his young son took shelter from 30ft waves after they walked out to a perilous stack of rocks during a vicious storm. The pair wandered 50ft away from the main coastal path in Portland, Dorset, to the outcrop known as Pulpit Rock, and were left exposed to the high winds and choppy seas. As the powerful waves broke around them, the father grabbed hold of the boy, aged about 11, and stood up against one side of the giant rock. Shocking: The pair are thought to have gone for a walk during extreme storms and wandered 50ft from the main coastal path in Portland, Dorset . Perilous: As the powerful waves broke over the front of the huge stack of stones, the father grabbed hold of the boy, aged about 11 . The large waves crashed around them; leaving the pair soaking wet while a stunned passer-by stopped and photographed the scene. A spokesman from Portland Coastguard said: 'Had the pair been struck directly by a wave they would have been washed away. 'They placed themselves at a significant risk by doing that.' Police and coastguards have repeatedly warned sightseers to stay away from the sea front during the dramatic storms. The RNLI warned people not to take any chances and said the behaviour had been irresponsible. James . Millidge, RNLI community incident reduction manager in the south west, . said: 'Ducking waves at any time is not only foolhardy but extremely . dangerous - including for those RNLI volunteers who may have to come to . the rescue you if the sea washes people away. 'The sea is far more powerful than people think and the chances of survival are slim for people who are dragged in to the swell. 'There's the risk of drowning, of dying from cold water shock or from being battered back on to the rocks by the crashing waves. 'We understand why people want to experience extreme weather, but we would urge folk to do it from a safe distance.' Risk: The large waves crashed around the pair as they stood helplessly on the rock. A spokesman for the coastguard said if they had been directly by the water, they could have been washed away . Exposed: The father and son were spotted by a stunned passer-by who stopped to photograph the horrifying scene . Yesterday, a man perched on the edge of the coast in Bude, Devon, as waves came down over his head. The . unidentified man was wearing a suit as he left himself vulnerable to . the vicious conditions during the extreme weather which has impacted . Britain since Christmas. Onlookers were horrified as the man stood for 15-20 minutes in weather that has claimed lives and torn apart homes. Stupid: A man clad in a suit looks sharp but then stands on the coast in Bude as perilous wave crash overhead . Bewildered: Onlookers were shocked to see him being drenched in the storm as emergency services blast storm tourists . Julia Devitt, who saw the man joking with his friend, said: 'We couldn't quite believe what we saw. There on the edge of the sea pool wall was a man dressed in a suit. 'He was with someone else who we presume was taking photos or video from the relative safety of the steps. 'This man kept coming back to pose, long after we thought it was safe to do so. It was scary.' In January a family in Cornwall narrowly escaped . being swept into the sea when a 20ft wave washed over them as they were . walking along a sea wall. At .

"Abu Hamza told how he 'happy' he was about the September 11 attacks . Abu Hamza told how he 'happy' he was about the September 11 attacks in a broadcast interview, saying it left Muslims and non-Muslims around the world rejoicing, according to a tape played for the jury at his terrorism trial on Monday. He did not hesitate when asked about the attack that killed nearly 3,000 people and could be heard casually speaking of the attacks in the undated interview with a Canadian broadcaster, even equating what Al Qaeda did to the hero in American movies. He is currently on trial in New York after being extradited to the US to face terrorism charges. 'Everybody was happy when the planes hit the World Trade Center,' Hamza said in the interview. 'Anybody who tell you he was not happy, they are hypocrites.' He said the World Trade Center was a legitimate target because of its role in globalisation. 'It's the centre of, of, of evil,' Hamza said. 'Political and financial evil for the whole world.' The interview was played after U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest last week turned down a request by defence lawyers to exclude it from trial on the grounds that it would unfairly prejudice their client. 'Expressing clear and unequivocal support for terrorism is no doubt prejudicial,' the judge said. 'However, the defendant is charged with just those sorts of crimes.' Hamza, 56, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he conspired to support Al Qaeda by trying to set up a terrorist training camp in 1999 in Oregon. He also is accused of helping to abduct two American tourists and 14 others in Yemen in 1998. Four hostages died. He did not hesitate when asked about the attack that killed nearly 3,000 people and could be heard casually speaking of the attacks in the undated interview with a Canadian broadcaster, even equating what Al Qaeda did to the hero in American movies . The tape was played during the testimony of a terrorism investigator for the prosecutor's office in Manhattan. 'This is what you teach your people in cowboy films when you see the aggressors being, doing bad things, and then the hero comes and gives him a couple of punches in his face,' Hamza said during the interview. 'That's exactly like this. So I would be hypocrite if I tell you no. All Muslims are happy, even non-Muslims are happy.' According to the taped interview, Hamza said it was right to use airplanes against those who use planes to 'oppress nations and kill them and maim them.' He added: 'What do you call this when you go and bombard people and kill them by thousands just because you have ability to fly higher?' In the interview, Hamza also said he agreed with the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen. The attack killed 17 American sailors. David Smith, one of his former worshippers, said . Hamza was like ‘two different people’ and was able to switch between the . two whenever he wanted - aggressive and outrageous when at the pulpit . but was a ‘nice guy’ when talking amongst his followers. The . testimony reveals one of the techniques Hamza used to manipulate his . followers and spread hate in North London at the notorious mosque before . police closed it down in 2003. Under . cross-examination from Hamza’s lawyer Jeremy Schneider, Mr Smith said . that he first heard Hamza’s preachings on tapes of his sermons that he . bought in Seattle. The court heard how the radical cleric adopted an aggressive and fiery persona to preach a message of jihad . Abu Hamza is standing trial for terrorism offences at New York Federal Court . Mr Smith was so impressed that in 1999 he flew to London to talk in person to Hamza. He . agreed with Mr Schneider that during their 45-minute meeting at the . Finsbury Park mosque that the preacher was a ‘nice guy’ who seemed . ‘cool’. Mr . Schneider said: ‘Is it fair to say that when you met him [Hamza] and . talked to him personally, it was like two different people, the person . you met and the person you hear on those tapes?’ Mr Smith replied: ‘If you believe like him, yes’. Mr Schneider suggested that in his sermons Hamza had ‘one personality’ and in private he had a ‘different approach’. Mr Smith said: ‘If you mean he’s not screaming and hollering at you, yes’. Mr Schneider asked: ‘When he was at the podium, that’s when he gets fiery?’ Mr Smith replied: ‘Yes’. This week the trial is due to hear from James Ujaama, a former follower of Hamza from Seattle who moved to London and worshiped at Finsbury Park mosque. He has been waiting 11 years to testify against Hamza under the terms of a 2003 plea deal which meant he only served two years for terrorism-related offences instead of up to 30. If convicted of the most serious charges, the Egyptian-born Hamza would face life in prison. The Finsbury Park mosque, since closed, where Abu Hamza preached to his followers . He previously served several years in prison in Britain for inciting his followers to kill non-believers. Extradited from Britain in 2012 under the condition that he would be tried in civilian court and not face the death penalty. Defense lawyers have argued that Hamza, known for his fiery sermons in London, is responsible only for using inflammatory words, not for any overt criminal acts. Prosecutors intend to use his rhetoric against him via video and audio recordings that show him denouncing non-Muslims and preaching Islamic fundamentalism and encouraging followers to become militants. Prosecutors also played several other tapes, some in Arabic, for the jurors, who were given English transcripts. Some of the tapes were seized from the Finsbury Park mosque or from Hamza's residence. Hamza lost both hands and one eye in Afghanistan in the 1980s and was known in London for wearing a prosthetic metal hook on his right arm. In court, he has taken notes with a pen wedged in his hook. Hamza plans to testify at the trial at Manhattan’s Federal Court which is expected to last about a month.","Hamza said attacks left Muslims and non-Muslims around the world happy .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . and Chris Pleasance . and Chris Paine . Leonore Draper, 32, was an active member in the community- she was a campaigner for women impacted by HIV and AIDS . A woman who campaigned heavily against violence was fatally shot in Chicago - moments after leaving a fundraiser she had helped to organise for a youth anti-violence charity. Leonore Draper, 32, attended the Project Orange Tree event in the Chicago suburb of West Pullman before she was attacked on Friday evening. Draper was shot in the arm and chest and died on the way to Advocate Christ Medical Center, Chicago Defender reports. The fundraiser, called A Charitable Confection, was dedicated to Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old girl who was shot dead in the city last year. Draper's brother Adrian Murrow said the family was in shock. 'She wasn't the type of person that would ever try to mess you up ever,' he told the Chicago Sun-Times. 'She was always trying to put a smile on your face.' Draper was an active member in the community. In addition to her anti-violence advocacy she was a campaigner for women impacted by HIV and AIDS. Draper's neighbour Andrew Loss told ABC Local she was in her car at the time of the shooting, dropping off her disabled husband. 'Some little girl was taking the man into the house. Then when the little girl came back out the lady, she was dead,' he said. Hadiya Pendleton, 15, was shot dead as she stood in a Chicago park with friends last January . The 32-year-old's friend Delk Adams described Draper as a 'bright light' and said the incident was sadly sympomatic of the violent culture they're trying to eradicate. 'We need to stop this,' she told ABC Local. 'We're losing people that don't need to be lost. There needs to be something done.' It comes after a spate of violence in Chicago over the Easter weekend  left nine people dead and another 36 wounded, including six children aged 11 to 15. The news came the same day that police chief Garry McCarthy praised his force for keeping homicides down to their lowest level - 415 last year - since 1965. That figure was an 18 per cent drop on 2012 and he said this year's rate is 'still ahead of where we were last year'. Speaking to WGN Radio's Steve Cochran, Supt McCarthy said: 'A week doesn't wipe out two years of progress. 'We always knew that we're going to have good days and we're going to have bad days, we've just got to make sure we're having more good days than bad.' Gerry McCarthy, the city's Police Chief, announced that Chicago's homicide rate has dropped - despite a spate of violence over the Easter weekend . Nine people were killed and 36 injured in 48 hours over the weekend, including five children aged 11 to 15 who were shot in a drive-by, and another 15-year-old girl shot while she was in a car (file pic) He praised officers for 'getting out in front of the shootings' but told CNN it would take time for the improvements to be felt. In the latest round of violence five children were shot in a drive-by on Sunday night after a person in a vehicle reportedly asked if the children were members of a particular street gang, then opened fire. A sixth youngster, a 15-year-old girl, was shot while riding in a vehicle in what appears to be a separate gang-related incident. Supt McCarthy highlighted the Easter killings to call for more gun control laws. 'It's just insanity that there's such a proliferation of firearms that they're so easy to get your hands on,' Supt McCarthy told WGN Radio . 'The studies show when there's more restrictive gun laws, there's less gun violence. It's not brain surgery, it's really really simple. 'It's going to take us a while to fix poverty and the break-up of the family units and education and jobs. But we can do something about gun laws today and we're just not doing it.'","Leonore Draper attacked after attending Project Orange Tree charity event .

"By . Rob Waugh . Burrowing tracks made by a centimetre-long prehistoric slug have pushed the earliest traces of animal life back 30 million years. The soft-bodied creature left its marks in a region of silty sediment in central Uruguay called the Tacuari Formation. Rock dating has determined that the tracks are 585 million years old, 30 million years older than any previously known animal traces. Signs of life: Burrowing tracks made by a centimetre-long prehistoric slug have pushed the earliest traces of animal life back 30 million years . Unlike simpler life forms, true animals such as the slug are ‘bilaterian’ and have a front and back as well as an upper and lower side. The new findings suggest that bilaterian animals appeared between ice ages during the early Ediacaran period. This pre-dates the ‘Cambrian explosion’ when life diversified into a myriad different forms. Scientists believe the slug-like creature grazed through sediments at the bottom of a shallow sea. The team, led by Dr Ernesto Pecoits from the University of Alberta in Canada, wrote in the journal Science: ‘It appears as though a maximum interval of 50 million years exists between the earliest definitive evidence of sponges and the bilaterians found in the Tacuari Formation, which implies that early animal evolution took place on a geologically rapid time scale once environmental conditions proved favourable for higher forms of life to colonise the ocean realm.’ Prior to the new discovery the oldest evidence of bilaterian animal life, found in Russia, dated back 555 million years.","Slug burrowed through sediment in Uruguay 585 million years ago .

"By . Leon Watson . A new survey into drug use in Britain has found that one in ten people have tried 'legal highs' - double the global average. And Britain's drug users are increasingly going online to feed their habits rather than use street dealers, research has found. The 2014 Global Drug Survey said buyers look online because they say the quality is better, there is more choice and it is more convenient. Deals are made using hidden online drug marketplaces such as Silk Road, which was the largest online black market site in the world until it was shut down last year. Marijuana is increasingly being bought online, the 214 Global Drugs Survey has found . The most likely drug to be bought online was cannabis, followed by MDMA, LSD and ketamine. The 2014 Global Drug Survey questioned almost 80,000 drug users from 43 countries,  7,326 of them from the UK. It is the largest research of its kind. It is an anonymous . study that provides a rare look into the illegal drugs being used at any . point in time and they way they are traded. Because the study isn't random, it doesn't show the . prevalence of certain drugs or habits but it can show, comparatively, which ones . seem to be on the rise and how their users take them. While most users still get their drugs from dealers, researchers found the UK has the highest percentage of people who had ever bought drugs over the internet. Almost a quarter of UK respondents to the survey said they had bought drugs over the internet. Hallucinogenic so called magic mushrooms are one of the most popular drugs being sold online . Available online: Triangle shaped white MDMA drug pills (stock picture) Reincarnated: Silk Road 2.0 is the reincarnation of Silk Road, the online black market that was dramatically shut down last year following a high-profile FBI sting . Silk Road provides anonymity to drug dealers and buyers . using a sub-layer of the Internet unreachable by normal search engines . known as Deepnet, the Invisible Web, the Undernet or the Hidden Web. Most of the Web's information is buried far down on dynamically . generated sites, unable to be found or seen by traditional search . engines - sites or pages don't exist until created as the result of a . specific search. An Internet search is like dragging a net across the . surface of the sea - a great deal of information is caught, but a . majority is deep and therefore missed. Just under 60 per cent of UK responders knew about Silk Road, and of these, 44 per cent had accessed the site. Almost a quarter said they had bought drugs over the internet. Dr Adam Winstock, a consultant addictions psychiatrist in London and director of the survey, said that the results suggested a new . trend. 'The fact that 44 per cent of respondents who had bought drugs online said they'd done it for the first time recently says to me there is growing recruitment,' he told The Guardian. 'It is currently a minority way to get drugs, but it really mimics the growth in e-commerce – we buy things online becuase it is convenient, cheap, and there is a better product range.' He added that the survey also reveals that the UK, more than any other country, is a nation of hedonists. Figures revealed 73.8 per cent of respondents had taken at least one illegal drug over the last 12 months. Alcohol was the most common drug taken, followed by tobacco and cannabis.","Survey said buyers look online because they say the quality is better .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Tragedy: 11-month-old Gavin Soto was killed after being crushed by his decimated home after a tornado swirled through his neighborhood . An 11-month-old baby died after a tornado leveled the house he and his family were sheltering in to ride out violent storms ripping through their North Carolina neighborhood. Gavin Soto became the first confirmed tornado death of the year when he succumbed Friday night to injuries resulting from being trapped in the rubble of his home, authorities said. He survived the initial demolition of the family’s Edenton home, but died at a local hospital, sources told NBC News. The toddler's mother tried to shield him from harm by covering his body with her's, but it did not make a difference. Neighbors walking through the terrorscape left behind by the EF2 twister heard the mother crying for help from under the decimated remains of her home and helped pull her to safety, WAVY reported. The baby was alive when taken to the hospital, but died soon after arriving, sources said. Soto’s mother was also hospitalized, but the extent of her injuries is not known. Footage from the scene shows the home was actually lifted up and thrown several feet from the front steps. The killer tornado was one of two to strike the area Friday night as violent storms rage across the southern half of the country. The damage was so severe that North Carolina governor Pat McCrory visited the neighborhood and pledged ‘whatever available’ funding he could find to help residents rebuild. Terrorscape: Soto's home was thrown several feet off it's foundation and was left unrecognizable . “It breaks my heart,’ he told WAVY. ‘It broke my heart to see the house.’ ‘I understand the mother did everything she could to protect the baby,’ he continued. ‘If you saw the house, it just fell on top of the family.’ Deadly tornadoes have swirled through several towns leaving behind paths of destruction not yet seen this year. A total of six people including Soto have died as a result of the storms, according to reports. At least two were in Oklahoma and one in Arkansas. The storms are expected to intensify and produce lethal tornadoes through Sunday night, according to forecasters.","Gavin Soto was only 11-months-old when the tornado took his life .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Banned: Kieran Stott has been handed an ASBO banning him from stepping foot in Birkenhead town centre, unless he is with his mother . He may not be the most menacing person to look at, but this 16-year-old boy has been banned from an entire town centre unless he is there with his mother. Kieran Stott led a 30-strong group of yobs on a rampage who terrorised shoppers by throwing fireworks at cars and hurling abuse, leaving one street in Birkenhead looking like a 'New York ghetto'. In . one incident witnesses said Stott was seen 'enjoying the chaos' after a . fire hydrant was set off. Staff and . customers in shops, particularly McDonald's and Bargain Booze were said . to have been left alarmed by his behaviour. On his Facebook he can be . seen holding a baton whilst young pals brandished a toy dagger and a . gold knuckleduster. One . posting showed a picture of a police van with . the caption: 'Hate the police they take the job to hart (sic).' He also called himself a member of the self styled 'Birkenhead Boyz'. Wirral Magistrates' Court heard the teenager was involved in at least 36 incidents, including intimidating and harrassing people and causing criminal damage. Details . of Stott's campaign of misery emerged when magistrates ordered he be named and shamed and issued with an ASBO banning . him from parts of Birkenhead - unless he is with his mother. He is also banned from meeting several friends in public. Speaking after the hearing Stott said: 'I have done some of it and I have admitted it. 'I haven’t been smashing windows or putting fireworks through letterboxes or intimidating people with knives. 'It’s stupid. It’s making me feel horrible (that mum’s getting upset). My face is all over the paper and I feel ashamed. I’m not going back to college, my face is all over the papers, I’m embarrassed.' His mother Tracie Stott admitted her son is 'no angel' but added 'he is not what they are making him out to be'. Gang leader: Looking as though butter wouldn't melt, a younger Kieran Stott is picutred in his school uniform. The teenager was said to be the leader of a 30-strong gang of yobs who terrorised shoppers in Birkenhead . She said: 'He is no angel by any means, if he has done something wrong yes he should get punished for it. 'He is being made out to be the ringleader. He is admitting doing things, some of it. He has been in the group messing about at McDonalds. 'He is not out of control in the house. I suppose he can do a bit of showing off. 'In my eyes I have done the best that I can. I come from a good family. I ground him. I take his phone and xbox from him and stop his money. That’s for everything. He has been punished and then they have the cheek to do this. 'He is totally gobsmacked, I think he is in shock. At college they all say what a nice lad he is but he can have his moments. 'He is easily influenced but he is far from a ringleader. Even when he is not there it is still happening. I haven’t seen any weapons.' Ali . Bayatti, prosecuting on behalf of Wirral council, handed the court a . dosssier of evidence detailing 'a series of at least 36 specific . incidents of anti-social behaviour in which the youngster was involved . in'. Yobs: Wirral Magistrates' Court heard Stott was part of a group who was seen throwing fireworks at cars and hurling abuse at passers-by who dared to intervene . He said the authority believed Stott was the leader of the gang - which numbered up to 30 at times. Mr . Bayatti said: 'The behaviour details incidents of verbal abuse, . intimidating behaviour, causing criminal damage, throwing things and . harassing people passing by.' Stott . was said to be among people repeatedly causing trouble and alarming . staff and customers in shops, particularly McDonalds and Bargain Booze. He . was also identified as being part of a group whose members had been . seen throwing fireworks at cars and shops, though he was not listed as . having thrown any himself, and shouting abuse at people in the streets. Last . July he was found 'enjoying the chaos' after a fire hydrant was set off . in a scene described in court as making the road 'look like a New York . ghetto'. Mr Bayatti added: . 'In relation to this defendant we classed the behaviour so severe that . it necessitated an application for an Anti-Social Behaviour Order.' Defending Stott, Matt Harvey disputed that his client was a leader of the gang and added that he had no previous convictions. Menace: Magistrates were handed a dossier of 36 offences Stott, pictured here with friends, was involved with. Magistrates banned the teen from meeting with friends in public under the terms of his ASBO . But . chairman of the bench Phil Rowlands approved the ASBO, which bans Stott . from entering parts of Birkenhead including sections of Grange Road and . Grange Road West unless he is with his mum or on public transport. He . is also banned from associating with eight individuals in any public . place in Wirral unless he is invited to attend by the council or police. A . reporting restriction banning the publication of Stott's identity was . lifted by magistrates 'due to the nature of the offences and to reassure victims . that action was being taken to protect them'. Restriction lifted: A reporting restriction in place to stop Stott being identified was lifted by Wirral Magistrates' Court, pictured, allowing the teenager to be named and shamed and to reassure victims that action was being taken . Stott will be subject to the ASBO for three years. Mohammed Rizhi, a local shopkeeper said: 'He (Stott) used to come and stand in front of the shop with all the others. He would send people in and they would steal ice creams. 'He is not a good guy he used to drink as well. I had to ban him from the shop about three or four months ago. 'He is very abusive. He used to taunt me from the window eyeballing me. I’ve seen them play with the football, kicking it against the window.' Labour . Councillor George Davies, Wirral's cabinet member for neighbourhoods, . housing and engagement, welcomed the ASBO, applied for after work by the . council, police and family housing associations. He . said: 'I hope this successful court action sends the message loud and . clear that such alarming and distressing anti-social behaviour will not . be tolerated in Wirral.'","Kieran Stott named and shamed by magistrates who handed him an ASBO .

"By . Richard Spillett . Max Clifford went into work today as he remains on bail ahead of his sentencing hearing on Friday . Victims of disgraced PR expert Max Clifford could sue him for his millions following his convictions for indecent assault. The 71-year-old was found guilty of carrying out sex attacks on four victims yesterday, with a jury clearing him of assaults on two other women. The convictions, the first under the Operation Yewtree investigation set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, could now pave the way for a string of civil law suits. Lawyers say the jury's verdicts will strengthen any case for damages brought before civil courts, with victims able to claim damages for any trauma or potential loss of earnings  caused by his offences. Liz Dux, who represents over 150 complainants in the Yewtree inquiry for law firm Slater and Gordon, said: 'The victims have already proven their case to the higher standard of proof required in a criminal trial, so would have good grounds to bring a civil case. 'They will have to make claims against him individually rather than any organisation, but he is a man of significant assets.' It emerged yesterday that there were 23 alleged victims who came forward to police, but prosecutors decided to proceed only with what they perceived to be the strongest cases. Experts say the civil claims may not be limited to those accusers whose claims led to conviction, meaning other women could also sue Clifford. Tracey Story, expert in abuse claims at law firm Irwin Mitchell, added: 'Others may not have as strong a case, but the standard of proof is lower in civil proceedings so, it would be a challenge for them, but it doesn't necessarily mean their cases would fail. 'The time limit for bringing claims of this kind is the victim's 21st birthday or three years from the date of the abuse. 'But exceptions are made in cases where victims can still get a fair hearing. The fact that there has so recently been a fair trial of the facts in this case means victims would have a very strong claim that they are still in time.' The Metropolitan Police refused to confirm whether further alleged victims have come forward since Clifford's conviction yesterday. Clifford has two large homes in Hersham, Sussex, one he valued at £3.5million in 2008 and another, which his daughter Louise lives in, he valued at £2.5million five years ago. Clifford, pictured leaving his home in Surrey yesterday, could be set to lose his millions to compensation claims from his victims . The Land Registry says property prices in the area have increased by around five per cent a year since then, meaning the two homes could now have a combined worth of up to £8million. The PR expert also has a house in an exclusive golf development in the hills near Nuevo Andalucia, southern Spain, which he valued at £1.5million in 2008. Clifford has said he made £2.5million a year from his PR work. The latest accounts for his company, Max Clifford Associates, in 2012 show a turnover of around £3.5million and give the firm an estimated worth of £1.2million. Clifford has also boasted he gets a new Bentley - each worth £200,000 - every two years. Clifford is bundled into a car after he was found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault at Southwark Crown Court yesterday . The disgraced publicist was seen arriving at his scaled-down offices in Weybridge, Surrey today, a far cry from his former palatial HQ in London's West End. Neighbours said they thought he would stay at home while he awaits his sentencing hearing on Friday and were surprised to see him out and about. One local, who asked not to be named said: 'You would have thought he'd keep his head down knowing the fate awaiting him but his appearance today in public only underscores his arrogance.' Clifford has said his lawyers have advised him not to comment on his situation. Prosecutors are still deciding how to deal with one count of indecent assault upon which the jury could not reach a verdict. Clifford continues to deny that charge.","Experts say victims will have strong claims for damages in civil law suits .

"By . James Chapman . David Cameron said he would step down as Prime Minister if he could not guaranteed an EU referendum . David Cameron has suggested he would resign if he fails to deliver his pledge to hold a referendum on Britain’s membership after the next general election. He accepted voters were ‘sceptical’ about his promise but insisted: ‘I would not continue as Prime Minister unless it can be absolutely guaranteed this referendum will go ahead on an in-out basis.’ Mr Cameron last night also made clear that a referendum is a ‘deal breaker’ in any future coalition negotiations – insisting it could not be ditched if he were to fail to win an outright majority and seek a new power-sharing deal with Nick Clegg. ‘This is a guaranteed part of our plan... I can’t make it any clearer than that,’ he said. ‘This is a totally key part of our plan.’ The US-style 'telephone town hall' events have been quietly organised for Downing Street by PR firm inHouse Communications. V . oters are emailed asking if they would like to join a conference call with the Prime Minister. Last night's was the second time Mr Cameron has deployed the new campaign tactic. Mr Cameron has pledged to hold a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe by the end of 2017 if he remains in Downing Street, whether or not he succeeds in negotiating substantial changes in our relationship with Brussels. But he made it clear he wants to see changes to the EU’s fundamental treaties ahead of the vote in 2017. ‘I’m giving myself some time to negotiate these changes – two years after the election to fix this renegotiation,’ he told a conference call with handpicked members of the public. ‘But people can absolutely be guaranteed that if I am Prime Minister after the next election, that referendum will take place.’ His remarks come amid a growing focus on the EU ahead of next month’s elections to the European Parliament. Polls suggest Ukip are on course to win. Boris Johnson yesterday attacked the ‘continual deceit’ that Britain can control immigration while remaining members of an EU with an unrestrained right to free movement. The London Mayor said voters realised the Government was ‘not doing anything’ about ‘completely untramelled’ migration from the Continent. His intervention came as Ed Miliband’s policy guru warned Labour risks losing support to Ukip because it has become too ‘middle class’ and needs to address concerns about immigration and welfare. Boris Johnson yesterday attacked the 'continual deceit' that Britain can control immigration while remaining members of an EU with an unrestrained right to free movement . Lord Glasman, a policy adviser elevated to the House of Lords by the Labour leader, warned the support of the working classes had ‘died’ in 2010 and the rise of Nigel Farage’s party was eating into his party’s ‘heartlands’. His blunt message came as another poll suggested Ukip is on course to win the European elections on May 22, which Mr Farage has claimed will trigger a ‘political earthquake’ in Britain. Mr Johnson said Tories ‘shouldn’t be talking about what other parties are going to do about the EU’, but should focus on it being the only major party offering voters a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe. He also told Total Politics magazine that significant reforms to the right to free movement were needed to win back trust. Mr Cameron has suggested changes to the rules will be among his demands in a proposed renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with Brussels ahead of a referendum in 2017. ‘We are living in cloud cuckoo land,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘One of the reasons people are so angry about immigration... it’s the continual deceit that we can somehow solve this problem whilst remaining members of the EU. They can see there’s a massive incoherence in the argument.’","PM suggested he would resign if he fails to deliver referendum pledge .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Downton Abbey will dramatise Edward VIII's first love affair with a married woman, five years before he met Wallis Simpson as part of the programme's Christmas special. The future King's affair with socialite Freda Dudley Ward has been written into a storyline, which sees Downton character Lady Rose presented at Buckingham Palace for her coming out. During the episode Lady Rose, played by Lily James, is seen dancing in the arms of Prince Edward, who later became Edward VIII before abdicating to marry divorcee Wallis Simpson. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Love affair: Downton Abbey will dramatise the affair between married Freda Dudley Ward, pictured left,  and Prince Edward, later Edward VIII. The socialite is played by Janet Montgomery, right, in the Christmas special . The prince's secret love affair with his first mistress began in 1918 when the couple, who were both 23, met in a doorway in Mayfair, London, as they sheltered from a First World War Zeppelin Raid. Mrs Dudley Ward had already been married for five years and had two daughters by her husband, Liberal MP William Dudley Ward, who was 16 years older than her. Her husband apparently turned a blind . eye to the affair, although the relationship was well-known to . aristocrats and politicians. Couple: Freda Dudley Ward and Prince Prince Edward with Viscountess Furness and Prince George of Hanover in 1932 . Romantic entanglements: The Prince of Wales (left) pictured with Freda Dudley-Ward, and her husband liberal MP William Dudley-Ward, and right, with Wallis Simpson on their wedding day in 1937 . Prince Edward would bombard Mrs Dudley Ward her with extravagant gifts, including a gold watch, and wrote letters to his 'precious Fredie Wedie', signing off as 'adoring little David' - the name he went by. By 1919, the prince wrote he was 'fearfully madly' in love, and . appears to have introduced her to members of the Royal Family, including . his brother Bertie, the future King George VI. Winston Churchill travelled on a train with the couple in 1927 and . noted: 'It was quite pathetic to see the prince with Freda. His love is . so obvious and undisguisable.' However, after 15 years the prince broke off the relationship when he met Mrs Simpson in 1934 and embarked on the romance which led to the abdication crisis two years later. Letters of note: A photograph of the Prince of Wales surrounded by some of the love letters that the young Royal wrote to his sweetheart Freda Dudley-Ward . When the prince met Mrs Simpson, he abruptly severed all ties to his former love. In a call to the Palace in 1934, Mrs Dudley Ward was told . by an operator: 'I have orders not to put you through.' Mr and Mrs Dudley Ward divorced in 1931. Her second marriage to Spanish nobleman the Marques de Casa Maury, who she married in October 1937 also ended . in divorce in 1954. She died in 1983, at 88, and never spoke of the affair. Mrs Dudley Ward, played by actress Janet Montgomery, follows other historical . characters to make an appearance on the series, including writer . Virginia Woolf and soprano Dame Nelly Melba. Prince Edward will be played by Oliver Dinsdale, while his father King George V, who receives Lady Rose at Buckingham Palace, is portrayed by Guy Williams. Drama: Downton Abbey's Crawley family will face a scandal that threatens to engulf the monarchy as Lady Rose, right, is presented at Buckingham Palace for her 'coming out' Royal appointment: Lady Rose, pictured with the Countess of Grantham, as she is presented at Buckingham Palace . Hollywood stars Shirley MacLaine and Paul Giamatti also return for the two-hour Christmas Day episode, which is set six months after the last series. ITV have provided little detail about just how the Crawleys will be involved with Mrs Dudley Ward, although a tantalising trailer gives viewers a sneak peak at what is to come. 'When the Crawleys are, implicated in a scandal that threatens to engulf the monarchy, Robert will go to great lengths to protect the Royal family, and his own', the broadcaster said.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A dedicated New York elementary school teacher can finally breathe easy after she got her students through some rigorous standardized tests - and herself a new pair of lungs. Tricia Moses, 38, of Canarsie is suffering from scleroderma, an autoimmune disease that slowly turned her lungs into scar tissue and affects her skin, blood vessels, muscles and organs. Doctors told Moses she needed a lung transplant - but she delayed the life-saving surgery to prepare her third graders with special needs for state exams. Dedicated: Tricia Moses delayed a much-needed lung transplant to prep her third-grade class for important state tests . 'I couldn’t leave my students because I loved them so much,' Moses told the New York Daily News. Moses, 38, is battling scleroderma - an autoimmune disease that was slowly stealing her ability to breathe. She was diagnosed with the rare disease in 2011, when she noticed that she would get fatigued just writing on the chalkboard, and that her muscles and joints would ache. A persistant cough that would come on in fits lasting up to seven minutes further confounded doctors. Then, Moses suffered a miscarriage when she was three months pregnant. 'I coughed my child out. I knew my body couldn’t take it,' Moses told the Daily News. 'It was heartbreaking.' Popular teacher: Moses has been teaching for 14 years and wants to return to class as soon as she has healed enough . Breathing a sigh of relief: Moses will leave Pittsburgh after months of recovery to return home to Brooklyn on Wednesday . She was told she needed a lung transplant in 2012, but the gutsy teacher continued to show up for class every day, toting an oxygen tanHer doctors don't know how she did it. 'I was just really surprised that she was still able to work,' Moses' rheumatologist Robyn Domsic told the Daily News. 'She was requiring a lot of oxygen at that point.' Moses was scheduled for a lifesaving lung transplant last spring, but opted to put off the surgery until her students got through their exams in April 2013. 'She’s an amazing person. A pillar of strength, courage and humanity,' fifth-grade teacher Sandra Boyke told the Daily News. 'She puts others before herself.' When Moses finally got her transplant on January 29 at Pittsburgh Medical Center, one of only two hospitals in the U.S. that performs the surgery, surgeons had to trim a set of lungs to fit her body because she couldn't afford to wait for a smaller pair. New beginnings: Moses suffered pain, fatigue and a miscarriage as a result of her illness but she's now on the mend . As she recovered in Pittsburgh, Moses kept up with her students, talking to them on Facetime and Skype and receiving hand-drawn cards from children at Public School 233 in East Flatbush who miss her terribly. Now, she's heading home to Brooklyn to see her beloved students after months of arduous recovery. 'I thank God I’m coming back,' Moses told the Daily News. 'I just want to get back to my students and family and raise awareness of my disease and the desperate need for donors.' Moses still faces the risk of her body rejecting the lungs, so she's on huge amounts of medication to keep that risk at bay. She won't be able to return to teaching a full class until next January, because there are too many germs and too much risk of illness for her, but she'll be tutoring smaller groups when she can. 'I miss her very much, her smile, the way she speaks, everything about her,' Jerell Johnson, 12, a former pupil who is now a fifth-grader at PS 233 told the Daily News. 'She gave people chances, even when we got on her nerves. I love her.' Moses plans to return to Brooklyn on Wednesday and the first thing she wants to do it visit her class.","Tricia Moses, 38, delayed life-saving transplant surgery to prep her students for state exams .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A patriotic forklift driver was sacked after he turned up for work in an England flag hat - on St George’s Day. Adam Lawson, 32, wanted to celebrate England's national day at his job at South Marston Distribution Centre (SDC) in Swindon, Wiltshire. But the father-of-three was ordered to remove the red and white flat cap because it was not part of the official uniform. Forklift driver Adam Lawson, from Swindon, Wiltshire, was sacked after refusing to take off a England flag cap at work on St George's Day . The 32-year-old believes St George's day is a proud tradition and said he was not offending anyone with his novelty cap . Mr Lawson refused - and was later told never to come back. Mr Lawson, who is also from Swindon, said: 'I was told that I couldn’t work while I was wearing it as it did not match uniform standards. 'It is ridiculous, it was St George’s Day and it was a little thing that I wanted to do to celebrate it. 'St George’s Day is part of English culture, I didn’t want to offend anyone or cause malice and I don’t believe I did. 'I’m disgusted as I’m a patriotic guy and to me it is wrong that I wasn’t allowed to celebrate English culture and was deterred from doing so, as I wasn’t doing any harm. 'I think it is a sad state of affairs if we are stopped from acknowledging our culture.' South Marston Distribution Centre (SDC), where Mr Lawson had worked for eight months, said Mr Lawson was asked not to return because he had 'an issue with the dress code' Mr Lawson had worked at SDC, which stocks Honda parts, for eight months through the agency Pertemps, He had handed in his notice one day earlier because he had a new job. But he later received a phone call from the recruitment company, apparently telling him SDC did not want him to work through his notice period. Mr Lawson, who lives with partner Sam Gregory and three children Paige, six, Lexi, four, and one-year-old Jamie, believes his colleagues are on his side. He said: 'When I was leaving, a lot of my colleagues came up to me and said they had sympathy for me. 'I got the phone call at about 4pm telling me they didn’t want me back which was a shock as I’d worked really hard there. 'I’d handed my notice in on Tuesday and I think - with all the redundancies going on at the minute - this was just an excuse to get rid of me a few days early. 'I have three children to provide for so I’m pretty annoyed.' Anne Wilkes, operations director at Pertemps, in Swindon, said: 'The employee did attend work with SDC with a hat on. 'He was asked to remove the hat by a team leader and refused. 'He was asked a second time to remove it, and failure to remove would be that he would be sent home. 'The reason for that is it isn’t part of the personal protection equipment for working on site. Any manufacturing company, including SDC and Honda, have a strict uniform policy. 'He’s been released from assignment at SDC but he’s not been sacked. 'It’s a shame. We’re very very sorry to hear that he had been released.' Bosses at South Marston Distribution Centre said Mr Lawson was asked to leave the company because he would not comply with uniform requirements. Steve Gopal, director of operations said: 'The issue from our point of view is relatively simple. 'We have a definite dress code in the business and in this instance the individual was asked to remove the cap because it's not part of our uniform. 'He then stated that rather than take his cap off he would rather go home. We didn't ask him to go home. 'The individual has an issue with the dress code. As a result he was requested not to return.'","Adam Lawson, 32, wore the England flag cap to work to celebrate St George's Day - England's national day .

"By . Steph Cockroft . A pair of benefit cheats swindled more than £42,000 from the taxpayer - despite having won £250,000 on the lottery. Alfred Wells, 64, and his partner Patricia Marshall, 55, from West Boldon, South Tyneside, claimed pension credit, housing benefit and council tax for five years - even though they had more than £170,000 savings stashed away. Wells had won £250,000 on the lottery in 2008 and also received a lump sum of £38,000 when he retired from his job at South Tyneside Council. Guilty: Alfred Wells and Patricia Marshall, photographed outside Newcastle Crown Court, pleaded guilty to benefit fraud after swindling more than £42,000 by lying about their savings . But the couple, who had no previous convictions, claimed they only had between £700 and £800 of savings - so they could claim more than £42,000 in benefits. When they were arrested last year, Wells said: 'All I am saying is hands up, I have been caught. I have been an idiot, a fraudster, whatever you are going to call it.' At a hearing at Newcastle Crown Court, Wells pleaded guilty to two counts of benefit fraud. Marshall pleaded guilty to three counts of the same charge. They were both sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for two years. All the money which the couple wrongly claimed has been repaid. The court heard that, between July 13, 2009 and May 26, 2013, the couple wrongly claimed £41,638 in benefits. Marshall also claimed £591 in housing benefit and council tax benefit between September 20, 2008 and December 22, 2008. She did this by claiming she was living as a single person, even though she lived with Wells. Wells had won £250,000 on the lottery in 2008 and had also received a £38,000 lump sum on his retirement - but still falsely claimed the benefits . Lee Fish, prosecuting, said: 'Alfred Wells claimed pension credit between July 13, 2009 and May 26, 2013 for both himself and his partner on the basis they were both over 60, had no real income and they had savings below the allowable limit. 'As a result of that claim he was also able to claim housing benefit and council tax benefit. 'The claim was made by Mr Wells, however Patricia Marshall participated in the telephone call which give rise to the claim for benefit. Therefore these claims were effectively made for both of their benefits. 'During their telephone call made to claim benefits they declared they only had £700 to £800 worth of savings. 'They had £171,000 at there disposal. This money came to be in the couple's possession in 2008. 'Alfred . Wells actually won the lottery, he won quarter of a million pounds. Further in 2009 he received a lump sum of £38,000 when he retired from . work. When Wells was arrested in August last year, he said: 'All I am saying is hands up, I have been caught. I have been an idiot, a fraudster' 'Both defendants were interviewed on August 1 last year and in interview accepted that they had made these applications for benefits out of sheer greed. 'He (Wells) accepted that what he had done was thoroughly dishonest.' Defending, Jonathan Cousins told the court how Wells was unwell. He said the defendant was currently in remission after being diagnosed with throat cancer in 2010. Mr Cousins said: 'Mr Wells rues the day he won the lottery, it has brought him a number of problems. 'He has never claimed any benefit whatsoever until he won the lottery. That is also the case for Miss Marshall. 'When he won the money he gave a significant proportion of it to charity, a significant proportion of it to his family and invested a large amount of it in an investment. 'He lived off the remainder. They both lived together and they had no other money. 'What they both did was claim benefits and they both deeply regret that. They recognise that it was wrong and they are thoroughly remorseful. 'The money has been repaid, that includes the cost of the investigation and the benefits they claimed. 'I think it's unlikely that you will see either defendant before the criminal courts ever again.' Judge Debbie Sherwin told Wells and Marshall: 'It is a sad day when two people who have never been in trouble in the court before find themselves before the court for serious offences. 'You came into a large sum of money and also received another payment at the same time. 'Some of that money was given to family and charity and some was invested. That was the part that should have been declared. You said you just got greedy.' Judge Sherwin also gave each defendant 100 hours of unpaid work and ordered them to pay £170 prosecution costs.

"Doctors have been given the go-ahead to perform a caesarean section on a mentally-ill woman who is 36 weeks pregnant. High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden ruled that the woman could lawfully be sedated - and restrained if necessary, following a hearing at the Court of Protection in London. Doctors at a health authority in Sunderland had asked the judge to declare a caesarean section lawful. Doctors have tonight been given the go-ahead to perform a caesarean section on a mentally-ill woman who is 36 weeks pregnant, by a High Court judge at the Court of Protection . They had said that the woman, who is in her 30s and has a schizophrenia-like psychotic disorder, had a liver condition which posed a risk to her and her unborn baby, and that the delivery by caesarean section was in the best interests of both. They said it was not clear whether the woman would agree to having a caesarean section, but that the woman's father agreed with doctors. He told the judge that his daughter was in 'such a state' that a 'normal birth' would be 'far too stressful' for her. A lawyer appointed by the court to represent the woman also agreed with doctors. Mr Justice Hayden ruled that the woman could lawfully be sedated - and restrained if necessary . Mr Justice Hayden said there was 'compelling evidence' that the woman lacked the mental capacity to evaluate medical advice. The judge said there was also compelling evidence that if well she would put her unborn child's interests first and follow medical advice. He was told that the woman's mental health problems were intermittent and that she was a graduate who had built a successful career. Doctors said they aimed to deliver the baby tomorrow. It was planned that the woman's parents would initially care for the baby, the judge heard. But he was told that doctors hoped that her condition would improve so that she could assume responsibility. Mr Justice Hayden said nothing could be reported which would identify the woman. But the judge said the health authority which had made the application to perform surgery - City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust - could be named. The Court of Protection is part of the High Court and judges analyse issues relating to sick and vulnerable people.","Mr Justice Hayden ruled the woman could be lawfully be sedated .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Paula Deen has decided to hit the road with a 20-city speaking tour as her latest attempt to launch a comeback following her racism scandal. The Savannah native will be touring different southern cities and hosting 90-minute shows that will be part-cooking demonstrations and part party games. 'We are going to play musical chairs and the dating game with the audience. That's the excitement of it all- my fans get to be a part of the show. I'll also invite some folks in the audience to come onstage and cook with me,' she told The Miami New Times. Back in the (virtual) kitchen: Paula Deen has announced a 20-show cooking tour that will kick off this summer as the latest leg in her comeback campaign (pictured at a food festival in Miami this February) In addition to the audience members- who will pay anywhere from $42 to $211 for tickets- she will have spousal support on stage as well. Her husband Michael will be co-headlining the tours, which start on July 21 in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. 'The crowd just loves him. He's an integral part of the show. And he will put me in my place in a New York minute! We have so much fun bantering back and forth with each other,' she said. So far, seven of the 20 talks have been announced, and are scattered between Tennessee, Texas and her hometown of Savannah, Georgia. Family support: She teased that 'you never know' who will show up at the talks- like her chef son Bobby (left)- but her husband Michael Groover (right) is co-headlining the entire tour so he will be at every show . The kick off in Pigeon Forge comes as little surprise since Deen is in the process of having a $20million restaurant built in the resort area. The rest of the tour dates will be unveiled later this week, but they are expected to remain below the Mason-Dixon line, with stops in Nashville, Tennessee and San Antonia, Texas. 'When I step out onstage, it's the most amazing feeling, y'all. I feel so alive when I walk on that stage, and I love that kind of adrenaline rush,' she told The Miami New Times. 'By going on tour, I can see all my amazing fans in different cities across the United States.' Tickets go on sale Thursday May 1 and the super fans who are willing to pay three-digit ticket prices to see the 67-year-old chef will get extra access to photo opportunities, meet-and-greets, and extra receptions featuring her signature recipes. Interactive: Deen (seen here with her son Jamie) promises to pull audience members on stage for the demonstrations and for impromptu rounds of musical chairs . The tour is just the latest in an increasingly busy schedule for Deen, who lost her Food Network show and millions in corporate sponsorships after she admitted in a deposition that she had previously used the n-word. Earlier this month, she spoke about how she was able to launch her business in Savannah at a conference for the town's tourism board. She was wearing a removable boot brace at the time, explaining how her dog had inadvertently jumped on her and caused her to break her foot. In February, she announced that a private equity investment firm poured $75million to $100million into her brand, banking on her prospects of bouncing back.","Disgraced celebrity chef will launch the tour in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee where she has a $20million restaurant in the works .

Over 100 people signed a petition asking why the commission had not been included, the paper says, before the situation became a full-blown controversy. In June 2013, it adds that police had to remove a neighbor that was protesting at the couple's home. Not long after, Haggag spoke at a town meeting quoting the Koran. 'All we've been shown are vitriol, attacks, harassment, and yes, even threats of violence,' he said.

"By . Taylor Auerbach . Ian Thorpe's manager said the Olympic champion is expected to be released from hospital 'in days' in a rare piece of good news for the swimming world. Thorpe, 31, has been battling a severe infection in a Sydney hospital since a major shoulder operation in late February and was undergoing 'around-the-clock' medical care. On Tuesday evening, Thorpe's manager Will Erskine revealed his client had all but conquered the mystery superbug and planned to leave hospital soon. Sunny skies: Ian Thorpe, 31, will be out of hospital in days, his manager said . 'He's doing well, he's recovered very well in fact,' Mr Erskine told MailOnline. 'He's due to get out of hospital very soon...as in days. He's got on top of the infection. 'There's obviously still a lot of structural damage which might require future surgery for future surgeries but he's in a lot better shape than he was a few weeks ago.' Mr Erskine said the five-time Olympic gold medalist and world record holder would first be checked in to a 'mental health facility' for treatment of his depression and then planned to resume a number of media commitments. Things first started turning pear-shaped for Thorpe when a shoulder operation, believed to have been carried out in Bankstown, was botched in late January. Champion effort: The superstar swimmer was in intensive hospital care as he battled the infection . He required a number of 'repeat' surgeries and picked up a superbug around a month later. There was at the time a 'miniscule' chance doctors would have to amputate Thorpe's arm to save him from the infection. In early February the troubled superstar was found wandering in a 'dazed and disoriented state' by police in Panania, in Sydney's west. He has battled depression since the early 2000s, his autobiography revealed. Thorpe's manager would not comment directly on the plight of Geoff Huegill - charged with possession of an illicit drug on Saturday - but said it was not an ideal look for the sport of swimming. 'It's obviously an unfortunate situation,' Mr Erskine said. 'It's something that doesn't help put focus on the sport for Swimming Australia.' Huegill and his wife Sara will face Waverly local court on May 14.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . and Ryan Gorman . Killer: Ashley Newton has admitted to stabbing her seven-month-old son to death, police said . A young mother admitted to police she stabbed her infant son to death in a California park. Ashley Newton, 23, of San Jose, told East Bay Regional Park District Police she stabbed her seven-month-old son to death Saturday morning in a remote part of Del Valle Regional Park, spokesperson Tyrone Davis told MailOnline. She did not provide an explanation as to why she committed the horrific killing, and investigators have debunked earlier reports she was suicidal, according to Davis. 'We have nothing to prove she is suicidal at all,' he said. '[But] she did accept ownership for her actions.' Police are working to determine if she is depressed, but have not found any evidence she has been diagnosed with clinical depression. 'At the end of the day, no mother would normally want to hurt their child.,' Davis lamented. Little else is known about Newton. Authorities do not believe she has been living in the Bay Area for very long, and have been questioning family in North Carolina to try to piece together the series of events that led to her child's murder, Davis explained. Cops have spoken with the baby's father and were able to determine he was not in a relationship with the mother but did talk to her as recently as Friday, according to Davis. They appear to have an amicable relationship, Davis said. There is no evidence to suggest the father had anything to do with the killing, or that the lack of relationship led Newton to Saturday's stabbing. Police have yet to search the vehicle but expect to wrap that part of the investigation up by Sunday night, Davis said. Abandoned: Police responded to an initial 911 call to find the woman's car had suffered significant damage, but she was nowhere to be found . Newton was jailed Saturday by East Bay Regional Park District Police and has been charged with murder. Cops . stumbled across her carrying the butchered seven-month-old baby around . the park roughly 45 miles east of San Francisco at 12.30 p.m., according . to the San Jose Mercury News. Police were initially called around 10.30 a.m. after a motorist called about a crash at the end of a road in the park about 10 miles south of Livermore, a police spokesperson said during an afternoon briefing with local media. Officers found an abandoned car with significant damage on both the front and back ends, cops said. They initially thought it was a hit and run but pressed on with an investigation upon discovering a baby seat in the back, said police. Unresponsive: Police then later found the mother walking along this road while holding her dead baby . The search had mostly disbanded outside of a handful of California Highway Patrol officers and park police who eventually came across a distraught young woman carrying a bleeding baby in her arms, authorities said. Officers saw no movements and failed to hear any sounds from the baby, and realized it had been stabbed once it was closer, authorities said. Police tried unsuccessfully to revive the baby, it was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators believe Newton may be suffering from depression, and discovered slash marks on her lower body and found her in possession of a pocket knife, cops said. The investigation remains ongoing.","Ashley Newton, 23, of San Jose, was charged with murder after admitting she killed her child, police said .

"By . Associated Press . Will plead guilty: Scott Dekraai, pictured, has agreed to plead guilty after being accused of killing his ex-wife and seven others . A California man charged with shooting and killing his ex-wife and seven others at a hair salon has agreed to plead guilty, his defense attorney said on Monday. Scott Dekraai, 44, had been locked in a custody dispute with his ex-wife over their-8-year-old son before he strapped on a bulletproof vest, took three guns and entered Salon Meritage in 2011, police said. He is accused of shooting his ex-wife Michelle Fournier, a 48-year-old hairdresser, before killing the Seal Beach salon's owner Randy Fannin, 62, and six others: Victoria Buzzo, 54, Michele Fast, 47, Lucia Kondas, 65, Laura Webb, 46, Christy Wilson, 47, and Hattie Stretz, 73. Eight people were shot inside the salon, and all but Stretz died. A man sitting in his car in the parking lot, 64-year-old David Caouette, was also gunned down. Minutes later, Dekraai was stopped by police and arrested. He said 'I know what I did,' according to police. Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said in a 2011 press conference that Dekraai's son was waiting at school for his parents to pick him up at the time of the rampage, KTLA notes. 'While Dekraai rampaged through a hair salon shooting at innocent victims, the son he supposedly ""loved"" was sitting alone in the principalâ€™s office at school waiting for his mom or dad to pick him up,' he said at the time. 'That little boy is also a victim. He is now left to mourn the murder of his mother, and grow up with the knowledge that his father committed a mass murder.' Defense lawyer Scott Sanders told an Orange County court during a hearing on Monday that his client is willing to enter the plea although he faces a possible death sentence. Dekraai, a former tugboat operator, had previously offered to plead guilty in exchange for multiple life sentences but prosecutors refused to drop the death penalty from consideration. Dekraai's trial was scheduled to start June 9. Although it appears Dekraai is getting no leniency in return for his plea, Lawrence Rosenthal, a former federal prosecutor and a law professor at Chapman University, said it's not unheard of for defense attorneys to make such a move. Victim: Dekraai reportedly killed ex-wife Michelle Fournier, pictured, with whom he was engaged in a bitter custody dispute . Custody: Dekraai was in a custody dispute at the time over son Dominic, seen dressed as Spiderman in this photograph . Grief: Witnesses are seen in this 2011 photo on the day of the killings in shock . Shock: a police officer is seen talking to people after the shooting in this 2011 photo . Often, Rosenthal said, attorneys worry that jurors have lost faith in the defense team after they've issued a guilty verdict. Attorneys may also worry that jurors become irritated after they've sat through a trial, issued a verdict and then learn they have to sit through a penalty phase and issue another verdict. By entering a guilty plea, Rosenthal said, Dekraai is taking a calculated risk that the jury may be go easier on him because he's owned up to his crimes. 'This is the kind of tactical judgment that defense lawyers make all the time,' he said. Dekraai, a former tugboat operator who lived in nearby Huntington Beach, had previously offered to plead guilty in exchange for multiple life sentences but prosecutors refused to drop the death penalty from consideration. Dekraai's trial was scheduled to start June 9. Sorrow: Mourners are seen at a vigil the night after the 2011 shooting . The salon reopened about a year after the shootings that rocked the sleepy beach city. Six of the original employees, including the owner's widow, returned to work . Sanders, an assistant public defender, still wants to have the death penalty tossed out and to have the district attorney's office recuse itself because of recordings made by a fellow inmate that prosecutors characterized as Dekraai bragging about the killings. The district attorney's office agreed last week to drop efforts to use the recordings in court proceedings. The salon reopened about a year after the shootings that rocked the sleepy beach city. Six of the original employees, including the owner's widow, returned to work. For more than two years, relatives of the victims have trekked to the Orange County courthouse in Santa Ana for hearings on the case. Paul Caoette of Costa Mesa, whose father David was gunned down as he sat in his car outside the salon, welcomed the idea of a plea. 'I think he should admit his guilt,' Caouette said. 'Every single thing he has done is cowardly. 'We're a capital punishment state. If anybody deserves the death penalty, it's Dekraai.'","Scott Dekkrai was involved in a custody battle with his ex-wife when he allegedly shot her and seven other people at a Seal Beach hair salon .

"By . Taylor Auerbach . and Candace Sutton . Geoff Huegill has been dropped as a national ambassador for AustSwim -  Australia's peak water safety and training body - after he and his wife were charged with possessing cocaine. AustSwim CEO Gordon Mallet told MailOnline Huegill has been 'suspended' from his role after more than 10 years' service and described the situation as 'regrettable'. The star Olympic swimmer and his wife Sara were charged with drug possession after security guards at Randwick Racecourse allegedly found them with cocaine in a private suite at the races on Saturday. 'At the moment we've suspended his activities for us, pending the outcome of further legal outcomes,' Mr Mallet said. 'The alleged incident is out of character but Austswim has zero tolerance and we've suspended the relationship to let natural justice take its course' Mr Mallet said he has shared written correspondence with Huegill since the drug charge became public and that 'he's extremely upset and remorseful'. Scroll down for video . Charged: Geoff Huegill and wife Sara were charged after allegedly being found with white powder on Saturday . Champagne Stakes: Geoff Huegill's picture posted on Instagram taken at the running of the Champagne Stakes at Royal Randwick Racecourse where he and his wife Sara were arrested and charged with possession of cocaine . Huegill, 35, was at the newly-renovated racecourse with his wife Sara Hills, 30, late on Saturday afternoon around an hour after the last race had run when police and security guards watched CCTV of the couple entering a disabled toilet together. He is still listed as an ambassador on the Austswim website. The Huegills, who are the parents of two daughters, Mila, 2, and a three month old baby girl, were guests at the running of the Australian Turf Club's $400,000 race, the Champagne Stakes, which is sponsored by Moet & Chandon. Police noticed the couple stayed in the toilets for some time. When the Huegills re-emerged and returned to the Moet & Chandon private box, police interviewed and around 5.45pm allegedly took possession of a small bag of cocaine. A group of police then made a detailed search of the area with a sniffer dog. Through their lawyer, Paul Hunt, the couple has declined to comment about the charges which are due before court next month. A day at the races: Geoff Huegill and his wife Sara Hills in a picture posted on Instagram of them in a private box at Royal Randwick racecourse where they allegedly were arrested in possession of cocaine . Mr Hunt issued a statement confirming the couple has been ordered to face court. It is uncertain now whether Huegill will make an appearance alongside some of Australia's most prominent sports men and women at the inaugural Sporting Legends lunch in Sydney this Friday. Huegill also runs his own fitness business, Club Skip, and represents the vitamin company, Swisse. An extremely close friend of Geoff Huegill's reacted with shock when MailOnline told him of the charge. 'You're kidding me aren't you,' he said when informed of the Saturday afternoon nab. 'I didn't have a clue, I'm sorry to hear that. He called me this morning, I had a missed call from him, I'd rather not comment further.' Geoff Huegill and his wife Sara Hills will appear in court next month after they allegedly were in possession of cocaine in a private box at Randwick racecourse . Racegoers were at Randwick for the final Saturday of the Sydney Autumn Racing Carnival. 'Police were patrolling Randwick Racecourse as part of their normal duties,' a NSW police spokesman told the MailOnline. 'They were directed to a suite in the grandstand by security guards where a 35-year-old man and a 30-year-old woman were allegedly found with a small quantity of white powder, believed to be cocaine. 'They were issued with a field court attendance notice for the offence of possessing an illegal drug.' The Daily Telegraph reported Huegill was seen being escorted from the Moet & Chandon lounge by police on Saturday. Huegill has credited his wife, a former publicist who he married in 2011, with turning his life around after a battled with obesity, drugs and depression. Comeback: Geoff Huegill holds his bronze medal after coming third in the men's 50-metre butterfly at the FINA World Championships in Shanghai in 2011 . Back in the pool: a toned and trimmed down Huegill back in the pool in 2012 Australian Olympic Swimming Trials in Adelaide a year after his marriage at Sara Hills, who he credited with turning his life around after he succumbed to drugs, alcohol and depression after his swimming career stalled . He revealed then that he had taken drugs and suffered from depression when he retired from swimming after the 2004 Athens Olympics.Free of the discipline of 4am starts, Huegill engaged in binge drinking and became so hooked on fatty food that he put on 45kg. He also said he had suicidal thoughts.'My life from about 2005 to 2007, I experimented with many different things. I guess that's a story that's in my past,' he told the Nine Network. Huegill was the world record holder in the 50m butterfly between 2000 and 2003. Four years ago, a slimmed down Huegill made a successful comeback and won gold medals at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, and a bronze at the 2011 World Championships in Shanghai. Sydney lawyer, Paul Hunt, issues a written confirmation 'that on Saturday 26 April 2014, while attending a function at the Royal Randwick Racecourse, my clients Geoff and Sara Huegill were each issued with a Court Attendance Notice by NSW Police in relation to an alleged offence. 'As the matter is not yet resolved, my clients do not intend to make any further comment atthis point in time.' The Australian Turf Club declined to comment, 'as it is a police matter' but said the club 'has a zero tolerance policy on illicit drugs'.

"By . John Naish . Warfare may be an awful thing, but it has a habit of accelerating health technology in ways that are helpful to everyone. For example, in World War II the Allies made significant medical advances in vital areas such as developing antibiotic drugs — which the Germans didn’t possess — and performing lifesaving blood transfusions. Now, however, the military is developing an alarming new interest in the human body and brain. It wants to create armies of mutant soldiers, equipped with unstoppable physical and mental powers. Within 30 years, according to newly released Ministry of Defence papers, British soldiers should be able to lift huge weights, run at high speeds over extreme distances, have infra-red night vision built into their brains, and even be capable of transmitting thoughts by electronically aided telepathy. And this is not just pie-in-the-sky planning. Science is now emerging that may make these army dreams real. A recent Freedom of Information request revealed details of a two-day future-gazing summit by the MoD’s obscure Development Concepts and Doctrine Centre, where military spooks swapped ideas with experts from universities, industry and government. The summit concluded that by 2045, advances in medical technology could create a class of genetically superior humans — rather like the super-powered science fiction characters Wolverine, Storm and Rogue from Marvel Comics. Further details of the military boffins’ thinking are on the internet, in an MoD report titled: Global Strategic Trends Out to 2040. This predicts that advanced drug and genetic technologies will enable armies to reprogram soldiers’ genes, in order to transform them into daunting fighters. High-tech implants in brains could also help to turn square-bashing squaddies into super-intelligent man-machines. The defence ministry forecasters have given the process a chilling clinical name: ‘human augmentation’. They predict that these brain implants (called ‘cognitive prostheses’) could give solders bionic vision and hearing, as well as towering IQs and total recall. The MoD report adds that such ‘augmented’ soldiers could even have bodies that self-repair wounds, through the use of what it terms ‘regenerative medicine, tissue engineering and artificial immune systems’. It all sounds far too fantastic to be real. But, in fact, some of these outlandish predictions are already turning out to be true. Arms race: In the future a British, currently limited in the amount of equipment he can physically carry, could be given superstrength. (File picture) For example, America’s Lockheed Martin company is developing an advanced robotic exoskeleton known as the Human Universal Load Carrier, which will enable men to carry massive loads with minimal effort, either on their front or their back. The skeleton is ultralight, highly mobile and attached to the outside of the body with its own titanium legs, which transfer the weight of any load to the ground. Microcomputers sense the soldier’s body movements and enable it to do exactly what he does, whether it is running, lifting or even crawling. Prototype versions are already entering combat trials in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, super-vision came considerably closer last year after pioneering surgery at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford restored some sight to Tim Reddish, a Paralympic swimming champion in his 60s who had been blind for 17 years. The key to the operation’s success was a 3mm microchip with 1,500 light-sensitive cells implanted into each retina and connected by wire to a power unit implanted behind his ear. When light enters the eye and hits the chips, it stimulates light-sensitive cells which send signals to the brain, enabling him to see. Military experts see huge potential. Experiments in the U.S. have shown that implant technology could also give normally sighted soldiers amazing extra senses, such as night vision, and even the ability to see magnetic fields. Science fiction: What seems like science fiction today could soon become a battlefield reality if technology being worked on by Ministry of Defence boffins sees the light of day. (File picture) The breakthrough has been made by Dr Miguel Nicolelis, a neurobiologist at Duke University in North Carolina, who announced earlier this year that he had given rats the ability to detect infra-red light, normally invisible to them, by fitting them with an infra-red detector wired to microscopic electrodes in their brains. The military are interested in super-blood, too. Surgeons and emergency doctors have long hoped for the advent of artificial blood that can safely be stored for months or years, and be given to any patient. Now that possibility is nearing reality, thanks to the work of British teams such as those at the University of Sheffield. Chemists there have created a ‘plastic blood’ that mimics red blood cells and can be successfully donated to over 98 per cent of patients. Military scientists are predicting a wealth of potential breakthroughs in human capability that could be created by advanced future versions of artificial blood. For example, nanotechnology could fill them with synthetic platelets, the naturally occurring cell fragments vital for clotting, enabling wounds to heal faster. Artificial blood could also be adapted to increase its power to carry oxygen and nutrients round the body, thus boosting muscle and brain power. But artificial blood would not be the only way to muscle power. Back in 2004, Lee Sweeney, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, showed it was possible to create genetically modified mice that produced a natural stimulant in their muscles called ‘insulin-like growth factor’. Some of the finest minds are working away on military technology which could transform the British soldier into bionic superhumans, according to newly released documents . Mice with such enhanced genes had more than 30   per cent stronger muscles, enabling them to run for much faster and longer than normal. Dr Sweeney’s mice were modified as embryos. Since then, genetics researchers have been working on ways to boost muscles in adults. In 2008, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania created GM mice that could run six times further than normal without suffering from exhaustion, by altering a gene called interleukin-15R alpha, which shifts how energy is used in the ‘fast-twitch’ muscle fibres that provide sprinting ability. Such breakthroughs promise to create armies that appear unbeatable. The Pentagon is now working on manipulating human brainwaves to optimise performance. American military chiefs are seeking a technology system that would synchronise gamma waves (which facilitate memory creation) and theta waves (for turning short-term memories into lasting ones), so they work together in the best way. This would boost the ability of soldiers to retain lots of information in high-stress situations, for longer. Telepathy is being considered as well — and already a machine has been developed in Dr Nicolelis’s laboratory to make it happen, facilitating telepathic communication over distances of thousands of miles, though so far only for rats. The implications for the military are extraordinary. If commanders could simply pass on their thoughts to their troops without the need for radios, it would confer a huge tactical advantage. Given the extraordinary pace of technological development, one thing is certain — the toughest man in the Armed Forces could soon be the one with a silicon chip on his shoulder.","High-tech implants in brains could turn square-bashing squaddies into super-intelligent man-machines .

Cover story: the book written by Sydney journalist Josh Massoud with Ryan Tandy about the late rugby league star's role in the game's most notorious match-fixing scandal. Tandy was said to be looking forward to its publication, the date of which will now be decided by his mother, Carol . Dead at 32: Former NRL star Ryan Tandy had been banned from the game for life . The NSW Coroners Court told the MailOnline no decision has yet been made whether to conduct an inquest into Tandy's death to determine whether he died of a drugs overdose. Police said the death is not being treated as suspicious. Tributes have poured in from throughout Australia for the 32-year-old, who played for the Canterbury Bulldogs and for the Melbourne Storm, and from Ireland and Hull where he was also being remembered by former team mates as a 'larger than life' character. A statement from Rugby League Ireland, for whom Tandy played in the 2008 World Cup, said:  â€˜Rugby League Ireland would like to pass on our condolences to the family and friends of Ryan Tandy. â€˜Ryan was a larger than life character and we would like to express our thanks for the commitment during the World Cup.'

Abroad: The footballer played for five teams in Britain, including Hull KR in 2007 . Tandy was due back in court next month over the plot, linked to criminal bikie organisations, which allegedly was an attempt to recover a drug debt worth tens of thousands of dollars. The troubled star had received a life ban from rugby league after he was convicted of match fixing while playing for the Canterbury Bulldogs against North Queensland Cowboys in 2010. Investigations were launched following a $30,000 betting plunge on the game and Tandy was subsequently banned for life from NRL. He was also handed a $4,000 fine and a 12-month good behaviour bond for his involvement in the scandal. Over the course of his tumultuous career, Tandy featured in 36 NRL games across five clubs. Born in Wollongong in 1981, he began playing for St George Illawarra in 2003 before joining South Sydney midway through that season. 'In complete shock!!! Won a premiership with Ryan in 2009, a bloke who gave his all on the footy field. RIP,' he added.

He also played five matches for Ireland in the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. A statement on Rugby League Ireland's official website today said: 'Ryan was a larger than life character and we would like to express our thanks for the commitment during the World Cup.' Tributes for the sportsman have also poured in on Twitter. Tandy's former coach at Hull KR, Justin Morgan, wrote: 'So sad to hear of Ryan Tandy's death. RIP' Retired professional rugby league footballer Steve Turner, said: 'Shocked and saddened to hear of the news about Ryan Tandy. RIP mate!' 'A good mate': Teammates and friends paid tribute to the Bulldogs star on Twitter . Tandy's former South Sydney teammate Bryan Fletcher told The Daily Telegraph: 'I wouldnâ€™t have seen this coming. It's tragic for his family.' Fletcher revealed he had spoken with Tandy only a month ago. During their meeting, Tandy told of how he was planning a new compression garments business. 'He'd been training and was off the drink. He was in a good headspace which I thought was good,' a shocked Fletcher added. Tandy's friend Brett Clarke wrote on Twitter: 'Today I've lost a good mate, a bloke I've shared the best and funniest days of my life with. Ryan Tandy you'll be missed mate. #RIP'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Rescue crews were scouring the north of San Francisco Bay for a missing pilot after two small vintage planes collided while heading home from a show, sending one crashing into the water while the other miraculously managed to land. Debris was found in San Pablo Bay after the 4.05pm collision near the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge, but the pilot has still not been found, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Loumania Stewart. The mid-air crash involved a single engine 1965 Cessna 210 and a World War Two era Hawker Sea Fury TMK 20, piloted by a husband and wife crew, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Ian Gregor. Scary: Two small planes collided over San Pablo Bay near San Francisco on Sunday . The Cessna crashed into the water and the Sea Fury's pilot was able to land 40 minutes later at Eagle's Nest Airport in the small Northern California city of Ione, Gregor said. Amador County firefighters and medics sent to the Ione airport were not needed because the pilot and passenger in the Sea Fury - a husband and wife - were not injured, the county's Undersheriff Jim Wegner said. Both planes had departed from Eagle's Nest Airport to participate in the Pacific Coast Dream Machines, an annual festival in Half Moon Bay that features a variety of planes, motorcycles, and cars. Both planes left Half Moon Bay Airport, about 20 miles south of San Francisco, and were on their return flight to Ione. Miracle: One of the planes was able to land safely at an air field a few miles away from the bay . Witnesses at Point San Pablo Yacht Harbor told the San Francisco Chronicle that the Cessna spiraled out of control and crashed into the choppy water after the collision. 'Everyone associated with the Pacific Coast Dream Machines Show is terribly saddened by this news and we hope and pray the missing plane and survivors are found,' the event organizers said in a statement. Four Coast Guard boats and a helicopter searched the choppy bay waters, along with five boats from local law enforcement agencies, including the Marin County Sheriff's Office and the Sausalito Police Department, as well as a local helicopter. 'It clipped a wing, probably lost a wing, spun violently and hit the water,' said witness Eric Johnson to KTVU. 'Tragic. The plane spinning that hard, you can't jump out, you can't get away. It's really sad.' Divers from the San Francisco Police Department also were on the scene. Wegner wouldn't discuss damage to the Sea Fury, citing the ongoing investigation by the FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board. The names of the pilots involved have not been released as of Monday morning. Search: Rescuers are now searching the San Pablo Bay near San Francisco for the second plane involved in the collision . Classic aircraft: This is a Hawker Sea Fury TMK 20 - a British fighter jet used in the Second World War and the Korean War - a model like this was involved in a mid-air collision over San Francisco Bay on Sunday . The British Hawker aircraft, named Dreadnought, was one of the featured aircraft at the Pacific Coast Dream Machines event in Half Moon Bay on Sunday - which annually showcases a variety of planes, motorcycles, vintage cars and other customized vehicles. The Hawker is famed for its racing pedigree and is registered to Sanders Aircraft Ince, which restores classic airplanes and is operated by brothers Dennis and Brian Sanders. The plane was rebuilt by their father, Frank Sanders, who died in a 1989 plane crash. Sanders Aeronautics' website said the family-run company specializes in aircraft restoration and brothers Dennis and Brian Sanders are avid air racers.","Two small planes returning from an air show collided over San Pablo Bay on Sunday .

"By . Daniel Mills . Killed: Jo La Spina was found dead at her home in Bingil Bay . The tiny township of Bingil Bay in Queensland’s north has been rocked by the suspicious death of a woman, 26, inside her two storey townhouse. Jo La Spina, 26, was sleeping inside her Bingil Bay Rd unit when police allege she was attacked sometime during the early hours of April 19. She was last seen leaving the Bingil Bay Café at about 2.30am, with a man who is believed to be known to her. Detective Acting Inspector Kevin Goan said the man attempted to escort Ms La Spina from the café dance floor about 2.30am. 'We believe that they may have been at the Bingil Bay Café up until 2.30am on the Saturday morning,' Acting Insp. Goan said. Her body was found later that day by another occupant of the house after he returned home from work. The pair are also believed to have worked together. Working on information from the public, police yesterday made a breakthrough arrest following more than a week of investigations. Musa Brandon Ngwira, 31, from South Mission Beach was arrested at Cronulla and refused bail yesterday at Sutherland Local Court. He will be extradited back to Queensland to appear before the Cairns Magistrates Court on April 30. Detective Acting Insp. Goan said Ms La Spina, a well-respected woman who worked in Bingil Bay’s profitable tourism industry, was the target of a cruel 'act of violence.' He said her family is 'simply devastated.' 'This was the needless taking of a young person’s life that is simply hard for the family to come to terms with and certainly for the community of Bingil Bay-Mission Beach to come to terms with,' he said. 'It is something that will scar the hearts of the family for many years and the community in general.' He called the attack 'opportunistic,' and said the timing of it would have coincided with when she was at her most vulnerable. 'The victim would have thought she was alone and safe at these premises,” he said. 'Our information is she slept alone and had the room to herself.' Devastated: Ms La Spina's parents, family and friends are utterly distraught at her death which occurred in the early hours of Saturday April 19 . Ms La Spina went to Blackheath and Thornburgh College in Charters Towers for high school, before graduating in 2005. She then lived in Cairns and Townsville before coming back to Feluga, where her family live, to work as a photographer for rafting company Raging Thunder. 'She was a likable, bubbly, friendly girl,' Acting Insp. Goan said. 'Every witness we’ve spoken to has said this.' Her mother Shelley penned a heartfelt note to her daughter which read: . 'To my beautiful Jo, I love and miss you so very much.' 'Jo please remember how much you are loved. I will love and cherish you forever. Oh my sweet, sweet, beautiful baby.' 'We will love you for ever and ever and then more, .

"By . Steve Nolan . A revolutionary slip-on plastic coated hoof that doubles as an equine fashion accessory could spell the end for nailing on horseshoes. An equestrian designer came up with the 'GluShu', which uses a traditional metal horseshoe that is coated in a durable thick plastic covering and glued to the animal's foot rather than nailed. The coating offers the horse more cushioning and offers an easier alternative to the traditional method of fitting shoes. Revolutionary: Designer John Wright with his new plastic coated horseshoe, pictured with Sarafina, and her owner Anneli Larrson at her stable in Chester le Street, County Durham . Comfortable: The horseshoe uses a traditional metal shoe but that is coated in a softer plastic . But not only are they easier to fit and more comfortable for the horse, the shoes could become something of an equine fashion accessory as they come in a variety colours including neon pink and grey and look like the popular plastic sandals Crocs. The new shoes were designed by John Wright with the help of GB Olympic equestrian team farrier Jeffrey Newnham. John, managing director of GluShu, which is based in Team Valley, Gateshead, said: 'It's an up-to-date solution to shoeing a horse, that has been updated from what was introduced 500 years ago. 'Farriers nailed steel shoes to horses' feet back then because that was their only option, but now we have designed a much more comfortable option for horses which makes much better sense, and helps fix worn and tired hooves.' But farriers can breathe a sigh of relief - the GluShu won't see their trade become obsolete. Under UK law a horse must have its shoes fitted professionally. The concept, which is the first of its kind to be created in the UK was thought up from an idea had by a designer in the US. Quicker: Instead of using nails, the shoe uses glue and takes around three minutes to fit . Healthy: The shoe allows medicine or cream for injured horses to be applied under the shoe . Fashion accessory: The shoes come in a variety of bright colours including neon pink and green . While the American concept relies on gluing shoes to horses feet, the horse is forced to stand still for more than 15 minutes - which often means it has to be tranquilised. The US way is also a more messy procedure as the plastic coating on the shoe has to be mixed and applied in the stable. The GluSHu however slots simply onto the horse's hoof and is glued on - a process that takes around three minutes. The plastic flaps around the top of the shoe simply bend backwards and forwards to accommodate any shaped hoof. New shoes: Farrier Billy Moore attaches a new rubber horse shoe called Glushu to Sarafina, pictured with her owner Anneli Larsson at her stable in Chester le Street, County Durham . Although having a horseshoe fitted the original way isn't painful for the animal - it has no nerves in its hoof - it is said by vets to be an improvement to the old method. John added: 'Nailing does damage horses feet. Everywhere else in the world, you can shoe your own horses feet, but in the UK you have to use a farrier who will only use a traditional horseshoe at the minute. 'It's a brilliant alternative for horses in the UK, and we have spoken to lots of vets who agree its a marked improvement for horses feet.' 'We have created a range of different colours for the GluShu as recently people have started to pay for their horses to have cosmetic items, such as headcollars and bridles. 'People want to style and accessories their horses more and more, and we wanted to fit into that market, and not just give the product another standard leather-look finish.' Annali Larsson had the company's first bright pink shoes fitted to her horse Sarafina last week at Chester-le-Street. The GluShu is especially suitable for horses who are lame or unable to walk, and the product means medicated creams and treatments can be placed inside the shoe so they can work effectively on the horse's hoof. John, who has been a product designer for 30 years, said: 'We have had a horse that could not walk because he was in so much pain from an infection he had in his hoof. 'As soon as he had the shoes on, he was running around like an excited foal, the shoes changed his life for him. 'People are left with horses they can't ride, and as soon as they are fitted with these shoes they can again. They're such a straight forward concept but they are so effective.'","Designer John Wright came up with the new GluShu design .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A 14-year-old Chicago girl has been charged with murder as a juvenile in the killing of another girl her age sparked by a romantic rivalry. Police spokesman Thomas Sweeney says Endia Martin, 14, was walking home from school Monday in the hardscrabble Back of the Yards neighborhood on the city's South Side when she ran into her nemesis, who pulled a gun and opened fire. Martin was rushed to University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital, where she was pronounced dead from a gunshot wound to the back. Scroll down for video . Too young: Endia Martin, a high school freshman from Chicago, was shot in the back and left for dead on the ground . Street violence: Martin was walking home when she encountered a rival group of girls in the 900 block of west Garfield Boulevard on the South Side . The second victim, who was shot in the arm, was taken to St Bernard Hospital and listed in stable condition. Martin, a freshman at Tilden Career Community Academy High School, was on her way home at around 4.30pm when she encountered a group of girls from another school in the 900 block of west Garfield Boulevard, Chicago Tribune reported. According to police, Martin exchanged some words with the teens, one of whom then allegedly pulled out a gun and started shooting. The 14-year-old was struck in the back and left for dead on the sidewalk. Her 16-year-old companion was able to flee and hide behind a house before seeking medical attention for a gunshot wound to the arm. Suspected motive: Endia's parents say their daughter got into a verbal spat with another girl on Facebook, which they believe led to the deadly shooting Monday . Endia Martin's stepfather, Kent Kennedy, said the teen was active in sports, loved to dance and dreamed of visiting Paris and Rome. The victim’s family believe the dispute that resulted in their daughter's slaying may have started on Facebook, but police would not confirm that. ‘They had words and she gunned our daughter down,’ Kennedy said. ‘For what? What reason would another girl gun down another child?’ Mr Kennedy added that they had only recently transferred Endia to Tilden Academy from another school located far from home, hoping to keep her safe. ‘No place in Chicago is safe for teenagers nowadays,’ he said. Police are not releasing the suspect's name because of her age. They also arrested the girl's 24-year-old uncle and a 17-year-old boy, who also face charges in the shooting. Full of hopes: Family say Endia, a dancer and athlete, dreamed of traveling to Paris and Rome . Mr Kennedy, a retired U.S. Marine, and his wife, a nursing assistant, have two other children. They insist that Endia was a good teen and not a ' gang banger.' ‘No child needs to be gunned down like a dog in the street. Nobody, period,’ Kent Kennedy told the station WLS-TV. The 14-year-old was hoping to join the U.S. Navy after high school to see the world, her parents said. ‘She will never graduate from high school or get to go to prom, none of that. She was mapping out a plan with her life,’ Mr Kennedy told Chicago Sun-Times.","Endia Martin died after being shot in the back in Back of the Yards section on the city's South Side .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . An Engadget source recently revealed that HTC's upcoming M8 Ace smartphone will feature a plastic body instead of one made from aluminum . HTC may have turned its nose up at its competitors' plastic handsets, but the Taiwanese company could soon be offering its own cut-price version. An Engadget source recently revealed that HTC's upcoming M8 Ace smartphone will feature a plastic body instead of one made from aluminum. This would place it in direct competition with the recently-launched Samsung Galaxy S5 which also features a plastic shell. The M8 is expected to have almost identical features to its competitor, including a 5-inch 1080 pixel display and a 2.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor. Speculation still surrounds whether the M8 Ace will also have the Duo Camera feature, which, along with the cheaper price, could set it apart from the Galaxy S5. Up until now, the only information on the plastic HTC handset has been a blurred out picture courtesy of @evleaks. But a source recently told Richard Lai at Engadget that the phone could launch next month for around £285 ($480). This is significantly cheaper than its competitor with prices for a SIM-free Galaxy S5 starting at £570 in the UK and $649 in the U.S. The news is another blow to Samsung who earlier this week admitted a bug in its Galaxy S5 phone is causing the handset's camera to die. The Korean giant said the number of its flagship Galaxy S5 smartphones shipped with non-working cameras was 'very limited' and that it has taken measures to ensure the issue does not recur in new shipments.

A source recently told Engadget that the phone could launch next month for around £285 ($480) Samsung has admitted a bug in its newly launched Galaxy S5 phone is causing the handset's camera to die. The Korean giant said the number of its flagship Galaxy S5 smartphones shipped with non-working cameras was 'very limited'. However, operator Verizon was forced to take to Twitter to make customers aware of the flaw, which renders the camera useless. '[The problem] was caused by complications in the ROM (Read Only Memory) component which stores the information necessary to operate the camera,' Samsung said in an e-mailed statement. A company spokeswoman on Monday declined to specify the number of phones that were affected but said the problem had been reported in the United States and a number of other countries. Reports of the problem surfaced last week and come less than a month after the phone's global launch, with Samsung banking on the S5 to outdo its predecessor and rebuild momentum for the brand in an increasingly competitive market. Adding to its woes, the South Korean company today reported a four per cent fall in sales at its mobile phone unit. The group said that revenues in the sector fell to 33.4 trillion won ($32.3bn; £23.3bn) between January and March of this year. However, operating profit for its mobile phone unit increased by 18 per cent from the previous three months. The electronics giant also reported a net profit of 7.57 trillion won (£4.4bn; $7.5bn) for the first quarter – an increase of 7.3 trillion won (£4.2bn; $7bn) in the previous three months.

"By . Margot Peppers . It seems baby names keep getting stranger and stranger, culminating in what has been voted the most bizarre of all: Zzyzx.

The name was apparently first given to a town and road in San Bernardino County, California, because of its status as 'the last word in the English language.' As such, the town of Zzyzx was referred to as 'the last place on Earth'. 1. Zzyzx: The name of a town in California and 'the last word in the English language' 2.

"By . Ashley Collman . A 55-year-old convicted murderer serving a life sentence in Pennsylvania state prison is fighting in court for the right to have conjugal visits with his multiple wives. Polygamist inmate Gregory Thomas, who is Muslim, said the prison's policy against such visits is a violation of his constitutional right to freedom of religion. On Tuesday, a Commonwealth Court judge allowed Thomas to proceed with his case, shooting down the Corrections Department's call to for a blanket dismissal. Imprisoned polygamist: Gregory Thomas, an inmate at the state prison in Huntington, Pennsylvania, claims a ban on conjugal visits with his multiple wives is a violation of his constitutional right to freedom of religion . While Judge P. Kevin Brobson says Thomas didn't prove his constitutional rights had been violated by the prison's policy, he believes there is still a case to be made under the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which prohibits measures that prevent prisoners from worshiping freely. Thomas has been behind bars at the state prison in Huntingdon since 1990, after being convicted of murder in Philadelphia. After spending more than two decades in prison, Thomas says his wives are threatening to divorce him within their religion on the basis that they can't have sex with him. It's unclear how many wives Thomas has since the number isn't specified in court documents. He also says the policy is discriminatory against heterosexual inmates since homosexual prisoners can have intercourse freely behind bars. Thomas is also fighting other prison policies including the limited use of prayer oil, rules on who inmates can and can't call as well as the presence of female prison officers. Trouble at home: After spending more than two decades in prison, Thomas says his wives are threatening to divorce him within their religion because they can't have intercourse. Above, a still from HBO television show Big Love, which followed a fictional Mormon polygamist family in Utah . He told Judge Brobson that the 'presence of female correctional officers causes him emotional stress' which is a cruel and unusual punishment. The Corrections Department has countered Thomas' complaint, explaining that each of the policies is in place for security reasons. They point out that conjugal visits aren't allowed in most state prison systems, and that prayer oil is used by inmates to mask the smell of illegal drugs and is also flammable. Currently, no two prisoners are allowed to have the same contacts on their call lists, which Thomas believes is a violation of his right to free association. But Corrections points out that inmates have alternative means of communicating with people in the outside world - like writing letters. If they want to win their case, Judge Brobson says the Corrections Department must prove that there is a legitimate security reason for their policies and that they are the 'least restrictive means available to accomplish the objective.'","Gregory Thomas, 55, is currently serving a life sentence for murder at a state prison in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott . Actress and comedienne Betty White has opened up on the subject of romance in an interview with New You Magazine. The 92-year-old Golden Girls star, who has been married three times in total, was asked if there was anything she would change about her life. 'To bring Allen [Ludden] back,' she says. 'And I wish I didn't have two bad marriages. They were probably my fault.' Oops: Comedienne Betty White, 92, has admitted that her first two failed marriages were 'probably' her fault, largely because she chose the wrong men, she theorizes . Ms White, who lost her last husband Allen Ludden to stomach cancer in 1981, added: 'I had lovely relationships, but not anything in the league of Allen.' She attributed her previous failed marriages to not marrying 'the right men'; namely U.S. Army pilot Dick Barker in 1945 and then Hollywood agent Lane Allen in 1947. In 1961, the legendary comic, who spoofed Miley Cyrus' Wrecking Ball video last year at the age of 91, finally found the man of her dreams in Mr Ludden, who she would stay married to for almost 20 years . Veteran: Ms White (pictured in 2010 accepting a Life Achievement award) reveals she has enjoyed 'lovely' relationships but nothing in the 'league' of late husband Allen Ludden . Third time lucky: Ms White (left, in 1962) turned down at least two marriage proposals from Mr Ludden (right) before marrying him in 1963 and staying with him until his death almost 20 years later . Enduring love: Following his death from stomach cancer in 1981, Ms White (right) implied she would never marry again, saying to Larry King that 'once you've had the best, who needs the rest?' The couple met when Ms White appeared on Mr Allen's game show as a celebrity guest, and, after two years of dating and two rejected marriage proposals, Ms White finally accepted and the pair were married. Following her husband's tragic death, the star admitted to Larry King that she wouldn't remarry. 'Once you've had the best, who needs the rest?' she said. Cover: Robin McGraw fronts the current issue of New You magazine . Asked by New You magazine what she thought of women dating much younger men, and whether she might consider it herself, she joked: . 'If they want to be a cougar that’s fine by me. I’m an animal lover. 'But I would always feel so insecure if I was with a much younger man. I would think, ""I’m getting older and he’s not!""' Wendie Malick, her co-star in hit TV series Hot in Cleveland, indicated in a separate interview that Ms White was in fact far from insecure about her age. 'She has taught us all that when you turn 60 you’re starting your third act', she attests. '[Betty] always comes in with a smile, is always ready to go, and gives it her all with grace and humor.' And according to a report today from Styleite, even the late Queen Elizabeth was a fan of her work. So much so that the Queen Mother, who died in 2002, requested a live performance of Golden Girls in 1988. 'It was very exciting. The Queen was lovely,' Ms White said on Reddit. 'We were told not to address her unless we were addressed. She was up in a box and she came down on stage after with Princess Anne.'

"By . Emma Glanfield . The German government has distanced itself from former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder after he was pictured embracing Russian President Vladimir Putin. The picture of the pair locked in a ‘bear-hug’ in St. Petersburg comes at a time of high tension between the West and Russia over Ukraine. In the photo, the former Social Democrat chancellor can be seen smiling as he embraces Putin on the steps of Jussupov palace in the Russian city. Former chancellor Gerhard Schroeder could be seen smiling as he embraced Russian President Vladimir Putin on the steps of Jussupov palace in St. Petersburg, Russia, after enjoying his belated 70th birthday celebrations . Gerhard Schroeder,right, has been good friends with Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, since they both were ostracised by U.S. President George W. Bush for opposing the 2003 Iraq invasion . A spokesman for Schroeder confirmed he was in the city on Monday for a shareholders' meeting of Nord Stream AG - the Russian-German pipeline joint venture he chairs. But spokesman Albrecht Funk would not say why Schroeder met Putin. German media reports said the grainy picture of the pair was taken late on Monday evening after a belated celebration in honour of Schroeder’s 70th birthday on April 7. However, the picture has caused a stir among German government representatives. ‘He does not represent the German government,’ a senior German government official said when asked about the pictures. ‘It should be clear to everyone that Mr. Schroeder left active politics some time ago.’ Germany - which relies heavily on Russia for natural gas supplies - has been trying to defuse tensions over Ukraine and is seen as reluctant to ratchet up sanctions against Moscow. Earlier today, the European Union imposed asset freezes and travel bans on 15 Russians and Ukrainians and yesterday, the United States widened sanctions on allies of Putin. After seeing the photo of Putin and Schroeder, a senior government official said: 'It should be clear to everyone that Mr. Schroeder (pictured) left active politics some time ago' Schroeder - a Social Democrat whose party is now in coalition with Merkel's conservatives - has been the Russian leader's best friend in the West since both were ostracised by U.S. President George W. Bush for opposing the 2003 Iraq invasion. Gerda Hasselfeldt, parliamentary leader of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) which is aligned with Merkel's party, said: ‘I found the pictures alienating. I hope he used the opportunity to talk to (Putin) about the problems.’ Andreas Schockenhoff, deputy parliamentary floor leader for Merkel's party, said Schroeder risked undermining the German government as well as his own protege, Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier. ‘The chancellor and foreign minister have tried to help stabilise Ukraine for weeks and keep the EU together while Putin is trying to destabilise Ukraine and divide the EU,’ he said. ‘Pictures like this play into the hands of Putin's propaganda.’ But Steinmeier, a fellow Social Democrat who served as Schroeder's chief of staff, said in Copenhagen that his former boss ‘has no government responsibilities and is therefore free to decide when and where he celebrates his birthday’. Schroeder, chancellor from 1998-2005, has come under fire before for his close relations with Putin. Schroeder became the board chairman of a German-Russian pipeline joint venture with gas monopoly Gazprom Nord Stream after leaving office. Klaus von Dohnanyi, a former Social Democrat mayor of Hamburg, said talking with Putin was good. He said: ‘Words are better than weapons to try to find a reasonable solution for Ukraine.’ But the German media almost universally condemned Schroeder, who in 2004 was asked if he thought Putin was a ‘flawless democrat’ and replied: ‘I am convinced he is’. Putin celebrated Schroeder's 60th birthday with the German leader in Hanover. ‘Schroeder celebrates his birthday with Putin and makes Germany's foreign policy look absurd,’ said an online commentary for Der Spiegel magazine. Earlier today, Sergei Shoigu, the Russian deference minister, said Vladimir Putin, pictured, has no plans to invade Ukraine . Schroeder cannot carry on with business as usual when the government is trying to ‘stop his friend Vladimir from pursuing power-hungry policies’, it said. ‘At times like this a former German leader must keep his distance.’ The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper found hugging Putin ‘ghoulish’ when German military observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) were being held hostage by ‘pro-Putin fanatics’ in Ukraine. Four of seven OSCE observers being held by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine are German. Berlin has asked Moscow to use its influence to get them all freed.","Government has distanced itself from Gerhard Schroeder following picture .
