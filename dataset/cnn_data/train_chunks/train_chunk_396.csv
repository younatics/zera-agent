"In recent years, the gaming industry has seen a number of hyped trends come and go: games on social networks, 3-D gaming, systems that let you control in-game avatars by moving your body. Now get ready for another one: Virtual reality. This technology, which plunges headset wearers into three-dimensional virtual worlds that feel incredibly lifelike, is coming to consumers very soon, according to the two companies spearheading the charge. Oculus Rift and Sony have been developing prototypes for virtual-reality headsets that immerse people in scenarios as mundane as a boardroom or as fantastic as a medieval castle complete with dragons. But reps for both companies who spoke to CNN at last week's E3 gaming show say the driving force behind the success or failure of virtual-reality, or VR, will be not their devices but the games created for them. Oculus Rift CEO Brendan Iribe said his team of ""the brightest minds of the industry"" has come a long way from two years ago, when a bulky Oculus prototype held together by duct tape was shown to selected media at E3. ""We've tackled so many of the hardest problems,"" Iribe said last week. ""We have 30 or 40 of these top talents all focusing on delivering the best VR the world has ever seen. This is really delivering on something that people have imagined for so many years and we haven't gotten there yet. Now we're starting to get there."" Meanwhile Project Morpheus, the code name for Sony's rival VR headset, was introduced in March as the future of gaming on the PlayStation system. Indeed, the lightbar on the PlayStation 4's DualShock controller was designed with the Morpheus headgear in mind to allow the devices to be tracked together. According to Anton Mikhailov, Magic Lab researcher and developer for Sony, the goal of Morpheus is to make players feel like they are inside the game. Both Iribe and Mikhailov said they must resolve technical issues before their respective systems will be ready for consumer use. These problems, which they say are close to being solved, include more precise eye tracking and stopping motion blur. Both Oculus and Sony say they are close to releasing consumer units, but neither would provide a timetable. However, they agree the headsets are useless without great content. People won't want to buy a VR headset if they can't use it for a compelling game. And these games need to be ready to go when the headsets hit the market. ""We're going to make a great piece of hardware that delivers on the promise of great VR,"" Iribe said. ""But it's going to be up to content developers -- game developers -- to make great experiences. They can still make things terribly wrong. ""It's a big challenge,"" he added. ""Game developers are just going to have to learn how to make great VR."" Both Oculus and Sony staged some early demos of their VR technology to E3 attendees. The Oculus Rift offerings ranged from a Mario-type platform game to a Matrix-style hallway shootout (complete with dodging bullets) to ""Alien: Isolation,"" a game in which you must avoid being killed by nasty space aliens. If you failed to elude your enemies in the ""Alien"" game, you ended up with a tail spike right through your chest. And yes, you could look down and see it as it happened. Eww. The Project Morpheus games were a bit tamer and definitely less bloody. A simple castle scenario let you use PlayStation Move controllers to grab medieval weapons and smack around a practice dummy. When the real fight began, the weapons disappeared and you were suddenly left going hand to hand with a dragon, with predictable results. A street-luge demo let players streak down a hillside while dodging traffic along the way. You could steer the luge by simply leaning left and right, and collisions merely slowed the player down instead of crashing them out of the game. Mikhailov said there is a balance between what hardware developers want to deliver for VR and game developers' creative visions. He said Sony is experimenting with different types of games to find that sweet spot, but he admits he doesn't know what it looks like yet. ""There's clearly games that work well,"" he said during an E3 demo. ""Street luge was surprising. You're traveling so fast, you'd think someone would get really motion sick, but no one ever has."" Iribe said Oculus delivered 60,000 developer kits for the first version of its headset and will send another 40,000 for the second. With so many pieces of test hardware in the hands of creative people, finding that elusive game that can deliver on VR's promise may be only a year or two away. Sony Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida said independent game designers may be the key to reaching this goal, with an assist from Oculus. ""We weren't able to provide many dev kits until after GDC,"" Yoshida said, referring to the Game Developers Conference three months ago. ""But many developers, especially indie, already were working on something cool using Oculus."" The mathematics of developing games for Oculus or Sony is pretty much the same, he said, meaning that game creators will easily be able to make entertainments for both headsets. Oculus director of developer relations Aaron Davies said that as more people get their hands on VR prototypes and discover what they can do, the more the industry sees the technology's potential. ""I like to give people about 15 minutes when they come out of it (VR),"" Davies said. ""They're thrilled with the experience and they see where it is going, but then it takes some time for them to realize how it is going to change the world. And that's what's fun.""","Makers of virtual-reality headsets say that games, not consoles will drive the VR experience .

"Somalia warned telecommunications companies Saturday not to comply with an Islamist terror group's order to shut down the Internet nationwide. Al-Shabaab, the rebel group behind years of chaos and violence in the nation, banned the use of the Internet this week. It gave Internet providers 15 days to comply or face attacks. But the interior ministry urged companies to disregard the threat. ""The Somali government strongly condemns such acts which show continued brutality and terrorist tactics of intimidation by trying to ban Somalis from using the Internet,""  minister  Abdikarim Hussein Guled said in a statement.  ""Our constitution guarantees freedom of expression and every citizen has the right to access information without fear."" Main telecommunication companies  Hormund and Telsom were not immediately available for comment. ""Al-Shabaab has lost control of the major cities of Somalia and are now trying to terrorize people and stop them using the Internet,"" the minister said. ""We will not allow our citizens to be deprived of Internet access and smartphones."" The terror group is notorious for prohibiting recreational activities, and has banned films, dancing  and watching soccer in the past. It had also barred foreign aid organizations from southern Somalia, describing them as Western spies and Christian crusaders. Al-Shabaab regularly uses the Internet. It has a major presence on social media, and posted the threat on its Facebook page. The radical Islamist group, which controls parts of Somalia, has said it aims to turn the country into a fundamentalist Islamist state.","Al-Shabaab gives telecom companies 15 days to shut down the Internet or face attacks .

"(CNN) -- Earth Day may fall later this week, but as far as former NASA astronaut Edgar Mitchell and other UFO enthusiasts are concerned, the real story is happening elsewhere. Astronaut Edgar Mitchell, shown after his Apollo mission in 1971, claims there ""is no doubt we are being visited."" Mitchell, who was part of the 1971 Apollo 14 moon mission, asserted Monday that extraterrestrial life exists, and that the truth is being concealed by the U.S. and other governments. He delivered his remarks during an appearance at the National Press Club following the conclusion of the fifth annual X-Conference, a meeting of UFO activists and researchers studying the possibility of alien life forms. Mankind has long wondered if we're ""alone in the universe. [But] only in our period do we really have evidence. No, we're not alone,"" Mitchell said. ""Our destiny, in my opinion, and we might as well get started with it, is [to] become a part of the planetary community. ... We should be ready to reach out beyond our planet and beyond our solar system to find out what is really going on out there."" Mitchell grew up in Roswell, New Mexico, which some UFO believers maintain was the site of a UFO crash in 1947. He said residents of his hometown ""had been hushed and told not to talk about their experience by military authorities."" They had been warned of ""dire consequences"" if they did so. But, he claimed, they ""didn't want to go to the grave with their story. They wanted to tell somebody reliable. And being a local boy and having been to the moon, they considered me reliable enough to whisper in my ear their particular story."" Roughly 10 years ago, Mitchell claimed, he was finally given an appointment at Pentagon to discuss what he had been told. An unnamed admiral working for the Joint Chiefs of Staff promised to uncover the truth behind the Roswell story, Mitchell said. The stories of a UFO crash ""were confirmed,"" but the admiral was then denied access when he ""tried to get into the inner workings of that process."" The same admiral, Mitchell claimed, now denies the story. ""I urge those who are doubtful: Read the books, read the lore, start to understand what has really been going on. Because there really is no doubt we are being visited,"" he said. ""The universe that we live in is much more wondrous, exciting, complex and far-reaching than we were ever able to know up to this point in time."" A NASA spokesman denied any cover-up. ""NASA does not track UFOs. NASA is not involved in any sort of cover-up about alien life on this planet or anywhere else -- period,"" Michael Cabbage said Monday. Debates have continued about what happened at Roswell. The U.S. Air Force said in 1994 that wreckage recovered there in 1947 was most likely from a balloon-launched classified government project. Stephen Bassett, head of the Paradigm Research Group (PRG), which hosted the X-Conference, said that the truth about extraterrestrial life is being suppressed because it is politically explosive. ""There is a third rail [in American politics], and that is the UFO question. It is many magnitudes more radioactive than Social Security ever dreamed to be,"" Bassett said.","He says governments are concealing evidence that extraterrestrials exist .

"Alan Turing, a British code-breaker during World War II who was later subjected to chemical castration for homosexual activity, has received a royal pardon nearly 60 years after he committed suicide. Turing was best known for developing the Bombe, a code-breaking machine that deciphered messages encoded by German machines. His work is considered by many to have saved thousands of lives and helped change the course of the war. ""Dr. Turing deserves to be remembered and recognized for his fantastic contribution to the war effort and his legacy to science,"" British Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said in a statement Tuesday. ""A pardon from the Queen is a fitting tribute to an exceptional man."" Turing's castration in 1952 -- after he was convicted of homosexual activity, which was illegal at the time -- is ""a sentence we would now consider unjust and discriminatory and which has now been repealed,"" Grayling said. Two years after the castration, which Turing chose to avoid a custodial sentence, he ended his life at the age of 41 by eating an apple laced with cyanide. Supporters have long campaigned for Turing to receive greater recognition for his work and official acknowledgment that his punishment was wrong. An online petition in 2009 that drew tens of thousands of signatures succeeded in getting an apology from then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown for Turing's treatment by the justice system in the 1950s. Brown described the Turing sentence as ""appalling."" The German messages that Turing cracked at the British government's code-breaking headquarters in Bletchley Park provided the Allies with crucial information. The German messages were encoded by Enigma machines, which Adolf Hitler's military believed made its communications impenetrable. Turing was considered a mathematical genius. In 1937 he published a paper introducing an idea that came to be known as the Turing machine, which is considered to have formed the basis of modern computing. This was a hypothetical device that could come up with a solution to any problem that is computable. ""Alan Turing was a remarkable man who played a key role in saving this country in World War II by cracking the German enigma code,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron said. ""His action saved countless lives. He also left a remarkable national legacy through his substantial scientific achievements, often being referred to as the 'father of modern computing.'"" The prestigious A.M. Turing Award -- sometimes called the ""Nobel Prize"" of Computing -- was named after Turing. The pardon, under the Royal Prerogative of Mercy, comes into effect Tuesday, the British Ministry of Justice said.","Alan Turing's code-breaking is credited with helping to end World War II .

First, on behalf of Penn State Football, we offer our sincerest condolences to the Paterno family for their loss. We also offer our condolences to the Penn State community and, in particular, to those who wore the Penn State colors, our Nittany Lion football players and alumni. Today they lost a great man, coach, mentor and, in many cases, a father figure, and we extend our deepest sympathies. The Penn State football program is one of college football's iconic programs because it was led by an icon in the coaching profession in Joe Paterno. There are no words to express my respect for him as a man and as a coach. To be following in his footsteps at Penn State is an honor. Our families, our football program, our university and all of college football have suffered a great loss, and we will be eternally grateful for Coach Paterno's immeasurable contributions."" Jerry Sandusky, former Penn State assistant football coach who is at the center of the child sex abuse scandal that cost Paterno his job late last year: . ""This is a sad day! Our family, Dottie and I would like to convey our deepest sympathy to Sue and her family. Nobody did more for the academic reputation of Penn State than Joe Paterno. He maintained a high standard in a very difficult profession. Joe preached toughness, hard work and clean competition. Most importantly, he had the courage to practice what he preached. Nobody will be able to take away the memories we all shared of a great man, his family, and all the wonderful people who were a part of his life."" Tim Curley, former Penn State Athletic Director who went on leave amid the child sex abuse scandal: . ""Words cannot express the sorrow my family and I feel.

"Nancy Writebol is a loving mother. A devoted wife. A woman of faith. A missionary who has traveled the world to help others. And now, the world knows her as an Ebola patient. Last month, while working in Liberia, Writebol contracted the deadly virus. She's one of three Americans known to contract Ebola during the outbreak that has ravaged West Africa. The others are colleague Dr. Kent Brantly and Patrick Sawyer, a naturalized citizen and Liberian government official who died from the disease earlier this week. The missionary is expected to be picked up in West Africa and flown back to the United States, where she is expected to join Brantly -- who arrived Saturday -- in a special isolation unit at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital. According to Todd Shearer, a spokesman for the Christian charity Samaritan's Purse, she should be in Georgia early next week. Ebola patient walks into Atlanta hospital . The trip will be the latest of many journeys for Writebol, whose other missionary ventures include Ecuador and 14 years ministering to orphans and vulnerable children in Africa. Since August 2013, the Writebols have been  in Monrovia, Liberia, with the Serving in Mission group, which worked with Samaritan's Purse. Nancy guided missionaries and teams and worked with nurses at ELWA hospital, where her husband is the technical services manager, according to the Christian group's website. Nancy was diagnosed with Ebola on July 25. Those who know Nancy best say that she's motivated not by any quest for personal glory or thirst for adventure, but because she and her husband feel compelled to act because of their faith. As husband David explained from Africa via Skype to members of Calvary Church in Charlotte, North Carolina, at a recent vigil for Nancy: ""We have been blessed because of what Christ has done for us, (by giving) us eternal life and salvation. ""What else could we do (but help)?"" The fact the Writebols left the comforts of America to live in an area rife with poverty, instability and disease, the fact they put their lives at risk to assist those suffering everyday, isn't surprising to those who know them. John Munro, their friend and pastor at Calvary Church, describes the couple as ""the salt of the Earth,"" the kind of people who wouldn't give a second thought to dropping everything to help. The only thing perhaps ironic about what's happening now is how such an ""unassuming"" and ""very humble"" woman has become international news. ""She is ... not someone who would ever make the headlines,"" Munro said, ""apart from something like this."" That doesn't change the fact the Writebols have extraordinary lives. Wherever they've gone, their lives have been centered on their church and their family, including two now-adult sons who live in the United States. One of those sons, Jeremy Writebol, told CNN's Chris Cuomo that the recent ordeal has been hard on his father. Nancy Writebol has been isolated in the couple's Liberia home; she and David talk by phone but, given fears she might pass on Ebola to him, they can't touch. ""It's very difficult, and we feel the emotion of that,"" Jeremy Writebol said of his parents' physical separation. Then, of course, there's the inherent danger of Ebola. The World Health Organization reports that there have been at least 1,322 cases in recent weeks in West Africa, some 729 of which have resulted in death. Even before it was known his mother would return to the United States, where she'll get top-notch care at Emory, Jeremy Writebol took solace the mortality rate isn't even higher. ""We feel like Mom has a chance,"" he told CNN affiliate WCCB. Atlanta hospital embraces chance to treat Ebola patients .","Nancy Writebol was diagnosed with Ebola on July 25 while in Liberia .

"It was either a very restless or restful night of sleep for someone who bought a Powerball ticket in Northern California. Restless knowing their life had changed forever. Or restful knowing they had a boatload of cash coming their way. The California Lottery announced late Wednesday that one winning ticket was sold for the $425 million jackpot.

"Washington (CNN) -- Only a third of U.S. voters think that most members of Congress deserve to be re-elected this year, according to a new national poll. That's the lowest number ever recorded for that question in a CNN survey. The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll, released Tuesday, indicates that only 34 percent feel that current federal lawmakers deserve re-election, with 63 percent saying no. According to the survey, 51 percent feel their own member of Congress should be re-elected -- also an all-time low in CNN polling -- while 44 percent say their representative doesn't deserve to be returned to office in November. Full poll results (PDF) The numbers on both questions are even lower than in 1994, when an anti-incumbent fever helped Republicans win back control of both the House and the Senate from Democrats. The trend line on those questions goes back to 1991, when they were first asked. ""This is not a good year to be an incumbent, regardless of which party you belong to,"" said CNN polling director Keating Holland. ""Voters seem equally angry at both Republicans and Democrats this year."" Fifty-six percent of people questioned in the survey say that most Democrats in Congress do not deserve to be re-elected. An equal percentage say that most congressional Republicans don't deserve re-election. The poll suggests Americans are split when it comes to their vote this November, with 47 percent of registered voters saying they will support the Republican candidate in their district for the House of Representatives and 45 percent saying they will back the Democrat. Republicans trailed the Democrats by 6 points in November. The voters' cool view of incumbents of both parties ""may hurt the Democrats more because there are more Democratic incumbents,"" Holland said. ""It's a change from 2006, when voters concentrated their anger at GOP members of Congress."" The generic ballot question asked respondents if they would vote for a Democrat or Republican in their congressional district, without naming any specific candidates. The Democrats currently hold a 255-178 advantage in the House, with two vacant seats that the Democrats once held. Republicans need to win 40 seats to take back control of the chamber. While President Obama is not up for re-election this November, he will be in 2012, if he decides to run for a second term. According to the poll, 44 percent of registered voters say Obama deserves re-election, with 52 percent saying the president does not deserve a second term in office. The survey also indicates that 49 percent of Americans approve of the job Obama's doing as president, with half of the public disapproving of his job in the White House. ""One problem Obama faces may be the perception that Obama is not a middle-class kind of guy,"" Holland said. ""Only 4 percent of Americans describe themselves as upper class. But a 45 percent plurality say that Obama belongs to the upper class, with 42 percent saying he is from the middle class and 12 percent describing him as working class."" The CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll was conducted Friday through Monday, with 1,023 adult Americans, including 954 registered voters, questioned by telephone. The survey's sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points both for all Americans and for registered voters.

"Dr. Kent Brantly walked around the room at Emory University Hospital on Thursday, hugging staff members and shaking hands. It was like he wanted everyone to know: I'm no longer infectious. The virus is out of my system. Ebola didn't beat me. Brantly and Nancy Writebol, another American missionary infected with Ebola in Liberia, have been discharged from the hospital. Writebol was released Tuesday and is choosing not to make public comments, according to the hospital. ""Today is a miraculous day,"" Brantly said at a news conference Thursday. ""I am thrilled to be alive, to be well and to be reunited with my family."" What happens when you survive Ebola? Emory's staff is confident that the American patients' discharges pose ""no public health threat,"" said Dr. Bruce Ribner, director of Emory's Infectious Disease Unit. He said the reason the public was not made aware of Writebol's release immediately was that she requested her discharge not be publicly announced. ""Nancy is free of the virus, but the lingering effects of the battle have left her in a significantly weakened condition,"" her husband, David Writebol, said in a statement. ""Thus, we decided it would be best to leave the hospital privately to be able to give her the rest and recuperation she needs at this time."" But Brantly passed along gratitude from the woman with whom he has shared a harrowing journey. Both patients were evacuated from Liberia this month, in a plane specially equipped with an isolation tent, and accompanied by medical staff outfitted in head-to-foot protective clothing. The plane was able to take only one patient at a time and made two trips. The patients were taken to an isolation unit at Emory, where they'd been treated for the last few weeks. As she walked out of her isolation room Tuesday, Brantly recalls Writebol saying, ""To God be the glory."" ""We are tremendously pleased with Dr. Brantly and Mrs. Writebol's recovery,"" Ribner said at the news conference. ""What we learned in caring for them will help advance the world's understanding of how to treat Ebola infections and help, hopefully, to improve survival"" in other parts of the world. ""There may be some recovery time because this is a fairly devastating disease,"" but in general, Ebola patients who survive without organ damage are expected to ""make a complete recovery,"" he said. Brantly and Writebol's releases are historic, says CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. They were the first humans with Ebola to ever arrive in the United States. And they were the first humans to receive an experimental Ebola drug called ZMapp, which may have saved their lives. Treating Ebola . There is no known cure for Ebola, no proven treatment and no vaccine. Treatment consists of giving fluids, monitoring vital signs and responding to acute medical crises. Symptoms include fever, aches, diarrhea and bleeding. Left untreated, infections can be deadly in up to 90% of cases. But around half the patients receiving medical care in the current outbreak in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Guinea are surviving. The Ebola virus spreads via direct contact with bodily fluids, like blood, sweat and feces. For Ebola patients to leave isolation, Ribner said, two blood tests done in a two-day period must come back negative. There is a slight possibility that the virus could linger for up to three months in vaginal fluid and semen, according to the World Health Organization. Ribner said that there is no evidence Ebola has ever been transmitted in this way but that the risk was discussed with both patients. Asked about the role the experimental drug may have played in their recoveries, Ribner said doctors ""do not know whether it helped them, whether it made no difference"" or whether it might have delayed their recovery. ZMapp was also given to three health care workers -- two doctors and one nurse -- in Liberia. The nurse and one of the doctors have shown ""a marked improvement,"" according to the World Health Organization. The condition of the second doctor is ""serious but has improved somewhat."" More human cases must be analyzed to determine whether the drug is having a significant effect or if it will help others in the region. But ""according to the manufacturer, the very limited supplies of this experimental medicine are now exhausted,"" the WHO said in a statement Thursday. Are they now immune to Ebola? A deadly outbreak . More than 1,350 people have died in the West African Ebola outbreak since the first cases drew attention in March, the WHO said Wednesday. Aid workers are fighting an uphill battle to stop the disease as it continues to spread. Financial and human resources have been stretched. An emergency research ""all call"" was issued Thursday by medical charity Wellcome Trust and the United Kingdom's Department for International Development to find a drug to stop the outbreak. They are making $10.8 million available to fund research. Wellcome Trust is committing another $66.5 million to the development of health research scientists in Africa, who are studying many deadly diseases there. Canada's public health agency had 800 to 1,000 doses of a vaccine known as VSV-EBOV delivered to health officials in Liberia last week. It's unclear if anyone has been given the vaccine. But there has been a glimmer of hope: The World Health Organization has seen ""encouraging signs"" from Nigeria and Guinea that positive action can rein in the deadly disease. The situation in Lagos, Nigeria, where the country's first case was detected in July, ""looks reassuring,"" the WHO said. ""At present, the city's 12 confirmed cases are all part of a single chain of transmission. Those infected by the initial case include medical staff involved in his treatment, a patient in the same hospital, and a protocol officer in very close contact with the patient,"" the organization said. One of those 12 has made a full recovery, the WHO said, which ""counters the widespread perception that infection with the Ebola virus is invariably a death sentence."" Evidence suggests early detection and therapy can help people survive, it said. Are myths making the Ebola outbreak worse?","Dr. Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol have been discharged from an Atlanta hospital .

"The historic six-month agreement over Tehran's nuclear program may begin a new era of relations with Iran, but it will be a long road back for the country's most vital sector, oil. Iran produces about two and half million barrels a day -- far off its 4-million-barrel-per-day peak a decade ago.  Output is hovering at a level last seen at the end of Iran's war with Iraq. With North Sea Brent crude averaging over $100 a barrel for a record three years running, the sanctions on energy alone are costing Tehran about $50 billion in lost annual revenue. Despite the deal breakthrough, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said most of the sanctions will stick as the world gauges the intentions of this relatively new administration in Tehran. ""During the six month phase, the oil sanctions that will remain in place will continue to cause over $25 billion in lost revenues to Iran or over $4 billion a month,"" he said. The message is clear:  the pressure remains, but if all goes well, in a half year's time Iran can expect more in return for transparency. The last few years have been filled with uncertainty. Tensions around the Strait of Hormuz with the on-and-off threats by the previous government of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to block oil shipments in the Gulf have kept what strategists call a 10-15% risk premium on global energy prices. Iran sits on about 9% of the world's proven oil reserves, claiming a few years back that it has nearly 150 billion barrels and the world's largest gas field. But its top four customers --China, India, Japan and South Korea -- have all had to cut back their energy imports by a third or more in the past few years due to U.S. and European pressure. With every year that has passed, the screws have been tightened by Washington and the countries of the European Union.  It was not only sanctions against oil, but also blocking Iran's ability to secure shipping insurance and to trade in U.S. dollars and euros.  That economic isolation, many Middle East strategists I have spoken with suggest, is what brought Iran's new government to the negotiating table. In 2012, the Iranian rial plunged by up to 80%.  Basic staples of life, poultry and bread skyrocketed in price and the economy went through a period of hyper-inflation. With rising import prices due to a plummeting currency, industrial Iran is no longer able to compete.  There are reports that the state manufacturing sector had laid off up to 800,000 workers in 2012 and those who have kept their jobs saw their wages eroded by skyrocketing prices. Oil executives with experience in the country say this initial agreement would help lift a cloud of uncertainty over the oil market, but that President Hassan Rouhani and his cabinet have to establish much better contract terms if this honeymoon period lifts sanctions. The blunt-speaking Chief Executive of French energy group Total, Christophe de Margerie, told me at an energy conference in Abu Dhabi this month that Iran needs to try and create a better climate for investment if this weekend's breakthrough is sustained. ""I can tell you with the experience we have from Iran it doesn't always bring as we say in French partie de plaisir ... a win-win."" Oil giant Saudi Arabia has expressed doubts about signing a deal with Tehran, which will introduce more challenges within OPEC.  Iraq plans to double production by 2020 to six million barrels a day and with Iran wanting to rebuild exports, the Kingdom may have trim its own production to defend prices. It is still early days, but this country of nearly 80 million people has been described as potentially being the Germany of the Middle East with plenty of natural resources -- that is, if it can emerge from years of economic isolation.","Oil sanctions on Iran remain in place for the next six months despite historic deal .

"(CNN) -- A person infected with an active case of tuberculosis flew aboard a commercial passenger jet last week, despite the person's presence on a ""do-not-board"" list maintained by federal health authorities, officials said Tuesday. The patient, who has not been identified publicly, flew Saturday aboard US Airways Flight 401 from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to San Francisco, California, airline spokesman Morgan Durrant told CNN. An investigation involving US Airways, the Transportation Safety Administration (TSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is under way, he said. The CDC gives the do-not-board list to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS), which notifies TSA. It in turn notifies the individual airlines, according to a U.S. government official who asked not to be identified. In this case, the official said, the government notified the airline at 10 p.m. Friday, more than 14 hours before the passenger checked in for the flight, which departed at noon Saturday. ""When DHS was provided the do-not-board information from CDC, TSA quickly followed proper protocol and made this information available to airlines,"" TSA spokeswoman Kristin Lee told CNN. The CDC told USAirways that there is little to no risk that another passenger would contract the disease on a flight of fewer than eight hours, Durrant said. Because the flight lasted less than six hours, the airline has not tried to contact any of the other passengers, he said. The person was stopped in San Francisco after trying to board another flight for a location outside the country, said Dr. Martin Cetron, CDC's director for global migration and quarantine. ""We don't think anyone with active tuberculosis should get on a plane,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview. Cetron said the patient has a contagious form of tuberculosis but he would not divulge whether it is a multiple-drug-resistant strain of the bacteria, which can prove fatal. The patient is being treated for the disease, the doctor said. Despite the fact that the person boarded the Philadelphia-San Francisco leg of his planned trip, ""I think the public health side of this equation functioned,"" Cetron said. He noted that the person's name was put on a do-not-board list in a timely way and that the person was intercepted in San Francisco. Still, he acknowledged, it could have gone better. ""If everything is working smoothly, the hope is that he would never get onto the flight in Philadelphia,"" he said. It is not the first time the list has failed to keep a passenger with contagious tuberculosis off a jetliner in the roughly 30 months of its existence, he said. ""There are a few others, but it's exceedingly uncommon,"" he said, citing ""a handful of other incidents."" He added, ""Every time it doesn't work, it's unfortunate and it's investigated ... There are all sorts of reasons why things may not work exactly as planned."" The list was created in June 2007 after Atlanta, Georgia, lawyer Andrew Speaker traveled abroad with a drug-resistant case of tuberculosis. He set off an international health scare by flying to Europe. and then Canada, before driving back to the United States. He insisted he had not been told he was contagious; public health officials disagreed. Since its creation, the list has held 88 names of people with contagious disease who represent a threat to public health and have shown evidence of intending to fly, Cetron told CNN. Seventy-six of the names have been removed, he said. He underscored that the do-not-board list differs from the do-not-fly list maintained by the Department of Homeland Security. ""There are separate procedures and processes,"" he said. Tuberculosis, one of nine diseases that can get a person on the list, has accounted for most of the cases on the list. Other diseases include viral hemorrhagic fever and SARS.","Person with active case of TB was on federal ""do not board"" list .

"The West African country of Senegal has closed its borders with Guinea over fears that the Ebola outbreak could spread, according to the Senegalese Interior Ministry. The closure includes any aircraft and ships traveling to Senegal from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia. Senegal is located to the northwest of Guinea, which as of August 20 had 579 suspected Ebola cases, according to the World Health Organization. Sierra Leone and Liberia border Guinea to the southwest. Those three nations have been the epicenter of the Ebola outbreak. So far, 2,473 suspected cases have been reported to WHO from those three countries and Nigeria. Nigeria now has a total of four Ebola patients under treatment at an isolation ward, bringing the total number of reported cases in the country to 14, officials said. More than half of the patients in the outbreak have died. It's the largest Ebola outbreak on record. And still, WHO says, the numbers don't tell the whole picture. ""The magnitude of the Ebola outbreak, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone, has been underestimated for a number of reasons,"" the organization said in a statement Friday. ""Many families hide infected loved ones in their homes. ""Others deny that a patient has Ebola and believe that care in an isolation ward -- viewed as an incubator of the disease -- will lead to infection and certain death. Most fear the stigma and social rejection that come to patients and families when a diagnosis of Ebola is confirmed."" Corpses in these countries are being buried without determining cause of death, WHO says. Medical staff cannot keep up with the current demand, especially with the limited supplies they have on hand. ""In some areas, most notably Monrovia, virtually all health services have shut down,"" WHO says. ""Fear keeps patients out and causes medical staff to flee."" Senegal is not the first country to close its border during the outbreak. President Ellen Sirleaf has shut most of Liberia's borders to contain the virus. The few points of entry that are still open are testing people passing through for Ebola. Guinea and Sierra Leone have done the same. Kenya, South Africa and others in the region are also limiting travel to and from the area. In its first statement on the Ebola outbreak, the African Union this week expressed its ""deep concern at the current situation, and its full solidarity and support to the countries affected by this epidemic."" At its meeting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the group of African nations authorized the ""immediate deployment of an AU-led Military and Civilian Humanitarian Mission, comprising medical doctors, nurses and other medical and paramedical personnel, as well as military personnel, as required for the effectiveness and protection of the Mission."" Medecins Sans Frontieres, also known as Doctors Without Borders, describes Ebola as ""one of the world's most deadly diseases."" The virus is highly infectious, and is transmitted through bodily fluids such as blood, sweat and feces. Two to 21 days after a person is infected, symptoms such as fever, muscle pain and a sore throat appear. The fever then progresses to vomiting and diarrhea, difficulty breathing, impaired organ function and internal bleeding. Ebola hemorrhagic fever can be deadly in up to 90% of cases, though the current outbreak's mortality rate has been around 50%. Ebola virus: 9 things to know . On Thursday, residents in the Monrovia's West Point slum protested a government-enforced Ebola quarantine. An estimated 50,000 people live in the West Point area. Armed soldiers were deployed to keep the quarantine in place, CNN's Isha Sesay reported. Liberia has been hardest hit by the virus, with 972 suspected cases and 576 deaths. Meanwhile, the disease's infectious nature has health officials around the globe on high alert. But so far, any suspected cases outside the four West African countries affected by the outbreak have turned out to be false alarms. Test results on a patient in California this week were negative for the deadly virus, according to the state's health department. Similar cases in New York, Ireland, Abu Dhabi and the Philippines have also tested negative for Ebola.","Nigerian officials report two new cases, bringing total in that country to 14 .

"(CNN)The Spanish nurse's aide who contracted Ebola after treating virus-stricken patients in Madrid is now free of the virus, her doctors announced Tuesday after another test on her. Teresa Romero Ramos is clear of Ebola, physicians at Carlos III hospital said. She received an initial test, which turned up no virus in her blood, doctors said Sunday. More tests were administered to be sure she was virus-free. While Spain welcomes the good news about Ebola, the United States is doing more to help prevent the spread of the virus. The Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that all arriving passengers from West African countries that Ebola has hit hardest -- Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea -- must land in one of the five U.S. airports that have enhanced Ebola screening. Those airports are New York's John F. Kennedy International; D.C.'s Washington Dulles; New Jersey's Newark Liberty International; Chicago's O'Hare International; and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta. On its website, the Department of Homeland Security shows how many people have been screened and then taken to health care facilities for further checks. JFK appears to be outpacing the other airports in screenings. Also Tuesday, the World Health Organization announced that testing was underway at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland for an Ebola vaccine; and a trial for a second vaccine, initially developed in Canada, has started at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring. The goal is to launch vaccine trials in West Africa by January, said Dr. Marie Paule Kieny, the WHO's assistant director general for health systems and innovation. The initial vaccine tests are being given to volunteers in countries such as Mali, the United States and England. It is impossible to get Ebola from the vaccines, Kieny said, because they do not contain enough of the virus's genetic material. But ""there is no vaccine that has no side effects at all,"" she added. It's not clear when vaccines could be distributed to the masses. That won't be determined until after test results come in. When the testing reaches West Africa, candidates could include relatives of infected Ebola patients, Kieny said. Debate over experimental drugs . The WHO said it is also visiting sites in the three countries most devastated by Ebola -- Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia -- to see which treatment centers could participate in the testing of experimental Ebola drugs. But there is debate among medical ethicists about the drug trials -- namely, whether to use placebos in testing. While some say placebos are necessary to gauge the effectiveness of drugs, others say it's unethical to withhold treatment for a disease with a mortality rate of about 50%. CDC gives new guidelines . The news from the WHO comes a day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued updated Ebola guidelines, focusing on better protecting health care workers. Dr. Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC, stressed the importance of more training and supervision, and he said no skin should be exposed when workers are wearing personal protective equipment, or PPE. ""We're increasing the margin of safety with a real consensus guideline that has three key changes. One, training, practicing -- demonstrated hands-on experience so that the health care workers are comfortable donning and doffing PPE. Two, no skin exposure. Three, observation of every single step, putting on and taking off the PPE,"" Frieden said. CNN's Lindsay Isaac contributed to this report.","U.S. restricts passenger arrivals from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea to five airports .

"Ignorance really isn't bliss. But there are times when the lack of knowledge and expertise about a subject or place can actually serve to clear the mind and lead to some clarity and honesty in the debate on even the most complex matters. I'm certainly no expert on Ukraine. I'm not sure before this crisis that I could even name all of the countries that share its borders. But watching the ticktock of the debate on the issue this past week, I'm stunned by the lack of perspective and breathlessness in the discussion. Sadly, I've grown accustomed to the partisanship. It has become a permanent fixture of our analytical and policy landscape. But here are several things about the recent coverage and discussion on Ukraine that even my lack of expertise won't allow me to accept: . 1. We're back in the Cold War . Clearly, none of the resets have worked with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Whether it was President George W. Bush looking into his eyes and seeing his soul or Bob Gates finding a stone-cold killer there, Putin isn't Stalin, Khrushchev or Brezhnev. That's hardly a shocker. Nor are we still in that unique period when two superpowers with contrasting ideological systems under the threat of nuclear war clashed and fought by proxy from one end of the globe to the other. There's no doubt that the United States and Russia have major differences. But the issue is no longer ideological. Russian capitalism is here to stay, state-controlled and monitored though it may be. And what ideology exists has more to do with asserting Russian national interests than anything Marx or Lenin would have recognized. And in at least one respect, that's too bad. At least during much of the Cold War, from the 1970s on, there were rules, do's and don'ts that prevented situations like Ukraine. Are you in Crimea? Share your story with CNN iReport. We'll continue to struggle with Putin, to be sure. But the world's too small, the Europeans too dependent on Russia, and the realities of global interdependence too deep to imagine hitting the rewind button and turning the planet into an arena of conflict and competition. Would it make for a good video game? Yes. 2. Putin is Hitler . In the past week, I've heard people I admire and respect talk about Crimea as Munich and Putin as Hitler. Twain wrote that history doesn't repeat; it rhymes. But those rhythmic patterns aren't evident here, either. When we can't think of intelligent parallels in analyzing nations who do things America cannot abide, it seems we're drawn irresistibly to the Hitler trope. The same thing happens with Iran. And while I don't for a moment condone the vicious  Israel-baiting and hating of the mullahcracy in Tehran (and the anti-Semitism, too) to bring up Hitler not only trivializes the monstrosity of the evil and the magnitude of the crimes in his time, it imposes unrealistic challenges in ours. The unique challenge of Hitler demanded that he be stopped and the Nazi regime destroyed. We don't have to like the Putin government in Russia, or Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei's in Iran, to recognize that the magnitude of the threat is different. To compare them to Hitler is to urge the United States into a game that we don't want to play and can't win. As best I can figure, Putin is a clever and easily riled Russian nationalist who presides over what remains of an empire whose time has come and gone. He lives in reality, not in some megalomaniacal world. But he is prepared to assert Russia's interests in spheres where it matters, and to block the West's intrusion into those areas as best he can. Russia is his ""ideology."" And on Ukraine, history and proximity give him cards to play. This man isn't a fanatic. Money, pleasure and power are too important to him. Any leader who is willing to be photographed shirtless on a horse, like some cover of Men's Health magazine, isn't going to shoot himself in the head or take cyanide in a bunker. This guy is way too hip (Russian style) and attached to the good life to be Hitler. And given Russia's own suffering at the hands of the Nazis, saying he is just makes matters worse. 3. It's all Obama's fault . President Barack Obama was never the catastrophic incompetent or Satan's finger on earth that his worst critics imagined nor the redeemer, savior, or great President that his most avid acolytes wanted. And yet the notion that Obama, through weak and feckless foreign policy, was responsible for Putin's move into Ukraine strains credulity to the breaking point. This urban legend that because of Benghazi and the ""red line"" affair in Syria, Putin was compelled to do something in Ukraine that he wouldn't have done had Obama acted differently, is absurd. The administration's foreign policy has often resembled a blend between a Marx Brothers movie and the Three Stooges. But on this one the charge is absurd, as is the notion that somehow Obama could have stopped him. When the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in 1956, there was no U.S. military response; ditto in 1968 when the Soviets put down Prague Spring in Czechoslovakia. Sometimes, geography really is destiny. Russia believed its vital interests in Ukraine were threatened and it had the means, will, and proximity to act on them. And it's about time we faced up to it. 4. Bombing Syria would have saved Ukraine . This notion that Obama's opponents have latched onto is, of course, unknowable. There are no rewind buttons in history. Counterfactuals are prime talking and debating points because they cannot be proven one way or the other. But to  argue that launching cruise missiles at Syrian military targets somehow would have deterred Putin from acting on what he perceived to be a Russian vital interest, or emboldened the Europeans to stand tougher against him, really is off base. Syria and Ukraine are like apples and oranges the President's detractors insist on putting in the same basket.  Even if Obama thought the U.S. had vital interests that justified an attack on Syria, it is likely it would not have altered Putin's policy toward Ukraine. The country perceived to be in Russia's zone of influence and manipulation was drifting westward. And Putin was determined to stop it. 5. Ukraine can have a 'Hollywood' ending . Are there good guys and bad guys in the Ukraine-Russian drama? Sure there are. We have courageous Ukrainian patriots who died in the Maidan for the dignity and freedom they believed in; corrupt and ruthless government officials who were willing to use force against their own citizens; Russian provocateurs eager to stir up trouble; extremist Ukrainian nationalists who are hardly democrats; and a Russian strongman who hosted the Olympics one week and invaded the territory of a sovereign country the next. I suspect that the Ukrainian Spring -- if that's what it is  -- may turn out better than its Arab counterpart. But we have to be real. Ukraine may be fractious and troubled for some time to come. Below the morality play there is intense factionalism; regional differences; scores to settle; Russian manipulation; and a tendency to avoid the kind of compromise that would lead to real power sharing and good governance. We like Hollywood endings. But real democratization depends less on a friendly U.S. or EU hand than on the emergence of genuine leaders who are prepared to rise above factional affinities and see a vision for the country as  a whole. It also depends on institutions that reflect popular will and some mechanism for accommodating differences peacefully without resorting to violence. There are no easy or happy endings here. And we can only make matters worse, as Henry Kissinger suggested recently, by trying to turn the Ukraine crisis into a Russia vs. the West  (or worse, the U.S.) tug-of-war.","Aaron Miller says even those with little knowledge of Ukraine should spot the myths we've heard .
He says Obama's foreign policy isn't to blame for what Putin did in Crimea .
Miller says this doesn't represent a new Cold War, nor is Putin equivalent to Hitler .
He says the outcome may be acceptable eventually but don't expect a Hollywood ending ."
"(CNN) -- This week Thomas Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stepped up to the microphone and took responsibility for the worst mistake in Dallas' Ebola-stricken hospital: its utter lack of preparedness. After insisting for months that any U.S. hospital could handle an Ebola case by following CDC guidelines, Frieden now wishes he had provided Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital with the robust CDC clinical support team it desperately needed to care for Thomas Eric Duncan -- the first of three people to be diagnosed with Ebola on American soil. What now? The federal government's last major health care scandal -- at the Department of Veterans Affairs -- offers a road map out of this mess, and it begins with finding new leadership for the CDC. The times call for a person with unique talents and vision that Frieden lacks. Americans were shocked this spring to learn about falsified treatment numbers and hidden, lengthy wait lists at Veterans Affairs hospitals. After a grueling, monthlong drumbeat of bad news, culminating with revelations that veterans died while on those secret wait lists, Secretary Eric Shinseki finally resigned. His resignation came only after President Barack Obama was essentially forced to fire him. After helming an agency that similarly proved ill-prepared to meet its most important mission, Frieden shouldn't force the resignation issue like Shinseki did. In announcing Shinseki's resignation, Obama hailed his fine career as a U.S. Army general, and Frieden similarly came to his leadership post with a stellar resume, the highlight of which is having helped up to a half million people in India by controlling the spread of tuberculosis. He was also the innovative New York City health commissioner who took on one of the top health scourges, tobacco, with a smoking ban in workplaces and bars that has now been replicated in many major cities. He tackled obesity and cardiovascular disease with a ban on trans fats and rules that chain restaurants post calorie counts -- moves that have also proved popular elsewhere. But while at the CDC's helm during one of its greatest public health crises, Frieden hasn't demonstrated the same kind of entrepreneurial spirit and foresight that he displayed in New York. In fact, at times, he's seemed completely out of touch. This weekend Frieden told reporters: ""I'm not familiar with any prior patient with Ebola who has undergone either intubation or dialysis,"" and speculated that such measures could have increased the risk of contamination surrounding Duncan's care in Dallas. He didn't seem to be aware that Emory University Hospital in Atlanta used both measures in its treatment of Ebola patients. Dr. Bruce Ribner, who's heading Emory's Ebola team, discussed these procedures in a conference call with hospitals and health care workers Tuesday. Frieden's out-of-the-loop status on core clinical details seemed to have pointed him in the wrong direction entirely for a cause of contamination, as further details about the Dallas hospital's difficulties with Ebola protective garb have come to light. In fact, using chocolate sauce as a stand-in for bodily secretions, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta demonstrated how easily self-contamination can occur: While taking off the CDC's recommended personal protective gear, he inadvertently smeared his arm and his neck. As it leaves necks exposed, the gear doesn't compare to the hazmat-style suits aid workers are using in West Africa, and workers use at Emory -- and in fact Frieden wore such superior protection when visiting Liberia. When the first nurse's infection was announced Sunday, Frieden immediately blamed a ""breach in protocol"" for her situation. It was perhaps beyond his imagination that the CDC protocols themselves -- including the training and infrastructure -- failed in Dallas. Finding an effective way to handle and dispose of medical waste from Ebola has been a problem as well, and the CDC should have solved it long before the first domestic diagnosis. The fact that more than 70 health care workers were involved in Duncan's care points to Presbyterian's lack of preparedness; hospitals that have a plan know it's essential to limit staff coming into contact with Ebola patients, who become progressively more contagious the sicker they become. In transferring the third patient, Amber Vinson, to Emory, the CDC is admitting that Presbyterian isn't prepared. I don't think Presbyterian is that different from most American hospitals. It has a fine reputation in its community. Yet it wasn't up to the job despite Frieden's repeated insistence that any American hospital can do this. On the call Tuesday with Ribner, one participant listener from a California hospital said implementing Emory's care recommendations would ""bankrupt"" them. That's the kind of practical detail leaders need to know to be effective, and Frieden has proven he doesn't. Frieden should have known the closest equivalent to the level of personal protective equipment required by Ebola in American hospitals is found in operating rooms, and even that doesn't compare. In ORs we're mostly concerned about not infecting the patient, and we're able to remove garb with little fanfare. Now we're learning that doctors and nurses treating Duncan didn't wear the recommended protective suits for two days while they suspected Ebola but didn't have the diagnosis confirmed. Why wasn't the CDC guiding them? When Frieden said this week he'll now send a robust, hands-on clinical team anywhere in America that Ebola is diagnosed, I thought, my word, we aren't doing that already? Instead, once his lab confirmed Duncan's diagnosis, Frieden provided epidemiologists and contact tracers, and the CDC offered passive guidance. Far too passive, it seems, as Vinson, the Presbyterian nurse, flew to Cleveland, a violation of the CDC's guidance on controlled movements while under monitoring, which doesn't include such public transportation. Frieden has been playing catch-up for too long. In mid-August, his agency touted a total of 55 CDC employees on the ground in West Africa, as if that was a remotely proportional response to the growing epidemic. By that time I and other critics had been recommending a military-grade operation. It would be another month, when the case numbers had doubled, before the administration would announce such an initiative. ""We are fulfilling our promise to the people of West Africa,"" Frieden said back then, in words he must now sorely regret. He didn't change his tune and lobby the President for the military option until he returned from a visit to the region several weeks later. At the VA, new leadership is in place, and the agency is picking up the pieces. America could use a surgeon general right now, and that we don't have one represents a failure of our partisan politics. But it's entirely within the President's authority to identify and appoint new leadership at the CDC, the central agency managing this crisis. Frieden is clearly a good man and will go on to do good things. But the President must now choose someone better attuned to the crisis leadership role that has overtaken the rest of the CDC director's job description.","Ford Vox: CDC's Thomas Frieden took responsibility for lack of Ebola preparedness .

"His middle name was Riddle, and that's what his whereabouts have been for the last 37 years. Maybe, the story went, Jimmy Hoffa was disposed of under the old Giants Stadium in New Jersey. Or perhaps he was buried in a Michigan horse farm. One colleague said his body had been incinerated. Still another theory was that he was taken to a Florida swamp as alligator food. Or, as one person said at the time of his disappearance, he wasn't dead at all. He'd taken off to South America in the company of a go-go dancer. To date, none of these theories have panned out. But wherever the truth may lie, one thing is for certain: Jimmy Hoffa -- former Teamsters leader, convicted felon, Kennedy enemy and alleged mobster cohort -- hasn't been seen since July 30, 1975. On Friday, police again looked for the union boss, who was declared dead in 1982, under the driveway of a house in Roseville, Michigan, just outside Detroit. A tipster told police that a body was buried at the spot around the same time the Teamsters head disappeared. Police found no ""discernible remains"" in the search, police Chief James Berlin said. It's a disappearance that has held on to the public's imagination far longer than Hoffa was in power -- a testament both to Hoffa's high profile and the power of mystery, says pop culture expert Robert Thompson of Syracuse University. ""In this world of enlightenment and science and blogs and the Internet, there are still a few mysteries,"" he says, ticking off the Loch Ness monster and the questions surrounding the Kennedy assassination as other examples. Digging into the Hoffa legend? A bad boy with a lingering legacy . Indeed, Hoffa's disappearance seems ready-made for such speculation. He was an incredibly influential figure, perhaps the most famous union leader of his time -- a time when labor presidents such as the United Auto Workers' Walter Reuther and the AFL-CIO's George Meany regularly commanded headlines. He maintained a base in Detroit, blue-collar home of the brawny auto industry. And he had a bad-boy aura, both for his pugnacious leadership and his alleged ties to organized crime. In fact, some Kennedy conspiracy theories tie Hoffa to the president's assassination. Part of the Hoffa fascination certainly comes from the attention his disappearance earned at the time, says Thompson. But it's the organized crime touch that gives the story a jolt of electricity. ""You get the voltage that comes from the media coverage that turned this into a myth,"" he says, ""(as well as) what it was he did, which is not only the stuff of news, but the stuff of 'The Sopranos' and 'The Godfather.'"" There are also the circumstances leading up to his death. Two weeks before Hoffa's disappearance in 1975, federal investigators discovered that hundreds of millions of dollars had been stolen from the Teamsters' largest pension fund, Time magazine points out in its list of the top 10 most famous disappearances. Hoffa was last seen at Machus Red Fox restaurant in suburban Detroit, ostensibly to meet with reputed Detroit Mafia street enforcer Anthony Giacalone and Anthony Provenzano, chief of a Teamsters local in New Jersey, who was later convicted in a murder case. Hoffa believed Giacalone had set up the meeting to help settle a feud between Hoffa and Provenzano, but Hoffa was the only one who showed up for the meeting, according to the FBI. Giacalone and Provenzano later told the FBI that no meeting had been scheduled. Both men have since died. The current tipster used to do business with a man who had ties to Giacalone. It's no wonder that Hoffa has inspired several Hollywood films, including ""Blood Feud"" (a 1983 TV movie about Hoffa, the Kennedys and gangsters that starred tough guy Robert Blake), ""Hoffa"" (a 1992 feature starring Jack Nicholson and written by David Mamet) and ""F.I.S.T."" (a 1978 film about a fictionalized Hoffa, starring Sylvester Stallone). New chapter in the search . Let missing union leaders lie? The appeal of the unsolved mystery runs deep, of course. They're the bread and butter of police procedurals: There's a reason that such shows as ""CSI"" and ""Bones"" have had such long lives (never mind the enduring attraction of Sherlock Holmes, who's also the subject of a new TV series). Such mysteries also touch on our interest in the supernatural, whether it's over religious icons, ghosts or visitors from outer space. And, like an audience pondering a well-executed magic trick, there's something to be said for our inability to simply figure something out, despite having all the clues at our fingertips. ""For years now, we have had the sense that stuff is provable and solvable. Whenever anything defies that, it naturally becomes the stuff of extreme curiosity,"" says Thompson. Of course, these stories tend to have an expiration date, and more than a generation after his disappearance, Hoffa's may be nearing his. Before Hoffa, one of the most famous missing-persons cases was that of New York Supreme Court Justice Joseph Crater, who disappeared in 1930 -- like Hoffa, he was last seen in a restaurant -- and inspired years of speculation and pop culture references (""Judge Crater, call your office"" was a popular one-liner). Though the Crater mystery has yet to be solved, few people are even aware of the judge anymore. Why should they be? It was a lifetime ago. Besides, if the Hoffa mystery is solved, that fascination will likely be replaced by letdown. Sometimes it's better -- at least for the sake of pop culture riffs -- to let missing union leaders lie. ""This idea that nobody knows what happened to Jimmy Hoffa represents something I think we need and hold on to,"" says Thompson. ""The inability of the human mind to solve the Jimmy Hoffa disappearance story was actually important to our collective soul in a weird sort of way."" Hoffa case reopened, again .","Former Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa hasn't been seen since July 30, 1975 .

"(CNN) -- In two operations in Africa nearly 3,000 miles apart, U.S. military forces went after two high-value targets over the weekend. One operation took place early Saturday in the Libyan capital of Tripoli, when members of the elite U.S. Army Delta Force captured Abu Anas al Libi, an al Qaeda operative wanted for his alleged role in the deadly 1998 bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa. In the second raid, a team of U.S. Navy SEALs in southern Somalia targeted a foreign fighter commander for Al-Shabaab, a terrorist group linked with al Qaeda, according to a senior Obama administration official. Early-morning capture . Al Libi, 49, was returning to his house after morning prayers around 6:30 a.m. (Friday night ET) when a group of at least 10 men in four vehicles surprised him, his wife told CNN. Umm Abdul Rahman said some of the men were wearing masks and some weren't. She said the unmasked men looked like Libyans to her and spoke Arabic with Libyan accents. She couldn't say whether the other men were Americans. The capture was over very quickly, she said. She disputed reports that her husband of 22 years was reaching for a gun when he was taken. She said he broke with al Qaeda in 1996 and had no role in the embassy bombings two years later, and he had even tried recently to clear his name. The Saturday operation was conducted with the knowledge of the Libyan government, said one U.S. official. The Pentagon said the U.S. military was holding al Libi in a ""secure location"" outside Libya. He eventually will be taken to New York, a source with knowledge of the capture and proceedings told CNN. The Libyan interim government called the U.S. capture a kidnapping and has requested an explanation from Washington about the raid, the country's state news agency reported Sunday. Libya emphasized its citizens should be tried in Libya if they are facing charges, LANA reported. President Barack Obama approved the two raids, monitored them closely and was updated regularly by homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco and his national security staff, National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden told CNN on Sunday. ""This operation should be a clear reminder that the United States will seek justice against those who would attack Americans, and never forgets those who are victims of terrorism,"" the White House said Sunday. And in a written statement Sunday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the raids ""send a strong message to the world that the United States will spare no effort to hold terrorists accountable, no matter where they hide or how long they evade justice."" ""We will continue to maintain relentless pressure on terrorist groups that threaten our people or our interests, and we will conduct direct action against them, if necessary, that is consistent with our laws and our values,"" Hagel said. SEAL Team Six involved in Somalia . In the Somalia raid, members of the U.S. Navy's SEAL Team Six targeted a foreign fighter commander for Al-Shabaab named Ikrima, a senior Obama administration official said Sunday. A Kenyan of Somali origin, Ikrima is associated with now-deceased al Qaeda operatives Harun Fazul and Saleh Nabhan, who played roles in the 1998 embassy bombing in Nairobi and the 2002 attacks on a hotel and airline in Mombasa, all in Kenya, the official said. Al Qaeda claimed responsibility for all three. The Nairobi embassy attack claimed 213 lives and wounded 4,500 people. In the 2002 attacks, three suicide bombers detonated a car bomb outside the Israeli-owned Paradise Hotel in Mombasa, killing the bombers as well as 12 Kenyans and three Israelis. The same morning, a missile attack unsuccessfully targeted an Israeli airliner taking off from Mombasa's airport. Local residents said the compound targeted by the Americans was the home of Al-Shabaab leader Mukhtar Abu Zubayr, also known as Ahmed Abdi Godane, and an Al-Shabaab spokesman claimed Godane was the target of the attack. SEAL Team Six is the same unit that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011. The SEALs came under fire and withdrew before they could confirm whether they killed their target, a senior U.S. official said. A second administration official said the commandos withdrew to avoid civilian casualties. The operations were carried out even as polls show Americans are skittish about U.S. military involvement in overseas conflicts. This means others who might be in U.S. crosshairs could have more reason to worry, said retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona, a CNN military analyst. ""One (mission) could have gone without the other,"" Francona said. ""But the fact that they did them both, I think, is a real signal that the United States -- no matter how long it takes -- will go after these targets."" Speaking to reporters at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Bali, Indonesia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said the raids ought to make clear that the United States ""will never stop in its effort to hold those accountable who conduct acts of terror."" ""Those members of al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations literally can run,"" he said, ""but they can't hide."" Al Libi tied to U.S. embassy bombings . Al Libi, has been on the radar for years. He was on the FBI's ""Most Wanted Terrorists"" list, with a $5 million reward offered for information leading to his arrest or conviction. He is alleged to have played a key role in the August 7, 1998, bombings of American embassies in Nairobi, Kenya; and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. More than 200 people were killed and another 5,000 wounded in the Kenya attack; 11 died in the Tanzania incident. Al Libi has been indicted on charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, murder, destruction of American buildings and government property, and destruction of national defense utilities of the United States. As early as December 2010, Libyan authorities told a United Nations committee that al Libi was living there, even providing a Tripoli address for him. U.S. officials wanted al Libi to face trial in an American court. But, counterterrorism analysts told CNN, he may not have been apprehended at the time because of the delicate security situation in much of Libya. There, ex-jihadists -- especially those who once belonged to the Libyan Islamic Fighters Group -- held considerable sway after the ouster of longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi. ""It's a huge deal to get him,"" said CNN's Nic Robertson, who has long been covering al Qaeda. ""He's a big player in al Qaeda (and) he is in one of the key target areas, the north of Africa."" Beyond any psychological impact on the terrorist group, al Libi's capture could potentially yield a wealth of information about al Qaeda's plans and capabilities. The terrorist network has shown particular strength of late in Africa. ""Clearly, he may have useful information about the strength of al Qaeda and the Islamists in Libya,"" Robertson said. ""He is somebody who is senior within al Qaeda. He was well respected, a good operative."" Al-Shabaab blamed for Kenya mall attack . Al-Shabaab long has been a target of Washington as well: It was designated a foreign terrorist organization in  2008. The group is seeking to turn Somalia into a fundamentalist Islamic state, though it has carried out attacks in other African countries as well. The attack on Nairobi's Westgate Mall on September 21 thrust Al-Shabaab into the spotlight once again. Washington vowed to support Kenya's government after the bloody raid, which killed at least 67 people. The Navy SEAL raid on Al-Shabaab took place before dawn Saturday (late Friday night ET) in the southern Somalian port city of Barawe. Abdiaziz Abu Musab, an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said at least one Al-Shabaab fighter was killed in the gunfight.  But no U.S. personnel were injured or killed, a U.S. official said. In recent months, Al-Shabaab's haven in south-central Somalia has been been increasingly squeezed as Kenyan forces fight the group from the south and African Union forces come down from Mogadishu, the Somali capital. At the same time, Al-Shabaab has become even more closely aligned with al Qaeda. The two groups effectively merged last year, said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen. ""This is a group that has adopted al Qaeda's ideology wholesale,"" Bergen said. ""The reason they attacked the mall was not only because it was Kenyan, but also because it attracted a fair number of Western businessmen and others living in Nairobi.""

"To the casual onlooker golf is often perceived as behind the times due to the archaic rules and regulations which govern the game. But even the most old-fashioned sport is powerless beneath the wheels of change and with the Pearls Golf Premier League, golf was recently given a 21st-Century makeover. The inaugural competition took place recently in Aamby Valley City pitting eight city franchises against each other in a floodlit tournament which boasted a $400,000 prize fund and starred major winners Angel Cabrera and Darren Clarke. The ""Premier League"" format is not new to sports fans, with cricket already having undergone a similar reinvention in the subcontinent with the lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL). The IPL is played in packed stadiums at a frantic pace, with superstar players on big-money short-term contracts letting rip in the 20-over competition. Both golf and cricket are sports which traditionally last for days at a time. But does that gentle sporting rhythm -- so reminiscent of yesteryear -- no longer excite a modern audience short on time and attention? ""It's all about thrills and spills these days,"" Edward Hawkins, author of Bookie Gambler Fixer Spy, told CNN. ""Just look at the popularity of T20 cricket in India and the sell-out stadiums. Compare that to the empty spaces at five-day Test matches. ""It's not just India which has a thirst for 'immediate' action and a disinterest for the nuances and chess-like formats. ""Most countries have seen spikes in interest in shorter formats of cricket. Pakistan wants to set up a T20 league, so does the West Indies."" The financial benefits are obvious. PepsiCo recently signed a deal worth Rs.396.8 crore ($71.93 million) to sponsor the nine-franchise IPL competition, which gets underway again in April, for five seasons. Television money . That figure doubled the league's previous sponsorship agreement and Hawkins isn't surprised, suggesting shorter games are more appealing to broadcasters. ""There is money there, unlike Test matches,"" added Hawkins. ""A broadcaster would far rather commit to a three-hour show than one over five days spanning seven hours each and have the possibility that it could be rained off or end two days early."" So now golf bravely follows where cricket has led. Rather than 18 holes, players in the Pearls Golf Premier League played over just 14 with each golfer decked out in their team's jersey. In the end, it was Clarke's Uttarakhand Lions which won the inaugural competition, with the franchise paying $55,000 for the services of the Northern Irishman during the event. Does this new golf experiment signal the imminent demise of more traditional forms of sport? ""This is significant and fundamental because it is changing the very nature of sport: the formats,"" Simon Chadwick, Professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at Coventry University, told CNN. ""The rules, the way in which they are commercialized and marketed, the way in which sport has become a commodity and somehow seems to be morphing into an entertainment product, the way in which sport is consumed."" These fast-paced, short forms of sport are ideal for a country which, like its BRIC counterparts Brazil, Russia and China, is very much on the up. ""India is fast paced,"" continued Hawkins. ""It's a society which wants everything and five minutes ago. It wants to be seen as leading new trends and in that regard quickfire golf certainly does that. ""It's a vibrant, cocksure country these days, a coming force and they are keen to show that off. ""Golf has its popularity in India but, frankly, every kid carries a cricket bat with them, not a five-iron and in that regard the sport has an 'elite' image. ""Now it could be that they are trying to shake off that stereotype but more likely I think this might be down to some rich folk wanting to have some fun and getting TV deals and sponsorships to pay for it."" Hybrid approach . Chadwick outlines how tinkering with the conventions of sport is an attempt to attract audiences whose interests might ordinarily lie elsewhere. He also suggest the trend could continue, as Asia's financial power continues to grow. ""There's the development of new format sports that are intended to deliver a 'better product', which often border on entertainment and celebrity rather than pure sport,"" said Chadwick. ""There's the change in sporting model, with the rise of Asian markets resulting in the emergence of hybrid approaches to sport.""","The inaugural Pearls Golf Premier League took place in India last month .

"A man fishing from a kayak off a Hawaiian island has died after being bitten by a shark, authorities said Monday. The incident was the latest in an alarming spate of shark attacks in the state this year. The attack took place Monday morning half a mile off a point near Little Beach in Makena State Recreation Area on the island of Maui, the Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR) said. The victim's companion, who was also on a kayak, told the department that his friend was fishing for baitfish with artificial lures when a shark bit one of his feet, which was dangling over the edge of the boat. Swimmer killed in shark attack at New Zealand beach . The man's companion, who was about 500 yards away when the attack took place, paddled over to him, tied a tourniquet to try to stem severe bleeding and called on a tour boat in the vicinity for help, authorities said. The tour boat brought the man to shore, and he was then taken to the hospital. But authorities believe he died of his injuries during the boat journey, said Rod Antone of the Mayor's Office of the County of Maui. The man was in his 40s, but authorities are unsure if he was a local resident or a tourist, Antone said. The identities of the man and his companion have not been disclosed. Shark attack claims Brazilian teen's life . High number of shark incidents . ""We offer our condolences to the family of the victim. Our thoughts and prayers are with them,"" said William J. Aila, Jr., the DLNR chairman. Authorities say they have closed the waters off Makena State Recreation Area following the attack. Beaches in the area remain open, but the DLNR said people are advised to stay out of the water. The area will reopen at noon Tuesday if no more sharks are seen in the vicinity, the department said. Shark attacks teen in waist-deep water . The attack is the 13th shark incident reported in Hawaii so far this year, and the eighth on Maui, authorities said. That's well above the state's average of four unprovoked shark attacks per year over the past 20 years. The 10 incidents reported in 2012 were unprecedented at the time, the DLNR said. ""We are not sure why these bites are occurring more frequently than normal, especially around Maui,"" Aila said. ""That's why we are conducting a two-year study of shark behavior around Maui that may give us better insights."" Aila said that authorities hope and expect ""that numbers of incidents will return to a more normal range in the near future.""

"Two weeks before he tested positive for Ebola in Liberia, American journalist Ashoka Mukpo talked about the bleak situation there. ""Man oh man, I have seen some bad things in the last two weeks of my life,"" he posted on Facebook last month from the Liberian capital of Monrovia. ""How unpredictable and fraught with danger life can be. How in some parts of the world, basic levels of help and assistance that we take for granted completely don't exist for many people."" The 33-year-old freelance cameraman for NBC News started feeling achy and tired Wednesday, and he quarantined himself. A  day later, a test at a Doctors Without Borders facility in Monrovia  confirmed that he had Ebola. Anxious parents . Mukpo was among a team working with Dr. Nancy Snyderman, the agency's chief medical correspondent. In an interview with NBC's  ""Today"" show Friday, his mother said he'll leave for the United States on Sunday. NBC News has said the entire team will return aboard a private charter plane. ""The enormous anxiety I have as a mother ... is the delay between now and him leaving on Sunday,"" Diana Mukpo said. ""The State Department has been fantastic. They've been compassionate. I can only hope and pray that his symptoms don't worsen."" Mukpo's father told the ""Today"" show that although he is able to walk around and has only a mild fever, his son is worried. ""Obviously, he is scared ... he has been filming what's happening in Liberia for two weeks and seeing the death and tragedy,""  Dr. Mitchell Levy said. ""And now it's really hit home for him. But his spirits are better today."" Your Ebola questions answered . Sick a day after he was hired . NBC News hired him Tuesday, and Snyderman said she'd worked with him for only a few hours when he started feeling sick. ""My suspicion is that he was infected before we met him and then he became symptomatic once we met him,"" Snyderman said Friday on the ""Today"" show. ""The amount of virus in his body is low. We should have a very good prognosis."" Before working for NBC, he wrote for a series of other international media, including Al Jazeera and Vice News. His passion for Liberia comes through in his work, which makes references to visits to the nation dating years ago. ""He spent two years in Monrovia working with a nongovernmental organization, and really made a strong connection to the Liberian people, and ... wanted to go back and see if he could make a difference,"" Levy said. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? Team to be put in isolation . The rest of the medical team does not have any symptoms, but when the team members return to the U.S., they will be quarantined for 21 days -- the disease's incubation period -- as a precaution. The cameraman is believed to be the fourth American stricken by the disease while in Liberia. Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Rick Sacra all contracted the disease while working in the country. All three recovered after they were evacuated from Liberia and treated at hospitals in Atlanta and Omaha, Nebraska.

"The ship captain accused of causing the deaths of 32 people in last year's Costa Concordia cruise disaster asked for a plea bargain Wednesday as his trial got under way in Italy. Francesco Schettino faces three criminal charges: involuntary manslaughter for the deaths; causing a maritime disaster; and causing personal injury to 150 people who were badly hurt in the accident. The trial, being held in Grosseto, begins a year and a half after the luxury cruise liner ran aground off the west coast of Italy. If convicted on all charges, Schettino could face a sentence of about 25 years in total. But his lawyers may argue that he serve his sentence under a form of house arrest, since there's virtually no danger of him repeating the offense. His lawyers asked for a plea bargain in exchange for a sentence of three years and five months in prison. But the prosecutor voiced his opposition to the request, which means it is almost certain to be turned down. The tribunal is expected to rule on it within a few days. A similar request was made by Schettino in May but was rejected. Four crew members and an officer for Costa Cruises who were originally co-defendants with Schettino have already asked for a plea bargain trial. Their requests will be decided Saturday. Read more: Cruise passengers get bill of rights . Schettino's trial was due to start last week but was postponed because lawyers involved in the case were taking part in a nationwide strike to protest measures aimed at streamlining civil trials. Night of chaos . Schettino was in court with his lawyers for Wednesday's hearing, the start of a process that will be closely watched in Italy and elsewhere. The Costa Concordia, carrying 3,200 passengers and 1,000 crew members, made global headlines when it turned on its side after striking rocks off the Italian island of Giglio on January 13, 2012. Read more: What cruise lines don't want you to know . According to passengers' accounts, chaos ensued that night, as guests rushed to fill lifeboats and escape the shipwreck. Some crew members helped passengers and then jumped overboard, passengers said; remaining crew members seemed helpless to handle the melee. The case centers on several questions, including why it allegedly took Schettino more than an hour to issue an order to abandon ship and why he allegedly left the vessel before all passengers had abandoned it. Given the complicated nature of the case, the trial could drag on for a year or more. The prosecutor presented the court with a list of 357 witnesses Wednesday. Read more: Costa Concordia reveals its darkest secrets . Running in tandem with the criminal prosecution are numerous civil suits against Schettino, which can be heard at the same time. This means more than 250 civil parties are also represented in court. The first hearing, devoted to preliminary questions, was held in a theater to accommodate the dozen of lawyers involved. 'I want justice' Among the civil plaintiffs is Gianluca Gabrielli, who came to Grosseto for the opening hearing of the trial. ""I'm still so angry and I want justice, this is why I'm here,"" he told CNN outside court. ""It was all going well, it was the nicest holiday we ever had with the family,"" he said, remembering the hours before the 114,000-ton ship hit the rocks just before 10 p.m. on a winter's night. Gabrielli recalls getting into a lifeboat with his wife and the two girls, then ages 3 and 4. But the lifeboat was stuck, so the family had to climb out and struggle to the opposite site of the sliding vessel. There, they had to slip into the sea using a rope ladder, with no life jackets and holding the children in their arms. ""I thought 'we'll all die,' it was all dark and cold,"" he said. ""I still have unjustified panic moments, even this morning during the hearing, I suddenly thought that an earthquake was coming."" Massimiliano Gabrieli, one of the lawyers in a pool representing about 100 passengers, said they are seeking up to 1 million euros ($1.3 million) in compensation for each survivor of the fateful cruise. ""We want this sentence to be an example, to serve as monitor so that similar accident never happen again,"" he said. The civil plaintiffs also include the Costa cruise line, which is suing Schettino for causing the accident and destroying its ship. However, many of the civil parties and Schettino's own lawyers argue that Costa and its parent company, Carnival, should be considered as criminal defendants in the trial. Cruise safety after the Concordia . 'This is not a car accident' They suggest that responsibility for the handling of the situation after the shipwreck, including any delay in the order to abandon ship, should extend beyond the captain. But the court decided Wednesday that Costa Cruises should remain a civil party because it had suffered damage. ""This is not a car accident. I'm very disappointed that Schettino is the only defendant,"" Domnica Cemortan, a Moldavian dancer who was on the bridge the night of the shipwreck and is a civil plaintiff in the case, told CNN outside the court. Evidence presented to the court is likely to include conversations between Schettino and cruise line emergency officials on the night of the accident. The 32 deaths occurred during the abandonment of the ship rather than in its impact with the rocks. Meanwhile, the Costa Concordia lies half-submerged on its side on the shore of Giglio Island, rusting and rotting in the waters off Tuscany's coast. Nearly 500 workers are involved in an operation led by Titan Salvage to remove the wreck while protecting the marine environment. Titan and Costa Cruises said last week they hope to be able to rotate the vessel to a vertical position in September. They will then be able to assess whether it can be refloated and towed away. 1 year on, survivors to mark the disaster .","The court will likely rule soon on a plea bargain request by the accused cruise ship captain .

"Deteriorating security conditions near the Golan Heights headquarters for U.N. peacekeepers in the region has prompted Austria to say it will pull out its 370 troops, more than a third of the force assigned to help keep Israel and Syria at bay. The announcement came amid fierce fighting over the Quneitra crossing, Syria's only access point to the Golan Heights. Rebel forces first captured but then lost control of the crossing in heavy fighting. Syrian tanks crossed into a demilitarized zone near the crossing, Israel complained to the United Nations, and two U.N. peacekeepers were wounded when an errant mortar round fell on their border camp. A CNN team also could see Israeli tanks taking up positions along the border on the Israeli-occupied side of the Golan Heights. The developments come amid longstanding concerns that the bloody 2-year-old Syrian conflict could widen into a broader regional conflict. Israel Foreign Affairs Ministry said it regretted Austria's decision to pull its troops out and said Israeli officials ""hope that it will not be conducive to further escalation in the region."" U.N. spokeswoman Josephine Guerrero said Filipino and Indian peacekeepers will remain in the region to enforce the peace deal between Israel and Syria reached in 1974, nearly seven years after Israel first captured Quneitra in the Six-Day War. Syria retook it in 1973. Guerrero said the U.N. will also look to other countries to bring troops to bolster the force, which has suffered from several security incidents in recent months. Last month, U.N. officials said Syrian rebels detained four Filipino peacekeepers, and in December, two Austrian peacekeepers were wounded after being caught in crossfire between Syrian government troops and rebels. The fighting in Quneitra could be seen on Thursday from the Israeli-occupied side of the Golan Heights. Rebels fired on the Syrian forces, who responded with tank fire. Mortars and small arms fire set bushes and shrubs ablaze. Israeli Defense Force spokesman Peter Lerner said the military was taking precautions to prevent the conflict from spilling over into Israel. Israeli authorities have told farmers in the Golan Heights not to approach the border fence in the Quneitra area due to the fighting on the Syrian side, Lerner said. Quneitra is important to the Syrian regime because it represents former President Hafez al-Assad's attempt to liberate Israeli-occupied territory. Pentagon official: Russian warships may be carrying weapons to Syria . In another sign that Syria's civil war is spilling across borders, at least 10 missiles from Syria landed overnight on the eastern Lebanese city of Baalbek, the Lebanese army said Thursday. The rockets wounded one person and damaged property, the army said. Baalbek's population has grown 50% in recent months because of the influx of Syrian refugees fleeing their country's violence. But it appears the violence is following them.","Israel expresses concern over Austrian pullout from Golan Heights force .

"One day after leading a peaceful procession of demonstrators along the streets of his native Ferguson, Missouri, State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson turned a outdoor news conference into an impromptu community forum. ""I'm here to make sure they hear what I'm talking about,"" Johnson, standing with Gov. Jay Nixon and others, told reporters Friday. He stepped away from the microphone and moved closer to members of a community still seething after Saturday's racially-charged police shooting of an unarmed black teenager. ""Move in a little closer,"" he implored residents who had gathered behind reporters. ""Come in closer."" For the man tapped Thursday to restore order in the restive St. Louis suburb where sometimes violent protests were met with a heavy handed police response, the mission is personal. ""The people of our community need to hear what I'm saying,"" he told the crowd. ""They have questions. This isn't about Ron Johnson... It is about the people that live in our community."" State troopers took over security after days of clashes between protesters and local police, who have been accused of using excessive force -- including rubber bullets and tear gas -- in response to the demonstrations. On Thursday night, Johnson and other officials marched with the protesters and, in his words, they ""walked and shook hands and talked to people and listened and promised that we're going to communicate better."" ""Last night was a great night,"" he recalled. ""There were no calls for service. We did not deploy tear gas. We did not have road blocks. We did not make any arrests. It was a good night. People were talking."" At Friday's news conference, residents  expressed skepticism to details released by Ferguson's police chief implicating Brown as the ""primary suspect"" in a convenience store robbery moments before he was killed. Johnson said he would brief residents about the claims after meeting with Police Chief Thomas Jackson. But he urged residents ""to make sure that we don't burn down our own house, that we don't go down there and vandalize our own buildings...That doesn't prove a point. That does not solve the issue. That hurts this community, and that's what I don't want."" At one point in the news conference, a man who said he was the father of seven children talked about his kids being ""scared to death"" of the police. Johnson responded more like a pastor than a law enforcement officer: ""When I got home, my daughter said, 'Daddy, were you scared?' I said, 'Just a little.' She said, 'Daddy, I want you to remember when Jesus asked Peter to walk with him in the water. When Peter got scared Jesus picked him up and said have faith.' Today, we need to be just like Peter."" On social media, people praised Johnson's handling of the situation. ""Capt. Johnson. Inspiring. What an incredible night this is in #Ferguson,"" one person tweeted. Music impresario Russell Simmons tweeted: ""When police know the community and come from community, the relationship can be transformed overnight. Well done Capt. Johnson. #Ferguson"" When Johnson took over security in Ferguson Thursday, the suburb has become a flashpoint.

"(CNN) -- Winter travelers trek thousands of miles to the frozen north each year seeking the sky's ""dancing lights,"" which provoke awe, excitement and, some say, sex. CNN iReporter Bruce Barrett shot this rare red aurora in Canada's Whitehorse, Yukon. Scientists call the natural phenomenon aurora borealis: cascading beams of greens, yellows, blues, purples or reds -- which paint a breathtaking backdrop across the wilderness and attract thousands of tourists annually. ""Usually it starts slowly as kind of a hazy greenish color -- like a mist -- building up in frequency dancing across the sky ... and to me that's religion,"" said photographer Dave Brosha of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, who's seen more than 100 Canadian auroras. ""It's just one of the most incredible feelings a person can have -- sitting there watching that."" To the west in Canada's Yukon province, tour operator Torsten Eder likes to tell a story about a marriage that was forged under the glowing curtains of light.  See spectacular photos of auroras » . ""I had one guy from Mexico, and he wanted to surprise his girlfriend by proposing marriage with a ring under the northern lights,"" said Eder from his office in Whitehorse. ""We got lucky and the lights were visible ... so our guest went down on his knee and proposed to his girlfriend and she was totally blown away. The funny thing was -- she wouldn't wear gloves for the first three days -- so she could show the ring off."" The otherworldly lights also have provided inspiration for almost sacred pilgrimages, Eder said. Guests who said they were going blind or battling cancer told him they wanted to view the auroras at least once in their lives. ""It puts enormous pressure on us,"" said Eder. ""You can't guarantee that the lights will be visible because it's a natural phenomenon."" The display is generally visible at least every three days, he said. Scientists say the northern lights are created by the sun's super hot atmosphere, which blasts particles into the protective magnetic field surrounding the Earth. The magnetic field forces the particles toward the north and south poles. About 60 to 200 miles overhead, the particles bump into the Earth's atmosphere and become electrically ""excited"" -- throwing off light of various colors, said Prof. Dirk Lummerzheim of the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. ""The forecast for this winter is a continued quiet sun, in general,"" he said. The sun is on the upswing of an 11-year cycle. ""Maybe we will have a few periods once a month where the aurora can get a little bit more active."" Although the phenomenon occurs around the clock, the lights are only visible at night. The best time of year to see them is during winter, when darkness in the upper latitudes stretches up to 24 hours.  See map where northern lights can be seen » . Eder's Northern Tales tour company picks up guests at their hotels about 10 p.m. and takes them to an area about 20 minutes outside Whitehorse's city lights. There, travelers can enjoy nature's colorful show from a heated, walled tent until around 2 a.m. ""We almost take it for granted sometimes,"" said Brosha. ""No matter how many times you've seen the aurora borealis -- when they really dance, when you get some really unique colors -- you just kind of say, 'Wow, I'm so lucky to see that.' "" A warmer way to enjoy the northern lights is a shallow, natural rock lake at Chena Hot Springs outside Fairbanks, Alaska, which allows bikini-clad guests to enjoy the lights in temperatures of 106 degrees Fahrenheit. ""I mean, honestly, it's the best way to see them,"" said spokeswoman Denise Ferree. ""Because you're warm and toasty and you're watching the northern lights above."" Chena's owner, Bernie Karl -- who's often as colorful as the lights themselves -- said the auroras sometimes spark the libido. ""Having sex under the northern lights -- it's an awesome experience,"" Karl said. ""Have you ever been out in nature at 35 below zero with northern lights bouncing over your head and your bare ass? Well, you need to try it."" If the hot springs aren't for you, Chena also takes guests up a nearby mountain to observe the auroras from heated Mongolian-style tents called yurts. The resort prides itself on its environmental initiative, which has led to the generation of clean electricity from geothermal heat produced by the hot spring. ""Iceland is probably one of the best places to see the northern lights,"" said Reykjavik tour guide Arni Magnusson of AM Tours. That's especially true as the U.S. dollar gains value against the Icelandic krona -- offering some attractive hotel and shopping opportunities. Guests are picked up at their hotel for a 20-minute drive outside the city to view the lights from higher elevations. ""People say they feel closer to Earth and to the forces of nature,"" said Magnusson. ""The lights totally overwhelm them."" Dan Hershman's life changed dramatically after he photographed a spectacular aurora in Washington state in 2000, which was a peak year in the solar cycle. ""These things are just dynamic and they seem just alive and organic,"" said Hershman, who at the time was a high school music teacher. The photo was unique enough to attract the attention of NASA, which ran the image on its Web site, Hershman said. This spurred his interest in photography and soon, as Hershman put it, ""my hobby became my profession and my profession became my hobby."" Now Hershman performs as principal bassoonist in local orchestras as a hobby -- and he teaches high school photography in Federal Way, Washington, as his profession. The trick to photographing the auroras, Hershman said, is choosing to take the picture when the lights aren't moving as much. ""Otherwise it looks like nothing but a big blob,"" he said. IF YOU GO .

"A newly discovered asteroid will pass ""very close"" to Earth on Sunday, NASA says. The space rock is estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long. It's expected to fly over New Zealand about 2:18 p.m. EDT (11:18 a.m. PDT / 18:18 UTC.) It won't hit Earth or any of the thousands of satellites orbiting the planet, NASA says. It will give astronomers and scientists a chance to study it. The asteroid won't be visible the naked eye, but amateur astronomers should be able to see it with telescopes. Called 2014 RC, the asteroid was discovered on August 31 by the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Arizona. NASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked are expected to hit the planet anytime soon. Sometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people. The Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth. NASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.","Asteroid 2014 RC will fly ""very close"" to Earth on Sunday .

"Meet Dr. Gorbee Logan, the county health director for Bomi County in Liberia. You have now met half the medical team in Bomi County. There are two doctors in the entire county. I don't mean two doctors to treat Ebola patients but two doctors, period. Two doctors to take care of Ebola patients, plus the 100 patients in their general hospital, plus the rest of the county. That's two doctors for about 85,000 people. Logan doesn't complain, even though he's been working around the clock since June, when the first Ebola case appeared in this agricultural county. He would, however, like an actual Ebola treatment center. He's been taking care of patients in a holding facility, which has only 12 beds. Sometimes they have nearly double that number, and patients overflow onto mattresses on the floor. He can't send these patients to real Ebola treatment centers because they're all full. Ebola outbreak: How to help . Logan has been begging the federal government for more than a month for an official Ebola treatment unit, one with more beds and a quarantine area for people who've come in close contact with Ebola patients but aren't sick. My team and I -- senior producer John Bonifield, senior photographer Orlando Ruiz and our coordinator, Liberian journalist Orlind Cooper -- saw firsthand Tuesday night just how much he needs a real hospital. About 7 p.m., an ambulance arrived at Logan's facility in Tubmanburg with five people who, the day before, had washed the bodies of a mother and daughter who had died of Ebola. After they'd done the washing, their community kicked them out, Logan told us. Now the five relatives -- three adults, a 13-year-old and a 5-year-old -- were in the ambulance in Ebola limbo. They couldn't go back home, and they couldn't go into the facility because they might get infected. Complete coverage of the Ebola outbreak . By the light of a single bulb outside the facility, Logan convened an impromptu meeting between himself, county Superintendent Samuel Brown and acting county Field Officer Frances Alesi. It was decided they'd look for a government building of some kind where the family could spend the 21-day quarantine. The county health department would feed them and take care of their needs. But they weren't going to find a place until the morning. The five relatives would have to spend the night in the ambulance. Logan put in an order for a second ambulance so they could stretch out and sleep more comfortably. Desperation grows in the Ebola zone . Logan and his staff are doing a heroic job of taking care of Ebola patients under difficult circumstances. He's strict about infection control -- no health care workers have died on his watch -- and he resourcefully tries different drugs to save his dying patients. Here's what I don't understand: With the millions upon millions of dollars spent in West Africa on Ebola, why doesn't this man get his treatment center? These centers are the single most important way to prevent the transmission of the disease, since they isolate the infected. We left Tubmanburg and Logan and his ambulance full of Ebola contacts and headed back to Monrovia. I fell asleep in the car to the sounds of One Direction on my iPhone (I have tween daughters). Just as the boys were telling me ""What Makes You Beautiful,"" the car came to a stop, and I heard the sounds of male yelling. LIberian English is beautiful and mellifluous and largely incomprehensible to me, especially when spoken at loud volume with a lot of testosterone and passion behind it. But I figured out this was a checkpoint, and the young men with guns wanted us to get out and wash our hands and have our temperature taken. Cooper, our coordinator and an accomplished Liberian journalist, argued with the guards. They didn't back down. They told us the president of Liberia had been through the same checkpoint earlier in the day, and she'd gotten out for the wash and check. Cooper shot back that was fine for her, but we weren't getting out of the car. The screaming back and forth went on for about 20 minutes. Finally, Cooper won. We visibly and dramatically sprayed our hands inside the car with the disinfectant we had with us and leaned our heads out the window so they could check our temperature. No contact: Life inside the Ebola outbreak . The guard aimed the thermometer at my temple; ""36.4,"" he said, and kept staring at me. I had a moment of anxiety -- why was he staring? I don't use Celsius every day, but I knew that was a normal temperature. I smiled back. After a few beats the guard moved on. I invited One Direction back into my ears and fell asleep for the rest of the ride back to Monrovia.","Bomi County, Liberia, has just two doctors .

"There's a lot of information out there on the Ebola crisis. And now, the issue's gone political with increasingly vocal talk on Capitol Hill and in midterm campaigns calling for a travel ban to keep the disease from spreading in the U.S. Let's sort through the muck and get to the facts: . What's all this talk about a travel ban to deal with the Ebola outbreak? Some Republican lawmakers and a handful of Democrats are calling for a travel ban on people from the West African countries most affected by the disease. In Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, more than 4,400 people have died of the disease and one person has died of the disease in the U.S. That patient was diagnosed and ultimately died at a Texas hospital and now Gov. Rick Perry is joining calls for a travel ban after two nurses at the hospital contracted the disease. ""Air travel is, in fact, how this disease crosses borders and it's certainly how it got to Texas in the first place,"" Perry said. ""I believe it is the right policy to ban air travel from countries that have been hit hardest by the Ebola outbreak."" Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said Saturday that such a travel ban ""makes sense."" His state is on high alert after Amber Vinson, the second Dallas nurse to fall ill, flew to Cleveland and spent four days there after she had contracted the virus. But health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and World Health Organization aren't recommending a travel ban, and CDC chief Dr. Tom Frieden has even said the ban could hurt efforts to prevent an outbreak in the United States . Has the U.S. ever enforced that kind of a blanket travel ban? Not really. The U.S. has not banned people from a certain country from coming to the U.S. because of an epidemic. But President Ronald Reagan in 1987 did ban anyone infected with HIV/AIDS from entering in the United States. And for more than 20 years, that was U.S. government policy until President Barack Obama struck it down in 2009. That travel ban came at a time when AIDS was heavily stigmatized in the United States and amid misinformation and some public fear that the disease could spread through casual contact. Anyway, there's not much evidence to suggest that travel ban was successfully enforced or effective. Today, more than 1.1 million people are HIV positive. But remember, Ebola is nothing like AIDS according to Sen. (and Dr.) Rand Paul. Wait, just checking, Ebola can't be spread through the air right? No. No, no, no. The Ebola virus is only spread through contact with the bodily fluids of a person who has started showing symptoms of the disease. And while some have stoked fears that the disease could go airborne, the World Health Organization and other experts have said the chances that could happen are near to nil and are unaware of a virus that has ever mutated in that way. Can you catch Ebola on a plane? What about  epidemics like SARS and swine flu that have infected and killed way more people than Ebola? Why weren't there travel bans for those outbreaks? Nope. No travel bans for those diseases. Swine flu, also known as H1N1 flu, killed more than 284,000 people between 2009 and 2010 according to the CDC -- of which about 12,000 Americans. The WHO did not recommend a travel ban then either. And the United States never banned travel from China, the epicenter of the 2003 SARS outbreak, which tallied roughly the same number of cases -- over 8,000 -- in the same seven-month period as the Ebola epidemic. In fact, U.S. airports never implemented SARS passenger screenings at airports at a time when many other countries did. So why are politicians so certain a travel ban is the right way to go here? Simply put, a lot of members of Congress just want to keep the disease out of the United States and prevent any more cases from spring up at home. And they believe the best way to do that is to bar anyone who's been in West Africa recently -- or who has a passport from one of those countries. U.S. health officials grilled on Ebola at congressional hearing . Rep. Tim Murphy, who led the house panel that sharply questioned top health officials over Ebola on Thursday, insisted airport screenings aren't enough to keep people out of the country -- especially since infected people can carry  the disease for up to 21 days without showing any symptoms. And Rep. Fred Upton said Ebola ""needs to be solved in Africa, but until it is we should not be allowing these folks in. Period."" OK, that sounds like it makes sense. Why are health experts saying the ban's a bad idea? The CDC's Frieden gets why that's the knee-jerk reaction to such a deadly disease. But a ban might actually make things worse, he said, because it could encourage people to lie about their travel to West Africa. And without that crucial information, Frieden said people infected with Ebola could slip into the United States without the CDC being able to track and monitor them for symptoms. But aren't more than two dozen African countries now enforcing some kind of travel ban? Yes. A few of the neighboring West African countries have actually sealed their borders altogether while many other countries on the continent are banning travel to and from those West African countries. But it's not clear how effective those bans are at keeping West Africans out in a region known for especially porous borders. ""Even when governments restrict travel and trade, people in affected countries still find a way to move and it is even harder to track them systematically,"" Frieden said last week. So you're saying it probably wouldn't work? Nope. At least not according to health officials. In fact, there are no direct flights to the United States from either Libera, Sierra Leone or Guinea, the three most affected countries. There are direct flights from Nigeria, which has dealt with 20 cases, but that country has been much more effective in containing the outbreak. Latest Ebola developments . How else could a travel ban hurt? The ban would especially hurt efforts in West Africa to contain the disease, where foreign health care workers have been central to the fight against the epidemic. And if American health workers are afraid they can't return to the United States, they might decide not to go at all. Preventing the disease from spreading further in West Africa is crucial to keep Ebola from continuing to spread.

"(CNN) -- Jean-Claude Juncker is a step closer to becoming the next president of the European Commission after EU leaders approved his nomination, despite strong opposition from Britain. Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, announced in a tweet: ""Decision made. The European Council proposes Jean-Claude Juncker as the next President of the European Commission."" Only British Prime Minister David Cameron and his Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban voted against Juncker. The former Luxembourg prime minister will represent the 28-strong union globally and become the answer to the question posed by American presidents for decades: ""Who do I call if I want to call Europe?"" Negotiations over the post have been tricky. One of the most powerful European leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, endorsed the former Luxembourg prime minister, who is a member of Europe's strongest political party, the center-right EPP. Merkel and Juncker share views on closer cooperation and stricter fiscal discipline within the EU. Merkel's endorsement was enough to defeat Cameron, who headed up a group campaigning against Juncker's appointment in the lead-up to the summit in Brussels, arguing that Juncker was too federalist for the job. But as the decision neared, Cameron's allies in Sweden and Denmark toned down their opposition and agreed to back Juncker for the job. When the leaders voted on the issue, Cameron found himself isolated, joined only by Hungary's PM Orban. Cameron, facing pressures from euroskeptics at home, has criticized the EU as being ""too big and too bossy."" A European president in favor of even closer cooperation -- as Juncker advocates -- runs against Cameron's plans to reform the UK's position within the Union and bring some power back to London. The EU election in May saw a surge in the support of euroskeptic parties across Europe, which also complicated Juncker's path to the top job . But Juncker's detractors have failed to come up with a viable alternative. Names floated included Christine Lagarde, the IMF chief, who rejected the idea; and Denmark's Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, famed for her selfie with U.S. President Barack Obama at Nelson Mandela's memorial service last December. But no-one emerged as a strong enough candidate to challenge Juncker and his high-powered backers. The newly elected European Parliament will hold a formal vote on Juncker when it meets next week.

"(CNN) -- Eight people who shared a flight with tuberculosis-infected traveler Andrew Speaker on May 24 filed suit Thursday against him in a Canadian court. TB patient Andrew Speaker set off an international health scare when he traveled to Europe for his wedding in May. Canadian Press reported the suit, filed in Quebec Superior Court, seeks $1.3 million (Canadian $1.4 million) in damages. Speaker, a 31-year-old Atlanta, Georgia, lawyer, caused an international uproar when he disregarded doctors' advice and traveled abroad to get married, potentially exposing his fellow passengers to the disease. Speaking with CNN from a hospital in Denver, Colorado, where he is undergoing treatment, Speaker said he is aware of the pending litigation but has not heard from his attorney in Montreal, Canada. ""I am not some trust-fund baby, and there is nothing to go after,"" he said. Rosalind Yee -- an attorney for the plaintiffs who said her clients include a ninth person related to one of the passengers but who was not on the flight -- said all eight passengers have undergone TB tests since they returned home. One of them, a 72-year-old man, tested positive for TB on a skin test, though it was not clear that Speaker was the source. The man's X-rays were normal, she said, and he is awaiting results of further tests. Speaker and his fiancee flew to Europe May 12, despite warnings from the Fulton County Health Department in Georgia that he should not fly because he was infected with a multidrug-resistant strain of the bacteria called MDR-TB. Once there, the CDC said, test results back in Georgia indicated he had a rare, more serious strain of the tuberculosis bacilli called extensively drug-resistant TB, or XDR-TB. That news led U.S. public health officials to try to persuade Speaker to turn himself in to Italian health authorities so that he would not risk infecting others. Speaker has said he disregarded their recommendation and returned to North America on a commercial flight from Prague to Montreal because he had been told he was not infectious, he could not afford to hire a private plane, and he was afraid that, if he were to remain in Italy, he would not be able to get the cutting-edge treatment available in the United States. Speaker was allowed on May 24 to cross from Canada into the United States at Champlain, New York, despite a warning from the CDC to border agents that he posed a public health threat and that a CDC doctor should be alerted if Speaker were to seek entry. The Customs and Border Protection officer said he let Speaker enter the country because the man did not appear sick. The officer was suspended and later retired. Doctors at National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver have since determined that Speaker is infected with MDR-TB, not the more serious XDR-TB. The CDC says the change in diagnosis would not have affected their recommendations regarding travel. E-mail to a friend .","Eight people on flight with Andrew Speaker sue him for $1.3 million .

"Washington (CNN)  -- You don't need to peek at Santa's long list to know what the White House is asking for this holiday season -- a large, nicely wrapped box of bipartisanship. The ideal gift would come fully assembled, with members of Congress ready to reach across the aisle and ""budge on some deeply held positions,"" as President Obama said earlier this week. But compromise is easier said than done because, as incoming House Speaker John Boehner points out, ""There's a reason why we have Democrats and Republicans. We believe in different things about the appropriate role of the federal government."" Even the president had to admit that history is not on his side. ""It's no secret that we have had differences that have led us to part ways on many issues in the past,"" he said. That said, the midterm elections changed the dynamic in Washington. It also forced Obama to admit to a ""shellacking,"" and it led to the so called ""Slurpee summit."" That meeting on Tuesday with Congressional leaders from both parties in the White House Roosevelt Room lasted only about two hours, and didn't end with a dinner in the private quarters as Obama had initially hoped. However, there was one major concession: The president admitted privately to Republicans that he had not reached out to them enough in the first two years of his administration and he vowed to do a better job. It was a mea culpa after months of dismissing criticism that he had not done enough to foster bipartisanship. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president didn't apologize, but ""took responsibility for that,"" and told Republicans he was ""ready to do his part."" The proof, as they say, is in the pudding. The next few days in this lame-duck session of Congress will truly determine if the summit both sides described as ""frank"" and ""useful"" will produce a compromise on Bush-era tax cuts, the new START treaty or a repeal of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy. But a new effort at bipartisanship seems to be getting off to a rough start. On Wednesday, Senate Republicans promised to block every legislative action until the Senate had moved to fund the government and extend tax cuts. Forty-two Republican senators signed a strongly worded letter to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who promptly blasted the GOP for trying to ""obstruct"" and ""delay,"" legislative progress. Senate GOPers: Take up tax cuts first . But Republican strategist Kevin Madden blames Democrats for wasting a lot of time on issues that ""don't have the votes to pass,"" and are ""not priorities for the American public."" ""The scoreboard shows time running out,"" he said, "" and Harry Reid and [outgoing House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi are just running in circles."" One thing is certain: Americans overwhelmingly want both sides to get along, but don't have much confidence that they will. In a recent McClatchy-Marist survey, 72 percent of registered voters said they wanted congressional Republicans to work with the president and their Democratic counterparts to get things done. But just 28 percent thought that would actually happen. That pessimistic view seems at odds with a more optimistic tone at the White House. The administration is convinced that the midterm elections narrowed the options and might just force results. ""Next year the House will be controlled by the Republicans, the Senate by the Democrats, and the presidency obviously unchanged,"" Gibbs said. ""To make progress on issues, to get legislation through Congress, it's going to take bipartisanship."" Gibbs dismissed doubts that the president's ambitious agenda could get wrapped and delivered over the next two weeks. When a reporter wished the White House good luck, the White House spokesman responded, ""Well, thank you. You'll have a lot to cover."" The top priority is the Bush-era tax cuts. Both sides are eager to ink a deal, but they remain entrenched in their long-held views. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky wants them extended not only for families earning $250,000 or less per year, but also for wealthier Americans. ""We ought to treat all taxpayers the same,"" he said. But the president said the country can't afford the $700 billion dollar price tag in extending the cuts to wealthier Americans. ""I continue to believe that it would be unwise and unfair,"" he said. Polling shows about half of Americans favor extending the tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 while a little more than a third favor extending them to all Americans. How will Republicans and Democrats be able to bridge this wide divide? Obama appointed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and his budget director Jack Lew to negotiate with four members of Congress from both parties. The goal is to find common ground in the next few days. During a break in their Wednesday closed-door session, Geithner told reporters that discussions were ""very civil"" and ""constructive"" and that there were ""no surprises."" But it's unclear how much progress is being made because the group agreed not to discuss those details. Past divided governments have managed to avoid gridlock and produce results. In President Bill Clinton's second term, key accomplishments like welfare reform, a balanced budget and trade agreements were sealed with bipartisan support. Now, both sides have signaled they're willing to work together to give Americans what they asked for on Election Day. Madden said the ball is in Obama's court. ""He'll see bipartisan success if he moves past his singular emphasis on style and actually looks for ways to meet Republicans on cutting spending and targeting the deficit,"" he said. The clock is ticking as the holiday break approaches. It seems progress will hinge on Washington being much less naughty and a bit more nice.","Midterm elections changed the dynamic in Washington .

The lawsuit comes after the department began questioning the legality of the state's so-called voter purge program, which would remove names from Florida's voter rolls months before the 2012 presidential election, when Florida will play a key role as a battleground state with a large chunk of electoral votes. Florida's move to eliminate non-eligible voters from its lists began after the state's Republican governor, Rick Scott, pressed the state to identify non-U.S. citizens who had registered to vote illegally. Using information from Florida's Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles, the state identified more than 100,000 names of non-eligible voters that could potentially be on the lists illegally. Critics say the plan unfairly targets minorities and paint it as an attempt to dissuade typically Democratic voters from going to the polls. While the Justice Department notes that states can legally remove non-eligible voters from their lists, the letter Monday argues that the Florida program does not comply with legal standards, has ""critical imperfections, which lead to errors that harm and confuse eligible voters."" The letter states that the Florida program improperly uses the information collected from old driver's license applications. ""The information is often going to be outdated, as a number of persons will subsequently have become citizens and lawfully registered to vote,"" Perez wrote. It also suggests that the removal process has been going on during a ""90-day quiet period"" prior to the August 14 primary election. ""Please immediately cease this unlawful conduct,"" the letter states. Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, told Fox News Monday that the state plans to sue the Department of Homeland Security to get access to the federal citizenship database so that it can better determine who is voting legally. ""I have a job to do to defend legitimate voters of our state,"" Scott said on Fox News. Three of the state's largest counties -- Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach -- agreed last week to end the removal of the names. The legal counsel for Florida's county election officials recommended halting the purge of names until the state responded to the federal government's legal assessment. Florida's Republican-appointed secretary of state, Ken Detzner, has previously defended the state's practice, slamming the federal government for restricting access to federal citizenship databases and saying such a constraint was illegal. ""It is an unfortunate but now undeniable fact that Florida's voter rolls include individuals who are not citizens of the United States. The Florida Department of State has a solemn obligation to ensure the integrity of elections in this State,"" Detzner wrote in the letter last week addressed to T. Christian Herren, head of the Justice Department's elections unit.","Lawsuit threat comes after Florida began removing non-eligible voters from its voter rolls .

"One day after New York officials announced a Doctors Without Borders physician had tested positive for Ebola, another person who treated patients in West Africa developed a fever and was put in isolation at a northern New Jersey hospital. The second health care worker, a woman who hasn't been identified by name, did not have any Ebola symptoms upon arrival Friday at Newark Liberty International Airport, New Jersey health department spokesman Donna Leusner said. Yet things changed in the hours that followed. According to Leusner, ""This evening, the health care worker developed a fever and is now in isolation and being evaluated at University Hospital in Newark."" That woman is being tested for Ebola, according to a government official who is receiving updates about the situation. Unlike Dr. Craig Spencer, the 33-year-old now in isolation at Bellevue Hospital in nearby New York City, this second health care worker is not confirmed to have Ebola. In fact, there have been far more examples in recent weeks of suspected Ebola cases than actual ones in the United States. For all the scares, only four people -- starting with Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian who died in a Dallas hospital, followed by two Dallas health care workers who'd treated him, lastly Spencer -- so far have been diagnosed with the deadly virus in the United States. Still, the concerns that Ebola could spread further remain real. And, especially amid criticism over how the Dallas cases were handled, officials have signaled their intent to take stops to prevent it moving in. To this end,  the governors of New York and New Jersey announced Friday their states were stepping up airport screening for Ebola beyond federal requirements for travelers from Ebola-hit countries in West Africa. The policy allows the states to determine hospitalization or quarantine for up to 21 days for travelers from the affected countries. A mandatory quarantine is called for those who had ""direct contact with an individual infected with the Ebola virus,""  including medical workers who treated Ebola patients. In addition, people with a travel history to the affected regions but with no direct contact with Ebola patients will be ""actively monitored... and, if necessary, quarantined."" The health care worker being isolated at Newark's University Hospital was among those initially quarantined as a result of this policy. ""This is not the time to take chances,"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- joined by his New Jersey counterpart, Chris Christie -- said of the shift. ""This adjustment in increasing the screening procedures is necessary ... I think public safety and public health have to be balanced and I think this policy does that."" New York officials try to reassure public . Meanwhile, there continues to intense interest about Spencer, including where he was, and what risk he might have posed, before getting hospitalized Thursday. He arrived October 17 at New York's John F. Kennedy's airport, days after leaving Guinea where he'd been treating Ebola patients. Spencer felt fine after touching down, only to begin feeling fatigued Tuesday. But he wasn't symptomatic and didn't have a fever -- of 100.3-degree between 10 and 11 a.m., according to New York City health commissioner Mary Bassett -- until Thursday, at which time he also had  nausea, pain and fatigue. Up through that time, authorities said, Spencer limited his public interactions but did not eliminate them. In fact, he jogged along the Hudson River, rode the subway, took a cab, went bowling, visited a coffee stand at a Manhattan park and ate at a meatball shop, among other activities. But that doesn't mean he posed to a risk during that time to anyone, beyond perhaps his fiancee and two friends being quarantined and monitored, though they feel healthy. On Friday, authorities sought to assure an anxious public that the likelihood of Spencer spreading the virus while out and about was low. Bassett said the chances of anyone contracting the virus from contact with Spencer were ""close to nil."" To show he had no fears, Cuomo vowed to ride the subway on Friday. ""There is no cause for alarm,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. ""Ebola is an extremely hard disease to contract. There is no reason for New Yorkers to change their daily routines in any way."" Infected doctor talking on phone . Spencer, employed at New York's Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, has been in isolation at Bellevue since emergency personnel took him there Thursday morning. His Manhattan apartment has been isolated. Fast Facts: Ebola . On his Facebook page last month, Spencer had posted a photo of himself in protective gear. The page indicates that he went to Guinea around September 18 and later to Brussels, Belgium, in mid-October. ""Off to Guinea with Doctors Without Borders (MSF)"" he wrote. ""Please support organizations that are sending support or personnel to West Africa, and help combat one of the worst public health and humanitarian disasters in recent history."" In a statement, Columbia Presbyterian Hospital said the doctor was ""a dedicated humanitarian"" who went to ""an area of medical crisis to help a desperately underserved population."" ""He is a committed and responsible physician who always puts his patients first,"" the hospital statement said. ""He has not been to work at our hospital and has not seen any patients at our hospital since his return from overseas."" By Friday, Spencer was in stable condition and actively talking on his cell phone from his hospital room. ""(He is)  ""in good enough shape to be in conversation with everyone around him,"" de Blasio said. How to help . The doctor was monitoring his health . In a statement Thursday, Doctors Without Borders confirmed that the physician recently returned from West Africa and was ""engaged in regular health monitoring."" The doctor contacted Doctors Without Borders on Thursday to report a fever, the statement said. The case came to light after the New York Fire Department received a call shortly before noon Thursday about a sick person in Manhattan. The patient was taken to Bellevue. Mark Levine, a city councilman who represents the doctor's Manhattan neighborhood, said Thursday, before news broke of the doctor's positive test, that city health department workers were canvassing the area, distributing information on the disease door-to-door, according to CNN affiliate WABC-TV. ""The goal right now is to make sure people don't panic,"" he said. Get up to speed . The health department said a special ambulance unit transported a patient suffering from a fever and gastrointestinal symptoms. Bellevue is designated for the ""isolation, identification and treatment of potential Ebola patients"" in the city, the statement said. ""As a further precaution, beginning today (Thursday), the Health Department's team of disease detectives immediately began to actively trace all of the patient's contacts to identify anyone who may be at potential risk,"" the health department statement said. ""The chances of the average New Yorker contracting Ebola are extremely slim,"" the statement said, adding that the disease is spread by direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. U.S. considers Ebola quarantine . The United States is considering a mandatory quarantine for returning health care workers from West Africa, an Obama administration official said Friday. The move is an attempt to give clarity to a public concerned about travelers returning from the region and is not because officials fear there is a risk of transmission from people who are not exhibiting Ebola-like symptoms, the official said. Ebola has killed nearly 5,000 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. But fears about its spread has mounted since the first person diagnosed with the disease in the United States was hospitalized in Texas last month. Thomas Eric Duncan, who had flown from Liberia to Dallas, died on October 8. Two nurses who treated him became infected with the virus and underwent treatment, with the cases raising questions about the ability of local and federal officials to deal with an outbreak in the United States. On Friday, the National Institutes of Health said one of the nurses, Nina Pham, had been declared free of the Ebola virus. Pham appeared at a NIH news conference in Maryland, where she thanked Dr. Kent Brantly, the American physician who also survived Ebola, for donating his plasma to her while she was sick. She also thanked God, her family, friends and the medical professionals who treated her. ""I feel fortunate and blessed to be standing here today,"" she told reporters. The other nurse, Amber Vinson, who is getting treatment for Ebola at Atlanta's Emory University Hospital, is steadily regaining her strength, and her spirits are high, her family said. Doctors can no longer detect the virus in her body, and she'll be transferred from isolation, her mother said. Already, all travelers coming to the United States from Ebola-affected areas will be actively monitored for 21 days, starting Monday. In addition, all U.S.-bound passengers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea must land in one of the five U.S. airports with enhanced screening for Ebola: New York's Kennedy, Washington Dulles, New Jersey's Newark Liberty International, Chicago's O'Hare International and Hartsfield-Jackson International in Atlanta.

"The decision by Copenhagen Zoo in Denmark to kill one of its giraffes last weekend sparked anguish. The news four days later that a second Danish zoo might follow suit prompted howls of outrage. But Jyllands Park Zoo has now said that those fears are groundless. In a statement on its official Facebook page, under the heading ""Problem solved,"" it said the giraffe's future was assured. The zoo said Thursday it might also have to ""euthanize"" one of its male giraffes -- which coincidentally shares the name Marius with the giraffe that was killed -- if a female was brought in to breed. But it now says the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria -- a body governing 345 institutions -- has no plans to send a female ""any time soon."" As a result, the zoo said, it would ""of course keep both our giraffes, as we have stated all along. There is no plan, and there has never been a plan to neither move or euthanize any of our giraffes."" Jyllands Park Zoo said reporting of the threat to its Marius had been based on a ""hypothetical situation"" which ""now seems to be eliminated."" The suggestion that a second Marius might be euthanized prompted a slew of angry comments on the zoo's Facebook page. A petition on the website Change.org garnered more than 10,000 signatures. ""We are begging Jylland's Park Zoo to please begin a new trend by showing that there is a more compassionate alternative to surplus animals or animals deemed not fit to breed within your zoo,"" its author said. ""Allow Marius, the giraffe within your care, to live out his days at a sanctuary or wildlife park. Please, do not kill another animal when there are so many other options."" Dead giraffe fed to lions . The decision by Copenhagen Zoo to shoot its male giraffe named Marius to prevent inbreeding sparked wide fury. Staff at the zoo received death threats as debate raged online over the killing, which took place despite another petition signed by thousands of animal lovers. Bengt Holst, scientific director at the Copenhagen Zoo, told CNN the decision was made for the greater good of the giraffe population. ""Our giraffes are part of an international breeding program, which has a purpose of ensuring a sound and healthy population of giraffes,"" he said. Copenhagen Zoo's Marius was shot by a veterinarian as he leaned down to munch on rye bread, a favorite snack. After a necropsy, the giraffe was dismembered in front of an audience that included children and fed to the zoo's lions, tigers and leopards.","Jyllands Park Zoo says there's no plan to kill one of its male giraffes, named Marius .

"As questions continue to swirl about how to deal with the ever-growing fears of Ebola, relatives of the first person to be diagnosed with the deadly virus in the United States gathered to grieve Saturday. Wiping tears from their eyes, family and friends of Thomas Eric Duncan told CNN affiliate Time Warner Cable News Charlotte he was a ""compassionate and respectful young man."" As relatives said their final farewells to Duncan, a  Liberian national and father of four, at Rowan International Church in Salisbury, North Carolina, they wanted him to be remembered for his acts of kindness, ""as opposed to the person who brought this disease to America because he didn't know he was sick,"" said nephew Josephus Weeks. Duncan, 42, died earlier this month at a hospital in Dallas. His mother and other relatives live in North Carolina. This week, a Central American country closed its borders to anyone who has been anywhere near the disease. And an airline scrambled to inform hundreds passengers that they had been on a plane that carried someone who has since come down with Ebola. When U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry asked the government of Belize to help evacuate a Dallas hospital worker from a cruise ship off its coast on Friday, officials declined to let her on shore. The employee of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital was a lab supervisor and did not have direct contact with Thomas Eric Duncan, who died there while being treated for Ebola. But she may have had contact with one of his specimens, the U.S. State Department said. A doctor on the Carnival cruise ship has declared her symptom-free and in good health. Still, the lab supervisor and a travel partner have undergone voluntary isolation as a precaution. Belize slaps travel, visa bans . It's been 20 days since she perhaps handled Duncan's fluid samples -- the maximum incubation period for Ebola is 21 days. Meanwhile, on Saturday, a U.S. Coast Guard confirms to CNN a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter flew to the Carnival cruise, lowered a hoist basket, and picked up the lab technician's blood samples. ""The samples which are in a container, so the USCG members are not exposed, were then taken by Carnival's on board doctor,"" said Petty Officer Andy Kendrick, U.S. Coast Guard spokesman. ""The test results are expected back, before the Carnival Magic arrives in Galveston tomorrow morning,"" said Kendrick. ""If results aren't ready, health officials will be at the port to make sure the woman is not showing any symptoms, before allowing her to get off the ship."" But as sure as it may seem that lab professional is Ebola-free, the State Department wanted to fly her back to the United States -- purely out of caution -- from Belize City's airport. Instead, the cruise ship is hauling her back to Galveston. On top of the no-go, Belize's government has slapped visa and travel bans this week on citizens of affected West African countries and announced more strict measures. ""Also, any person of whatever nationality wishing to travel to Belize who has visited any affected area of West Africa within the last 30 days will be prohibited from entering Belize,"" the government said in a statement on Friday. Cruise ship passengers will be vetted before being allowed to go on land. WHO to review Ebola response amid criticism . Airline worries . Leave no stone unturned is the approach Frontier Airlines is taking, after a passenger came down with Ebola. It is telling up to 800 passengers to contact the CDC. Most of them weren't on flights with Amber Vinson, the second Dallas nurse who contracted Ebola after helping treat Duncan. Vinson flew to Cleveland on October 10 and back to Dallas on October 13. In an effort to further quarantine the deadly virus, the Ohio Department of Health, upped the ante on specific Ebola monitoring requirements on Saturday for those potentially affected by the deadly virus. Ohio health officials Saturday increased the number of people being monitored from 16 to 29. These people were in the vicinity of Vinson or had contact with her. They include people who were in a bridal shop she visited. One of them was a ""close contact"" and is under quarantine, according to DiOrio. All are healthy. The new measures include daily health monitoring by a local health department official and those being monitored ""cannot leave the United States due to the inability to track them down in the event they fail to meet their daily reporting requirements,"" the statement read. ""We're taking an aggressive approach, no doubt about it, but it's just common sense. Some might criticize us for being too aggressive, but we're comfortable taking that criticism,"" said Dr. Mary DiOrio, state epidemiologist and interim chief of the ODH Bureau of Prevention and Health Promotion in statement. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said she could have had symptoms during that time. The TSA says an officer who patted down Vinson on October 13 in Cleveland has been placed on paid administrative leave ""out of an abundance of caution."" ""A Cleveland Hopkins International Airport Transportation Security Administration Officer who conducted a routine pat-down of a traveler later reported to be infected with Ebola consulted with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,"" the TSA said in a statement.  ""No Cleveland TSA officer came in direct contact with the infected traveler, as all pat downs are completed while employees are wearing disposable medical gloves,"" the statement continued. The TSA holds firm that the employee is not reporting any symptoms and was instructed by CDC to self-monitor over the next few days, as a precautionary measure. DiOrio told reporters that 87 state residents in the flights were self-monitoring for symptoms of Ebola. The CDC would like people who were on either flight to get in touch with them to answer some questions and potentially undergo monitoring, although it says the risk to anyone was extremely low. But Frontier, as an extra precaution, included anyone who had been on subsequent flights that used the same plane as the one on her return  flight. Frontier has also taken that plane out of service. Ohio Gov. John Kasich went so far on Saturday as calling for a travel ban for countries affected by the deadly Ebola outbreak. No Ohio airport currently has direct flights to or from the affected nations in West  Africa. ""I would say I think it makes sense to have (a) ban in place,"" he told reporters. ""The President of the United States has to make that call. He has to listen to many different people. And I have no doubt in my mind they're considering this now.""

"Poet Amiri Baraka, who lost his post as New Jersey's poet laureate because of a controversial poem about the 9/11 terror attacks, died Thursday, his agent said.  Baraka was 79. Baraka, considered a founder of the 1960s Black Arts movement, died in New Jersey's  Beth Israel Medical Center after a short illness, according to agent Celeste Bateman. His official website said that Baraka ""adopted a confrontational style for his poetry, drama, fiction and essays. With intent to create awareness about the concerns of African-Americans, his writings ... on one hand have been praised as a voice against oppression, on the other hand, have also incited controversies."" A self-described ""poet icon and revolutionary political activist,"" he was named poet laureate by then-Gov. James McGreevey, on the recommendation of the state's Council for the Arts, in 2002. Two months after his appointment, Baraka read the poem ""Somebody Blew Up America"" before a local arts festival. Among the poem's lines: . ""Who knew the World Trade Center was gonna get bombed . ""Who told 4000 Israeli workers at the Twin Towers . ""To stay home that day . ""Why did Sharon stay away?"" Despite the public outrage over a poem suggesting that Jewish workers had advance notice of the terror attacks,  McGreevey did not have the legal authority to fire the poet from his appointed $10,000-a-year post. Baraka refused the governor's request to resign, saying his work was neither anti-Semitic nor racist.  The position was eliminated by the New Jersey legislature in July 2003. In an open letter after the vote, Baraka called it a ""confirmation of the ignorance, corruption, racism, and criminal disregard for the U.S. Constitution."" He unsuccessfully sued the state of New Jersey over the matter. A federal appeals court wrote in rejecting his complaint: ""Baraka, like any person, was free to speak his views. But he had no protected legal interest in the maintenance of the position of poet laureate of New Jersey."" ""Amiri Baraka believed poetry to be a process of discovery of one's inner feelings,"" his website said.  ""Like the projectivist poets, he has always been of the opinion that the poetic writings should follow the shape of writer's own breath.

"(CNN) -- The Senate on Thursday passed its version of the health care bill, inching the country closer to the biggest expansion of medical coverage since Medicare was enacted more than four decades ago. Senate Democrats declared victory after the 60-39 party line vote, but one of the most complicated tasks is still ahead. A conference committee must reconcile the differences -- notably a public option, how to pay for the plan that emerges, and coverage for abortion -- and merge them into one. The House and Senate will then have to pass the revised plan before it can be sent to President Obama's desk. Each chamber needs a simple majority vote for final passage. Although the House won't be in session until January 12, House staff will begin working through the differences on the two chambers' bills, according to several Democratic aides. Leaders and committee chairmen will return in early January for health care meetings. South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said the House and Senate bills are in some ways ""irreconcilable."" Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele scoffed at the idea of negotiations. ""There won't be a legitimate conference. The House members are being told to accept whatever the Senate bill comes up with,"" he said on a conference call. But Democrats and the White House insist the bill that comes out of the conference will represent a huge step forward for health care reform. Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, agrees that the final bill will end up looking a lot like what came out of the Senate. ""Are they dramatically different in some key respects? Yes. But you can reconcile two bills by picking one over the other,"" Ornstein said. ""The question that remains is can they get 218 House Democrats to swallow the Kaopectate, which means basically to swallow hard and accept something that is basically the product of the Senate,"" he said. The House might be able to make changes around the margins, but that will be it, Ornstein said. The biggest difference between the two bills is the public option. The House bill has one; the Senate bill does not. The Senate bill originally included a government-sponsored plan with the option for states to opt out, but that was dropped as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid tried to secure the votes of moderate Democrats. The Senate bill instead allows nonprofit private insurers to offer coverage with approval of the Office of Personnel Management, which oversees the federal employees' health plan. In asking House Democrats to give up the public option, ""the argument that is going to be made here to House Democrats is, 'Do you want a health bill or do you want nothing?' "" Ornstein said. Given the reality that there weren't the necessary 60 votes in the Senate for a public option, there wasn't much discussion among House leaders about pushing hard for the Senate to include one in its bill. ""They [the Senate] tried to see if they had support for it. There isn't. That's the reality,"" a top Democratic leadership aide told CNN. ""I think a lot of people are coming to terms with that and I don't know how productive it would be to bring it out again."" Another sticking point is coverage for abortion. A late compromise in the House led to the adoption of the Stupak-Pitts amendment, which bans most abortion coverage from the public option. It would also prohibit abortion coverage in private policies available in the exchange to people receiving federal subsidies. A similar amendment introduced by Sen. Ben Nelson failed in the Senate. To get Nelson's vote, a compromise was reached that allows states to choose whether to ban abortion coverage in health plans offered in the insurance exchanges. Individuals purchasing plans through the exchanges would have to pay for abortion coverage with their own money. As lawmakers work to merge the bills, there will be no other option than to pick the Nelson compromise, Ornstein said. The real question is whether or not Democratic Rep. Bart Stupak ""tries to lead an insurgent group of pro-life Democrats away from the bill as a result of a compromise,"" he added. The House and Senate bills also conflict on how to pay for the plans. The House plan is projected to guarantee coverage for 96 percent of Americans at a cost of more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The Senate plan is projected to cover 94 percent of Americans with an $871 billion price tag over the next 10 years, according to the CBO. The House plan pays for health care reform with a 5.4 percent surtax on incomes for those making over $500,000 a year, as well as families earning more than $1 million. It also includes a 2.5 percent tax on medical devices sold in the United States. The Senate plan increases the Medicare payroll tax on individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning more than $250,000 from the current 1.45 percent to 2.35 percent. The Senate bill also imposes a new tax on insurers that provide so-called ""Cadillac"" health plans valued at more than $8,500 for individuals and $23,000 for families. The 40 percent tax would be on the value of the plan. In addition, it imposes a 10 percent tax on indoor tanning salon treatments. Both bills call for cutting hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare and Medicaid. Ornstein said the funding mechanism is one area where the House might be able to pull some weight. How to handle illegal immigrants could pose another obstacle as lawmakers iron out their differences. The House bill mandates insurance coverage for illegal immigrants and allows illegal immigrants to enroll in the public option and to buy private coverage in the national insurance exchange, but prohibits government subsidies for such private coverage. The Senate plan exempts illegal immigrants from the health coverage mandate, and prohibits illegal immigrants from participating in the insurance exchanges. Despite the differences, Ornstein predicts a bill will likely come out of conference quickly, although it won't be a smooth process. ""Part of the reason they are going to jump up and scream in outrage is, once you get down to the point where you need every vote, as we saw with the Senate example, it's a great way to extract favors."" CNN's Tom Cohen, Alan Silverleib and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.","Conference committee must merge House, Senate bills .

"Dubai's 828-meter Burj Khalifa has less than a year left as the world's tallest building. China's projected 838-meter (2,749 feet) Sky City broke ground in Changsha in central China on July 20. Astonishingly, the construction company behind it expects to top out in April 2014 -- a build time of just 10 months. It took five years to build the Burj Khalifa. Fast construction claims from Broad Group, the Changsha-based construction company in charge of the build, have elicited strong reactions from China's ""netizens,"" as well as experts. ""The speed is horrifying, how can that be possible?"" said one user on Weibo, China's Twitter-like service. Another criticized the liveability of the homes within, calling the project a ""giant stack of trailer homes."" But the building would appear to herald a new age in Chinese construction, one in which tall, fast builds become common. It's already difficult to keep track of China's tallest building announcements. China's race for the sky . Other projects under construction in China include: . • Shanghai Tower, Shanghai (632 meters, completion in 2014) • Goldin Finance 117, Tianjin (597 meters, completion in 2015) • Ping An Finance Center, Shenzhen (660 meters, completion in 2016) • Greenland Center, Wuhan (636 meters, completion in 2017) • Golden Rooster Tower, Suzhou (700 meters, yet to be confirmed) More than 10 cities in China are planning to build something taller than the 541-meter (1,775 feet) One World Trade Center, the United States' tallest building due to open early 2014 in New York City, according to the ""2012 China Skyscraper Report"" by Chinese architecture website motiancity.com. The site, which defines ""skyscrapers"" as buildings taller than 152 meters (498 feet), also reports that China currently has 470 skyscrapers, 332 under construction and 516 planned but unconfirmed. That means by 2022 China could have a total of 1,318 buildings higher than 152 meters, more than twice than expected in the United States. Last year, real estate data company Emporis reported that half of the 10 tallest buildings under construction worldwide are in China. Sky City will cost RMB 9 billion ($1.46 billion) to build. According to Broad Group CEO Yue Zhang, the building is meant to save on energy and land. The group says the 202-story, 1.05 million-square-meter building will keep at least 2,000 cars off of Changsha city streets by creating an environment no one needs to leave. The tower will house more than 30,000 people alongside a shopping mall, school, hospital, office areas, roof garden, amusement park, sports facilities, organic farm and a 10-kilometer ""walking street"" that will run from the first to the 170th floor. ""Residents don't need to step out of the building, they can do everything within it,"" said Zhang. Safety concerns . Some are worried the building could be vulnerable to safety hazards, due to the unconventional construction technique devised by Broad Group. That ""fast-building technology"" allowed the group to put up a 30-story tower in 15 days in 2011, and a 15-story hotel within six days a year earlier. VIDEO: See a hotel built in six days . Zhi Yin, head of Beijing Tsinghua Urban Planning Academy, told Xinhua, China's government-sanctioned media body, that Sky City would be ""either a marvel or a hoax."" According to Yin, Broad Group's Sky City is an experiment, he claims, that still needs a practical test. Yin Lu, an architect from Baojia Group, expressed concerns to Xinhua about subsidence when the building gets higher. Broad Group emphasized that relevant authorities have approved the building as safe. Super-fast construction method . The construction technique is simple, according to the company. Some 20,000 workers in BSB's offsite factory produce thousands of prefabricated steel-and-concrete blocks, 60 square meters in size, over four months. These blocks are transported to the location, hoisted and packed into position to make up the final structure over two months, at a rate of three stories a day. Another four months are needed to complete the internal construction. Broad Group has applied this method to more than 30 of their buildings. There remains a certain amount of skepticism about the feasibility of the project from Chinese public and experts. The world should know the truth early next year.","Sky City broke ground July 20, will top out in April 2014 .

"Inspectors overseeing efforts to destroy Syria's chemical weapons have examined one more site in the war-torn country, leaving only one to go. The joint mission between the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations has verified 22 of the 23 sites disclosed by Damascus, the mission announced Thursday. Report: Syria peace conference won't happen before December . The latest site, in Aleppo, was one of two that could not be visited earlier for safety reasons, the mission said in a statement. ""As per the declaration by Syria, the site was confirmed as dismantled and long abandoned with the building showing extensive battle damage,"" the statement said. But while the inspection progresses, the United States is looking at new classified intelligence suggesting that Syria might not fully declare its chemical weapons stockpile, CNN has learned. The intelligence is not definitive, but ""there are various threads of information that would shake our confidence,"" one U.S. official said. ""They have done things recently that suggest Syria is not ready to get rid of all their chemical weapons."" CNN has spoken to several U.S. officials with access to the latest intelligence on Syria, who confirmed the information. All declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the data. U.S. intelligence agencies, the Defense Department, the State Department and White House are all reviewing the information.","Inspectors reached a site that could not be visited earlier for safety reasons .

"It's a question many people inside Iran -- and those who watch the country closely around the world -- were asking Wednesday: Who is killing nuclear scientists in Iran? An explosion on Wednesday killed Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan, a top official at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant, Iranian officials said. He is the third man identified as a nuclear scientist to be killed in Iran in a mysterious explosion in the past two years.  A fourth survived an assassination attempt. In each case, someone placed a bomb under the scientist's car. Iranian officials, on state-run media, blame Israel and the United States. ""I want to categorically deny any United States involvement in any kind of act of violence inside Iran,"" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Wednesday. ""We believe there has to be an understanding between Iran, its neighbors and the international community that finds a way forward for it to end its provocative behavior, end its search for nuclear weapons and rejoin the international community and be a productive member of it,"" she said. While Israel generally refuses to comment on accusations and speculation , Brig. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, a spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, said on his Facebook page Wednesday, ""I have no idea who targeted the Iranian scientist but I certainly don't shed a tear."" Mickey Segal, a former director of the Iranian department in the Israel Defense Forces' Intelligence Branch, told Israel Army Radio that Wednesday's attack was part of broader pressure being brought to bear on President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's regime.  ""Many bad things have been happening to Iran in the recent period. Iran is in a situation where pressure on it is mounting, and the latest assassination joins the pressure that the Iranian regime is facing,"" Segal said. With no one claiming responsibility, the killings remain shrouded in mystery.  Iran experts contacted by CNN could only speculate. ""The most likely contender among people who are following this is that the Israelis are doing it, possibly in cooperation with the Iranian mujahedin,"" said Trita Parsi, president of the National Iranian-American Council and author of the book ""A Single Roll of the Dice: Obama's Diplomacy with Iran."" ""There's almost no downside for Israel,"" he said.  The killings ""take out nuclear assets and embarrass Iran"" by showing that the regime can't prevent such attacks, Parsi said.  And ""if Iran retaliates with a violent act, then Israel can point to it as a reason to take military action against the regime."" Michael Rubin, resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, agrees that Israeli involvement is the most ""plausible"" scenario.  And Mark Hibbs, senior associate with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, also said the way the attacks took place ""would be consistent"" with the possibility of Israel acting with cooperation inside Iran. Parsi told CNN he does not believe the killings are the work of the United States, and said they do not match the kind of activity U.S. intelligence would carry out in a country with which there is no declared state of war. Rubin agreed, and gave a different reason.  ""Frankly, I don't think the United States has the human intelligence knowledge,"" he said. The United States and Israel have been the most vocal opponents of Iran's nuclear program, although numerous countries have expressed serious concern as well.  Iran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian energy purposes. If Israel is cooperating with the Mujahedin-e-Khalq (MEK) to carry out attacks on Iranian nuclear officials, it faces a significant risk, Parsi argues.  The United States lists the MEK as a terrorist group.  ""Israel is a victim of terrorism and pressing other states to take measures against terrorism,"" Parsi noted.  If it turns out to be collaborating with a group on the U.S. list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, Israel's efforts to get other countries to crack down on terrorist groups could be damaged. MEK, an Iranian opposition group, has support from some members of Congress who say it should be removed from the terrorist list. Several analysts said they are certain that, whoever is organizing the killings, Iranians are involved. If Iranian leaders had a ""clue"" who is behind the killings, ""they'd have stopped this by now,"" said Daniel Serwer, Middle East Scholar with Johns Hopkins University.  ""The incredible thing is that it continues.  That suggests it is Iranians doing the deeds, no matter who is the sponsor.  Foreigners are under pretty tight scrutiny in Iran these days."" But Hibbs, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said he believes Israeli agents could be inside Iran. Whoever's behind the attacks knows who the nuclear officials are, and the specifics of their travel plans.  That could be foreign governments with intelligence assets in Iran, Hibbs said. But it's also ""conceivable this could be carried out by Iranians who oppose the government even without the support of outside governments,"" Hibbs said. The nuclear program ""is a centerpiece for Iran, a very, very important aspect for this regime,"" he said.  Groups inside Iran dedicated to overthrowing the regime would have reason to target the program, he said.  ""This is a program which is right at the heart of the legitimacy of this government."" Rubin, of the American Enterprise Institute, said there is another ""plausible"" explanation: that ""Arab intelligence services"" are involved. ""The assumption that many Americans have that the Mossad,"" Israel's foreign intelligence unit, ""is the most skilled intelligence service"" in the Middle East is ""a couple of decades out of date,"" he said. Some intelligence services in the Arab world ""could have recruited Shiites"" in the region, potentially in Iraq, to take action against the nuclear program, he said. There is also some speculation that the Iranian regime itself could have been involved in at least one of the killings. The first, in January 2010, left university professor and nuclear scientist Massoud Ali Mohammadi dead in a car bomb.  That attack came shortly after major riots against the regime, and many people thought the regime was behind that killing, Parsi said. Mohammadi ""did not seem to be a particularly valuable nuclear target,"" he said.   Some reports suggested Mohammadi was an outspoken supporter of the ""green movement,"" and had helped organize protests, Parsi said. But the man killed in November 2010, Majid Shahriari, and the one who survived an assassination attempt at the time, Fereydoon Abbasi Davani, were a different story.  It ""would make no sense for the Iranians to assassinate them,"" Parsi said.  ""They were critical nuclear assets."" No matter who is behind them, the attacks do not seem to be reversing Iran's efforts, said Parsi.  ""Arguably, the incentive for the Iranians to go forward with what they have has grown, because now they're under such critical threat,"" he said. But there are suggestions that the overall pressure being applied against Iran, including international sanctions, for its failure to cooperate on nuclear issues is making some scientists wary of adding their efforts.  Iran's semi-official Fars news agency earlier this week quoted Davani, now the head of Iran's nuclear program, describing as ""deserters"" in a ""scientific war"" the ""scientists who, for the sake of preserving their international connections, refuse to cooperate in (our) nuclear projects."" The killings of Iranian scientists have come up on the campaign trail in the United States among contenders for the Republican presidential nomination.  Newt Gingrich, at a debate in November, expressed support for the idea of ""taking out their scientists.""  Rick Santorum, at an event in October, referred to the scientists turning up dead as ""a wonderful thing."" Roshan's killing comes amid growing tensions between Iran and the West.  U.S. officials say the international sanctions on Iran have taken a toll.  Iran earlier this week sentenced a U.S. ex-Marine to death on charges of espionage, despite statements by him, his family, and the U.S. government that he is not a spy.","U.S. Secretary of State Clinton categorically denies any involvement in Iran .

"Qatar's ruler handed over the reins of the tiny but influential Persian Gulf nation to his son Tuesday -- a development seen as remarkable for several reasons. Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's decision to cede power willingly is a first in the modern history of the region. The norm is for Gulf leaders to rule for decades until their death or until circumstances conspire to overthrow them, such as the Arab Spring uprisings that toppled leaders in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya. Sheikh Hamad himself came to power in 1995 by overthrowing his father in a bloodless coup. The second reason Tuesday's transition is historic is because the son, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, now becomes the youngest monarch in the region. He is 33. While the timing of the handover was unexpected, Sheikh Tamim has been heir apparent for the past decade and was appointed deputy commander-in-chief of Qatar's armed forces. He was educated in Britain, first at private school and later at Sandhurst military academy, also attended by Britain's Princes William and Harry, from which he graduated 15 years ago. Sheikh Hamad made the announcement in a televised speech on Tuesday, a national holiday. ""God only knows I never wanted power for personal reasons and I never sought power for any personal motive,"" the outgoing emir said. ""It is all about the best interest of the nation that made us decide that it is time to start a new page in our history where the new generations take over with their great qualifications and ground-breaking ideas."" The outgoing emir is 61 and appears to be in good health. The energy-rich emirate has backed Syrian rebels in their fight against the Bashar al-Assad regime, and Taliban militants have set up an office there amid diplomacy to end the Afghan war. The prestigious soccer World Cup will be held there in 2022. Sheikh Tamim was involved in the bid to bring the tournament to Qatar, as well as heading his country's Olympic Committee since 2000. Opinion: Qatar changes leaders, now can it start reforms? Unusual power transfer . Jamie Ingram, a Middle East analyst at IHS Global Insight, said that while Sheikh Tamim had been groomed for power for some time, especially over the past two years, it was still a surprise to see the handover come so soon. ""In terms of modern Gulf Arab states, this is very significant. It's the first time in recent history we have seen such a transfer of power from a living monarch to the next generation,"" he said. It's also a marked contrast to what is happening in Saudi Arabia, he said, where the rulers are quite reluctant to hand over leadership to the next generation. The transfer of power is unlikely to lead to major policy changes, at least initially, said Ingram, since Sheikh Hamad would have been unlikely to hand it over unless his son was ""capable and willing to take Qatar down a broadly similar path."" But Ingram predicts that Sheikh Tamim is likely to focus more on domestic issues than Qatar's international role to start with. His father worked to ""put Qatar on the map"" by extending its network of alliances and influence to counter the sway of its powerful neighbors, Iran and Saudi Arabia, he said. But how greatly it will be involved in Syria under Sheikh Tamim ""is the big question,"" said Ingram, since Qatar has already started to pull back on that front and let Saudi Arabia take a lead. Critics have suggested Qatar gives too much support to Islamists in Syria, Egypt and elsewhere, he said. Qatar's huge foreign investment program will probably continue under Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim Al Thani, Qatar's prime minister and foreign minister, although his future role is unclear, he added. The Syrian National Council, a prominent opposition group, congratulated Qatar on what it described as a ""pioneering and unprecedented step that gives the Arab Spring an additional big boost."" The council's statement also praised the outgoing emir for his hard work and vision for the region, adding that it is ""confident that the ever evolving Qatar with its new young leadership will always align itself with the rights of the Syrian people."" In a White House statement, U.S. President Barack Obama welcomed Sheikh Tamim to his new role, saying Qatar was an ""important partner"" and paying tribute to his father's leadership. ""The United States looks forward to working with Sheikh Tamim to deepen the ties between our two countries, and to continue our close partnership on issues of mutual interest,"" Obama said. Reaction on social media . Social media has been abuzz over the news of the power transfer, with people thanking Sheikh Hamad for his efforts. One tweeter said, ""U changed a tiny desert hamlet to a powerful economic empire. Deeply indebted."" Another said, ""I have watched Qatar become an economic, sports, education and political leader. #ThankyouHamad for everything. You will always be in our hearts."" UK Foreign Secretary William Hague also chimed in, tweeting, ""Historic day for Qatar as the new generation takes over."" Sheikh Hamad was probably motivated by the desire for an orderly transition, having seen close-up what can happen if an older generation clings to power or an impatient crown prince plots a coup, said Ingram. However, Sheikh Tamim's youth ""doesn't mean that he will be more open to democratic reforms,"" as some might hope, he cautioned. ""His age is largely irrelevant to a conservative mindset. Nothing is proven yet -- we shall have to wait and see what line he will take.""","President Barack Obama says he hopes for close ties with the new emir .

"Boulder City, Nevada (CNN) -- Driving across the stark Nevada desert at 75 miles an hour, you don't expect to find much. Craggy mountains tower above scrubby brown plains with only hints of scattered green. Sometimes, a tumbleweed, like a lost extra from an old Western movie, skips across the road. Then, off in the distance, I see something shiny. More than shiny; it is positively gleaming. This is my first glimpse of what is billed as the largest solar cell field in the country. It is hard to say if the claim is true, since these things are being built so quickly in so many places now. But it is impressive: row after row after row of black glass panels tilted toward the sun, quietly soaking energy from the sky. ""Right now, we have about a million panels,"" says Scott Crider with Sempra Energy, a California-based energy resources company. ""This facility will power about 14,000 average homes on an annual basis."" And that's just the start. Sempra has big designs on being a major player in the green energy game. But as the wind whips through my hair and I study the immense emptiness all around, I can't help but ask, ""Why is this such a good location for such a thing?"" ""First, there is a lot of available, flat land,"" Crider says. ""Second, it is incredibly sunny. This region gets about 330 days of sunshine per year. And third, there's existing transmission lines which provide access to major markets throughout the western United States."" Which, as is so often the case, raises another question: Why are those lines way out here? To find that answer, you have to drive 20 minutes to struggling Boulder City, population about 16,000. The town is uniquely poised to cash in on the new energy boom precisely because it was built on old energy technology; during another time when the economy and energy collided; when thousands of jobless men came here during the Great Depression to undertake an unprecedented power-generating project. ""This town is here because it was a federal reservation to build Hoover Dam."" That's Duncan McCoy. He's a member of the city council and has a background in history. He has watched his town get hammered by the recession. Tourists aren't coming to the dam just east of town like they once did. The value of local houses has plunged. ""Our local sales tax revenue is down,"" he says, shaking his head. ""That's a major portion of our budget. Our property tax revenues are down."" But bring up the solar facility and he brightens, because it has opened a gateway from his town's past into the future. The solar plant provided several hundred temporary construction jobs when it was built, and it has created a handful of permanent positions, since. More importantly, it is bringing desperately needed money to city coffers. Fifteen years ago, the town bought up vast amounts of land to protect itself from the sprawling reach of neighboring Las Vegas. As luck would have it, the purchase included all the land around the big transmission lines leading to the dam, and now, they are leasing that property to Sempra and others who want to tap into them. ""This year, we'll get about two-and-a-half million dollars. That's about 11 percent of our city's general fund budget,"" McCoy says. ""That's pretty important money, and we can count on it."" They can probably count on more as well. Back at the solar field, Crider makes it clear that this is only the start. ""There is strong demand for cleaner sources of energy, and we're going to help fill that niche."" Sempra is not alone. Nevada is aggressively courting more solar firms, convinced that if they can get enough into place, the whole state can benefit from being a major green energy source for neighboring super state California. Of course, other states such as Arizona and New Mexico are thinking the same thing. For the folks in Boulder City, however, that's a worry for another day. They know their dark days are far from past. But right now, the sun is shining, and just as it was when they built the dam so long ago, that's a start.","Boulder City, Nevada, a small town near the Hoover Dam, has declining tax revenues .

"The room exploded in cheers when it was announced that the Denza electric car would sell for RMB 369,000 ($59,100), at the Beijing Auto Show earlier this week. A joint venture between German giant, Daimler, and Chinese electric vehicle makers, BYD, the Denza is the latest car to take advantage of China's push to put more green vehicles on its roads. It will start selling in September. Denza's affordable price places it at the opposite end of the market from its competitor, Tesla, another China-focused green model that is twice the cost at RMB 734,000 ($117,500). The government is helping to boost Denza's attractiveness with subsidies of up to RMB 120,000 that can be deducted from each vehicle, says Daimler. The move could bring China one-step closer to widespread adoption of green wheels. The issue of pricing, however, isn't the largest obstacle to selling electric vehicles in China. Consumers say their cities are lacking a well-established battery-charging infrastructure. Green cool . To combat escalating levels of air pollution, the Chinese government is promoting low-emission vehicles to the average driver, and has set a target of putting five million electric cars on the road by 2020. Many incentives are in place to encourage consumers to adopt green car technology, such as a RMB 60,000 cash handout to buyers of electric cars. Despite this, most drivers are still hesitant to go green. Less than 7,000 electric and hybrid vehicles were sold in the first quarter of 2014. Convenience, affordability, and style still trump environmental concerns for most of China's young car buyers. ""I am afraid I will run out of electricity on the road and get stranded,"" says Zhao Bi, a thirty-something fashion designer who lives in China's capital. Electric vehicle makers will typically install a charging station at a driver's home, so cars can fuel up overnight. Drivers worry that would make trips beyond their nine-to-five routine impossible. ""I was thinking of owning a Tesla. It is cool, eco-friendly, and high-speed,"" says Wang Yiquan, a 27-year-old media professional also living in Beijing. Wang has been driving a Volkswagen Passat for the past two years. He is looking for a smaller car that will make parking easier, but he's also looking for a ""younger and cooler"" brand of car to be seen in. As a Beijing resident, Wang must apply for a license plate through a lottery system designed to limit the number of cars on the road. However, Daimler says its Denza will be exempt from this system and buyers in Shanghai and Shenzhen can even get free license plates. In the end, Wang decided not to buy an electric car this year -- like many of his peers. ""I just don't see charging stations in or outside of Beijing,"" says the driver. Electrifying network . There are signs that this will all change soon in China. The national electricity supplier, the State Grid Corporation, has built 19,000 electric vehicle charging piles and 400 charging stations by the end of 2013. It also said in March that it is open to working with private investors in developing fast-charging stations for electric vehicles. The Beijing municipal government also said earlier this month that 12 property developers have signed an agreement to co-operate with car companies in installing charging facilities at residential buildings and shopping malls. Independent of the State Grid Corporation, Tesla is boosting consumer confidence with a promise to build a network of several hundred charging stations and service centers across the nation, the premium vehicle's CEO, Elon Musk, said while handing over the keys to his first eight Chinese buyers in Beijing on Tuesday. If these measures succeed, China's green roads revolution may be just on the horizon.","Denza is an affordable electric vehicle that taps the Chinese mass market .

"It started in 1996 as a crazy idea to ring in the new year, but police nearly shut it down. ""They said, 'We have an idea: Let's do a shoe drop. ... We made this shoe for you,'"" recalled Gary ""Sushi"" Marion, the star of a weekly drag queen review in Key West. ""'You've got to sit in it for New Year's Eve,' and I said 'OK,' and that is how it started."" So, on New Year's Eve, Marion took center stage inside a massive high-heeled red shoe made out of chicken wire, paper mache and plywood, dangling off the roof of the Bourbon Street Pub along Key West's main street. Just like the spectacular ball in New York's Times Square, the shoe would be lowered with each final minute of the year until the clock struck midnight. Crowds started to gather, attracting the attention of police, who tried to shut down the event because the pub owner didn't have a permit. ""(The police) came upstairs to the balcony and told me to get out of the shoe,"" Marion said. ""The owner called the mayor and the mayor was like, 'Leave Sushi alone, close down the street.' "" Today, Key West's annual ""shoe drop"" still stars Marion as Sushi -- in a better-constructed shoe -- and now attracts attention from around the world. Your best moments of 2012 . The Bourbon Street Pub festivities were once the place for the gay community to ring in the new year.  Today, the crowd is a mixture of tourists and locals from every walk of life. ""You'll have older gay men next to a family with kids, next to guys in leather, next to a bunch of rowdy bachelorettes,"" Marion said. ""Everybody's welcome."" Each year, Marion makes a special dress for the show, which he wears only once. His outfit is a tightly kept secret until he takes the stage as Sushi on New Year's Eve. ""They sneak her in the back and it's a big deal,"" said fellow drag queen Richmond Arcie. ""No one really sees the dress until she's right in the shoe."" Marion said he spends months looking through fashion magazines and watching couture fashion shows, getting inspiration from famous designers. ""I try to make it really elaborate, one of a kind, something you haven't seen before,"" he said. He said his dress this year will be fluorescent green, ""like a palm tree exploded -- very tropical."" After ringing in 2013, Marion will put the dress in storage along with the 15 others from new years past. ""She gives her all to the dress and to the public that night,"" Arcie said. ""She puts her best face forward and foot forward for this event."" It takes Marion two hours to transform into Sushi: an hour applying makeup, a half-hour getting into the dress and another half-hour preparing his wig. ""Once you get your face on, your lashes, your lips and your dress, you're creating somebody different,"" Marion said. The street in front of Bourbon Street Pub is closed to traffic to accommodate the crowds. While they wait for Marion as Sushi, a live musical dance and impersonation show is performed on a stage in front of the bar. ""At 11 o'clock, Sushi arrives, and we lower the shoe and put her in it, then raise her up,"" said pub owner Joey Schroeder. Over the next hour, Marion as Sushi is lowered 20 feet down inside the fire-engine red shoe made of fiberglass and stainless steel. The shoe is a size 8 -- feet, that is -- with a 4-foot-high heel. ""It is very stable and secure,"" Schroeder said. That hasn't always been the case. ""It rained the second year, and my foot went through the bottom of it and I was like,'You guys have to make me a new shoe,' "" Marion recalled. "" '(Otherwise) I'm not going to sit in it.' "" Marion said the months of preparation for the hourlong show, and the potential danger of being dangled in midair, is all worth it because it allows him to represent the gay community and the city of Key West. ""Every year she says, 'This is my last year,' "" Schroeder said, ""and I say, 'Oh Sushi, you are going to be the old lady in the shoe.'

"The U.S. Department of Education is legally prohibited from having any control over curriculum or instruction in the nation's public schools, but nonetheless Secretary of Education Arne Duncan is a zealous advocate of the new Common Core standards for students' proficiency in English and math. First, he said their critics were members of extremist groups, and he recently assailed the parents who criticize them as ""white suburban moms who — all of a sudden — their child isn't as brilliant as they thought they were, and their school isn't quite as good as they thought they were."" His remarks were prompted by the nearly unanimous outrage expressed by parents -- moms and dads -- at public forums in suburban districts in New York, following the release of the abysmal results of the new Common Core tests. The parents weren't angry because they found out their child wasn't brilliant, but because most were told by the state that their children were failures. Only 31% of the state's students in grades third through eighth passed or exceeded the new tests. Among students who are English-language learners, only 3% passed the English standards; among students with disabilities, only 5% passed them; among black and Hispanic students, fewer than 20% passed. The numbers for math were better, but not by much. The high failure rate did not happen because the students are dumb, but because the state chose to set an unrealistic passing mark. The state commissioner knew before any student had taken the test that only 30% or so would pass; that is where the state commissioner set the passing mark. Duncan likes to boast that the Common Core standards were adopted by 45 states, but neglects to mention that the states were required to adopt ""college-and-career-ready standards"" to be eligible for $4.35 billion in the education secretary's signature program called Race to the Top. Some states adopted them without seeing a finished draft. The standards, unfortunately, were never field-tested. No one knew in advance whether they would improve achievement or depress it, whether they would widen or narrow the achievement gap among children of different races. It is hard to imagine a major corporation releasing a new product nationwide without first testing it among consumers to see if it is successful. But that is what happened with the Common Core standards. Experts in early childhood education say the standards for young children are developmentally inappropriate. Teachers say that they have not had the training or resources to teach the new standards. Field-testing would have ironed out many of the bugs, but promoters of the standards insisted on fast implementation. No one yet has estimated the costs of shifting from state standards to national standards. Duncan awarded $350 million to develop new tests for the new standards, but all of the testing will be done online. Los Angeles intends to spend $1 billion on iPads for the Common Core Techology Project, designed to help prepare for the standards. If that is the cost to only one district, how many billions will schools across the nation pay for software and hardware and bandwidth for Common Core testing? This will be a bonanza for the technology industry, but will put a strain on public school budgets in a time of austerity. The Common Core standards emphasize critical thinking and reasoning. It is time for public officials to demonstrate critical thinking and to stop the rush to implementation and do some serious field-testing. It is time to fix the standards that don't work in real classrooms with real students. It is time to stop testing students on material they have not been taught. American students take more tests than students in any other nation. Our dependence on standardized testing has become excessive. Standards alone can't right everything that needs fixing in American education, and some experts, like Tom Loveless at Brookings Institution, say they will make little or no difference in student achievement. Public officials should listen to the moms and dads. This is a democracy, and it is not the role of public officials to impose their grand ideas without the consent of the governed.","Diane Ravitch: Education department should not push Common Core standards .

"(CNN) -- Alabama authorities on Wednesday released a rough timeline of a gunman's rampage in the southern part of the state on Tuesday. All times are Central Daylight. Glass from a door is broken at a True Value Hardware store in  southern Alabama. Before 3:30 p.m.: Michael McLendon, 28, fatally shoots his mother, Lisa White McLendon, and her four dogs and sets fire to her Kinston, Alabama, home. ""We knew that he liked guns,"" said Kenneth Smith, a neighbor of McLendon's. ""Every couple of weekends or so we could hear gunshots out in his backyard. Just bam, bam, bam. A lot of shooting."" About 3:45 p.m.: McLendon takes rampage to nearby town of Samson, Alabama. He kills 5 people on his uncle's porch, including 3 relatives and the wife and child of a sheriff's deputy. ""My reaction is, my neighbors got shot, my friends got shot, something's wrong -- go check if there's anybody alive,"" said neighbor Alina Knowles, who rescued the 3-month-old daughter of Deputy Josh Myers from the porch. ""I ran over there to see if there were any survivors, heard the baby, picked her up,"" she said. ""What I saw, there were no words for it. There is no describing what I saw."" ""This is a very tight-knit neighborhood. All the neighbors around here are a family,"" said Myers, father to Corrine Gracy, 18 months, and husband to Andrea Myers, 31, both victims of the shooting. ""Every day she was up on the porch talking with neighbors just like they were family to us. She hardly knew anybody here to have enemies,"" he said. ""She was a super mom, Corinne Gracy was the sweetest thing in the world. I don't even know how to comprehend what's going on."" After 3:45 p.m.: McLendon fatally shoots his 74-year-old grandmother, who was standing in the doorway of her home next door. ""The whole community is still in shock,"" Samson Mayor Clay King said. ""I personally know everyone that is involved, both the shooter and the victims. And that makes it more difficult to have to deal with."" Before 4 p.m.: McLendon drives east on Highway 52, killing two and injuring two others while he fires into businesses and vehicles. ""We were all frightened,"" said Sandy Morris, who owns a hair salon in Samson.

"Tammy Baldwin made history Tuesday night -- twice. She became the first openly gay politician, and first Wisconsin woman, elected to the U.S. Senate. The seven-term Democratic congresswoman edged past former Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson in a win that advocacy groups hailed as a significant stride toward bringing diversity to the Senate. Baldwin said she ran ""to make a difference"" and not to make history. But she said she hopes the Senate will be more reflective of America and the ""life experience"" of women. ""Having a seat at the table matters and I think we will see a Senate that is more reflective of America. We're certainly not there yet, but this will be a change that moves us forward,"" she told CNN. ""People ... see our country and our states moving toward full equality in many respects,"" Baldwin said. ""When you have legislative bodies that look more like America, that happens."" Baldwin was one of many successful gay and lesbian candidates in local and state races this election cycle, which also included her successor in her legislative district in Madison, state Rep. Mark Pocan. At least 118 gay and lesbian candidates won their races as of Wednesday, according to political action committee Victory Fund, which supports gay and lesbian candidates. Political commentator Sally Kohn was ecstatic. ""This is a big day for gay women in America, and really, for all communities who aren't the typical straight, white, wealthy men elected to Congress,"" she said. Share your reaction to the election . There has never been an openly gay or lesbian member of the U.S. Senate, according to several LGBT advocacy groups. Baldwin is one of four openly gay House members of the 112 U.S. Congress, along with fellow Democrats Barney Frank of Massachusetts, David Cicilline of Rhode Island and Jared Polis of Colorado. ""For the LGBT person growing up in Wisconsin or anywhere across the country, seeing an openly gay woman who is able to rise up to become a senator in the U.S. Congress is an incredible role model,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. Though Baldwin's sexual orientation makes her victory notable, it rarely came up during the campaign, unless it was called a nonissue. The race pitted Thompson's ""conservative leadership"" platform against Baldwin's progressive agenda. Thompson, a four-time governor and secretary of Health and Human Services under George W. Bush, said he returned to politics to make America a better place for his grandchildren. ""I wanted to so much help lead back America,"" he said in his concession speech. ""To be the country of growth and opportunity. To build America for future generations. I certainly didn't need the job. And I guess I'm not going to get it."" What started as a long shot for Baldwin eventually narrowed to a close finish, with the born-and-raised Wisconsinite capturing 51% of the vote, according to CNN projections. ""This campaign has been run on who's the most qualified candidate and who has the best vision for the state,"" Griffin said. ""We're eager to have her move from one side of the Capitol to another and take a seat in the chamber as the first openly gay person."" Maryland, Maine approve same-sex marriage . To those watching the race, it was no surprise that Wisconsin, a state that approved a gay marriage ban six years ago, would send the first openly gay politician to the Senate. Baldwin has made no secret of her sexual orientation as she rose through local and state politics during the last two decades. When she was elected in 1998 to represent Wisconsin's second congressional district, she was the first out candidate to be elected to the chamber, said Chuck Wolfe, president and CEO of the Victory Fund, a political action committee that supported LGBT candidates including Baldwin this election. ""The electorate already knew what they needed to know about her, and they continued to elect her every step of the way,"" Wolfe said. ""She is a force with very deep roots in Wisconsin. She has a backbone of steel, but she's polite and compassionate, and people enjoy their interactions with her."" Born and raised in the Congressional district she has represented for the past decade, Baldwin's track record reflects a commitment to LGBT issues and diversity. As a Wisconsin representative, she was a co-founder and co-chairwoman of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, leading efforts to advance the Employment Non-Discrimination Act and other civil rights initiatives. She also led successful efforts in the House in 2009 to pass expanded hate crimes legislation and was the lead author of legislation to extend benefits to same-sex partners of federal employees. ""Tammy has been a driving force because of her ability to tackle issues without having to use double-speak,"" Wolfe said. ""Having someone like her in the Senate changes the tone and tenor of this discussion."" Democrats keep control of Senate . Others are hopeful that more women in Congress will change the discussion of policies affecting women and families. Women in the 112th Congress made up 17% of both the Senate and the House, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. ""A lot of research has shown that more women in leadership leads to better outcomes for the community,"" said Tiffany Dufu, president of The White House Project, which trains women for leadership. ""We know that women in political leadership reach across the aisle more often and are inclusive when it comes to taking constituents into consideration. They care deeply not just about the outcome, but the process,"" she said. ""For us, the biggest thing about Tammy Baldwin is her visibility. You can't be what you can't see.""

"(CNN) -- I keep my hands hovering in the space between an elevated lamp and a square white box that resembles a washing machine. At a signal, I make patterns with my hands, creating shadows that stretch out on the bright surface below, generating a cacophony of barking, as if a pack of dogs have been released into the East London basement. This is a meeting of the city's Music Hackspace, an offshoot of the London Hackspace, among the largest of over 1,000 such citizen workshops that populate the world from Brazil to Baghdad. Around a dozen keen members -- and 150 part-time - form the basis of this music chapter; designing, building and re-purposing instruments to suit ambitious creative projects. The 'washing machine' is one of eight home-made instruments the members have created that make up the 'Cave of Sounds', an installation inspired by prehistoric musical collaboration, which has exhibited in some of London's leading cultural institutions including the Victoria & Albert Museum and Barbican centre. Three of the instruments respond to physical movement, and another is activated by light. One produces sound through an accelerometer and gyroscope, and there is a sensor-filled hat operated by taps from a metallic glove. Trained percussionist and hackspace member Dominic Averso believes a new style of instrument is emerging from maker culture. ""The technology lowers the bar to participation, so it's easier to create with it. But the music may be more ephemeral than lasting -- there's a parallel to early jazz when it was very free and experimental."" Musical legacy . But Averso believes that there may be a lasting impact from instruments that interact with the listener. ""Future generations might think it's wacky to listen to the same song over and over again."" The collective have already made waves through Seaboard, a radically re-imagined keyboard, launched by London start-up ROLI with the work of several members. The instrument uses tactile sensations to create a more nuanced experience, allowing the user greater control of the volume, pitch, and timbre emanating from its rubber keys. The Seaboard has heavyweight support from the likes of Hans Zimmer, who demonstrated its use, and is now a shareholder. ""Evolution can be more responsive versions of existing instruments"", says Jean-Baptiste Thibaut, ROLI innovation manager and hackspace organizer. ""Digital music offers so much range and possibility but misses the familiarity of physical objects in your hand. Your body has so much expressive ability, so I think the future is combining the two."" This mode for innovation has been popular. The semi-finalists in Georgia Tech's prestigious musical instrument competition' included Chet Udell's augmented Trombone, complete with amplification and wireless sensors, and the eCorder that gives the woodwind staple a range of effects and data capture. Digital analogue . A contrasting approach has been to make computers behave like traditional instruments, as pioneered by UK band Hugs Bison. The musicians play heavily customized iPads, using touch screen interfaces, wireless sensing and a range of apps such as virtual instrument platform 'ThumbJam' to give performances along with the sound. ""I play very differently when there is touch"", says band member Shaun Blezard, comparing with his background in electronic music production. ""It feels like a real instrument rather than technology. You're more physically involved, you can bend and distort notes, and affect the sound more."" Blezard believes it's a method accessible to any beginner ""if they have a good ear"", and sees potential for large-scale, networked collaborations. Hobbyists have already shown the potential with a reworking of the ""Dr. Who"" theme, while the Göteborg Symphony Orchestra have delivered a symphony on iPhones. Emerging instruments can be even more available and adaptable than our smartphones. The 'Ototo' from London start-up Dentaku is a pocket-sized synthesizer that can turn any everyday object - from vegetables to furniture - into an instrument if the two are connected with simple cables. The user can then compose using the synthesizer's inputs and the object's own conductive properties (see video below. If reading on mobile, click here). Noisy shirt . A similar system has been adapted to create wearable instruments, as with the percussion jackets worn by America's Got Talent participant William Close, and even edible instruments, through ice-cream activated by the player's tongue. Analysts see a collective spirit as a common thread running through innovation in hacked instruments. ""It's partly about using technology to make people interact"", says Nick Sherrard, head of development, digital and communications at Sound and Music, the UK agency for new music. ""Anyone can play but typically it needs to be with others."" Sherrard believes such home-made instruments could have a broad appeal beyond the maker niche and be widely taken up by children, although as an accompaniment rather than a replacement for traditional instruments. ""Musicians that do one would do the other."" The analyst is most excited about ""music generated by interaction with living things"", and some epic projects have illustrated the potential of using the environment as an instrument. ""Living Symphonies"" is the result of two artists laboriously mapping a British forest over two years and creating a musical motif for each organism, a database which is then installed at the site so that the forest effectively plays - and interacts with - its own symphony. In 2013, MIT composer Tod Machover used thousands of crowd-sourced sound elements from the city of Edinburgh, drawing on everything from elevator conversation to overhead planes, to create a soundscape for the city's festival. The richness of audio data available from the environment also offers spectacular performance possibilities, to give the audience immersive, multi-sensory experiences. The classical virtuosos are not endangered yet, but regular concerts and instruments could begin to seem outdated before long. Read more from Make, Create, Innovate: .

"Thomas Eric Duncan left Africa for the United States, by official accounts, a healthy man. But within days after his arrival in Texas, things changed for him, for the worst. So who is Duncan, besides the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the United States? When did he start to feel sick, and what happened to him next? And who did he come in contact with, in the meantime? Your #EbolaQandA questions answered . Who is Thomas Eric Duncan? He is a 42-year-old Liberian citizen, said a friend who knows him well but asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of his case. Duncan's Facebook page indicates that he's from the Liberian capital of Monrovia, where he attended E. Jonathan Goodridge High School. Why did he come to the United States? To visit family and friends, according to the friend, who noted this was Duncan's first trip to America. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Thomas Frieden has said that Duncan was ""staying with family members who live in this country."" Duncan was visiting his son and his son's mother in Dallas, according to Wilfred Smallwood, Duncan's half-brother. When did Duncan leave Liberia? He departed the West African nation on September 19, Frieden says. How did he get Ebola? Authorities haven't said. Witnesses say Duncan had been helping Ebola patients in Liberia. Liberian community leader Tugbeh Chieh Tugbeh said Duncan was caring for an Ebola-infected patient at a residence in Paynesville City, just outside Monrovia. The New York Times reported Thursday that Duncan had direct contact with a pregnant woman stricken with Ebola on September 15, days before he left for the United States. Citing the woman's parents and Duncan's neighbors in Monrovia, Liberia, the newspaper said Duncan had helped carry the ailing woman home after a hospital turned her away because there wasn't enough space in its Ebola treatment ward. A CDC spokesman told CNN on Wednesday that he hadn't seen the newspaper's report and couldn't comment. Was he screened for Ebola before getting on the plane? Yes, according to Binyah Kesselly, board chairman of the Liberia Airport Authority. ""The first screening was at the gate, before you get to the parking lot. The second time is before you enter the terminal building and the third is before you board the flight. At every point your temperature is scanned."" His temperature at those checkpoints was a consistent 97.3 degrees Fahrenheit, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Thomas Frieden told reporters Thursday. On a health screening questionnaire, Duncan answered ""no"" to questions about whether he had cared for a patient with the deadly virus and whether he had touched the body of someone who died in an area affected by the disease, Kesselly said. Complete coverage on Ebola . So where did he go next? Authorities believe he was on two United Airlines flights -- Flight 951 from Brussels to Washington Dulles and Flight 822 from Washington Dulles to Dallas-Fort Worth -- during his trip, according to a spokesperson for the airline who did not want to be named. Passengers on those flights are not in danger, the spokesperson said. The airline is voluntarily reaching out to passengers on those flights, an airline source said. When did his Ebola symptoms appear? ""Four or five days"" after his trip, according to the CDC's Frieden. This doesn't mean that Duncan actually got infected with Ebola in the United States. The incubation period for the virus is two to 21 days, meaning that a person could be infected with the disease for up to three weeks before he or she show any signs of it. When he did seek medical help? After 10 p.m. Thursday, September 25. That's when Duncan first walked into Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, according to a statement Wednesday. (A hospital official had earlier said that he'd gone to the hospital Friday.) His friend said that Duncan had a fever and vomiting during this first visit to the Dallas hospital. The hospital, in a statement Wednesday, said he had a ""low grade fever and abdominal pain."" He underwent basic blood tests but wasn't screened for Ebola, said Dr. Edward Goodman from the Dallas hospital. Duncan left the medical facility after being given antibiotics and a pain reliever, his friend said. ""His condition did not warrant admission,"" the hospital said. ""He also was not exhibiting symptoms specific to Ebola."" Were flags raised that Duncan might have Ebola? After being asked by a nurse, Duncan did say that he'd traveled from Africa, said Dr. Mark Lester, executive vice president of Texas Health Presbyterian's parent company. But that detail -- which might have raised an alarm that Duncan might have Ebola, since Liberia is one of the countries hardest hit by the virus -- was not ""fully communicated"" to the medical team, according to Lester. When was he admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital? On Sunday. The friend -- frustrated and feeling hospital staff wasn't doing enough -- then reportedly called the CDC about Duncan's case. The CDC told the friend to call Texas' Department of Health, with the message eventually getting to the hospital. This description, however, runs counter to what Texas Health Presbyterian said in its statement Wednesday. By the time Duncan arrived via ambulance, ""EMS had already identified potential need for isolation,"" the hospital said. ""The hospital followed all suggested CDC protocols at that time."" Who did the patient come into contact with in the meantime? Given the timetable outlined by Frieden, that leaves a few days between when Duncan began to show signs of Ebola and when he was hospitalized. This is significant because someone with Ebola is only contagious when they are symptomatic. And, obviously, there are more safeguards to prevent infection in a medical environment than outside of it. Health officials are reaching out to as many as 100 people who may have had contact with Duncan, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services said Thursday. These are people who are still being questioned because they may have crossed paths with the patient either at the hospital, at his apartment complex or in the community. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we're starting with this very wide net, including people who have had even brief encounters with the patient or the patient's home,"" spokeswoman Carrie Williams said. ""The number will drop as we focus in on those whose contact may represent a potential risk of infection."" The number of direct contacts who have been identified and are being monitored right now is ""more than 12,"" a federal official told CNN on Thursday. ""By the end of the day, we should have a pretty good idea of how many contacts there are,"" the official said. That number includes five students who attended four different schools in the area, according to Dallas Superintendent Mike Miles. Three students were also pulled from an elementary school in the Richardson Independent School District on Thursday after health officials determined they may have been in contact with Duncan. They have no symptoms, but ""have been removed from school in order to be monitored,"" the school district said. It's not known yet whether they or anyone else got Ebola, which only spreads through contact with infected bodily fluids, because of Duncan. This includes members of the ambulance crew that transported him to the hospital; none of had shown symptoms, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said Tuesday. How is Duncan doing? ""All right,"" according to his friend, who has spoken with Duncan frequently. ""He is in pain."" The friend, who talked with Duncan as recently as Wednesday afternoon, said that Duncan hasn't eaten in a week. Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital spokeswoman Candace White said that Duncan is in serious condition at her Dallas hospital.","United Airlines is reaching out to passengers on flights with the patient .

"Washington (CNN) -- House Democrats voted Wednesday to make Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, their leader for the 112th Congress, overcoming objections from moderates who argued that she was partly responsible for the party's overwhelming defeat at the polls two weeks ago. Republicans, who won a net gain of at least 61 seats in the elections, will control the House next year. They unanimously chose to be led once again by veteran Ohio Rep. John Boehner, now in line to inherit the speaker's gavel from Pelosi. Pelosi turned back a challenge from North Carolina Rep. Heath Shuler, a member of the party's diminished centrist ""Blue Dog"" faction, in a 150-43 vote. The speaker -- now set to be House minority leader in January -- retained the solid support of party liberals, who have noted her fundraising prowess and past ability to lead congressional Democrats to power, among other things. An earlier motion to delay the Democratic leadership vote until December 8 was easily defeated in a 68-129 vote. Some rank-and-file members were seeking more time to ""fully understand the causes of our historic losses"" in the midterm elections, according to the resolution. One senior Democratic aide called support for the resolution ""a proxy vote"" against Pelosi. Addressing reporters after her election, Pelosi said the message Democrats got on Election Day is that people ""want jobs."" Chalking up Democratic losses to the 9.6 unemployment rate, she said Democrats would ""strive to work together, wherever possible, in a bipartisan way"" on both job creation and deficit reduction. Pelosi brushed aside a question about her low national approval ratings. ""I'd like to see what your (approval) ratings would be"" if $75 million in negative ads had been spent against you, she told one reporter. Speaking earlier, Shuler claimed the Democratic leadership contest ""wasn't about winning or losing."" It was about ensuring ""moderates are heard within the [Democratic] caucus and that we have a seat at the table,"" he said. Democrats avoided a contentious fight for the No. 2 slot between the more moderate Maryland Rep. Steny Hoyer -- the current House majority leader -- and the more liberal South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, now the majority whip. Under a deal brokered by Pelosi, Hoyer will become the minority whip in the next Congress -- the second Democratic slot -- while Clyburn will serve as assistant leader, a newly created third Democratic position. Connecticut Rep. John Larson remains Democratic caucus chairman, with California Rep. Xavier Beccera rounding out the top leadership as caucus vice chair. Some defeated Blue Dog members argued that by retaining Pelosi and the rest of the current leadership, Democrats were making it tougher to recapture the House in the near future. Pelosi is ""the face that defeated us in this last election,"" Florida Rep. Allen Boyd told CNN. ""It seems to me that at some point you have to put your personal agenda and ambitions aside for the good of the country and certainly the party."" ""I don't know how we go into these districts like the one I represented ... and recruit good moderate Democrats if you have the same leadership,"" he said. On the Republican side of the aisle, Boehner will be followed by Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor -- soon to be majority leader. California Rep. Kevin McCarthy is slated to become majority whip, with Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling filling the fourth slot. The massive 80-plus-member GOP freshman class will have two representatives in the party's leadership -- South Dakota's Kristi Noem and South Carolina's Tim Scott -- one of two new African-American House Republicans. Boehner, who marked his 61st birthday Wednesday, will have to balance competing interests within the suddenly swollen ranks of his party's caucus. The incoming speaker will have to work with the Obama administration on various legislative priorities while also placating Tea Party activists who won seats on a platform of opposing the White House and sticking to strict conservative principles. ""This is the dawn of a new majority,"" Boehner said. ""One I believe will be humbler, wiser, and more focused than its predecessors on the priorities of the people."" ""And what (the people) want is a smaller, less costly, more accountable government,"" he concluded. ""More jobs, less spending. It's that simple.""

"We all hope the apparent cease-fire between Israel and Hamas will hold. However, we must recognize that Hamas and its terrorist partners bear responsibility for instigating the latest round of this conflict and need to refrain from further rocket and terrorist attacks. Israel exercised its inherent right to self-defense only after weeks of unprovoked attacks against civilian targets. Having picked a fight like a playground bully, Hamas cannot now credibly claim to be a victim. Israel, like the United States, places a premium on avoiding collateral damage and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on sophisticated weaponry to minimize to the greatest extent possible civilian casualties. Hamas intentionally launches unguided rockets into densely populated areas to cause wanton destruction and kill as many innocents as possible. Hamas exploits their own citizens as human shields, locating rocket stockpiles in population centers, hopeful that images of dead Palestinians will rally the world to their extremist cause. It is important to understand how this conflict started and how responsibly Israel has behaved, but also how future conflicts with Hamas can be prevented. Israel has made tremendous progress in reducing Hamas' capacity to threaten Israel and in restoring its deterrence. Israel's military operations in Gaza have been informed by impressively accurate intelligence and have been conducted with great precision and success. Significant stocks of long-range rockets have been destroyed, although remaining weapons stockpiles -- located in densely populated areas -- may require risky ground operations to secure should Hamas resume firing at Israel. For any enduring cease-fire, the onus must be on Hamas to control its fighters, cease rocket attacks, abandon terrorism and accept Israel's right to exist -- conditions it has long refused to accept despite Israel's commitment to a two-state solution and persistent willingness to negotiate with its Palestinian neighbors. After Israel-Gaza: Who won, who lost? Israel's Arab neighbors have an important role to play. Egypt deserves credit for its efforts to craft a cease-fire, but initial inflammatory public statements and actions of its leaders unfortunately served mainly to legitimize Hamas. If Egypt is serious about playing a positive role in the region, it will redouble its efforts to combat terrorist activities in the Sinai, police its border with Gaza, and prevent Iran and others from resupplying Hamas with rockets and other weapons. If Hamas rearms, it will be only a matter of time before the cease-fire breaks down. Opinion: In Israel-Hamas clash, Iran casts a shadow . Despite President Obama's friendship with Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, his recent behavior has been incredibly disappointing.  Erdogan, not for the first time, this week referred to Israel as a 'terrorist state' and has solely blamed Israel for the conflict, despite Hamas' preceding campaign of terror. Erdogan's anti-Israel positions are well known, but his inability to see in Hamas' behavior any wrongdoing whatsoever is deeply disturbing. Turkey and Israel for many years had a positive relationship. Their shared interests and democratic values should overcome the obstacles of Erdogan's personal views and provocative statements. Israelis look fondly upon Turkey and its people, and they desire a better relationship with this important NATO country. Turkey can play an important role in the region, as it has done in Syria, but its ability to be a responsible partner is badly hindered by Erdogan's staunch defense of a terrorist group. Opinion: Israel, face new reality: Talk to Hamas . The behavior of Qatar is similarly disappointing.  Qatar's emir recently visited Gaza and promised $400 million in aid to the terrorist rump-state, and it's no coincidence that Hamas' escalation took place in the wake of the emir's visit and his promise of cold hard cash. Such efforts from Qatar, Egypt and Turkey not only legitimize Hamas' violent strategy and embolden its militant leaders, but also marginalize the official Palestinian Authority government of President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad. Hamas' influence and ability to threaten Israel militarily is greatly enhanced by the Islamic Republic of Iran. Long a patron of Hamas, Iran provides significant resources and weapons to Hamas and other terrorists in Gaza. Indeed, the longer-range rockets fired at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem are gifts of Tehran, provided for use against the Jewish state. Any enduring solution must consider the pressing need to cut Iran's military supply lines to terrorists in Gaza. The conflict in Gaza -- as well as the one in Syria -- demonstrates that the threat posed by Iran goes well beyond its pursuit of nuclear weapons.  Indeed, the most pressing challenge for Obama in his second term may be the dual task of thwarting Iran's push for nuclear weapons and combating its support for terrorism. News: Gaza conflict leaves a 'cruel paradox' for Palestinians . The international community and especially the neighboring Arab and Muslim states, if they truly care for the Palestinians, should make clear that terrorism will never earn the Palestinians statehood and encourage all Palestinian parties to return to the negotiating table to seek a peaceful solution to this decades-long conflict.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than two-thirds of African-Americans believe Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision for race relations has been fulfilled, a CNN poll found -- a figure up sharply from a survey in early 2008. Martin Luther King Jr. waves to supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963. The CNN-Opinion Research Corp. survey was released Monday, a federal holiday honoring the slain civil rights leader and a day before Barack Obama is to be sworn in as the first black U.S. president. The poll found 69 percent of blacks said King's vision has been fulfilled in the more than 45 years since his 1963 ""I have a dream"" speech -- roughly double the 34 percent who agreed with that assessment in a similar poll taken last March. But whites remain less optimistic, the survey found. ""Whites don't feel the same way -- a majority of them say that the country has not yet fulfilled King's vision,"" CNN polling director Keating Holland said.  However, the number of whites saying the dream has been fulfilled has also gone up since March, from 35 percent to 46 percent. In the 1963 speech, delivered to a civil rights rally on the Mall in Washington, King said: ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.""  Watch Obama speak at Lincoln Memorial on Sunday » . ""Has that dream been fulfilled? With the election of Barack Obama, two thirds of African-Americans believe it has,"" CNN senior political analyst Bill Schneider said. ""Most blacks and whites went to bed on election night saying, 'I never thought I'd live to see the day.' That's what the nation is celebrating on this King holiday: We have lived to see the day,"" Schneider said.  Watch Schneider's analysis of pre-inauguration polls » . What about the Voting Rights Act, one of the signature achievements of the civil rights movement, which will be reviewed by the Supreme Court later this year? Two-thirds of blacks questioned in the poll say the U.S. still needs the Voting Rights Act today, but white respondents are split down the middle over whether that law is still necessary. In November, a majority of black respondents said that Obama's victory signaled a new era in race relations. The poll suggests that a majority today no longer feels that way, although most blacks predict some improvement on racial issues. ""In the immediate aftermath of Barack Obama's victory in November, African-Americans were cautiously optimistic about the future of race relations in the U.S., but some of that optimism has faded since that time,"" Holland added. In November, a majority of blacks for the first time believed that the U.S. would eventually find a solution to its racial problems; now a majority of blacks believe that race relations will always be a problem in this country. Blacks do believe that the Obama presidency will be good for them -- 61 percent say that the quality of life for African-Americans will improve over the next four years. Optimism for a new era has also dropped among whites. ""We saw a burst of enthusiasm about race relations immediately after Obama's election. The initial excitement has cooled a bit. But most blacks and whites still foresee some improvement in race relations,"" Schneider said. The CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll was conducted January 12-15. Pollsters questioned 1,245 adult Americans, including 798 whites and 332 blacks, by telephone. The survey's sampling error is 3 percentage points for the overall sample and 4.5 percentage points for the breakdowns by race.","69 percent of blacks polled say Martin Luther King Jr's vision realized .

"(CNN) -- Growing up in Arizona, the common joke was that one day a giant earthquake would tear California out into the Pacific and then we'd all have oceanfront property. It never happened. So we made a lake in Tempe. Same thing. Fewer whales. The truth is that California isn't going anywhere, and, now, as it continues to grow as a political superpower and cultural trend-setter, some people want to figure out just what the hell to do with our nation's weirdo West Coast uber-state. I say we give it a funny hat. But noted technology investor Tim Draper has a different idea that's both bold and arguably insane. And he's quite serious about it. Draper wants to turn California into six separate states. His initiative, Six Californias, quietly started bouncing around the Internet, but is getting more and more attention now that Draper's actually moving forward, trying to make his dream a reality. I've been told this phenomenon is called ""follow-through."" I'd be inclined to try it some day, but it sounds like it requires effort. And pants. That said, Draper appears up for the task, and he recently shared his big idea with TechCrunch writer Gregory Ferenstein, who reports that Draper is ""submitting a polished version to the state's Attorney General in the form of a ballot proposition proposal within the next 48 hours."" Now, that doesn't necessarily mean anything. Theoretically, I could submit a proposal that requires all Californians to wear REO Speedwagon T-shirts on Wednesdays, but it doesn't mean it's going to happen. Mind you, it should. Because it would be awesome. But it won't. The reality is that trying to get an initiative on the state ballot is both difficult and expensive. And I just don't hold the cash to push forward my REO Speedwagon plan. However, Draper might just have the wherewithal to make the possibility of Six Californias an actual thing. But why? His major argument is that, currently, California isn't represented properly in Washington -- that two senators simply cannot speak for the massive population of the entire state. Additionally, Draper argues that creating six Californias would encourage more business competition and allow the separate states to make decisions and regulations that are more appropriate to their respective populations. ""So, uh ... who wants some weed?"" Of course, debating, here, the serious pros and cons of this initiative are far beyond my pay grade. I mean, I guess it makes sense. But, then again, so does the McRib. Clearly, I'm not the man with the answers. Unless, of course, those answers pertain to Simpsons trivia. In which case, I'm your Huckleberry. I really have no idea whether this would be good or bad, but, still, it's easy to identify at least one of the major points of debate within Draper's plan, which is turning Silicon Valley into its own state, stretching from the Sierra Mountains to the shores of the Bay Area. Again, I'm not smart enough to truly understand the actual impact of something like this, but it seems that that particular state might be disproportionately amazing compared to the other five. ""Don't mind us. We're just going to take all the pretty and successful parts. But, hey, good luck with Los Angeles!"" In Draper's plan, the other five states that don't get to be Silicon Valley would be known as Jefferson, North California, Central California, West California, and South California. Now, at this point, having shared the basics of Draper's vision, I want to go firmly on the record as saying I absolutely, 100% disagree with this idea. It's simply the worst. Not so much because of any sound political or social reasons, but because I'm terribly OCD and couldn't, even for a second, fathom 55 states. This would drive me crazy. And what would we do with our flag? It would be chaos! That said, I do support cutting the state in half. At least so long as we eliminate one of our current states to keep the stars on the flag just as they are. In a perfect world, I suppose California would be divided into two states -- Northern California and Steve. And then we would combine North and South Dakota into just Dakota. Which, as a name, actually sounds quite pretty without the directional prefixes. And I'm sure all seven people who live there will learn to get along as one. But more importantly, Jarrett gets to sleep at night. Fifty stars. A beautiful thing. And, really, dividing California is not a completely far-fetched idea. Draper notes in his proposal that, ""Voters overwhelmingly approved the splitting of California into two states in 1859, but Congress never acted on that request due to the Civil War."" No matter what happens -- if anything -- it'll be a while before a vote actually occurs. These things take time. But it's fun to think about. And I bet REO Speedwagon would play the big constitution-signing party in Steve. Follow @JarrettBellini on Twitter.

"Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf said Monday that the situation over the massive Ebola outbreak in her country ""remains grave."" ""Our health delivery system is under stress. The international community couldn't respond quickly,"" Johnson Sirleaf told CNN's Nima Elbagir in an interview. Liberia is one of three nations, including Guinea and Sierra Leone, at the center of  the deadliest outbreak of Ebola in history. More than 1,500 people have died from the highly infectious virus since March. The World Health Organization has confirmed more than 3,000 cases and  says the outbreak is still accelerating across West Africa. Johnson Sirleaf also extended the stay-at-home order for all nonessential government employees for another month on Monday, underscoring the still dangerous health conditions the Ebola virus is causing in the country. The order went into effect on July 30. A statement on the President's website said the order is still necessary as efforts to contain the spread of the often fatal virus continue. But Johnson Sirleaf sounded hopeful.  She said conditions are slowly improving and that the world is responding to the epidemic, realizing the catastrophe that could unfold if the virus were to spread beyond Africa's borders. In a positive sign over the weekend, the quarantine on the Township of West Point in the capital city of Monrovia was lifted on Saturday. Johnson Sirleaf ordered the quarantine lifted ""based on the advice of authorities of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, as well as consultations with local and international partners,"" according to the online statement. She explained that ""the residents' cooperation and support over the period heightened the decision to lift the embargo."" But the President also warned a bigger response is still needed to prevent the spread of the infectious virus and contain the threat. ""People now don't see this as a Liberia or West Africa crisis. It could easily become a global crisis."" Johnson Sirleaf said the solution is for the global community to work in partnership with the affected nations to help them fight Ebola. ""We need that hope, we need that assistance. We need for the Liberians to know that this war can be won,"" Johnson Sirleaf said. The West African nation of Senegal confirmed its first Ebola case last week, one week after closing its border with Guinea. Senegal is the fifth country in the region to report the Ebola virus.","President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf warns Liberia's health system is under stress .

"(CNN) -- Heath Ledger died from an accidental overdose of prescription medications including painkillers, anti-anxiety drugs and sleeping pills, the New York City medical examiner's office said Wednesday. Actor Heath Ledger, 28, died January 22 at an apartment in Lower Manhattan. ""Mr. Heath Ledger died as the result of acute intoxication by the combined effects of oxycodone, hydrocodone, diazepam, temazepam, alprazolam, and doxylamine,"" the office said in a short statement. ""We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications."" Hydrocodone and oxycodone are painkillers. Diazepam is an anti-anxiety drug commonly sold under the brand name Valium; alprazolam is also an anti-anxiety drug sold under such names as Xanax. Temazepam, sold under such names as Restoril and Euhypnos, is a sleeping agent. Doxylamine, an antihistamine, can be obtained over the counter as a sleep aid. Ledger died January 22 at an apartment in Lower Manhattan. The Oscar-nominated Australian actor, best known for his role as a stoic, closeted cowboy in the 2005 film ""Brokeback Mountain,"" was 28.  Watch why Ledger's death probably was ruled accidental » . Police reported finding several prescription medications in the room but no illegal drugs. CNN has learned the Drug Enforcement Administration has requested the toxicology and prescription records related to Ledger's death. The DEA requested the records Wednesday from the New York Police Department and the medical examiner's office after the release of the report detailing the cause of death, according to a law enforcement source who asked not to be identified by name or agency because the request concerns an active investigation. The DEA confirmed it will look into anything suspicious concerning Ledger's death. ""We will investigate any leads in respect to this,"" DEA spokesman Garrison Courtney said while declining to provide any specifics. ""In any case, we look to see whether prescription drugs were illegally obtained or whether it was through proper channels."" An autopsy done on the actor January 23 was inconclusive.  Interactive: A look back at Heath Ledger's life » . In a statement released through Ledger's publicist, Ledger's father, Kim, said Wednesday: ""While no medications were taken in excess, we learned today the combination of doctor-prescribed drugs proved lethal for our boy. Heath's accidental death serves as a caution to the hidden dangers of combining prescription medication, even at low dosage."" The family added, ""Families rarely experience the uplifting, warm and massive outpouring of grief and support as have we, from every corner of the planet. This has deeply and profoundly touched our hearts and lives. We are eternally grateful."" Read the full statement . Ledger had talked about his difficulty sleeping after back-to-back roles as a Bob Dylan figure in ""I'm Not There"" and the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" part of the ""Batman"" series that is due out this summer. ""Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night,"" Ledger told The New York Times in November. ""I couldn't stop thinking. My body was exhausted, and my mind was still going."" In the hours leading up to Ledger's death two weeks ago, a housekeeper, identified as Teresa Solomon, arrived at the apartment about 12:30 p.m., a police source with knowledge of the investigation said. She saw Ledger lying on a bed face down with a sheet pulled up around his shoulders and heard him snoring, the source said. Masseuse Diana Wolozin arrived at the apartment about 2:45 p.m. to give Ledger a massage, according to the police source. About 15 minutes later, when he had not come out of the bedroom and the door remained closed, she went in, saw him lying in bed and set up a massage table. She shook Ledger, but he did not respond, so she used his cell phone to call actress Mary-Kate Olsen, a friend of Ledger's, in California, the source said. Wolozin told Olsen that Ledger was unconscious, according to the police source. Olsen reportedly told her that she would call private security people in New York. At 3:26 p.m., Wolozin called 911 and told authorities Ledger was not breathing. While on the phone with dispatchers, Wolozin tried to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Ledger, but he was unresponsive. Emergency personnel arrived seven minutes later, according to the police source, at about the same time as a private security person summoned by Olsen. The medical technicians performed CPR on Ledger and used a cardiac defibrillator, but their efforts were in vain and he was pronounced dead at 3:36 p.m. By then, two other private security people summoned by Olsen had arrived as well as police. His former fiancée, actress Michelle Williams, has asked the public to respect the need for her, the couple's 2-year-old daughter, Matilda, and others ""to grieve privately."" ""My heart is broken,"" Williams said in a statement issued last week via her publicist. ""I am the mother of the most tender-hearted, high-spirited, beautiful little girl who is the spitting image of her father. All that I can cling to is his presence inside her that reveals itself every day. His family and I watch Matilda as she whispers to trees, hugs animals, and takes steps two at a time, and we know that he is with us still. She will be brought up in the best memories of him."" Condolences poured in from Ledger's friends and co-stars. ""He was a wonderful guy, he was a wonderful actor, he had a wonderful future ahead of him, and I liked him,"" said actor Eric Roberts, who worked with Ledger in ""The Dark Knight."" Colleagues on Terry Gilliam's film ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus,"" which Ledger had been shooting in England, said the actor apparently had been suffering from a respiratory ailment in the days before he died. Christopher Plummer told Entertainment Weekly that Ledger had a ""terrible, lingering bug in London, and he couldn't sleep at all. We all -- I thought he'd probably got walking pneumonia."" Ledger's first American film was the teen comedy ""10 Things I Hate About You"" in 1999. He passed up several scripts before taking a role in the Revolutionary War drama ""The Patriot"" in 2000 and ""A Knight's Tale"" in 2001. He also played a supporting role in ""Monster's Ball."" But Ledger was perhaps best known for his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in ""Brokeback Mountain,"" Ang Lee's film about two cowboys who had a secret romantic relationship.

"Total SA says energy companies should not drill for crude in Arctic waters, marking the first time an oil major has publicly spoken out against offshore oil exploration in the region. Christophe de Margerie, Total's chief executive, told the Financial Times the risk of an oil spill in such an environmentally sensitive area was simply too high. ""Oil on Greenland would be a disaster,"" he said in an interview. ""A leak would do too much damage to the image of the company"". Last week, Royal Dutch Shell had to postpone until next year an attempt to drill into oil-bearing rock off the Alaskan coast after a piece of safety equipment was damaged during testing. It has spent $4.5bn and seven years preparing to drill. ExxonMobil, ENI of Italy and Norway's Statoil have also signed deals to explore for oil in Russia's Arctic waters, while others have secured licences to drill off Greenland. Mr de Margerie emphasised that he was not opposed to Arctic exploration in principle. Total has a number of natural gas ventures in the region, including a stake in the vast Shtokman field in Russia's Barents Sea. The Total chief executive said gas leaks were easier to deal with than oil spills. His comments were welcomed by environmental groups that are opposed to Big Oil's presence in what they see as a near-pristine wilderness. ""The rest of the oil industry should heed his warning,"" said Ben Ayliffe, head of Greenpeace's Arctic campaign. ""Given the risks, companies shouldn't be touching the Arctic with a barge pole."" Shell declined to comment. It has said in the past that it is well prepared for spills, with round-the-clock response teams on Alaska's North Slope and a fleet of specialised vessels that will be in place before drilling starts. According to a 2008 study by the US Geological Survey, the Arctic contains just over a fifth of the world's undiscovered, recoverable oil and gas resources. The melting of the polar ice cap has made the area more accessible to the majors than ever before. The region's challenges are formidable, however, ranging from icebergs the size of cities to storms, darkness and fierce cold. There is also no certainty of success: UK-listed explorer Cairn Energy spent $1bn exploring off Greenland and failed to find commercial volumes of oil. Total's Arctic projects are concentrated in Russia. As well as its stake in Shtokman, it has interests in a number of onshore developments, such as a big liquefied natural gas venture in Russia's far north known as Yamal LNG. It also operates a Siberian oilfield called Kharyaga. Gazprom announced in August that it was shelving Shtokman due to excessive costs. But Mr de Margerie said as far as he was concerned, it was still on. ""Gazprom never told me in writing that the project is over,"" he said. ""Discussions are not ... as active as I would like. [But] the reserves are still there.""","Total SA says energy companies should not drill for crude in Arctic waters .

"Native Americans have been news in mainstream media recently, which is a rare occurrence. On Wednesday, the U.S. patent office canceled trademark registrations of the Washington Redskins team name, calling the word ""disparaging to Native Americans."" Amanda Blackhorse, a Navajo, was one of five plaintiffs to contest the federal trademark protection of the team name. This is a great victory for Native Americans and it's indicative of the growing chorus of people who oppose the use of such racial slurs. Last week, the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation of California purchased airtime during the NBA Finals to run the anti-Washington Redskins video, ""Proud To Be."" The ad, produced by the National Congress of American Indians, ran in seven major cities and aimed to visually illustrate who Native Americans are and who we are not. Days after the ad aired during prime time, President Barack Obama became only the fourth sitting president to visit an American Indian reservation. Meeting in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, the president and first lady addressed a diverse group of Native Americans: those dressed in traditional regalia (not costumes) and those in suits and ties and dresses and modern attire. They met with decorated veterans of wars past and present, and children with iPhones and iPads. These events are significant because Native American voices are often marginalized, ignored or simply left out of the American conversation. But the 21st century is a time when we are getting mainstream attention. We are reclaiming our voice and images. Now, we are using platforms like social media to speak out against consistent appropriation of Native culture or to collectively oppose offensive Native American imagery. Recently, when ""Happy"" singer Pharrell Williams wore a Native American headdress on the cover of UK Elle magazine, a #nothappy twitter campaign was launched. Pharrell quickly issued an apology. It was not the first time the use of a misappropriated headdress prompted a public mea culpa. In 2012, Victoria's Secret also issued an apology and removed a model wearing a headdress from its broadcast. Now, more than ever, Native Americans are visible in ways they have not been in the past, erasing the antiquated image of a mythical, loin-cloth-clad Tonto figure and giving voice to real American Indians. Native Americans: We're not your mascots . Native Americans are typically lumped into one large group due to the social construct of race and for ease. But Native American nations are diverse, and recent visibility in the news offers a chance to see a wider range of who we are. We are not ""savages."" We are not ""injuns,"" and we are not ""redskins."" We are the first people of this nation -- our old country -- and we have endured. We are still here. We have always been here, and there is better chance you will see us and hear us. Not all Native American nations operate casinos. We do not all get free tuition. We don't get free gasoline, as Justin Bieber has suggested, and we do not all get monthly checks from Uncle Sam. Due to a complex history and interconnected issues, many tribes face poverty unlike other American ethnic groups and have the highest dropout rates. And sadly, there are additional reprehensible social statistics. But efforts like those the president outlined in his recent visit -- additional investment in tribal communities, improved communication between agencies and empowerment -- highlight some of the ways that the government is aiding these deeply rooted issues. And as Native Americans are seen beyond the stereotypes, and as we use our voices to speak out, we give visibility to who we are, as well as the issues we are working to solve. This visibility allows for a rehumanization. That is important, and not just for the sake of a brand name of a professional football team. It is also not about an overly sensitive, politically correct Native American adult who feels the sting of racial epithets. It's about a future where our kids won't have to face the racism we have. Our voices were once silenced, but we never stopped speaking. Our land was taken, but we never stopped living. Our children were stolen, and yet generations endure. The 21st century is incontrovertibly a time where we have reclaimed our voice from those who would speak on behalf of us, and it is a time where we work diligently to reclaim our appropriated image.","Native Americans appeared in big stories in mainstream media recently .
This visibility is rare but becoming more common, author says .

"Italy's electoral run-off between an ex-communist and a former cruise ship singer threatens to throw the country back into the spotlight of the European debt crisis. The enigmatic leader of the center-left Democratic Party, Pier Luigi Bersani, goes head-to-head with scandal-laden former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- back from the political grave following his resignation in November 2011. Incumbent technocrat premier and eurozone darling Mario Monti, meanwhile, is lagging behind in the polls. The cigar-chomping Bersani is favorite for Italy's top job and proposes to steer the country's battered economy through a debt crisis that is still plaguing the eurozone three years on. Following six consecutive quarters of recession and with unemployment at 11.2%, Bersani is pursuing the euro area's latest fad to revive Italy's ailing economy; a pro-growth agenda. Read more: Can the anti-Berlusconi pull Italy out of the mire? Such policies are a stark contrast to Monti's cocktail of cuts and taxes served up to woo policymakers in Brussels and Frankfurt. Read more: Berlusconi renaissance would be 'disaster' for Italian economy . Growth will be the ""golden rule"" to attract foreign investment, according to Democratic Party number two Enrico Letta. A similar sentiment was key in sweeping socialist French President Francois Hollande into the Elysee Palace in 2012. But Letta stresses that Bersani will not follow Hollande's lead by proposing a 75% income tax for the country's wealthiest residents. Read more: Beppe Grillo: Clown prince of Italian politics . Speaking to CNN, Letta said: ""It will be different, we already have a very high level of taxation...the main point is not to increase taxes."" Bersani -- who promises to stick to the outgoing government's plans for pension and labor market reform -- will also keep Monti's reviled property tax, known as IMU. It's a policy that Berlusconi pledges to scrap if elected. In an interview with CNN, Bersani says he plans to make the tax ""more progressive"" and focus on the owners of large properties if his party wins. But for all Bersani's talk of change, bond strategist Nicholas Spiro dismisses the 71-year-old as no reformer and says he is ""not up to the task"" of hauling the Italian economy out of a ""knee deep"" recession. Spiro, managing director of Spiro Sovereign Strategy,  says ""Bersani could very well go for taxes on the rich, but Italy has a massive tax evasion and compliance problem, that could be difficult."" Can a political marriage survive? Politics in Italy is complicated and outright victory for any party is unlikely. If Bersani wins he may be forced to form a coalition. An alliance with the flamboyant center-right leader Silvio Berlusconi is unthinkable -- which leaves Monti the most likely candidate to support a Bersani-lead government. But Monti is viewed with suspicion Bersani's far-left partners, Left Ecology Freedom, who believe the technocrat would pull a left government too far to the economic right. If the parties can strike a deal Monti would be offered ""an important role"" to be discussed ""Monday afternoon,"" Letta told CNN. He refused to say if the technocrat would be appointed finance minister. Monti, a former European Commissioner in financial services, wields the power to reassure European leaders that Italy is on the right track and can act as a counterbalance to a leftist government. Bersani, by contrast, is a mystery on the international stage, according to Paola Subacchi, an economist at London-based think tank Chatham House. ""He is not known abroad and he doesn't speak English... But his whole agenda is pro-Europe and pro-euro."" A Bersani-Monti marriage is unlikely to be smooth. The two could clash over unpopular austerity measures implemented by Monti as part of a European agreement. Filippo Cavazzuti, former Italian senator and economist at the University of Bologna, believes Bersani will be forced to maintain Monti's policies under the European fiscal compact. He said: ""Otherwise Monti leaves [the coalition], the spread [on bond yields] rises and the credibility with the eurozone will immediately disappear."" A coalition agreement is crucial to stifling a power-grab by Italy's political bad boy, Berlusconi, is gaining on Bersani's seemingly unassailable lead in the polls. Berlusconi is using his showman charm to mount a comeback for his People of Freedom party and holds key regions in Veneto and Lombardy that could prove crucial, particularly in the battle for the Senate. The election will hand down a ""damning verdict"" to the policymakers of northern Europe that Italians are fed up with austerity, according to Spiro. The electoral campaign, Spiro added, has been: ""Very ugly, devoid of substance and purely based on personalities.""","Bersani wins he may be forced to form a coalition with incumbent PM Mario Monti .

"(CNN) -- All six airmen aboard the B-52 bomber that crashed Monday off Guam's northwest coast were killed, Air Force officials confirmed Wednesday. The B-52H Stratofortress, like this one, was in Guam as part of a four-month rotation. Aboard Raider 21 were Maj. Christopher M. Cooper, 33; Maj. Brent D. Williams, 37; Capt. Michael K. Dodson, 31; 1st Lt. Joshua D. Shepherd, 26; 1st Lt. Robert D Gerren, 32; and Col. George Martin. The plane crashed about 30 miles northwest of Guam, the Air Force said in a statement. Air Force crews switched from a rescue operation to a recovery operation over the 7,000-square-mile crash site, said Air Force spokeswoman Sgt. Ashleigh Bryant. The bomber was scheduled to fly over crowds celebrating Liberation Day, which commemorates the U.S. capture of Guam from Japan in 1944, said Capt. Joel Stark, spokesman for Andersen Air Force Base in Guam. The B-52H Stratofortress, based at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, was in Guam as part of a four-month rotation when it went down about 9:45 a.m. Monday (7:45 p.m. ET Sunday), Stark said. Martin was a physician and second in command of the medical unit at Andersen and not a member of the crew. There were no weapons or munitions aboard the aircraft, the Air Force said. In February, a B-2 stealth bomber crashed shortly after takeoff from Andersen Air Force Base. Two crew members ejected safely.","NEW: One airman was physician and second in command of the medical unit .

"CHICAGO, Illinois (CNN) -- A magistrate judge on Monday granted bail for an Illinois man accused of surreptitiously taping sports reporter Erin Andrews in the nude and posting the videos on the Internet. ESPN reporter Erin Andrews was allegedly stalked by a man who posted nude videos of her on the Internet. Michael David Barrett, 48, will return to California to face a federal charge of interstate stalking. U.S. Magistrate Judge Arlander Keys agreed Barrett would be released on bail. However, Keys ordered that Barrett be confined to his home and subject to electronic monitoring, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. Barrett, an insurance company employee from Westmont, Illinois, is accused of taping Andrews, an ESPN reporter, while she was nude in two hotel rooms. He then made seven videos that he posted on the Internet, according to a criminal complaint filed in the case. Barrett was arrested Friday at Chicago O'Hare International Airport. He will appear in court in Los Angeles, California, on October 23, according to a statement from prosecutors in Los Angeles. Authorities believe most of the videos were made at a Nashville, Tennessee, hotel in September 2008. The peephole into Andrews' room was altered with a hacksaw, and the images appeared to have been taken with a cell phone camera, the complaint said. Investigators found in hotel records that Barrett had requested and received a room adjacent to Andrews' and used his home address to register for it. Barrett allegedly attempted to sell the videos to celebrity gossip site TMZ in January 2009. TMZ did not purchase the photos, but employees of the Web site assisted in the investigation, providing information to Andrews' attorneys, authorities said. However, Barrett posted the videos to other Web sites, the criminal complaint said, with labels like ""Sexy and hot blonde sports celebrity shows us her all."" ""The e-mail (sent to TMZ) was linked to Barrett through a number of methods,"" the statement from Los Angeles prosecutors said. Investigators found that Barrett reserved a room at a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, hotel where Andrews was staying in July 2008 but never checked in, according to the complaint and prosecutors' statement. ""However, the peephole on the door where the victim stayed during that trip was altered in a similar way to the peephole found in the Nashville hotel,"" the statement said. Andrews, 31, is a sideline reporter for ESPN, traveling around the country covering college football games. The criminal complaint against Barrett, which identifies Andrews only as ""Individual A,"" says she became aware of the videos in July, and that their posting has caused her distress, anxiety and trouble sleeping. Authorities believe Barrett could have recorded similar videos of other women in the same manner, the criminal complaint says. Investigators found other videos on a Web site, apparently posted by a person using the same username as the person who posted the Andrews videos. ""From the screenshots of these videos, it appears that these videos have also been taken of naked women through the peephole of a door,"" the complaint said. In Monday's hearing, prosecutor Steve Grimes called Barrett's interest in Andrews an ""obsession,"" the Sun-Times reported. ""This was not just a whimsical act,"" Grimes said. ""This was an obsession, one that was acted out ... one he carried out through various states."" Grimes described Barrett as a danger to women. A call to Andrews' attorney, Marshall Grossman, was not immediately returned. In an interview Monday with Chicago's WGN-AM, Grossman said Andrews was initially ""quite relieved"" after a suspect was identified and arrested. However, he said, in reviewing the affidavit, Andrews' ""concern returned, unfortunately, in spades, so to speak, because of the extent of the charges as outlined by the FBI (and) the fact that this has been going on for several months in numerous locations. ... Her distress level is naturally quite high, and she hopes that this matter is brought to resolution as soon as possible so she can return to some sense of normalcy in her professional job and responsibilities."" Barrett's father, Frank Barrett, told the Sun-Times on Sunday that the allegations do ""not match the Mike I know,"" describing his son as ""an extrovert and very outgoing."" He told the newspaper his son is divorced but has a college-age daughter. The magistrate placed Barrett on a 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew and ordered him not to use the Internet at home or at work. He will be allowed to go to work but must be at home the rest of the time, the Sun-Times said. A search warrant in the case directed authorities to search Barrett's computer for information in the case, including anything ""relating to Individual A, a female reporter for ESPN, including but not limited to her travel schedule,"" as well as information relating to hotels where Barrett has stayed, among other items. Grimes said in court that the warrant was executed Saturday, according to the Sun-Times. The maximum penalty for the charge of interstate stalking is five years in federal prison, the FBI said.","Bail granted for man accused of secretly taping ESPN reporter Erin Andrews .

"Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych intends to sign a deal on closer European Union ties, the bloc's top diplomat has said, after weeks of mass protests that have rattled the Eastern European country. Ukrainian protesters, angry about the government's decision last month to spurn a free-trade agreement with the EU in favor of closer economic ties with Moscow, have stood their ground in Kiev's Independence Square, or Maidan, paralyzing the center of the capital. They have remained there, undeterred by authorities' overnight crackdown early Wednesday in which police tore down barricades they had set up. After meeting Yanukovych this week, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said he had assured her of his intent. ""He indicated he still wishes to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union,"" she told CNN in Kiev on Wednesday. ""From our perspective, we think that's good for this country. But the present crisis that's happening right now needs to be resolved."" A statement from the EU in Brussels, Belgium, on Thursday quoting Ashton echoed this: ""The President has assured me when I've met him that he does intend to sign the Association Agreement."" Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Serhiy Arbuzov traveled to Brussels on Thursday, where he  met Stefan Fule, European commissioner for Enlargement and European Neighbourhood Policy, an EU spokesman in Kiev said. In Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin briefly touched on the situation in the Ukraine in his State of the Nation address to the Federal Assembly on Thursday. ""I very much hope that all political forces of the country will manage to come to an agreement in the interest of the Ukrainian people and solve all the piles of problems,"" he said. Opposition dismisses talks . Pressed by Europe and the United States, Yanukovych on Wednesday offered to meet opposition leaders to find a way out of a crisis that blew up last month when thousands poured into the streets of the capital, demanding his resignation. ""I invite representatives of all political forces, priests, public figures to hold the nationwide dialogue,"" he said in a statement on the official presidency website. The statement also called on the opposition not to ""choose the path of confrontation and ultimatums."" However, opposition leaders have dismissed the offer of talks, insisting that Yanukovych must quit for favoring ties with Russia over the EU. In a statement on her website, Yanukovych's jailed chief political opponent, Yulia Tymoshenko, urged Ukrainians to ""stand up,"" and she repeated previous opposition calls for early elections. U.S. 'disgust' at crackdown . Kiev's handling of the pro-EU protests has been met with stern responses from the European Union and United States. Police moved into the main protest camp early Wednesday, using chainsaws to tear down the barriers, which had been manned by pro-Western demonstrators. Clashes led to reports of injuries on both sides. ""The United States expresses its disgust with the decision of Ukrainian authorities to meet the peaceful protest in ... Maidan Square with riot police, bulldozers, and batons, rather than with respect for democratic rights and human dignity,"" U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said in a prepared statement. ""This response is neither acceptable, nor does it befit a democracy."" In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday that ""all options"" were under consideration in Ukraine, including sanctions. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was ""deeply concerned"" about the Ukraine government's decision to send in riot police against peaceful protesters. Thousands of demonstrators have been camped out for days in Independence Square. They also continue to occupy Kiev's City Hall. The scenes of protest are reminiscent of the uprising that swept Yanukovych from office as prime minister nine years ago during the Orange Revolution. East vs. West . Ukraine is split between pro-European regions in the west of the country and a more Russia-oriented east. Protesters say an EU agreement would open borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion. They accuse Yanukovych of preparing to take the country into a Moscow-led customs union. Moscow has leverage that may have affected Yanukovych's decision last month to backpedal on the EU talks because Russia supplies Ukraine with natural gas. The EU is also pressuring Yanukovych to free Tymoshenko, who has languished in jail for two years after being convicted of abuse of power in 2011. The EU and other critics decried the verdict as a sham. The Orange Revolution that swept Yanukovych from office in 2004 also brought the pro-Western Tymoshenko to power. At the rallies in Independence Square, protesters have carried her picture.","EU diplomat: Yanukovych ""assured me ... he does intend to sign"" deal on closer ties .

"Floating in the middle of the sea, the first thing we noticed was the vast expanse of tarmac, roughly the size of three soccer fields. And then we heard the loud blasting sound of fighter jets preparing to take off. This was one of the world's most powerful warships, the Nimitz-class 'super carrier' USS George Washington, which the CNN crew and members of other media organizations were granted a rare opportunity to visit this weekend. After climbing up the equivalent of an eight-story building, staircase after staircase, one narrow hallway after another, we finally arrived at the ""bridge,"" an elevated tower containing the command control center on the aircraft carrier. The U.S. nuclear-powered carrier was in the waters off the Korean peninsula for a routine patrol mission, which followed a trilateral ""search and rescue"" drill between the U.S., South Korea and Japan. The drill drew harsh rhetoric from North Korea earlier last week, warning the U.S. of a ""horrible disaster"" and claimed that its troops are on high alert to promptly cope with ""blatant provocations."" Standing on the flight deck of the USS George Washington, I realized North Korea probably had good reason to be on edge. The USS George Washington can carry about 80 aircraft, launch tactical fighter jets towards any location and is equipped with various types of missiles. Known as a ""floating military base"", it can also accommodate more than 6,000 crew, serve 18,000 meals per day and even has live broadcast television on the vessel. Back on the bridge, we saw fighter jets take off one after another at an impressive pace. This, I was told, was the work of a deck catapult, which slings the fighter jet forward, generating enormous speed. We experienced just that. Ending the tour, we strapped ourselves  into a propeller-powered, windowless plane. After a roaring sound, the plane took off at an enormous speed, faster than any roller coaster ride I had been on.

"(CNN)Adam Markus has bet nearly everything he has on a pot shop. ""My checking account, as of this morning, is $25.97. Somewhere deep inside me, I'm still afraid I've thrown all our money away,"" he said. ""I am sure I will feel that sense of relief when I see the first customer walk in the door. Once they are lined up out the door, I'll be doing a dance on top of the glass counter."" Markus, 53, was a step closer to dancing Monday after officials in Washington issued him one of the state's first 24 marijuana retailer licenses. He plans to open a store this week in Union Gap, Washington, one of two U.S. states that have legalized the sale of recreational marijuana. Sales started in Colorado in January. Markus got the idea after his sister died from an accidental drug overdose some four years ago. She suffered from chronic pain and took heavy medication. ""She passed away and in the process of talking to people about it, it came up that she would have benefited from using a cannabis product. It motivated me,"" Markus said. At that point, medical marijuana was legal in Washington, but recreational marijuana sales were not, so he decided risks were too great to open a store. That calculation changed when Washington changed its laws. ""I was making $25,000 a year, selling cars and supporting a family of four. This was until last month. I went through and pulled out all my funds in all my 401ks. And put into this -- with lots of help from friends, lots of donated labor. This is a true labor of love,"" said Markus, who does not smoke. ""I don't want to give the impression this is a hippie thing. All my friends and family pulled together to build this thing. We have everything in place to be successful,"" he said. Maureen Cooke, 72, is equally optimistic. She, too, received one of the state's first marijuana retailer licenses. Cooke is set to open her store in Langley, Washington, where she expects rapid growth, ""maybe $5 million in sales"" the first month. ""If it's anything like Colorado, goodness! As long as we have product to sell, we are going to sell it. This is my retirement,"" she said. 'I like weed and I'm a good person' Public opinion has rapidly shifted toward softer policies on marijuana use. In January, a CNN/ORC International survey found that 55% of respondents wanted to see marijuana made legal.

""Jana fought hard to stay alive,"" her relatives said. ""However, we are sad to say that she lost her fight today."" Shark bites teen's legs in latest attack in Hawaii . The woman, believed to be about 20 years old, was snorkeling about 50 yards off the Hawaiian island of Maui when a shark severed her right arm around 4:40 p.m. on August 14, authorities said. ""The water was choppy with limited visibility"" at the time, the county of Maui noted on its Facebook page. Two male friends, who were nearby in the water, and a kayaker carried Lutteropp out of the water. First responders found her unconscious and took her to Maui Medical Center, said Lee Mainaga of the Maui Fire Department said. She was initially listed in critical condition.

"Forget Elon Musk or Al Gore. The biggest star of the South by Southwest Interactive festival is less than a year old, sleeps all day and looks like she just swallowed a hairball. Austin, meet Grumpy Cat. The real-life cat, an Internet sensation since photos of her sourpuss face began circulating last fall, has been holding court during SXSW at the Mashable House, a temporary lounge run by the tech-news site. People have stood for hours, in lines snaking around the block, to get their picture taken with her. Grumpy Cat, an 11-month-old mixed breed whose real name is Tardar Sauce, has ignored them all. Mostly she sleeps in a cat bed while fans pass by to pose next to her. Instead of smiling, many of them make pouty faces of their own. Through it all, Grumpy Cat has remained unimpressed. ""People keep asking if we sedate her,"" said one of her handlers, Bryan Bundesen, on Sunday. (The answer is no.) ""It's been crazy. Yesterday, they were lined up for almost three blocks."" This is the first official public appearance for Grumpy Cat, who lives with her owner, Tabatha Bundesen, in Morristown, Arizona. The cat first gained fame in September when Bryan, Tabatha's brother, posted some photos of her on Reddit, the social-news site. ""It was an accident,"" said Bryan Bundesen of the viral stardom that followed. ""We thought it would get some laughs, with the Internet liking cats. And it just kept going."" Grumpy Cat now has a website that Bryan Bundesen said attracts 1.5 million unique visitors a month, plus a popular Facebook page, YouTube channel and Twitter account. Bryan manages her social media pages from his home in Ohio with occasional help from Tabatha, who sends him fresh Grumpy Cat photos every week or so. ""I don't mind it,"" Tabatha said of her pet's celebrity. ""I'm thrilled to see that my cat brings joy to people."" The Bundesens declined to say exactly how much money they've earned off Grumpy Cat, although Bryan said it's in the mid-five figures. They're also sensitive to charges that they're exploiting their pet. At SXSW, they have made her available to the public only for several hours each day, and Tabatha sits close by to make sure no fans get too cozy. But that hasn't stemmed people's enthusiasm for the small cat with the cranky face. Oscar-winning filmmaker Danny Boyle (""Slumdog Millionaire"") was doing an interview a few feet away Saturday, but people crowded past him for a glimpse of the cat. Fans have come bearing cattnip toys and other gifts. One woman said she came all the way from Australia to see Grumpy Cat. Mashable, a CNN.com content partner, invited the Bundesens and Grumpy Cat to Austin as part of their SXSW party space, which celebrates Internet memes. The result supports the notion that Internet fame is becoming as potent a force as other types of celebrity. ""There's this great universal quality that Grumpy Cat captures,"" explained Mason Peatross, who waited in line more than 90 minutes for his 30 seconds with the snoozing kitty.

"Editor's Note: Fernando Espuelas is the host and managing editor of Café Espuelas, a Los Angeles Spanish-language radio talk show and a media entrepreneur. Fernando Espuelas says it was a mistake for Latino voters to support Proposition 8's gay marriage ban. LOS ANGELES (CNN) -- It's a done deal: Proposition 8, making same-sex marriage illegal in California, has been approved by voters. The constitution of the state was amended to take away rights recognized by the California Supreme Court under the equal protection clause of the California constitution just this May. And Latinos were in the vanguard, providing critical support for the passage of Prop 8. For the past few weeks, Latinos have called in to my radio show, horrified at the idea of same-sex marriage. Callers said they would vote for Obama for change -- and for Proposition 8. They told me that the future of their family was at stake. Biblical passages were quoted, divinely inspired indignation given voice. The vision of a collapsed society, where men abandon their wives in droves to ""become gay,""' consumed these callers. Is this simply a case of cognitive dissonance? By now, the media has reported the importance of the Latino vote to Obama's win in such key states as Florida, New Mexico, and Colorado. President-elect Obama, by some early estimates, garnered the largest share of the Latino vote of any candidate in history, carrying it by more than 2 to 1 over John McCain. In spite of what seems to be sweeping approval for a progressive agenda, Latino support of Prop. 8 has exposed an entrenched bias against homosexuality at once profound and confounding. Perhaps because of the teachings of the Roman Catholic priests and now the evangelical preachers who have captured many Latinos' devotional intensity; or simply because of the macho albatross we all carry as part of our Latino heritage, the very idea of gay marriage is anathema to many in the Latino community. The fight for civil rights in America -- from the abolition of slavery in 1865, through the battle for a woman's right to vote, to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 -- has been long, fierce, and steady. Politicians from both parties never tire of telling us that a metaphorical Liberty Bell rings brightly, as it does in no other country in the world. Yet even as civil rights in America have come so far, Latinos still suffer keenly under the heel of oppression. Everyday, I feel the blow of news reports about Latinos struggling against dark odds in our country: the immigrant mother forgotten in a jail cell for four days without food, water, or a toilet; slaughterhouse workers herded like the cattle they process into an Immigration and Customs Enforcement bus. Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who has attacked the immigration conundrum with zeal, is being sued by Latino human rights organizations for allegedly demanding proof of citizenship from anyone who looks Latino, and even from people listening to Spanish-language radio in their cars. The irony of Latino support for Prop. 8 is sad. That a community that continues to struggle for basic rights would deny them to another is particularly baffling. A marginalized minority -- Latinos -- voting to take away the rights of another marginalized group -- gays and lesbians -- is like the kid who's picked on in the third grade and only makes some headway when a punier kid comes along to take the punches instead. Throughout this campaign, in an avalanche of Spanish-language commercials, Latinos were exhorted to vote ""Yes"" on Prop 8. A calm voice -- a voice that could be selling baby wipes or low-fat cookies -- told us that we should check yes ""for the good of our families,"" that we must save everything that is good and decent about America. Take away the civil rights of gays and lesbians so that we can be safe. But safe from what? The low-fat cookie voice of the radio commercial did not really say. Latinos were asked not just to look away as these rights would be withdrawn, but to actively vote for the demolition of someone else's family. We were implored to look at ""them"" as the unredeemable ""aliens"" that must be expurgated from our society. And we did. Once you start the process of taking away other peoples' fundamental rights -- like food and water in a jail cell, or the right to drive and listen to whatever music you like -- you must ask yourself where to draw the line, and who will draw it? What -- and whose -- rights will be next on the chopping block? As Martin Luther King Jr. said, ""Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere."" You'd think that as Latinos, proud and strong and willing to fight for our own rights,- we'd refuse to turn against the ""punier kid,"" wouldn't you? That we might in fact stand up for that kid, tell the bullies to back off, the same way we told the bullies of racism and ""the real America"" to take a hike -- and in the process carried Obama to triumph. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fernando Espuelas.","Fernando Espuelas: Latino voters provided critical support for Prop. 8 .

"(CNN) -- Chelsea reclaimed the lead in the English Premier League as Didier Drogba continued his hot scoring run against title hopefuls Arsenal with both goals in a 2-0 victory on Sunday. Ivory Coast striker Drogba has now netted 12 times in 12 encounters with Chelsea's London rivals, and could have had a hat-trick as his second-half free-kick thumped against the bar. Chelsea moved two points clear of Manchester United, who thrashed bottom club Portsmouth on Saturday, with Arsenal nine points off the leaders in third place. Arsenal's title challenge has disintegrated in the past two weeks, with a goalless draw against European hopefuls Aston Villa followed by a 3-1 home defeat by United, and Arsene Wenger's team must now face fourth-placed Liverpool on Wednesday. ""It is difficult to swallow a defeat like that when we felt we were the better team,"" Wenger told reporters. ""Chelsea defended well until the last minute, so you have got to give them credit. We are outsiders but we will fight until the last day of the season."" Chelsea successfully bounced back from the shock draw with lowly Hull in midweek, which came as speculation about the future of England captain John Terry reached fever pitch. The defender was subsequently stripped of the national armband by England boss Fabio Capello due to tabloid revelations about the player's private life, particularly his alleged marital infidelity with the former partner of his one-time Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge. But Terry, publicly backed by his club coach Carlo Ancelotti, showed on Sunday that his performances on the field have not been affected by the controversy as Chelsea's solid back four rendered Arsenal's silky passing game near impotent in the last third of the pitch. And it was Terry who helped Drogba score the eighth-minute opening goal, heading a corner to the far post where his unmarked teammate coolly slotted the ball into the net past exposed goalkeeper Manuel Almunia. Arsenal dominated possession in the first half, but the closest they came to scoring was when Russia forward Andrei Arshavin's volley was well blocked by the legs of keeper Petr Cech. Drogba's second goal 15 minutes later knocked the stuffing out of the visitors as he cut in from the right and lashed in a fierce left-foot shot after being fed by Frank Lampard on the counter-attack, with Arsenal guilty of schoolboy defending. Arsenal poured forward in the second half but were unable to penetrate as Chelsea could afford to sit back and absorb the pressure. Wenger brought on Czech winger Tomas Rosicky and defender Emmanuel Eboue for Abou Diaby and Bacary Sagna with 15 minutes left, but it was Chelsea who almost scored again. Drogba curled a powerful free-kick against the crossbar, with Almunia left helplessly unable to even try to save it. In Sunday's other match, Birmingham City moved up to eighth place as veteran striker Kevin Phillips came off the bench to score both goals in the 2-1 win at home to Midlands rivals Wolverhampton Wanderers. The visitors took the lead on manager Mick McCarthy's 51st birthday when striker Kevin Doyle reacted fastest to score after City defender Roger Johnson diverted a low cross onto his own post three minutes before halftime. But the 36-year-old Phillips scored twice in the last 10 minutes in a rare first-team outing this season to leave promoted Wolves in the bottom three. The former England international leveled after Craig Gardner headed the ball back across goal, and then volleyed the winner five minutes from time after chesting down a chip from fullback Stephen Carr, who was allowed to run into the penalty area.","Chelsea reclaim lead in English Premier League with 2-0 win over title hopefuls Arsenal .

"London (CNN) -- Over the last 15 years, I've been lucky enough to work in the industry of tech-driven start-ups, and I've watched as revolutions have taken place. Technologies we now take for granted -- wifi, the iPhone, Twitter and Facebook, for example -- have transformed the way we communicate, do business and even facilitate political upheavals. Yet they remain youthful technologies. Wifi had its earliest start around 1991, and didn't hit the mainstream until the early 2000s. It's now in every decent coffee shop and threatening to infiltrate the last bastion of un-connectivity -- the London underground. The United Kingdom is integral in this narrative of global upheaval. But, unlike its American peers, it's shy of celebrating its success. But without the ground-breaking work of UK companies, this brave new world would not be possible. ARM, a spin-off of the loved but now-defunct Acorn Computers, pioneered the high-speed, low-energy brains that power this revolution. Without ARM's ""reduced instruction set computing"" your laptop would barely last a few hours, and would be too hot to keep on. This relatively small company has created such huge opportunity and promise, but the UK barely celebrates them, let alone acknowledge the huge impact they've had on the future of computing. Ever heard of Cambridge Silicon Radio? They create Bluetooth platforms, a technology which is now emerging as a potential way of securing mobile to mobile transactions, revolutionizing advertising and making sure that you're still connected to your phone even when driving. British brains are also behind many of the greatest innovations. Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web, while Jony Ive is the design guru at Apple. And it is these British visionaries who are as central to our new world, if not more so, than the social platforms that are part of our everyday conversations. Consumer technology is all very attractive and tangible: Twitter is immediate; Facebook is ubiquitous. In contrast, ARM, Cambridge Silicon Radio and their peers, like Datasift, Autonomy and Wolfram, are technical, complex and powerful. And hard to make sexy. In these times of instant gratification, sexy is a necessary condition. However such companies are all products of long-term vision, backed with massive intellectual prowess, creating cutting edge technologies that will remain a core part of the technological future for many, many years. This stands them apart from Facebook and Twitter. These things are, by their very nature, faddy, nascent, fast to grow and fast to die. MySpace, Friends Reunited and countless others became ""also-rans"" who didn't keep the consumer's attention beyond a few years. So, the UK needs to celebrate its vital role in our new, connected world. We're ambitious, dedicated, passionate, diligent and intellectually capable. But we're also refined, genteel and not one to brag about new riches. That attitude stands in stark contrast to our American peers, who are incredible at creating and monetizing opportunities, then playing to consumers of the digital age -- just as Hollywood did with the silver screen. They talk themselves up, they champion their industries, and they invest in each other, both financially and in spirit. In short, they are the noisy cousins bragging about their new riches. We need to stop being distracted by this hype, and instead invest in and recognize our nation of incredible promise and intellectual capacity. We don't invest enough in academia -- which is why I have established a free school, The Ada Lovelace Academy, to nurture the new generation of entrepreneurs. Without such investment, we are at risk of failing subsequent generations with an endemic short-termism that doesn't set the stage for the next ARM, CSR, Wolfram or Autonomy to emerge from this green and pleasant land. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Benjamin Southworth.","Technologies we take for granted such as Twitter and Facebook are still young .
They've transformed the way we operate, but social platforms can end up as ""has-beens""

"(CNN)This year, at the annual gargantuan gadget gathering known as CES, the titans of technology stood on stage to deliver virtually the same message, one after the other: We have arrived at a turning point in human society -- one in which the world around us is so deeply embedded with intelligent electronic objects that we can essentially outsource huge aspects of our life to them! Personal fitness. Family communications. Home management. And now that our devices are becoming interlinked as a vast always-on network, they don't even need to be supervised anymore -- our stuff can handle all of these irritating tasks just by talking with each another. The buzzword for this idea is the ""Internet of Things."" And if truth be told, the IoT (as it's been hastily acronymed) sounds...pretty cool! Appliance giant LG shared its vision of a ""better and more beautiful future"" in which its HomeChat platform might allow your LG smartwatch to understand that you're sleeping restlessly, and instantly tell your LG audio system to play soothing music, your LG air conditioner to reduce the temperature, and your LG air purifier and humidifier to pump some scented mist into the room. Meanwhile, your LG coffeemaker is grinding some fresh beans for next morning's automatically brewed cup of joe, and your LG smartphone is transmitting your daily schedule to your LG-enabled car system, so you can be guided directly to your first appointment when you wake up in the morning. (All of which will give you more time to watch ""Game of Thrones"" on your LG widescreen OLED Ultra HD television and play Candy Crush Soda on your LG tablet, naturally.) But as you can tell, the problem with Internet of Things is that it depends on your having the right things -- ""smart,"" ""connected"" things. And LG and Samsung and Sony and the other brands that paid millions to appear at CES aren't exactly handing them out for free. A standard light bulb costs a dollar. But a Philips Hue bulb, whose intensity and color you can adjust with your smartphone, costs $60. And that's not even including the cost of a Hue Bridge ($200), which allows you to manage up to 50 Hue bulbs, or Hue Remote Switches ($60), which let you control your lights if your smartphone isn't handy. For home security, you might find an August Smart Lock useful -- letting you deadbolt your door using a smartphone even when you're far away from home. That'll run you $250 (though it comes in four colors, including August Red and Champagne!). And if an intruder tries to come through a window, your smart Canary camera system can sound the alarm and send you a picture of the trespasser, at a price tag of $200 for every opening you want protected. The list of smart, connected things that manufacturers want you to add to your smart, connected life gets even more elaborate from there. If you're constantly worrying about whether you have enough fuel to fire up the family gathering you've been planning (and who doesn't?), Quirky will sell you a wi-fi enabled Refuel Smart Propane Tank gauge for just $50. After you eat, you can play in your pool (with your comfort managed by Vigilant's LilyPad floating wi-fi enabled thermometer and UV sensor, $100) or take a nap on your $4999 self-adjusting, digitally enabled ReST Bed from Boditrack. Don't worry about having a few too many helpings. Your Belty smart belt will automatically let itself out a few notches (the maker is still figuring out what to charge for it, but says it's a ""luxe"" product for ""upscale"" customers, so, expensive). Of course, you won't want to hit the hay without brushing your teeth first — and your Kolibree smart toothbrush will let you automatically track and share how well you polish your molars for just $99 to $200. That just covers the human members of your family, of course. We haven't even mentioned CES's burgeoning array of products for the Internet of Pets — from the Voyce wearable fitness tracker for dogs to the PetNet smart connected feeder — or the Edyn Garden Sensor and the Parrot intelligent plant pot. The bottom line is that it all sounds great, until you realize that unlike the infrastructure of the Internet, which was laid down by the Department of Defense, major universities and cable and telecom companies, or of the wireless world, whose antennas are paid for by mobile operators, the bill for the IoT's infrastructure is coming out of your own wallet (Wocket has one that digitally stores up to 10,000 credit cards, syncs with your smartphone and unlocks with your fingerprint, for just $150). And the smarter and more connected your devices are...the thinner that wallet is going to be. Which means that when you look at your bank balance after splurging on the IoT, you might feel a bit like an IdioT.","Jeff Yang: The buzzword in tech is ""Internet of Things,"" where devices are interconnected .

"Golf players just keep getting younger. First there was Guan Tianlang, who at the tender age of 13 became the youngest player to participate in a European Tour event. But this May, a Chinese 12 year-old will eclipse Guan's record to become the European Tour's youngest ever golfer. From the city of Dongguan, Ye Wocheng finished two under par at the Western China qualifier to earn one of the three spots on offer for the China Open -- the tournament where Guan made his European Tour debut in April 2012. Now 14, Guan will become the youngest player to compete in the Masters when he takes to the course at Augusta next month. Competing as an amateur, Guan finished tied for 150th at last year's China Open event, which was won by South Africa's Branden Grace. Ye, whose father caddied for him, shot a four-under-par opening round of 68 on Tuesday to put himself in contention before pulling clear of the field over the front nine on Wednesday. Four birdies saw him head to the turn on seven under, but Ye collapsed at the par five 16th where he dropped three strokes. But the 12-year-old had done enough to ensure he finished third on the leaderboard behind joint winners Li Xinyang and Jin Da Xing. Should Ye do the unthinkable and win the China Open, which will take place at the Binhai Lake Golf Club, he would assume Matteo Manassero's mantel as the youngest ever winner on the European Tour.

"U.N. inspectors prepared to examine the site of a suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria on Monday, a strike a U.S. official said was all but certain was carried out by the embattled Syrian government. Rebel forces and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government have been blaming each other for Wednesday's reported attack in a suburb of Damascus, which opposition members say killed hundreds. Gruesome video of the aftermath showed numerous bodies, including women and children. The U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak on the record, said the evidence pointing to government forces goes beyond images and open-source reporting from doctors and others. ""There is nothing credible to indicate that the rebels, either the Syrian National Council or even al-Nusra Front, have used chemical weapons,"" the official said. ""Only the Assad regime is responsible for chemical weapons use."" The Syrian government has steadfastly denied its forces used chemical weapons outside Damascus or elsewhere and repeated the denial Sunday. But a second U.S. official said Sunday that tissue samples were collected from the scene in the hours and days after the August 21 attack. The official says the evidence was ""collected by multiple international sources"" and was being analyzed in secure locations. The official would not say how the samples were collected or specify where the analysis was taking place. But with the United States and its allies warning of military action, Syria's leading ally invoked the history of Western claims about Iraq urged Washington to avoid ""a reckless enterprise."" Russia's Foreign Ministry said unilateral force that bypassed the United Nations would ""undermine international efforts to find a political and diplomatic solution to the Syrian conflict, lead to its further escalation and have an extremely destructive effect on what already is an explosive situation in the Middle East."" ""All this is reminiscent of events of 10 years ago in which, using false information that the Iraqis possessed weapons of mass destruction as a pretext and bypassing the United Nations, the United States launched a reckless enterprise with consequences that everyone is well aware of,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman A.K. Lukashevich said in a written statement. The statement added: ""Our American and European partners should realize what catastrophic consequences such a policy would have for the region, for the Arab world, and for the entire Islamic world."" Syria agrees to stop shooting during U.N. inspection . These developments came as a top Syrian official told CNN on Sunday that the government would allow U.N. inspectors full access to any site of a suspected chemical weapons attack. The agreement is effective immediately, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al Mekdad said. The U.N. secretary-general's office said inspectors hope to begin their investigation Monday at the suspected chemical attack site. The Syrian government has agreed to cease all hostilities as long as the U.N. inspectors are on the ground. Before Sunday, U.N. inspectors in Syria attempting to gather information were not allowed to visit the site of the recent attack. But one senior Obama administration official said the Syrian government's announcement was too little, too late. ""If the Syrian government had nothing to hide and wanted to prove to the world that it had not used chemical weapons in this incident, it would have ceased its attacks on the area and granted immediate access to the U.N. -- five days ago,"" the official said. ""At this juncture, the belated decision by the regime to grant access to the U.N. team is too late to be credible, including because the evidence available has been significantly corrupted as a result of the regime's persistent shelling and other intentional actions over the last five days,"" the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said in a statement. ""Based on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured, witness accounts, and other facts gathered by open sources, the U.S. intelligence community, and international partners, there is very little doubt at this point that a chemical weapon was used by the Syrian regime against civilians in this incident."" The same senior Obama administration official said the United States is ""continuing to assess the facts so the president can make an informed decision about how to respond to this indiscriminate use of chemical weapons."" Last year, while discussing the situation in Syria, President Barack Obama said ""a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized."" The Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region, and two key members of U.S. congressional foreign affairs panels said Sunday they expect the United States to strike Syria after reports of chemical weapons attacks in that country. On Friday, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the American military was providing Obama ""with options for all contingencies, and that requires positioning our forces [and] positioning our assets to be able to carry out whatever options the president might choose."" Jihadist group vows revenge . Meanwhile, the jihadist group al-Nusra Front, which has ties to al Qaeda, vowed Sunday to avenge the suspected chemical attack by targeting villages populated by Syria's Alawite minority, the sect to which al-Assad belongs. Competing claims on chemical weapons use in Syria . An audio message posted on YouTube, purportedly from al-Nusra leader Abu Muhammad al-Joulani, accuses the Syrian regime  of bombarding eastern Ghouta ""with tens of missiles"" carrying a ""suffocating chemical agent,"" killing ""hundreds of children, women and men."" ""We are announcing a series of revenge operations called 'An Eye for an Eye.' Your Alawite villages will pay a very dear price for every chemical rocket that you've launched against our people."" According to Syrian state-run television's depiction of events, government forces came across the site of the gas attack when they entered the rebel stronghold of Jobar on the edge of Damascus. The bodies of some of those killed in the attack early Wednesday had been found there. Several of the soldiers were ""suffocating"" from exposure to gases as they entered the city, according to state TV. ""It is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area,"" Syrian TV reported, citing an anonymous source. The government uses the term ""terrorists"" to describe rebel forces. Broadcast video showed a room containing gas masks, gas canisters and other paraphernalia that could be used in a gas attack. The army said it uncovered the cache in a storage facility in Jobar. CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video. ""We said it from the first moment and, here, we assure again that we have never used chemical weapons (around Jobar) or any other region in any form whatsoever -- ... liquid, gas or whatever,"" Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said in an interview on Lebanese television. He blamed the rebels. Syria's refugee children will be the ones to rebuild . Opposition accusations . The rebels say that government forces fired rockets into the heavily populated civilian area. Opposition spokesman Badr Jamous from the Syrian National Coalition claimed that some of the rockets delivered chemical payloads. More than 1,300 people were killed, most of them by gas, said Khaled al-Saleh, another spokesman for the group. Al-Saleh said that medical teams in the affected area had administered 25,000 shots of atropine -- a medication used to treat people exposed to the nerve gas sarin -- after the attack. Doctors Without Borders said three hospitals it supports in Syria's Damascus governorate reported having received some 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms last Wednesday morning. ""The reported symptoms of the patients, in addition to the epidemiological pattern of the events -- characterized by the massive influx of patients in a short period of time, the origin of the patients, and the contamination of medical and first aid workers -- strongly indicate mass exposure to a neurotoxic agent,"" said Dr. Bart Janssens, director of operations. Video showed rows of bodies without apparent injury, as well as people suffering convulsions or who appeared to be struggling to breathe. CNN could not verify where or when the videos were recorded, and could not confirm the number of casualties.

"In a gesture toward the romance of Valentine's Day, Pope Francis on Friday gave his advice on how to have a happy marriage before thousands of young engaged couples. The unprecedented event, held under brilliant winter sunshine in a packed St. Peter's Square in Vatican City, may reflect Francis' desire to be closer to ordinary people's lives. Three couples were able to put their own questions directly to the Pontiff before being blessed. His answers were shared with the 25,000 or so people from around the world spread out in the square before him. The first young couple to speak explained how they had decided to get married. ""We didn't want to give in to the easy way of not committing,"" the man said. The couple asked the Pontiff to give them his advice on how to make a lasting marriage. Francis, himself committed to lifelong celibacy as a Catholic priest, said that many people are afraid these days to make ""definite decisions"" and long-lasting choices -- but that it can be done. 'Don't be afraid to marry' ""Today, everything is changing rapidly and nothing lasts for long. This sort of mentality leads so many who are getting ready for marriage to say they will be together for as long as love lasts,"" which can lead to divorce, he said. Love has to be built together, he said, not alone. ""To build such a thing means to help your love grow,"" he said. ""Dear engaged people, you are getting ready to grow together, to build a home, to live together for good. Do not just base it on those feelings that come and go, but on the rock of true love that comes from God,"" he said. Francis also took to Twitter to encourage those who are in love to take the plunge and tie the knot. ""Dear young people, don't be afraid to marry.  A faithful and fruitful marriage will bring you happiness,"" he said on his official @Pontifex account. Don't go to bed angry . A second couple in St. Peter's Square told Francis of how their love and commitment had changed their lives, before the woman asked for the Pope's advice on how to live together day to day. ""Living together is an art. It's a patient art, it's a beautiful art, it's fascinating,"" Francis replied. He spoke of the need to communicate with respect and attention, ""to request politely so that you enter with courtesy into the life of the other."" That isn't easy, he said. Each half of the couple must learn to say thank you, and to apologize for his or her mistakes. ""We all know there isn't a perfect family, neither a perfect husband nor a perfect wife. Of course, we are not talking about the perfect mother-in-law,"" he joked. ""Do not end any day without asking each other for forgiveness, having peace back in your house and your family,"" he said. ""Never end a single day without being at peace with each other. This is the secret in order to preserve love."" The third couple's question dealt with how to celebrate their marriage. Francis said the key thing was not to have a wild party, though the celebration is important, but to feel the presence of Jesus. The dress, flowers and food are important, but only if the couple are there in a true spirit of love, he said. St. Valentine was a third-century Roman priest who is widely believed to have been martyred on February 14 for his beliefs. He has since become the patron saint of love and engaged couples.","Pope Francis: ""Dear young people, don't be afraid to marry""

"The brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri is proposing to mediate a peace deal between the West and Islamists. In an exclusive interview with CNN, Mohamed al-Zawahiri unveiled his proposal for the first time, saying he is in a unique position to help end the violence and that both sides need to make concessions. As the al Qaeda leader's brother, he says they are ideologically inseparable, and that if anyone can talk his brother out of violence it's him. He is like so many former prisoners I've met -- calm, collected, focused and utterly convinced by long held views examined, tested and reforged in incarceration. Mohamed al-Zawahiri is not a physically imposing man. His long beard is shading from gray to white, his features and figure drawn. Ramadan is long over but he still fasts until the sun goes down. Mohamed spent 14 years in Egyptian jail on charges including terrorism and involvement in the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat 1981. He denies the charges. On 9/11, al Qaeda looks to Syria to revive its fortunes . For five years he was in solitary confinement in a cell 180 centimeters by 180 centimeters (6 feet by 6 feet) where, locked in with his own thoughts, he had plenty of time to plan what to do when released. That day came a few months ago in May. He wants peace, he says, between Muslims and non-Muslims and has written a proposal that outlines the terms. He says he's offering to be an intermediary between Islamists and the United States and the West. ""I don't represent a certain group. My role is a mediator between the West and them."" A source with direct knowledge of Egyptian government talks with jihadists in the Sinai says al-Zawahiri is helping negotiations. The source says al-Zawahiri has the respect of the Islamists and the trust of the new government. Al-Zawahiri says his offer puts him at risk from radical Islamists, but says he is not acting from weakness or for personal gain. His six-page proposal offers a 10-year truce if the following terms are met. In brief they are: . • U.S. and West to stop intervening in Muslim lands• U.S. to stop interfering in Muslim education• U.S. to end the war on Islam• U.S. to release all Islamist prisoners. The document also calls on Islamists to change their behavior too: . • Stop attacks on Western and U.S. interests• Protect legitimate Western and U.S. interests in Muslim lands• Stop provoking the U.S. and the West . Through his steely determination to get his voice heard and his message out it is hard to gauge how much hope al-Zawahiri is really investing in his initiative. Is he trying to get back in the jihadist spotlight he once occupied before his incarceration? Al Qaeda diminished, but not gone . Back then he was military commander of Islamic Jihad that would later ally with al Qaeda. Back then he reportedly had disagreements with his brother about the way forward for the group. Then came his came his arrest, long before 9/11, picked up, he says, by Egyptian authorities in the United Arab Emirates. He says he told his interrogators he could work a truce with Islamists but he says his jailers didn't want to know. ""If this idea had succeeded, September 11 would not have even happened in the first place. I hope this opportunity today is not wasted."" Osama bin Laden had a similar proposal in 2004. It was followed a year later by the deadly 7/7 subway attack in London killing 52 people. Al-Zawahiri offers no guarantees that he has some quick fix. ""This is a very tough mission. You have to be logical. If you want to live in peace then you must make others feel that they will live in peace."" He says his brother will listen to him, but admits he hasn't talked to him in long over a decade. While he once had standing among his Islamist peers, the reach of his influence today is hard to judge; being connected by blood to one of the world's most wanted men only carries so much weight. The cost, he says, of getting out of today's conflict must be paid. ""We want to turn this page and forget the past."" It wouldn't be the first time the terms are unacceptably high.

"(CNN) -- If you're white, you may be able to shoplift, drive drunk, even shove a police officer -- and not suffer the same consequences a black person might, according to trending stories being shared on social media. #CrimingWhileWhite became Twitter's highest trending topic in the United States and a trending topic worldwide as protests continued Thursday morning over a New York grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the chokehold death of Eric Garner, a black man suspected of illegally selling cigarettes on the sidewalk. Garner's case also catapulted other hashtags into prominence in the Twitterverse, including #ICantBreathe, a reference to Garner's last words. An attempt by the New York Police Department to acknowledge the anger also generated a storm online. The department said on Twitter that it wanted to rebuild public trust, in a post that included #wehearyou. That backfired. Meanwhile, many people identifying themselves as white posted tweets confessing to crimes they said they committed without getting punished. Each specific account could not be verified independently and immediately. Taken as a whole, however, they paint a portrait that suggests a racial double standard by American law enforcement. ""I shoplifted when I was 14 and they let me go because my parents came down and we 'looked like a nice family,'"" wrote Joel Watson, a cartoonist. Allison Brown, an editor, tweeted ""Tonight, black protester & I both ignore barricade & walk in street. 4 cops pounce on him; I'm told to get in the pen."" Artist Jeremy Scheuch confessed, ""I'm not proud of it, but when I was 22 I pushed a cop when I was drunk at a bar. I was told to go home and 'sleep it off.'"" ""When I see police, I feel safe, served, and protected,"" commented writer Kyran Pittman. ""That shouldn't be a privilege, but #CrimingWhileWhite shows that it is."" On Twitter, black users had mixed reactions. ""Are white ppl openly acknowledging white privilege on police interactions or am I dreaming?"" asked blogger and researcher Maya Reid. ""Some of you have pointed out that #CrimingWhileWhite helps other White folks realize policing isn't fair. My heart still hurts,"" said writer Elon James White. ""I just hope people contributing to #CrimingWhileWhite are vocal about these disparities offline. Great, you're trending but we need action,"" tweeted Franchesca Ramsey, a curator at Upworthy. Unequal treatment . The anecdotes are backed by evidence that suggests racial disparities in American law enforcement are very real. Studies show that for an identical crime, black teenagers are more likely to be arrested or jailed than white teenagers. Black people are around four times as likely to get arrested for marijuana possession, despite surveys showing black people use marijuana less than white people, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In Ferguson, where protests have continued over the shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown, official reports show black people being pulled over, searched, and arrested at disproportionately high rates compared to their share of the population. An ACLU study found a similar imbalance in Boston, where two-thirds of police stops involved black residents -- despite black people making up just one-quarter of the city's population. Even after being convicted of a crime, being white may still hold advantages. A Princeton University study examined hundreds of American employers' hiring and found that white people with felony convictions were preferred as much as black people with clean backgrounds.","White internet users are using the hashtag #CrimingWhileWhite to confess to crimes .

"(CNN) -- Bowe Bergdahl wanted a life of adventure. People attend a vigil for Bergdahl in Hailey, Idaho, on Wednesday. He was a seeker, a hard worker, a man raised in a small town, an avid outdoorsman who took ballet lessons. By the age of 23, he had learned to navigate the high seas on an expedition that took him from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. He didn't care for cars, choosing to bike to and from odd jobs he worked to pay for his travels, friends say. ""He's a good kid,"" said his hometown buddy Dylan Fulmer. ""Strong as an ox."" While working on a commercial fishing vessel in Alaska, Bergdahl told Fulmer he was dreaming of riding his motorcycle around the world. ""This kid is crazy,"" laughed Fulmer, recalling his reaction to his friend's ambitions. ""There's no land all the way around the world. Then he explained the whole boat process. Biking around the world, that's one heckuva feat right there.""  Watch how friends recall adventurous Bergdahl » . Enlisting in the U.S. Army was another way for him to understand the world, but has become a horrific encounter with the darker side. Pvt. Bowe Bergdahl was captured three weeks ago in the Paktika province in southeastern Afghanistan, according to the Department of Defense. The Taliban is holding him, threatening to kill him if foreign troops continue search operations in Ghazni and Paktika provinces, which they claim target civilians, according to Taliban commander Mulvi Sangeen contacted by telephone by CNN Friday at an undisclosed location. On Sunday, a video was released of Bergdahl dressed in loose fitting blue clothes and sitting on the floor in a location that American officials are not pinpointing publicly. The soldier seems to get choked up when he speaks of his family -- his parents, siblings, nieces and nephew -- and the girlfriend he hopes to marry. ""I have a very, very good family that I love back home in America, and I miss them every day that I'm gone,"" he says. ""I miss them, and I'm afraid I might never see them again and that I'll never be able to tell them I love them again. I'll never be able to hug them. I'm scared I won't be able to go home. It is very unnerving to be a prisoner,"" he says. He adds that he's being treated like ""a guest."" It's unclear if he is speaking from a script his captors are ordering him to follow. Bergdahl's family members, who live in a small rustic home tucked in the woods outside Ketchum, Idaho, have chosen not to speak to reporters. The Bergdahls released a statement earlier this week: ""We appreciate and take comfort in all the kind words and support we've heard."" ""We'd like to ask that your concern for our son Bowe also be shared with all of our American service members in harm's way around the world. We are very grateful to all of them."" Bowe Bergdahl was home schooled and taught chivalry at a young age, friends and neighbors of his family say. He is able to have a conversation with anyone, and has a natural curiosity. ""Bowe is not somebody in the corner,"" said Sue Martin, the owner of Zaney's Coffee Shop in nearby Hailey, Idaho, where Bergdahl once worked as a barista. ""You engage and he engages very well."" ""He captures you,"" Martin said. She recalled going to her car after a snowstorm and seeing that the snow had been scrapped off. ""Bowe would have been out there... He would never say anything,"" Martin said. Her shop has become the epicenter of hometown support, with people leaving notes to him. ""Always a knight searching for what is good and right and true in the world,"" one of them read. One rainy evening, Blaine Country Sheriff Walt Femling spotted Bergdahl walking his bike on the side of the road, completely drenched. ""I stopped to give him a ride and he turned it down because he didn't want to get my car wet and he continued to walk in the rain. Kind of tells you a little bit about the person,"" recalled Femling, who know Bergdahl through renting him an apartment the sheriff owned. ""I don't usually rent to 20-year-olds,"" Femling said, but he trusted Bergdahl. ""There's not many young people who have the kind manners he has,"" said neighbor Minna Casser. ""He's a gentleman and a sportsman. He did some yard work for us. And he didn't just do the job, he went above and beyond what was expected."" And for all the complimentary things people in Blaine County, Idaho, are saying at Bowe Bergdahl, they all make sure at least one thing is understood. This is not a young man who backs down. Dan Collins is a fishing boat captain who hired Bergdahl for 10 weeks two summers ago, pulling for sockeye salmon in Bristol Bay, Alaska, up for 18 to 20 hours a day. ""It's just hard, grueling work, hours per day. But he was up to it,"" said Collins. ""I am at times not the easiest guy to get along with, being a fishing boat's captain. But I imagine I am easy compared to what he is dealing with everyday now."" CNN's Ed Lavandera, Paul Vercammen, Ashley Fantz and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.","Bowe Bergdahl tough under adverse circumstances, friends say .

"Seoul (CNN) -- South Korea admitted Thursday that it held a secret meeting with the North last month. The meeting was to persuade North Korea to apologize for the sinking of a South Korean warship Cheonan 15 months ago and the shelling of Yeongpyong Island last November, Unification minister Hyun in-Taek told parliament. Fifty South Koreans were killed in those attacks. However, North Korean officials said South Korea had asked for a series of summits at the May 9 secret meeting. However, the North Korean National Defence Commission said South Korea had asked for a series of summits at the May 9 secret meeting. North Korean state media quoted the commission saying South Korea wanted to have ministerial-level talks in late May. It also wanted to hold the first round of summit talks in June at Panmunjom, a truce village on the border where meetings between north and south take place, and a second round of talks during the nuclear security summit in Berlin in March next year, KCNA reported. Pyongyang says it declined as the South had asked it to apologize for last year's attacks. Pyongyang denies responsibility for the sinking of the warship. The NDC also claimed South Korean officials had begged for a summit and offered bribes. In a statement, the South Korean unification ministry expressed regret at the North's revelation, saying ""It is not worthy to respond to unilateral claims that distort our true intentions."" State Department spokesman Mark Toner said in a news briefing Wednesday that he did not see it as a ratcheting up of tensions, but ""we've been consistent in saying North Korea needs to improve North-South relations before we move forward, ceasing provocative actions.""

"From Chicago, to Georgia, to Southern California, a new social media application is causing problems on middle school and high school campuses across the United States. It's called Yik Yak, a location-based app that creates an anonymous social chat room where up to 500 nearby users connect through GPS tracking on their phones. Less than 4 months old, Yik Yak has ""a couple hundred thousand users, mainly in Southeast/East coast campuses,"" its co-founder Brooks Buffington said. Users are limited to 200 characters, and no pictures are allowed. If a post is ""down voted"" enough times by other users on the forum, the comment disappears. Tech experts are comparing the new Atlanta-based app to a cross between SnapChat and Twitter. ""The app was made for college-age users or above, for college campuses and to act as a virtual bulletin board, so it acts as local Twitter for their campus,"" Buffington told CNN. Although the app is meant for users age 17 and older, younger users can still sign up, and that's where the issues have sprouted. School administrators in Chicago said teens in some of their schools have used the free app for cyberbullying. Others have made anonymous bomb threats that have led to school lockdowns. ""Students were actually coming downstairs to talk to administration, and they were mentioning remarks posted and student names that were obvious, so of course that is going to impact you,"" Melvin Soto, assistant vice principal at Whitney Young High School, told CNN affiliate WLS. Some students have compared it to a virtual bathroom wall where users post vitriol and hate. ""They ripped on someone for getting raped, and that's just so wrong. They said a whole lot of bad things about this girl,"" Whitney Young student Rachel Brown told WLS. In southern California, a San Clemente High School resource officer told CNN a threatening Yik Yak post caused a bomb scare on campus. ""The school was placed on lockdown, we conducted a sweep utilizing our bomb squad and bomb-sniffing dogs and nothing suspicious was located on or near the campus,"" Orange County Sheriff's spokesman Jeff Hallock told CNN. He added that the app is so new that some students hadn't even heard about it yet. In Georgia, the principal of Webb Bridge Middle School in Fulton County wrote a cautionary letter to parents warning them about the ""inflammatory [Yik Yak] app,"" encouraging them to talk to their children about the ""dangers of social media."" The school district has blocked the app from its network, but Principal Susan Opferman writes, students have found ways around that too. ""If used inappropriately, Yik Yak posts can be especially vicious and hurtful, since there is no way to trace their source, and can be disseminated widely,"" Opferman said in the letter. These types of incidents have caused the app's developers to disable it in some areas. Buffington told CNN he doesn't want high school students using the app. ""One of the things we were planning to do is to essentially geo-sense every high school and middle school in America, so if they try to open the app in their school, it will say something like 'no, no no, looks like you are trying to open the app on a high school or middle school and this is only for college kids,' and it will disable it and the app won't work,"" Buffington told CNN. ""That will completely eliminate the problem we have been seeing, so we geo-sensed the entire city of Chicago until we get this fix up.  We are working on getting third-party help to get the fix in place as soon as possible."" But cyberbullying expert Justin W. Patchin says that's just a short-term solution. He says teens will figure out a way around it. ""It is pretty impossible to limit it to the ages that the founders have intended,"" said Patchin, who is the co-director at the Cyberbullying Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. ""When I signed up for the app, it said that you have to be 17 or above to sign in, and of course, there wasn't any way of them checking my age so anybody could sign up."" The app's developers defended their technology, saying it is used for good. ""With anonymity comes a lot of responsibility, and college kids have the maturity that it takes to handle those responsibilities,"" Buffington said. ""One of my favorite use case stories is a freshman missed his flight for Christmas break, and he came back to campus and he posted on Yik Yak that the freshman dorms were closed, and so an upperclassman let him crash on his couch,"" Buffington said. ""Anonymity can be a really beautiful thing, and one of the reasons we made it anonymous is it gives people a blank slate to work from, so you're not judged on your race or sexuality or gender.  On Yik Yak you are purely judged on content you create."" Buffington said. He added, ""The longer that we are around on college campuses, the better it gets."" As more applications pop up and the environments of social networking sites change, Patchin says the emphasis should be on teaching younger generations about respect in online communities. ""It is more important to talk to the students about how to treat each other respectfully. Whether it is happening in an application like this or Facebook or on e-mail, the emphasis for us has always been on those behaviors because it is easier to teach that than to restrict that to particular technology.""","Yik Yak creates an anonymous chat room of users connected by location .

"It has been a starting point for some of the world's top soccer players. As youngsters, the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Andrea Pirlo, Carlos Tevez, Javier Mascherano, Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka all played in the Mondial Montaigu youth tournament in France. Known as ""Mondial Minimes,"" the 40-year-old competition is contested by under-16 national teams over Easter, with an event also held for club sides. Leading  French clubs Lorient, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Nantes, Montpellier and St Etienne are all involved this year alongside another lesser-known name -- Foot Solidaire. Its a team that will showcase the very best of Africa's talent, but which also aims to open young African players' eyes to the risks of seeking their fortunes in Europe's top leagues. The team has been put together by Culture Foot Solidaire (CFS) -- a Paris-based charity which campaigns against the dangers of the trafficking of young players by unscrupulous individuals; be they former players, businessmen, lawyers or unlicensed agents. ""I've heard a lot about less ethical agents bribing parents, and I have no doubt about the methods,"" one agent, who asked not to be identified, told CNN. ""I know of agents using the parents' ''money weapon' (promising them untold riches), kind of 'selling' the player to an agent or organization. ""How many times was I offered that option? Not only agents though. An agent cannot do anything without a club at end of the line."" The movement of African players to Europe is long established. European clubs generally regard African players as athletically and technically gifted. Arguably just as importantly, they are relatively cheap to develop, with the added potential that clubs can make a large profit if they are sold in the future. For the players, the idea of becoming of a professional footballer in Europe holds the promise of a better life for themselves abroad and their families back home -- if they are not discarded by clubs and left to fend for themselves. Smuggling players . CFS's founder is Cameroonian Jean-Claude Mbvoumin, who has already helped hundreds of youngsters return home after they were left stranded in Europe. Often they have been brought to Europe on an illegal passport, frequently taken first to eastern Europe, where it is easier to arrange a visa before moving them on to Western countries. Mbvoumin estimates each year as many as 700 youngsters leave Cameroon alone to seek a professional career. But if the club doesn't sign the player the youngster is left to his own devices as to how he returns to Africa. ""To bring young players to this tournament is a very good experience for them,"" the 39-year-old Mbvoumin, who played for a number of lower league French clubs, told CNN, as he explained the reason behind entering in the Montaigu tournament. ""Very few can become professionals and our goal is to explain how hard to become is to do so. It's important to dream, but they must realize how few players there are in the professional world."" At one stage CFS was monitoring nearly 1,000 boys dumped in France. It believes these youngsters were taken from hundreds of football academies in Africa -- ones that don't recognize basic child protection issues -- by clubs desperate to unearth the next Yaya Toure, Michael Essien or Claude Makelele. ""When I brought players from Africa -- either for trial or on a contract  -- I always faced a huge problem: visas,"" added the anonymous agent, referring to players over the age of 18 rather than minors, as he detailed the complexities of such transfers. ""And I am talking of a period when things were easier, that is, 10 years ago. ""I visited consulates with players trying to get a visa -- and I had to present the proper paperwork such as invitations and return tickets, etc. -- otherwise the player's application would not even be considered."" However the agent said he did once manage ""to smuggle"" a player out of his home country Cameroon. ""He had already gotten a visa -- the Italian consulate would only grant a tourist visit once a year -- so I had to find a way to get him out again,"" the agent said. ""Yaounde being a modern airport I decided to fly from Douala, where the lights at the airport were dimmer. It was an amazing experience because in order to get to the plane we passed through four security controls. ""The last one was at the plane's door -- and lights were stronger than in Yaounde -- and I had made a 'change' on his stamped visa. We managed to pass this last obstacle anyway and the player made a reasonable career."" Money, money . Foot Solidaire's team for this year's Montaigu tournament is made up from players from Cameroon. More than 500 players have been assessed since January, before their 25-man squad was selected. Those players, who have been preparing for the tournament at a training camp in Nantes, came from as many as 100 training centers in Cameroon, which have all signed up to CFS's objectives to protect the young players who are being trained. Its charter is designed to provide the players with the best possible training environment, and it recognizes world governing body FIFA's regulations as well as the United Nations Convention on Human Rights. Mbvoumin estimates CFS is working with as many as 2,500 players -- this on a miniscule budget of just over $100,000. ""We don't have salaries and we rely on volunteers,"" he said. ""We have a very important network of partners and we rely on very small donations. But we need help -- our organization has been in existence for 13 years. ""Football can just be business, business and money, money. People forget about education and the protection of young players -- football should not be above the law."" Mbvoumin recently featured in a documentary film called ""Soka Afrika"" that traced the journey of two African footballers -- South Africa's Kermit Romeo Erasmus and Cameroonian Julien Ndomo Sabo -- as they attempt to fulfil their dreams of playing professional football in Europe. At the age of 18, Erasmus signed a professional contract with Dutch club Feyenoord, though he is back now in South Africa with Supersport United, where he is the team's captain. Sabo was trafficked to Africa as teenager after he and his family were promised ""riches beyond their imagination,"" before he was abandoned in Paris. ""Ndomo has been a bit off the radar for the last few weeks,"" said Sam Potter, managing director and chief executive officer of Masnomis, the production company behind the film. ""But following a series of injury setbacks he and (Spanish club) Deportivo La Coruna -- where he eventually signed in 2010 -- agreed to terminate his contract last year. ""He is still signed up with Octagon sports agency and they are hopeful of finding him another club in Europe for next season."" Potter said Mbvoumin  and CFS "" work tirelessly on a shoestring budget to provide support and education to vulnerable and exploited young African footballers"", despite a lack of interest and funding from the wider football community. ""I have had the privilege of working with Jean-Claude in the making of Soka Afrika and I would say that he is a genuine hero -- working for little reward beyond his love of the game and, more importantly, his deep respect for the human rights of all men, women and children.""","Some of the world's leading players have appeared at France's Montaigu youth tournament .

"(CNN) -- ""When I got married I was scared,"" remembers 10-year-old Nujood Ali. ""I didn't want to leave my family and siblings."" Yemeni lawyer Shada Nasser helped 10-year-old Nujood Ali divorce her 30-year-old husband. At an age when girls in the West still play with dolls, Nujood found herself married to a man three times her age. But in her home country of Yemen -- a deeply conservative Middle East Muslim nation -- this situation isn't uncommon. Yemeni lawyer Shada Nasser had long opposed the practice of early marriage when, in April 2008, she got a chance to do something about it. Arriving at the courthouse for her usual casework one day, Nasser was told about a young girl who had come to court alone. She met Nujood, who told her that she was desperate; she wanted a divorce. Nasser says she was appalled by Nujood's story, particularly her claims that her 30-year-old husband regularly beat and raped her. It was unheard of for such a young girl to get a divorce, but Nasser didn't hesitate to take the case. ""When I spoke with her, I [felt] like she [was] my daughter,"" Nasser recalls. ""I hugged her and said, 'Don't be afraid. I will help you and you will take the divorce.'"" Since then, Nasser has volunteered to help other young brides, and is working to raise the legal age for marriage in Yemen. As a lawyer and activist, Nasser has always promoted the rights of women and children. Born in the progressive southern region of Yemen, she was raised in an affluent family. She graduated from law school in 1990 in Prague, which was then part of Czechoslovakia. Her father, a journalist and union organizer, died when she was young, but Nasser inherited his crusading instincts and has spent much of her career challenging the status quo. Among the first female lawyers in the capital city of Sanaa, Nasser has defended several women who she believes were wrongfully accused of crimes. ""I believe in being a lawyer to help people,"" she says. By striving to end early marriage, Nasser is challenging a custom that's been part of Yemeni culture for centuries. Extreme poverty leads some parents to marry off their daughters, while others do it to protect the girls from spinsterhood, or from potentially shaming the family by getting involved with a man out of wedlock. Some find justification in the Quran. Sanaa University's Woman and Development Study Center found that more than 50 percent of Yemeni women are married before they are 18; in some regions, 8- and 10-year-old brides are the norm. The 1992 law that set Yemen's marriage age at 15 was later amended to allow even younger girls to wed with parental approval. However, they are not supposed to have sexual relations until they are ""mature,"" a stipulation that's difficult to enforce. When Nujood's parents agreed for her to be married, they believed they were putting her in the care of her husband's family. Nujood's father, Ali Mohammed Ahdal, is angry about what the man did to his daughter. ""He was a criminal, a criminal. He did hateful things to her,"" he said. ""He didn't keep his promise to me that he wouldn't go near her until she was 20."" Specialists believe that young girls giving birth at an early age has contributed to Yemen having one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world, according to the United Nations Population Fund. After Nasser took Nujood's case, reporters packed the courtroom. When the judge dissolved the marriage, the story made headlines around the world. Sharia law dictated that Nujood pay her husband more than $200, which was covered by donations.  Watch Nujood and Nasser tell their story » . Now happily back home with her family, Nujood hopes to become a journalist, and says she never wants to get remarried. Reflecting on her experience, she shows a maturity beyond her 10 years. ""I did this so that people listen and think to not marry girls so young,"" Nujood says. ""Like what happened to me.""  Watch Nasser explain how Nujood has become a symbol for girls in Yemen » . Nujood's case sparked a nationwide debate about the marriage age; Nasser and others hope to raise it to 18. Having already been contacted by other child brides, she's vowed to help as many of them as she can, for free. ""I and Nujood, we opened this big window for all other girls,"" Nasser says. ""Nujood's case is going to change a lot of things, and will better the lives of hundreds of young girls who live in the countryside.""","Yemeni lawyer Shada Nasser helped a 10-year-old divorce her 30-year-old husband .

"(CNN)  -- South Korea beat fellow World Cup finalists Ivory Coast 2-0 in a friendly international at Loftus Road in London on Wednesday. Lee Dong-gook's early strike put the Koreans on their way to victory which was sealed by Kwak Tae-hwi's late header. Both teams had several English Premier League stars in their ranks, with Korea captained by Manchester United's Park Ji-sung while the Ivorians had Chelsea's Didier Drogba and Portsmouth's Aruna Dindane in attack and Arsenal's Emmanuel Eboue in defense. Drogba came close several times for the Elephants, who crashed out in the quarterfinals of the Africa Cup of Nations to Algeria, and are without a coach after the subsequent sacking of Vahid Halihodzic. The Ivory Coast have been linked with former Chelsea and Russia boss Guus Hiddink and need to show an improvement with Brazil and Portugal in a tough group in South Africa. It was the Koreans who gave their rowdy supporters at the home of second flight English side Queens Park Rangers the most to cheer and they were ahead in the fourth minute. A free-kick from Cha Du-ri was only partially cleared and Dong-gook showed superb technique by volleying it past Boubacar Barry. Park nearly gave the Koreans a two-goal cushion but he was denied by an excellent block by Souleman Bamba. United ace Park also saw a shot drift just wide after the break, but in the dying moments they grabbed a deserved second as Kwak headed in Kim Jae-sung's free-kick. It proved a generally round of friendlies for Africa's World Cup qualifiers with Algeria, who are in England's group, thrashed 3-0 at home by Serbia, who are also in the finals. Marko Pantelic, Zdravko Kuzmanovic and Dusko Tosic scored as Rabah Saadane's team were easily beaten . Meanwhile, World Cup hosts South Africa were held 1-1 at home my minnows Namiba who saw Rudolf Bester give them a shock 42nd minute lead. Ghana were beaten 2-1 by Bosnia despite going ahead through Sulley Muntari after 22 minutes but the Super Eagles of Nigeria beat the DR Congo 5-2 as they build up to the finals. Cameroon also received a boost as they held world champions Italy goalless in a later match held in Monte Carlo. Marcelo Lippi fielded an experimental Italian side but they had the better chances although it needed a last-ditch tackle from substitute Gennaro Gattuso to deny Samuel Eto'o a late winner for Cameroon.","South Korea beat Ivory Coast 2-0 in friendly international at Loftus Road in London .

"(CNN) -- Tech visionary Elon Musk made headlines when he said recently that artificial intelligence is like ""summoning the demon"" and may well be humanity's ""biggest existential threat."" Just this month, researchers in Japan announced they had created a software system that could outperform the average Japanese high school student on a standardized college entrance exam. In other words, the machines are catching up to humans in intelligence. Concerns about A.I. and robots can be divided into two broad categories and framed as questions. First, will the machines take our jobs and destroy our livelihoods? Second, do we have to worry that advanced artificial intelligence could truly threaten humanity, perhaps by acting to destroy us (as in the ""Terminator"" movies) or enslave us (as in the ""Matrix"" series). The evidence suggests that, at least for the foreseeable future, the impact on employment is what should worry us. The reality is that most people in our workforce are employed in occupations that are on some level fundamentally routine and predicable. Most people come to work and, regardless of their job title or industry, tend to face the same basic types of challenges again and again. Just as a trainee might learn to do a job by carefully observing everything done by an experienced worker, rapidly improving machine learning algorithms seem likely to eventually figure out how to do a great many jobs. Last year, a team in Oxford University performed a detailed analysis of over 700 occupations in the United States. They came to the conclusion that jobs constituting a staggering 47% of U.S. employment—well over 60 million jobs—could become automated in a decade or two. It's important to realize that projections like these do not rely on the stuff of science fiction. Machine learning technology is already in widespread use; it powers Google's language translation service as well as its self-driving cars, the book and movie recommendations made on websites like Amazon and Netflix, and the potential matches suggested by online dating sites. The idea that smart software will eventually begin to eat any job that consists primarily of tasks that are predicable requires only a fairly simple extrapolation that technology will only get better and better. Many people remain very skeptical that progress will ever result in a significant unemployment problem. So far, history is on their side. The classic example of technological disruption is the mechanization of agriculture. In the United States, most people once worked on farms. Now the number is roughly 2% of the population. Millions of jobs were lost, and yet we are clearly better off; food is much cheaper and workers moved on to often more fulfilling jobs in other industries. The farm workers of yesteryear were able to transition into a rising manufacturing sector and later into service industries. But it may be overly optimistic to expect that scenario to play out again in the face of today's technology. Unlike the specialized, mechanical innovations that transformed agriculture, today's information technology is truly general purpose, and it will ultimately bring sophisticated artificial intelligence and robotics capability to every industry and employment sector. Technology will certainly create new industries, but there is little reason to expect they will need many workers. We can get some idea of how the future is likely to look by examining one of the most successful technology companies. Google, for example, has become enormously influential and achieved a staggering market valuation with a workforce of only about 50,000 people. That's roughly half the number of jobs the U.S. economy needs to create in a single month, just to keep pace with growth in the population. What about the even more frightening prospect of smart machines destroying or enslaving us? Unlike the prospect for technology to displace many workers, this outcome requires a quantum leap in technological progress. Building a machine that can truly think like a human, conceive new ideas and exhibit self-awareness remains a daunting challenge and likely lies at least decades in the future. It is entirely possible that accelerating computer power coupled with advances in brain science may eventually result in a true thinking machine. Many researchers believe that such a truly advanced A.I. would be driven to turn its intellectual energies inward, repeatedly improving its own design and making itself even smarter. The result could be an ""intelligence explosion"" culminating in a silicon-based mind hundreds or even thousands of times more intelligent than any human being. And there is, of course, no guarantee that this new alien intelligence would be especially concerned about the welfare of humanity. The chance that we'll see a true thinking machine anytime soon is small. Yet, the magnitude of the disruption—and potential threat—that would result is so large that the prospect should not be ignored. For now, though, the pressing question is: How do we adapt our economy and society to a future in which machines do much of the work now performed by people? Will humans go the way of horses?","Martin Ford: Concerns about artificial intelligence should be taken seriously .
Ford: In the immediate future, the risk that you'll lose your job to a machine is real .

"Harold Ramis, the actor, writer and director whose films include ""Stripes,"" ""Ghostbusters,"" ""Groundhog Day"" and ""Analyze This,"" has died. He was 69. His death was caused by complications related to autoimmune inflammatory vasculitis, a condition Ramis battled for four years, according to United Talent Agency, which represented Ramis for many years. His disease is called 'painful' and 'debilitating' Ramis died Monday morning in his Chicago-area home, the agency said. For more than 40 years, Ramis was a leading figure in comedy. A veteran of the Second City troupe in his hometown of Chicago, he was a writer for ""SCTV"" and wrote or co-wrote the scripts for ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" (1978), ""Caddyshack"" (1980), ""Stripes"" (1981), ""Ghostbusters"" (1984), ""Groundhog Day"" (1993) and ""Analyze This"" (1999). The films often featured members of his generation of comedy talents -- veterans of the National Lampoon's recordings, ""Saturday Night Live"" and ""Second City TV"" -- most notably Ramis' old comedy colleague and fellow Chicagoan Bill Murray. ""Harold Ramis and I together did 'The National Lampoon Show' off-Broadway, 'Meatballs,' 'Stripes,' 'Caddyshack,' 'Ghostbusters' and 'Groundhog Day.' He earned his keep on this planet,"" said Murray in a statement. ""God bless him."" Ramis' directing credits include ""Caddyshack,"" ""National Lampoon's Vacation"" (1983), ""Groundhog Day,"" ""Analyze This"" and -- in a change from his usual comedies -- the dark 2005 film ""The Ice Harvest."" He occasionally acted as well, most notably playing Murray's friend in ""Stripes,"" Dr. Egon Spengler in ""Ghostbusters"" and a doctor in ""As Good as It Gets"" (1997). ""Ghostbusters"" star Dan Aykroyd wrote on Facebook, ""Deeply saddened to hear of the passing of my brilliant, gifted, funny friend, co-writer/performer and teacher Harold Ramis. May he now get the answers he was always seeking."" Steve Carell, who worked with Ramis on ""The Office,"" tweeted, ""Harold Ramis. Funny, gracious, kind hearted. A joy to have known you."" Ramis directed several episodes of that TV series. Ramis' films were some of the most influential -- and highest-grossing -- comedies of recent decades. ""Animal House"" remains a model for knockabout laughs and gross-out moments. ""Caddyshack"" is eminently quotable. ""Ghostbusters"" was the second-biggest box office hit of 1984, just behind ""Beverly Hills Cop."" But though the movies were full of silly moments, Ramis often tried to tap into larger themes. Perhaps most successful was ""Groundhog Day"" in which Bill Murray's cynical weatherman is forced to relive the same day over and over again until he finally comes to terms with his life. The film has been used as the subject of philosophical and religious discussions. That intellectual bent didn't always go over well with studio bosses, Ramis observed. In an interview with the Onion A.V. Club, he mentioned the studio for his 2009 film ""Year One"" was uncertain how to pitch it. ""When the studio said, 'Well, what is the movie about?' I said, 'The movie tracks the psycho-social development of civilization.' And they said, 'Uh, that's not going to be too good on a poster.' "" Ramis was also a mentor to several current comedy writers and directors, the Chicago Tribune noted in its obituary. Judd Apatow, a fan, cast him as Seth Rogen's father in ""Knocked Up."" Jake Kasdan put him in ""Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story"" (which was co-produced and co-written by Apatow). Did you ever meet Ramis? Share your memories . Ramis was usually a good-natured presence, playing understanding characters -- often doctors, of one sort or another. It was true to his personality, the late Second City founder Bernie Sahlins told the Chicago Tribune in 1999. ""He's the least changed by success of anyone I know in terms of sense of humor, of humility, sense of self,"" Sahlins told the paper. ""He's the same Harold he was 30 years ago. He's had enormous success relatively, but none of it has gone to his head in any way."" Indeed, Ramis always seemed to find a way to laugh. Asked by The New York Times about the existential questions raised by ""Groundhog Day"" -- and competing interpretations of the film's meaning -- he mentioned that he didn't practice any religion himself. ''Although I am wearing meditation beads on my wrist,'' he noted. ''But that's because I'm on a Buddhist diet. They're supposed to remind me not to eat, but actually just get in the way when I'm cutting my steak.'' Ramis is survived by his wife, Erica Mann Ramis, three children and two grandchildren.

"(CNN) -- From Singapore to Norway, there are plenty of reasons to plan your next trip around a fabulous hotel opening its doors next year. Here are 11 of them. The Reverie Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam) Opening: January 2015 . Part of the new Times Square building in Ho Chi Minh City's District 1, this lavish lodging doesn't cut corners. The 286 rooms and suites have been fitted out by four of Italy's finest interior designers and come with elaborate chandeliers, jeweled beds and velvet curtains. Cantonese food is dished up by a Michelin-starred chef, there's traditional Italian in a dining room named after Romeo and Juliet (R&J), a deli and one of the longest bar counters in HCMC (reportedly the length of a city block). You can arrive in one of the property's fleet of Rolls-Royce Phantom Dragons or, if you're short for time, chopper in -- the hotel has its own helipad. The Reverie Saigon, 22 Nguyen Hue, Ben Nghe, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam; +84 8 3920 9520 . Mama Shelter (Los Angeles) Opening: February 2015 . Philippe Starck may have been responsible for the design of existing properties in the Mama Shelter portfolio, but the French interiors celebrity passes the baton to Thierry Gaugain for the brand's Los Angeles property. Located in a 1923 building and one-time hotel in Hollywood (supposedly a favorite of Jimi Hendrix and Eva Gardner) the property's 70 rooms will feature the same design flair of sister properties across France and Turkey. Unfortunately, we'll have to take the company's word for it -- no photos have yet been released of the secretive new property. In addition to a ground-floor restaurant and bar, the hotel will offer dining and drinks on a rooftop patio. From here you'll enjoy unbroken vistas of the nightlife along Cahuenga Boulevard, the Hollywood ArcLight (one of the largest movie theaters in the city), Amoeba Music and, every Sunday, the Hollywood Farmers' Market, which is a block away on Selma and Ivar. Mama Shelter, 1557 Wilcox Ave., Los Angeles . Lizard Island (Great Barrier Reef, Australia) Opening: March 1, 2014 . Cyclone Ita devastated this petite Great Barrier Reef island when it hit in April 2014. Almost 12 months down the track, and following a massive rebuild and remodeling effort, the isle and its resort have set a re-opening date. From March, guests will have access to Lizard Island's understated, barefoot luxury once more, with new resort additions including a standalone two-bedroom suite, The Villa, which comes with its own plunge pool, wraparound deck, and views of the Coral Sea. The Pavilion now features a separate lounge offering ocean vistas, and the Sunset Point Villas now have more plunge pools. Inside are design nods to the reef, with an earth-tones palette complemented by pops of coral, blue and gold. A dedicated wine and cheese room has been added and the island's spa has been relocated and expanded to include a dedicated manicure and pedicure room. One thing that hasn't changed is the spectacular diving and snorkeling, with some of the world's most dazzling marine life steps from your room. Lizard Island, Lizard Island National Park via Cairns, Australia; +61 3 9426 7550 . Park Hyatt Zanzibar (Tanzania) Opening: March 2015 . The UNESCO World Heritage-listed Stone Town, the historic heart of the East African island of Zanzibar, offers a dramatic backdrop for the soon-to-open Park Hyatt Zanzibar. The rich culture and heritage of this Tanzanian island -- an important trading hub for spices during the 19th century -- is reflected in the hotel's design, with its 67 rooms spread over two buildings. One of them is the 17th-century Mambo Msiige, a beautiful Zanzibari mansion enveloping a peaceful courtyard and featuring intricate carvings. Oceanfront rooms and suites offer shimmering views of Dhow Harbour and the Indian Ocean, a view also found from the beach-side infinity pool. Other diversions range from an Anantara Spa to Zamani Residence, the hotel's restaurant designed to pay homage to a traditional family residence by allowing guests to enjoy meals in different areas, including a library with a veranda, the living room and the main dining room, with a terrace and residential-style kitchen. Park Hyatt Zanzibar, Shangani Street, Stone Town, Zanzibar, Tanzania; +255 24 223 1234 . Anantara Tangalle Resort & Spa (Tangalle, Sri Lanka) Opening: mid-2015 . One of two Anantara hotels opening on Sri Lanka's picturesque southern coast in 2015 (the other being the Anantara Kalutara Resort & Spa, welcoming guests from late 2015), Tangalle Resort & Spa sprawls over 18 hectares in Tangalle, a beach-side town around 80 kilometers east of the historic fortified city of Galle, and within easy reach of several national parks. Design is inspired by traditional Sri Lankan architecture, with high-pitched thatched roofs, local artwork and artifacts, hand-carved furniture and plenty of breezy open spaces dotting groves of coconut palms. The 152 guest rooms include 32 pool villas, which the hotel is billing as being the first of their kind in the country. Facilities include a selection of restaurants and bars and an Anantara Spa. Residences will be on offer for those who want to truly make the resort a home away from home. Anantara Tangalle Resort & Spa, Tangalle Bay, Sri Lanka . Patina, Capitol Singapore . Opening: mid-2015 . Patina Hotels & Resorts' flagship hotel is spectacular. The brainchild of Singapore's Kwee family -- who also own the city's Capella, Conrad, Regent and Ritz-Carlton hotels -- the Patina occupies two heritage-listed buildings: the Capitol Building and Stamford House. Part of a bigger redevelopment project transforming the old Capitol Movie Theatre, the 157-room hotel has two huge names attached to it: Pritzker Prize-winner Richard Meier and notable interior design company Jaya International Design, which conceptualized the beautifully laid out accommodations, including Wellness Suites and Art Suites. Other features range from a library-lounge and saltwater relaxation pool to a state of the art fitness center and signature restaurant and bar. Patina staff double as concierges -- a concept designed to tap into the creative skills of employees and have them provide personal experiences for guests. Patina, Capitol Singapore, 15 Stamford Road, Singapore . Four Seasons Hotel Seoul (South Korea) Opening: mid-2015 . South Korea's first Four Seasons hotel will blend traditional designs with ultra-modern trimmings. Occupying a new 25-story building in the CBD of Jong-gu, the hotel stands out for its prime location. Adjacent to Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbok Palace and the historic districts of Jong-ro and Isadong, the Four Seasons is a great base from which to explore the Korean capital. The 317 rooms and suites showcase an earthy fusion of blonde wood, marble and local ceramics. Facilities include restaurants and saltwater pool. Meanwhile, another Four Seasons property is set to debut in the Moroccan city of Casablanca mid-year. Four Seasons Hotel Seoul, South Korea . Alila Seminyak (Indonesia) Opening: Q2 2015 . It turns out there's room to squeeze yet another hotel onto Bali. The latest luxury lodgings come courtesy of the Alila hotels group, which has four existing properties across the Indonesian island. This newcomer sits on a beach along Bali's southwest coast, a short walk from the bars, restaurants and busy shopping streets of Seminyak. Rooms and suites ring a pool -- one of three at the hotel -- that leads to the beach. An 811-square-meter penthouse comes with its own infinity pool and terrace, as well as three bedrooms, a living room and kitchen. Like other Alila properties, there's a strong environmental focus: buildings are laced with vertical rooftop gardens and green corridors link the four buildings. Recycled and reclaimed building materials are used throughout and rainwater harvesting and solar energy are employed to reduce the hotel's environmental footprint. Alila Seminyak, Jalan Taman Ganesha No. 9, Bali, Indonesia . SLS Park Avenue (New York) Opening: late 2015 . The third hotel in the SLS portfolio, joining properties in LA and South Beach, SLS Park Avenue has a perch that's hard to beat. Located at 444 Park Avenue in Manhattan's trendy NoMad neighborhood, it's a couple blocks from Central Park and the Museum of Modern Art. A celebrated creative team is behind the project, including visionary designer Philippe Starck, who was responsible for conceptualizing the 190 guest rooms and suites as well as a handful of restaurants and bars spanning the lobby and rooftop. While the design concept is yet to be announced, from what we've seen of the property it's clear that Starck is bringing his signature whimsy to the project, which includes a glamorous blend of gilding and mirrors and a moody color scheme with plenty of designer furniture. SLS Park Avenue, 444 Park Ave. S., New York . Lofoten Opera Hotel (Norway) Opening: late 2015 . The Lofoten archipelago is a dramatic union of soaring peaks, untouched beaches and sheltered bays. It's here that you'll soon find the Lofoten Opera Hotel, a property befitting its wild surroundings. Design firm Snohetta is behind the eye-catching building that cascades toward the sea and links the mountains and ocean. In addition to hotel rooms -- all of which will offer unbroken views thanks to the hotel's circular design -- the 11,000-square-meter site will be home to apartments, an amphitheater and spa. It's a far-flung corner of the world, but that's part of the appeal. The surrounding wilderness offers treks, kayaking and sailing, among other activities. Lofoten Opera Hotel, Lofoten, Norway . Ritz-Carlton, Langkawi (Malaysia) Opening: 2015 . Fringed by tropical rainforest, the Ritz-Carlton, Langkawi enjoys a private cove and beach overlooking the Andaman Sea on the island's southwest corner. The 132-room resort, including 42 villas, nods to traditional architecture: buildings reflect kampong village styles and classic interiorsl. The family-friendly property features three swimming pools, including one just for children, and there's also a Ritz Kids Club. While staff look after your young ones you can head to the spa, replete with a Turkish-style hammam. Restaurants reflect the diversity of local culture, with Malay, Chinese, Thai and Indian offerings -- plus French fine dining and an international beach grill.

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Jordan's King Hussein sent a secret message to President Richard Nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack Syria, according to declassified documents released Wednesday by the former president's library. President Nixon works at his desk in the Oval Office in a June 1972 photograph. The papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the Nixon Presidential Library, some of which offer harbingers of present-day events, such as concerns about terrorism and Saudi Arabia. Library director Timothy Naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the Saudis more involved in solving the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, how to get them more engaged against terrorism, how to address the Arab view that the United States always sides with Israel and how to build up moderate Palestinians to counter extremists. A 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective: ""isolate and undermine terrorisms [sic] and commandos [sic] by establishing another, more stable and respectable Palestinian political entity and political personality."" Documents detail U.S. efforts to persuade Saudi Arabia to move away from Fatah, the military wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization, because U.S. officials believed the PLO was supporting the terrorist-linked, anti-Israel group Black September, referred to as BSO. The document, a U.S. State Department telegram from the embassy in Jeddah to Washington reads, ""BSO and Fatah [are] now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty. One might wonder whether central objective BSO conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward Middle East peace."" The document release was intended to coincide with Mideast peace summit among Palestinian, Israeli and other Mideast leaders in Maryland, Naftali said. The Nixon White House also was adjusting to Israel's acquisition of a nuclear weapon. ""We are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for Richard Nixon's decision in 1969 to accept the fact, a fact of life, that Israel had a bomb, a nuclear device,"" said Naftali. ""That, of course, is very important with what's going on in Annapolis."" ""Even though it is clear from the documents that the United States government did not encourage Israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent, it became a fact of life,"" Naftali said. ""There are materials here that show how our government, 30 years ago, dealt with this very, very difficult problem."" Rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power, Israel still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability. In 1970, as King Hussein dealt with threats by both Palestinian refugees in his country and Syrian military forces crossing Jordan's border, the king asked ""the United States and Great Britain to intervene in the war in Jordan, asking the United States, in fact, to attack Syria,"" Naftali said. ""Syria had invaded Jordan and the Jordanian king, facing what he felt was a military rout, said please help us in any way possible."" The telegram indicates that Hussein himself called a U.S. official at 3 a.m. to ask for American or British help. ""Situation deteriorating dangerously following Syrian massive invasion...,"" the document said. ""I request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of Jordan. Immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative."" The library has withheld the Nixon documents from public access until Wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified, Naftali said. Nixon served as president from January 20, 1969, to August 9, 1974, when he resigned under political pressure during the Watergate scandal -- the only U.S. president to do so. He died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81. E-mail to a friend .","Telegram: King Hussein wanted U.S. strike on invading Syrian troops in 1970 .

"Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen has called for an inquiry into a suspected mass HIV infection in a remote village in northwestern Battambang province. The infected cases have surpassed 100 and is believed to have been spread by contaminated needles used by an unlicensed doctor, reported local media. More than 800 panicked residents of Rokar village have sought testing after reports of infections emerged last week. Some 106 people have tested positive for HIV said the National AIDS authority. ""I call for a thorough investigation into the issue,"" Hun Sen said in a televised speech on Thursday. The Ministry of Health, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS have sent teams to the village to carry out more investigations and to provide free testing and treatment services. ""I urge everyone to stay calm and avoid listening to or spreading rumors,"" said Dr. Mam Bunheng, minister of health in a press release. ""We should also all fully respect the privacy of the affected families and ensure they do not face stigma and discrimination,"" he added. Villagers are accusing an allegedly unlicensed local doctor for using contaminated needles, reported Phnom Penh Post. He now remains in protective custody by the police.

"Rumors and speculation are running wild, as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) prepares for its 18th Party Congress. So far, though, the most tangible thing about the Congress is the massive deployment of extended security measures in China, resulting in the cancelation of academic conferences, art exhibitions, performances and even private meetings. In a way, the CCP is asking the entire Chinese nation to hold its breath until the Congress ends. All this effort is expended over the transfer of power to the ""next generation"" of Chinese leaders. Indeed, these extra security measures indicate that the leaders of the CCP understand well their weakness: that the fragility of an authoritarian system lies in its transfer of power. China's next leaders: Who's who . That is, despite its domination over the lives of the Chinese people, even the Communist party is not exempt from the general political axiom that a governing régime relies on popular acceptance of its authority. The problem is that is no one, not even the Party's own members, voted for the next generation of CCP leaders. There are no laws -- or even any clear rules -- that govern the selection of leaders, leaving the matter of choosing the top leaders of the most populous nation on earth entirely at the mercy of the Party's forever changing internal logic. Read about the struggle of ideas among China's leadership . Even after a decade as the top leader of China, how exactly President Hu Jintao became Jiang Zemin's designated successor remains a mystery even to expert analysts and historians. The selection process is and will always remain at the highest level of state secrets, guarded even from the majority of Party members. The most important reason is that any detail, if known, could be used as ammunition for internal party strife and dangerously expose the leadership's vulnerabilities. On April 30, 1976, after Premier Hua Guofeng had accompanied Chairman Mao Zedong to a meeting with New Zealand Prime Minister Robert Muldoon, Hua told Mao that he would summon activists from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces to Beijing for a conference to strengthen the ""Criticize Deng Xiaoping Campaign."" Mao was already suffering from a neural disease that made him unable to speak, so he replied by jotting down a note that read: ""With you in charge, I am at ease."" Five months later, Mao died, and Hua became his successor as chairman. That note became the main vehicle of state propaganda efforts to lend Hua legitimacy. And in order to keep its original limited context a secret, Foreign Minister Qiao Guanhua, an eyewitness to the original exchange, was sacked. It is unlikely that the public will ever know how Xi Jinping became the designated successor of Hu Jintao. Whether or not he was actually handpicked by Jiang Zemin, as rumored, will remain a secret, and even if Jiang were confirmed to have picked Xi, Jiang does not have the charismatic stature of Mao to lend instant legitimacy to his chosen successor, and the lack of public consent would only be highlighted. In Hua's case, details surfaced only after he was politically sidelined and excluded from positions of power. In addition to the selection of president and the party's general secretary, the selection of the powerful Politburo Standing Committee is another top level state secret, because the details of who nominated whom would allow political analysts to figure out factional affiliations and map out the complex web of entrenched interests. Read why China's new leaders must focus on rights . Under certain circumstances, information regarding top leaders is released to the public only with intent. Deciding which details to release or not to release on the fallen Bo Xilai must have been a real headache for the Chinese leadership. When the case against his wife, Gu Kailai, was first announced, there was no mention of Bo himself. Too many details would only confirm the longstanding public impression that families of high-level Party officials use their connections to rapidly accumulate millions and live their private lives in stark contrast to the Party's claims of altruism. Yet, some details needed to be released, as authorities built their case against him. Thus, the decision of what and when to release information has seemed painfully slow and cautious, creating the perfect environment for rumors and speculation to feed public curiosity. In today's global information environment, details on the Chinese leadership can now reach millions of people in a matter of minutes via online media and social networks. More than likely, Chinese leaders do not like the way the public reacts to news that is not carefully crafted by the state's propaganda machinery. In March 2012, a young man driving a Ferrari 458 Spider with two young women aboard died in a fatal high-speed crash. Information about the incident went viral online before it could be suppressed. The driver was reportedly found to be Ling Gu, the son of Ling Jihua, President Hu Jintao's protégé, who was demoted six months after the Ferrari incident. Recently, the New York Times report of Premier Wen Jiabao's alleged family business ventures spread throughout the Chinese online network shortly after publication, even after Chinese authorities had blocked access to the newspaper's English and Chinese websites. The same happened after Bloomberg reported on the wealth of Xi's extended family. That is a far cry from September 13, 1971.  When Mao's comrade-in-arms Lin Biao died in a mysterious plane crash in Mongolia, it took months for the news to ripple through widening circles of the population. Thus, the Chinese leaders' response to the new age of information has been to make their political system ever more opaque and expend enormous resources on media censorship. Such is the case with Xi, China's designated leader, of which little is known beyond official accounts. His personality too must be kept secret through a web of media censorship, because such information could be used by opponents to figure out his political tendencies and preempt his political actions. If we have to make an intelligent guess about Xi, we might have to look at the CCP's recent ""History of the Chinese Communist Party, Volume 2 (1949-1978),"" which covers the Mao years. This grand project was led by none other than Xi Jinping, according to official reports, and reportedly under his sole discretion. The result is another Party effort to cosmetically make over the disastrous events of the Mao era. When Xi is in power, he will be turning Party history to its next page. ""He who controls the past controls the future.""","There are no laws -- or even clear rules -- that govern selection of leaders, Bao writes .
Bao: It is unlikely that public will ever know how Xi became Hu's designated successor .
Selection of powerful Politburo Standing Committee is another top level state secret .
Bao: Public consent is lacking; in media age, leaders respond by making system more opaque ."
"The Pakistani government plans to challenge the granting of bail to the man accused of masterminding the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, a law enforcement official said Friday. Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, a top leader of the terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba, was granted bail by an anti-terrorism court in Islamabad on Thursday, prompting dismay from Indian officials. Lakhvi is one of seven people being prosecuted in the Pakistani anti-terrorism court over the terror attacks in Mumbai that left more than 160 people dead in November 2008. In the attacks, heavily armed men stormed landmark buildings around Mumbai, including high-end hotels, the city's historic Victoria Terminus train station and the Jewish cultural center Chabad House. A lawyer for Lakhvi, Rizwan Abbassi, said his client was granted bail because of ""deficient"" evidence. ""The court always sees and decides the case on the basis of evidence,"" he said in a report by Times Now, an Indian TV station. But Azhar Chaudhary, an official with Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency, said authorities intend to challenge the bail decision. Many in India, where deep anger remains over the attack, have strongly criticized the Pakistani court's move. ""It is very disappointing that the accused of the Mumbai attacks has been granted bail,"" said Rajnath Singh, India's Home Minister on Thursday. India's external-affairs spokesman Syed Akbaruddin complained about the ""glacial pace"" of the proceedings against the Mumbai suspects in Pakistan. ""The move to grant bail to Zaki-ur-Rahman Lakhvi yesterday has taken this saga to another level,"" he said, adding that India has communicated its ""strong concerns"" on the matter through diplomatic channels. Ujjwal Nikam, the Indian public prosecutor for the 2008 Mumbai-attack trial insisted Indian prosecutors dealing with the Mumbai trial had given what he called ample evidence to Pakistani authorities against Lakhvi. ""It is a mockery of justice,"" Nikam said of the bail decision. India executed the last surviving gunman from the Mumbai attacks in 2012. The other attackers were all killed during the three days of violence in the city in 2008.","Pakistan government to appeal against bail of suspect behind 2008 Mumbai attacks .

"(CNN) -- In opposing President Barack Obama's opening to Cuba, Florida's Republican senator, Marco Rubio, explained, ""This entire policy shift announced today is based on an illusion, on a lie, the lie and the illusion that more commerce and access to money and goods will translate to political freedom for the Cuban people."" Rubio has correctly touched on the core issue. But theory, logic and history suggest that he's wrong in his conclusions. I would recommend to Rubio one of the classics of conservative thought, Milton Friedman's ""Capitalism and Freedom."" He doesn't have to spend too much time on it. The first chapter outlines the ""relation between economic freedom and political freedom."" The point Friedman makes in the book is one that America's founding fathers well understood. Drawing on the political philosopher John Locke, they believed that the freedom to buy, sell, own and trade were core elements of human freedom and individual autonomy. As they expand, liberty expands. This is not just theory, of course. Over the last two centuries, the countries that embraced ""more commerce and access to money and goods"" in Rubio's phrase -- Britain, America, then Western Europe and East Asia -- have moved toward greater prosperity, but also political freedom. If you exclude oil-rich countries, where money is not earned but dug from the ground, almost every country that has used free markets and free trade to grow is also a democracy. Yes there are a few exceptions: Singapore and China (though the latter is still not quite a developed economy.) But on the whole, there has been a remarkably strong connection between economic freedom and political freedom. In Latin America itself, the line has been clear. Augusto Pinochet's regime opened up its economy in the 1970s. Chile began to grow, but that growth then produced a stronger civil society that over time clamored for the end of the Pinochet dictatorship. (The same pattern could be seen in Taiwan, South Korea, Spain and Portugal.) In Latin America today, democracy and markets have acted to reinforce each other, transforming the continent, which 30 years ago was almost entirely ruled by dictatorships to one that is today almost entirely ruled by democracies. Cuba is an outlier, one of the last regimes in Latin America that has embraced neither markets nor ballots. The Obama administration is acting on the theory that more commerce, capitalism, contact, travel and trade will empower the people of Cuba and thus give them a greater voice in their political future. And so the first point to make is that it will help Cubans economically -- it will raise their incomes, their standard of living, and boost access to technology. These are all good things in and of themselves. But easing the embargo will also help Americans, who will benefit from being able to trade with a neighbor. This is the reason that conservatives have long understood that free trade is not a gift bestowed on someone. It helps both countries and in particular, helps the United States. That's why the Wall Street Journal's editorial page -- bastion of conservative thought -- has been an advocate on lifting the trade embargo against Cuba, which is a far larger step than Obama's normalization. So, did it support Obama's opening? Of course not. It turns out that he has done it in the wrong way. It is difficult not to think that the problem here is not the policy, but who the president is. Had George W. Bush announced this initiative, I have a feeling that the Wall Street Journal would be hailing it -- and Rubio would be quoting Milton Friedman to us all.

"President Barack Obama is set to close a week jam-packed with news of a breakthrough with Cuba and new tensions with North Korea on Friday with a 1:30 p.m. EST news conference. Just weeks removed from huge Democratic losses in the midterm elections, Obama's allies say he appears liberated -- taking executive actions to overhaul immigration rules, thaw the United States' economic and diplomatic freeze with Cuba and more. Here are some of the questions Obama will likely face as he confronts the press one more time before he heads to Hawaii for what's left of 2014: . Did November's election result liberate you? A President derided as overly cautious for much of the last six years -- especially since the Republican wave of 2010 -- is suddenly no longer hesitant to use every lever the Oval Office has to offer. He's brokered a diplomatic breakthrough with Cuba, halted deportations for more than 4 million undocumented workers, green-lit Environmental Protection Agency restrictions on ozone emissions, endorsed net neutrality and extended talks with Iran to curtail its nuclear program. And that's just been in the first six weeks since Democrats lost the Senate. With no more potential election results weighing on his actions, does Obama suddenly feel like he's free to be the President he's always wanted to be? Republicans scoff at this notion -- and they're working quickly to curb Obama's executive authority. Dozens of states are challenging his immigration action in court, while Congress is plotting to defund him on immigration and block parts of his Cuba deal. The strength of Obama's resistance on Capitol Hill won't come fully into view until new lawmakers take office in January. Was this the push Cuba needed to embrace democracy? Republicans like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio blasted Obama's deal to free American contractor Alan Gross, trade three Cuban spies for one American spy imprisoned in Cuba and ease a host of U.S. banking and travel restrictions and open an embassy in Havana in exchange for the release of 53 political prisoners and expanded Internet access. Their criticism: Obama just gave away the United States' best leverage to force Cuba to abandon communism and embrace human rights, democracy and a greater connection to the outside world. He responded by pointing out those tactics hadn't worked in the 50 years since the embargo. What was Obama's calculation on what this deal would mean for Cuba's future? What's the next campaign pledge you'll use your executive authority to fulfill? Obama was widely mocked during the 2008 campaign for promising to engage directly, without preconditions, with the leaders of the United States' enemies. And yet his Cuba deal, negotiated in secret for more than a year, shows Obama carrying through on that promise. Obama has just two years left in office to tackle a long list of complicated issues that played prominent roles in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns. Will he finally close Guantanamo Bay? Will his approach to the international stage change now that election results aren't riding on how his moves are portrayed? Russia's economy is tanking, but Vladimir Putin isn't backing down. What's next? Russia's ruble has tumbled to historic lows, and its central bank raised its interest rate to a stunning 17 percent this week -- a downturn due to dropping oil prices and harsh Western sanctions on the country's oligarchs and its banking, energy and defense industries imposed as a result of the country's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region. So Russian President Vladimir Putin could have sent signals that he is willing to back off. Instead, he used a three-hour long news conference Thursday to compare Russia to a ""bear"" that the United States and its European allies are trying to chain down before ripping out its ""teeth and claws."" Obama and his top economic advisers have long insisted that the pressure of Western sanctions will grow over time -- and there's only so much Russia's economy can take. But Putin continues to resist that characterization. Is a breaking point coming soon? And if not, what will the United States and European countries do to further pressure Putin? RELATED: Obama and Putin: From frosty to frozen . What does North Korea's Sony hack -- and Sony's decision to pull a film's release as a result -- say about America? The Obama administration is set to place the blame on North Korea for hacking into Sony's computers and threatening attacks on theaters that show ""The Interview,"" a movie that depicts the cartoonish assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Sony subsequently decided to halt the film's planned release. Obama could be asked whether Sony was wrong to pull the movie -- and whether it's troubling that a major company was so easily cowed. He could also face questions about whether there's the Sony hack will build momentum in Congress for cybersecurity legislation that would increase data sharing between companies and the U.S. government. Other similar questions: Is Sony's vulnerability an ominous sign for other corporate giants, the government, financial services institutions and more? Are cyber attacks akin to acts of violence?

"Violence wracked Yemen yet again Thursday -- this time in the form of dual car bomb attacks purportedly carried out by al Qaeda militants targeting fighters from the minority, albeit powerful, Houthi group.

Medics expected the death toll to rise as some of about a dozen people injured in the attacks are in critical condition.

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States dramatically expanded its evacuation warnings near the troubled Japanese nuclear reactors Wednesday, telling Americans to get at least 50 miles away. The earlier recommendation from both the U.S. and Japanese governments was to stay 12 miles away or to take shelter indoors if evacuation was not possible within an 18-mile radius. The U.S. change came Wednesday afternoon in Washington but in the middle of the night in Tokyo.  It was the first time since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami in  Japan triggered the nuclear crisis that the United States and Japanese  governments have differed on advising what their citizens should do. Before  Wednesday, the United States had urged American citizens in Japan to  follow the recommendations of the Japanese government. The new U.S. recommendation ""suggests that the advice the  Japanese government is giving based on the information it has is  different than the advice we'd be giving if this incident happened in  the United States,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters in Washington. ""Their  standards are different from ours based on how far you should  evacuate,"" he said, calling the situation in Japan ""very fluid."" State Department spokesman Mark Toner echoed Carney, saying that the United States has confidence in Japanese authorities but wanted to put out the new information about the crisis based on the evaluation of U.S. experts and what they would propose in a similar crisis inside the United States. ""This is not any kind of judgment on what the Japanese authorities are telling their public,"" Toner said at a mid-afternoon briefing at the State Department. ""This is based on what we would advise American citizens here to do in a similar situation. So we are compelled based on that estimate, based on that appraisal, to advise American citizens in Japan to do the same. ' The decision on widening the exclusion area lagged behind the U.S. military, which had kept military personnel from operating within 50 miles of the damaged nuclear plant ""days ago,"" according to Pentagon spokesman Col. Dave Lapan.  State Department officials could not explain why the military was concerned about U.S. military operating in the area but the State Department did not feel a need to warn American citizens until early Thursday in Japan. Just before the evacuation recommendation had changed, the U.S. ambassador to Japan had told journalists that the United States was in full agreement with the Japanese. ""Our experts are in agreement with the response and measures taken by Japanese technicians, including their recommended 20-kilometer (12-mile) radius for evacuation and additional shelter-in-place recommendations out to 30 kilometers (18 miles),"" Ambassador John Roos told journalists at a briefing in Tokyo Wednesday afternoon. Despite the major change, Toner said the widening of the evacuation area should not be viewed as any shift of confidence in Japan. ""We feel we are cooperating effectively with the Japanese government and that we are communicating,"" Toner said. The State Department is coordinating with other governments about helping people leave the areas devastated by the earthquake and tsunami as well as by the crisis at the nuclear plants. But despite earlier U.S. statements that there were 160,000 Americans in Japan, Toner said no specific numbers were available. And he would not predict whether the United States would take steps to bring members of its diplomatic team and families back to the U.S. ""We are looking at all contingencies but I have no more to say on that. Posture hasn't changed,"" Toner said.","U.S. government urges American citizens to move 50 miles away .
Japan calls for evacuations within 12 miles .
U.S. officials say the difference reflects how each country analyzes information .

"Women in Britain's armed forces could be allowed to fight in front line combat roles for the first time by 2016, the Ministry of Defence said Friday, as it published a review into how this would impact troops on the ground. According to the ministry, the review ""has ended the long-held view that mixed close ground combat units would have an adverse effect on cohesion between troops."" But it calls for more research into the physiological demands placed on those in close combat roles before a final decision is made on allowing women in. Ground close combat units are defined as those where ""the primary role is to close with and kill the enemy."" The potential impact on women's health of serving in such units should be fully examined, the review said. Researchers will also look at how training for such combat roles can be set up to ensure women are able to take part safely, without reducing combat effectiveness. ""Roles in our Armed Forces should be determined by ability not gender. I hope that, following further work on our training regimes and equipment, we can open up combat roles to women in 2016,"" said Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. At present, 70% of roles are open to women in the army, 79% in the navy, and 94% in the air force. Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter, said UK military operations in Afghanistan had shown that there could be ""significant physiological risk to women"" serving in ground close combat roles. ""I look forward to the prospect of opening ground close combat roles to women, but we have to look at this in a responsible way,"" said Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton. ""Our aim must be to maximise the use of talent without compromising our standards or undermining capability. The final piece of work on physiological risks is vitally important in ensuring that ground close combat roles would not be detrimental to the health of our service women."" Women currently make up 10% of the UK armed forces, according to Ministry of Defence statistics from October, with 15,740 women in total employed across all services. Their numbers have gradually increased over the past two years in the army and remain stable in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. The Royal Navy allowed women to serve on board submarines for the first time this year, more than 20 years after women were first allowed to serve on surface ships. In another sign of increasing gender equality, two women have also reached the rank of rank of air vice-marshal in the Royal Air Force. The Pentagon took steps early last year to open up combat roles to the roughly 200,000 women in the U.S. armed forces. Announcing the move, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said it was a bow to reality on the battlefield, where women in what are technically non-combat units already find themselves fighting alongside their male comrades.

It doesn't feel heavy in the hands, and you will really have to try hard to snap it in two (not recommended). The Wii U Game Pad is part controller and part handheld console, and new games are expected to take advantage of both abilities. I tried out the Wii U on two games, each featuring a different use for the device. ""Luigi's Haunted Mansion"" takes advantage of what Nintendo calls asymmetric gameplay. This allows the Wii U to have unique goals and abilities in the game when played simultaneously with other people holding regular Wii controllers. In this game, the player with the Wii U is a ghost trying to track down and capture the four players using Wii controllers. The ghost player uses the Wii U built-in screen to see everything on the map while the four other players must watch the TV screen to capture a ghost they can't usually see. The Wii U screen is large enough to make small shapes easy enough to distinguish. The two joystick controllers feel natural and sturdy, and comparable to other console joysticks. There are also two sets of shoulder buttons which are appropriately placed and don't feel uncomfortable to use. In the second game, ""Donkey Kong's Crash Course,"" those buttons are used to manipulate a course you navigate by tilting the Wii U in the appropriate directions. The shoulder buttons raise and lower bridges and elevators while the joysticks are used to turn cranks. It was a little difficult to rotate joysticks while also trying to tilt the Wii U. But with practice, I was able to get the right amount of touch without dying. Players can watch the overall action on their TVs or get an up-close view through the Wii U screen. I can't envision players using the big screen for games when the small one is in their hands. Nintendo plans to release a wide range of games, from kid titles like ""Pikmin 3"" to offerings for hardcore gamers like ""ZombiU"" and ""Mass Effect 3."" The promise of additional gameplay features for the Wii U make it an intriguing option. Overall, the Wii U is a solid hybrid of a souped-up Wii system and a handheld gaming device. It's larger than a traditional console controller, but not so heavy that it would cause fatigue problems. Despite no announcement of a specific launch date or a price, the Wii U will only be as good as the games made for it. Nintendo's focus on games during Tuesday's event is a sign the gaming company may have its eye on the right target.","The Wii U will bring a fresh new element to Nintendo gaming .

"(CNN) -- Fierce battles between Yemeni government forces and Shiite Muslim rebels in the country's northwest have displaced tens of thousands of people, creating widespread humanitarian concerns, aid agencies said Thursday. UNICEF trucks carrying supplies to internally displaced families in Yemen. ""The ongoing conflict in Saada has forced more than 100,000 people to flee their homes at great risks to their lives and well-being,"" said Ann Veneman of the United Nations Children's Fund. ""Children and women represent the majority of the displaced."" The agency has been working to get refugees out of conflict zones and to provide them with safe drinking water, sanitation and critical supplies. The number of displaced could total as many as 150,000, Veneman said. Getting assistance to those in need has been difficult, a government official said Wednesday. ""The government is cooperating with international relief organizations, with the U.N.,"" said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington. ""Internally we are doing all we can to ensure that civilians are not hurt and to minimize the collateral damage."" Yemen's government and Houthi rebels have been involved in intermittent fighting since 2004. The conflict is believed to be both separatist -- over who will have power in the area -- and sectarian -- whether Shiite Islam will dominate even though the majority of Yemenis are Sunni Muslim. The Houthis are Shiites. In mid-August, Yemen laid out cease-fire terms to the Houthi rebels, which included removing checkpoints, ending banditry and destructive acts, handing over all military equipment and weapons, and offering information on the fate of six kidnapped Europeans who disappeared in June, SABA, Yemen's official news agency reported. Yemen's President Ali Abdullah Saleh is also faced with a separatist movement in the country's south and a growing threat from al Qaeda. Al Qaeda in Yemen has been a growing concern for the United States. In late July, Gen. David Petraeus, commander of the U.S. Central Command, and an accompanying delegation met with Saleh in Yemen. One of the topics of discussion was how to better combat terrorism, according to SABA.","Aid agencies warn of humanitarian crisis amid Yemen fighting .

"(CNN) -- North Korea, with its previous technologically laggard image, may have just shocked the world with some alleged hacking savvy, but when ISIS comes to mind, so does the terrorists' digital bent. The Islamist militants renowned for their bloodthirsty beheading videos and slick social media propaganda, may have extended their skills into low-level hacking, a cyber-security human rights group believes. The Citizen Lab obtained new malware that has targeted the ISIS opposition group ""Raqqa is being Slaughtered Silently,"" or RSS, and released an analysis of it Thursday. The researchers from the University of Toronto can't confirm that the cyberattack is coming from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, especially since the Syrian regime led by Bashar al-Assad has also used Trojan horse software to fight activists since 2011. But the workings of the malware, its intended target and what it achieves for the attacker lead The Citizen Lab to suspect ISIS the most. ISIS hates RSS . ISIS is particularly motivated to strike RSS. The Islamist extremist militants like to depict their stronghold city of Raqqa to the world as a caliphate paradise, where life under strictest Sharia is practically Heaven on Earth. But RSS activists in the city reveal on social media Raqqa's bleeding underbelly, the terrorizing of residents. Warnings of graphic content speckle its Twitter feed, where photos of public beheadings and stonings of residents in Syrian cities are posted in unflinching detail. RSS also reports coalition airstrike hits against ISIS and warns Raqqa residents about new strict Sharia rules the militants impose on them. But activists participating in RSS activities have another enemy. Before ISIS took over their town, they were taking the same actions against the Syrian regime. Slapdash malware . The Raqqa target who passed along the malware to The Citizen Lab did not fall for its ploy, and the group was not successfully hacked, as far as The Citizen Lab researcher John Scott-Railton knows. But he fears others who may have received the target email may not have been so savvy or lucky. The malware used in the attack is simple and lean, and whoever wrote it did some things wrong -- or felt it wasn't necessary to do them right. The Citizen Lab found the malware to be effective and very dangerous even without proper coding whistles and bells, because its targeting of victims is socially savvy. This is how it works. The victim receives an enticing email tailored to his anti-ISIS interests from people claiming to be expat Syrian activists living in Canada. They ask for the local activist's help in working with mainstream media. ""We are preparing a lengthy news report on the realities of life in Raqqah,"" the email reads. ""We are sharing some information with you with the hope that you will correct it in case it contains errors."" Images are attached showing areal photos with spots marked on them portraying alleged ISIS strongholds and U.S. airstrike targets . And the email includes a link to a file sharing site, where the victim is encouraged to download files, which contain a slideshow of more such images. But in the download is also a malicious file, and while the victim views more photos, it installs a set of small malware files onto the target's computer. Find them, punish them . Once there, these bad files don't do much, The Citizen Lab said. Just enough. ""The custom malware ... beacons home with the IP address of the victim's computer and details about his or her system each time the computer restarts,"" it said in its study. That's enough for militants who know the area to determine the user's physical location. The files don't include a key logger -- although many forms of the software that monitors what infected users are writing are readily available on the Internet. Such RATs (Remote Access Trojans) are typical of the Syrian regime, whose hackers seems more interested in obtaining opposition activist content, the researchers Scott-Railton and Seth Hardy said. ""A RAT would have provided much greater access alongside IP information,"" they said. It makes the researchers think that whoever is using the slideshow malware may be interested only in ""identifying and locating a target."" Find his Internet café or apartment; haul him in; punish him -- or execute him. That's probably the idea, The Citizen Lab said. American journalist James Foley, who ISIS later beheaded, was captured coming out of an Internet café in Syria in 2012 before ISIS officially existed. Regime's signature different . This attempted hack doesn't bear the signature of typical Syrian regime attackers, The Citizen Lab said. They usually employ servers to facilitate data sent back by their RATs, but this malware doesn't need one. It sends an attachment with the sparse information it gathers to an email account. ""This functionality would be especially useful to an adversary unsure of whether it can maintain uninterrupted Internet connectivity,"" the researchers said. Whether shoddiness or simplicity: That email is improperly encrypted, leaving the recipient's logon credentials open to interception. One of the malware's passwords is also visible in its code. There are other apparent bugs, and software itself is unusually artless. ""It relies on a half dozen separate executable files, each with a single task,"" the researchers said. But keeping it bare bones has an advantage, the researchers said. ""The program looks less like malware, and may attract less attention from endpoint protection tools and scanners. Detections were low when the file was first submitted to VirusTotal, for example. It registered only 6/55 detections by anti-virus scanners, or a 10% detection rate."" This malware flies under the radar. - .","Target email speaks to victims who are opposed to ISIS and asks for their help .
It contains a link to a file sharing site, where a malicious file is hidden among photos .
Malware is artless, and the writer encrypted it wrong .

"Sen. John McCain, the incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, will hold a hearing into the cyber attack on Sony Pictures in the first two weeks of the next Congress. McCain also called the cyber attack ""an act of war"" and said that while the U.S. shouldn't respond with rockets and missiles, the U.S. should hit North Korea with a cyber attack of its own. ""This is the greatest blow to free speech that I've seen in my lifetime probably,"" McCain said Friday on Arizona radio station KFYI 550's ""The Mike Broomhead Show."" ""We have to respond in kind. We have lots of capability in cyber and we ought to start cranking that up.""

"One day after President Barack Obama announced that he is delaying executive action on immigration, top lawmakers urged the President to ditch his plans for an executive action altogether and work with Congress. Sen. Dianne Feinstein indicated she'd prefer the President not act unilaterally at all. ""The way this should be done is legislatively,"" the California Democrat said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""  She said anything done through presidential action would be challenged in the courts. Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, agreed, adding the President is being ""prudent"" by not acting. ""I think that was wise. He needs to work with Congress on this,"" he said, also on ""State of the Union."" On Saturday, the President announced he is delaying any action on immigration that could have protected many undocumented immigrant workers and families from deportation until after the midterm elections in November. His move prompted critics and analysts to determine his decision was political as Democrats are struggling to maintain control of the Senate. Even Democratic Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, who is a strong proponent of immigration reform, said ""it's clear that playing it safe is what is going on at the White House and among Democratic circles."" He said Democrats have looked at polling in red, Southern states with small Latino populations, including Georgia, North Carolina, Arkansas and Louisiana, where Democratic Senate candidates are at risk of losing in November. ""Playing it safe means walking away from our values and our principles,"" he added on ABC's ""This Week."" Obama said that he decided to postpone taking action because ""the politics did shift midsummer"" because of the record number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border. The President also said that he needs to spend time explaining to the American public his reasons for acting on immigration. ""I want to spend some time, even as we're getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we're doing this, why it's the right thing for the American people, why it's the right thing for the American economy,"" he said in an interview aired Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" But the President has also received criticism for his delay. Immigration reform advocates have said they are ""bitterly disappointed."" Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, expressed a similar sentiment, saying on ""Fox News Sunday"" that he's ""deeply disappointed"" that the President hasn't yet acted. While Rep. Tony Cardenas, D-California said Latinos and immigrant communities are ""frustrated"" with the President for taking so long to act, he said the majority of frustration is placed at the feet of Congress. ""The first blame is with Congress not doing its job, and now the President is forced to have to take a measure like executive actions,"" he said on CNN. The Senate passed a comprehensive piece of immigration legislation in 2013 but it has been stalled in the House. That inaction led the President to announce at the beginning of the summer that he would act in spite of congressional inaction. Rogers said he hopes the President never moves forward on such an executive action, calling it ""risky"" for his relationship with Republicans. ""I think it's very risky for the President. He already has a credibility crisis. If he takes this step, it would make for a very long two years,"" Rogers said.","Two top lawmakers say Obama should drop plan for executive action to get immigration reform .

"A 56-year-old Southern California woman was charged Friday with driving intoxicated into a crowd exiting a church Christmas-related event, killing four people, including a 6-year-old boy, prosecutors said. Margo Julie Bronstein of Redondo Beach pleaded not guilty in a Los Angeles courtroom to four felony counts of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and one felony count of driving under the influence of a drug causing injury, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said. She is being held on $500,000 bail. Bronstein's attorney unsuccessfully asked the court that bail be reduced to $100,000; Bronstein client has no criminal record and a clean driving history, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. ""This appears to be an accident. It wasn't an intentional act on her behalf,"" attorney Jeffrey Gray said, according to the station. Redondo Beach Police Lt. Joe Hoffman said prescription medication was involved ""at the very minimum,"" according to the affiliate. Timothy Eakin, a friend of Bronstein, told KTLA that Bronstein ""takes a lot of pain medications, and she actually drives her vehicle with hand controls."" Bronstein has had many hip and leg surgeries and had been in a wheelchair most of her life, Eakin told KTLA. Bronstein on Wednesday evening allegedly swerved around vehicles stopped at red light, crossed the light and plowed into a group in a crosswalk on Pacific Coast Highway as they left St. James Catholic Church in Redondo Beach, authorities said. The highway is the busiest street in Redondo Beach, police said. Bronstein kept driving before ""colliding head-on with a vehicle"" going the other way, police said. Killed were Martha Gaza, 36; and her son Samuel, 6; Mary Anne Wilson, 81; and Saeko Matsumura, 87, prosecutors said. In all, the felony complaint names nine victims. At least one pedestrian struck ""was moved up to where the head-on collision occurred,"" police said. About 12 ambulances rushed to find people lying in the street, suffering from injuries ranging from minor to critical, Division Chief Rob Rappaport of the Redondo Beach Fire Department said. If convicted on all charges, Bronstein faces about 40 years in prison, prosecutors said.","Margo Julie Bronstein, 56, faces about 40 years in prison if convicted of all charges .

"Dozens of militants were killed in crackdowns across Pakistan on Friday, officials said, days after the Pakistani Taliban massacred nearly 150 people at a school. The Pakistani military claimed it killed 32 militants in an ambush as they were moving toward the Afghan border in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The military's statement didn't specify whether any of those killed were Taliban members or say whether the ambush was linked to Tuesday's deadly attack by the group on a school in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The military claimed that the fleeing insurgents ""left behind bodies of their accomplices"" after the firefight. Three members of the Pakistani security forces were wounded, it said. CNN wasn't able to independently confirm what took place. Pakistani security forces also killed eight militants in the southwestern province of Balochistan, including a Taliban commander, during a heavy exchange of fire, an intelligence officer said. The military actions follow this week's horrifying Taliban attack on an army school in Peshawar that killed 145 people, 132 of them children. The school massacre prompted widespread revulsion across Pakistan. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif responded by announcing an end to a moratorium on the death penalty in terrorism cases. The Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, said they targeted a school that mostly admits soldiers' children because the students aspired to follow in their fathers' footsteps and target militants. They also said it was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen and their children during a recent offensive by Pakistan's military. The Pakistani army has been conducting a ground offensive aimed at clearing out Taliban and other militants in the loosely governed tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan. The campaign has displaced tens of thousands of people. The Pakistani Taliban, which has close ties with its namesake in Afghanistan, has long taken credit for an extensive list of assaults on civilians and security forces in Pakistan.","Pakistan's military says its forces killed 32 militants in an ambush in the northwest .

"Six months after she was freed from the ""house of horrors"" where Ariel Castro held her captive for 11 years, Cleveland kidnapping victim Michelle Knight is speaking out. In an exclusive interview with Dr. Phil McGraw scheduled to air Tuesday and Wednesday, Knight describes a moment when Castro trapped her in a room and tied her up with an orange extension cord. ""I was tied up like a fish,"" she said, ""an ornament on the wall."" An excerpt released by the ""Dr. Phil"" syndicated talk show Monday shows Knight sitting cross-legged on a couch and drawing a U-shape in the air with one finger as she describes how Castro hung her by her feet, neck and arms. Knight also says Castro taped her mouth shut with duct tape, according to another excerpt posted on the show's YouTube channel. And she tells McGraw she once picked a lock to try to escape, drawing an ominous warning from Castro: ""Now you're gonna be punished."" Knight, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus were freed from Castro's Cleveland home in May, drawing national attention to the horrific case. The dramatic rescue came after neighbors heard Berry's cries and broke down a door. ""It's astounding to me that she had the strength that she did,"" McGraw told ""Anderson Cooper 360."" ""She says that she was referred to as the unbreakable one. She fought him every step of the way."" McGraw said Knight was chained around the neck and waist with a motorcycle helmet on her head. She was left there for days at a time, Mcgraw said, adding that Knight told him she couldn't lie down because the chain was too short. So she would just lean and wait until she passed out from fatigue. Knight told McGraw, though, that she didn't always fight back, at least not at first. She said she was in shock after being taken and all she could do was cry and beg him to let her go back to her son. He threw money at her. ""He was obsessed with prostitutes and also he thought I was a 13-year-old prostitute,"" she said in the interview. ""When he found out my real age he got mad."" Knight, 32, was 21 years old when she was reported missing in 2002. In August, Castro was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years after he pleaded guilty to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping. He committed suicide in his prison cell in September. Before the women's rescue, Knight's disappearance generated less publicity and attention than the kidnappings of Berry and DeJesus, and a level of mystery still surrounds her case. But since their rescue, Knight hasn't shied away from speaking out. ""After 11 years, I am finally being heard, and it's liberating,"" she said in a powerful statement at Castro's sentencing describing the abuse she endured. ""You took 11 years of my life away, and I have got it back. I spent 11 years in hell, and now your hell is just beginning,"" she told Castro. ""I will overcome all this that happened, but you will face hell for eternity."" When crews demolished the 1,400-square-foot house where Castro held them captive, Knight was there, handing out yellow balloons to onlookers. She said she was at the demolition site in part to remind relatives of abducted children that all is not necessarily lost. ""I want the people out there to know -- including the mothers -- that they can have strength, they can have hope, and their child will come back,"" she said. Since their release, accounts have depicted Knight as someone who cared for the other victims during their captivity while also enduring great suffering herself. A family friend of one of the victims said this year that Castro used Knight as his main ""punching bag."" The friend said Castro hit Knight with a variety of objects, including hand weights. She has suffered vision loss, joint and muscle damage, and other problems from her time in captivity. According to an initial incident report obtained by CNN, Knight said she became pregnant at least five times while in Castro's home. When that happened, she told investigators, Castro ""starved her for at least two weeks, then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried."" Knight said Castro ordered her to deliver Berry's child, according to a police source familiar with the investigation. ""What's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6-year-old,"" a police source said.","Michelle Knight says Ariel Castro thought she was a 13-year-old prostitute .

"(CNN) -- A California music teacher's insanely elaborate ""Star Wars"" themed Christmas lights show is dazzling the Internet with its lightsabers and some 100,000 lights choreographed to songs from the movies. Tom BetGeorge, whose display was featured on a recent episode of ABC's ""The Great Christmas Light Fight,"" even made massive instruments that play real notes, according to his YouTube description. He said he uses the display to raise money for the poor and homeless through his church. There's something about Christmas that brings out people's whimsical sides. Besides BetGeorge, we've come across some men and women whose traditions were so delightful we couldn't help but wish we were spending the holiday season at their homes. Vote for your favorite at the bottom, and hear why they go to such lengths to celebrate: . To bring joy to the neighbors . Kevin Lynch, a retired firefighter in Queens and last year's winner of ""The Great Christmas Light Fight,"" covers his house and lawn with more than 300 giant plastic figures, 100 animated characters and 300,000 lights to entertain the masses. He even hired an electrician to install 30 outlets outside his house and on the roof, specifically to support his obsession. He thoughtfully buries the power cords underground so no one admiring the display will get hurt. Lynch says the greatest part of his elaborate display is the people who come to see it. ""The joy and the happiness it brings to little kids and adults is fantastic,"" Lynch said. After 18 years of decorating, the retired New York City firefighter has no plans to stop. ""It's a tradition. If I don't put the lights up, I will have thousands of people ringing the bell thinking someone died."" Don't bother asking him how much his electric bill runs. He'll only tell you if you agree to pay it. To enjoy nostalgia at its best . The cuteness! How can you not smile when you look at the '50s and '60s elves, pixies and reindeer in Amalia Martinez's San Francisco apartment. She and her fiance have spent the past six years collecting dozens of vintage Christmas decorations to dress up their abode, which they call ""Popville,"" a reference to Andy Warhol's factory. The aluminum tree is illuminated by a bright rotating color wheel, and the big-eyed Blythe dolls get to have their very own tree. To channel his inner child . Nick Sweetman, a chef in Plymouth, United Kingdom, played with Legos as a child and forgot about them until he started helping his son build sets people had given him. He has since become a bit of a celebrity on the AFOL (Adult Fan of Legos) scene, recently winning a national award for building a Star Wars world in Lego. His Christmas displays have gotten bigger and bigger each year. This year, he told us he's working on a fully lit English fishing village. Here, we get a peek inside the International Training Centre of Santa Skills (training begins tomorrow). To entertain his grandchildren, and the kid at heart in all of us . For the past several years, Maury Fisher has decorated the center of the Christmas Eve dining table with an elaborate model train display that moves, with specialized sound effects. Fisher is a 64-year-old computer technician and grandfather of four in Highland Park, Illinois. This year's display features 11 tracks on which 17 rail lines run at the same time, including two separate Hanukkah lines. In all, there are more than 130 train cars on display. ""It is my holiday endeavor to bring a smile to everyone appealing to the kids at heart in all of us,"" Fisher said, ""notwithstanding the severity of the news from all over the world."" To indulge her love of kitsch . Jennifer Perkins, a crafting and lifestyle blogger in Austin, Texas, loves neon, glitter and all things sparkly. For Christmas, she's got 15 silver aluminum tinsel trees, along with pink, teal, gold and red varieties. She also has a tree decorated entirely with a collection of vintage Fisher-Price toys. ""I always say people should not take home decorating too seriously. Stay away from trends and follow your gut,"" she said. ""Same holds true when decorating for the holidays. If you want a 7.5-foot tall hot pink tree with a topper that looks like a headdress for a Vegas showgirl then go for it. Santa does not discriminate based on tree color."" To preserve a bit of Christmas history . In Scott Luedtke's Wisconsin house, you'll find at least one tree (or two or seven) in every room. There's the American tree with Shiny-Brite ornaments from the World War II era, a Jewel Brite tree with plastic diorama ornaments from the 1960s, a family tree with photos of ancestors, and the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, a balsam or a Fraser fir holding thousands of vintage and antique ornaments from Europe. Luedtke, an antique dealer and interior decorator, started collecting as a child when his babysitter's grandparents moved to an apartment and were throwing out all their Christmas decorations. He and his partner typically hold several open houses for friends and family who love to share the spirit of the season. ""For me it isn't about showing off the collection. It is about the opening of the memories that many people recall of Christmases of their past, some long forgotten,"" said Luedtke, an active member of the Golden Glow of Christmas Past, an international organization of vintage Christmas collectors. ""It brings a smile to my face every time someone says, 'Oh I haven't seen one of those in years,' or 'We had that as a child growing up.' "" To buck tradition . Sherri Aguilar, 61, can't quite explain why, but for the last 27 years she has hung her live Christmas tree upside down from the ceiling. The San Diego native attaches the tree with eye bolts and uses a staple gun to get the gift bags and presents to stay.

Among her collection are old-fashioned clothespins painted like Santa, a Santa piggy bank and some very hard to find Santa Mardi Gras beads.

"""America's favorite way to fly"" has returned. Eastern Air Lines, which used that slogan in the 1980s, flew its first of 20 new planes into Miami International Airport on Friday afternoon.  The event marks a relaunch of the once-bankrupt airline, which last flew in 1991. According to an airline spokesperson, Eastern is now expected to take to the skies in March 2015 as a charter airline.  That date is a few months delayed from the original hopes of CEO Ed Wegel, who said in January that the airline would start flights this month. In recent months, Eastern has ordered a fleet of 737-800 Boeing aircrafts.  It has also held hiring events for flight attendants, as well as started the application process for pilots.  On its website, Eastern says it will initially hire 10 captains and then add 25 to 30 pilots. Eastern Air Lines Group filed an application with the Department of Transportation earlier this year.  It will be based in Miami, where Eastern was headquartered from 1927 to 1991, when it was the largest employer in what was then known as Dade County. Wegel also said no decisions have been made on initial routes, but that the airline plans to restart as a provider of charter services initially and then build into scheduled service at a yet-to-be-determined date. He said the group bought the rights to the Eastern name and logo out of bankruptcy court in 2009, but it had to wait until now to find the investor support needed to restart the airline. ""When you look at history since '78, how many airlines started, how many didn't make it, it's not a business for the faint of heart,"" Wegel said in January. ""But we believe there are opportunities that will present themselves for us once we show we are a good airline operator."" According to the group's website, Eastern was founded in 1927 and adopted its name in 1930. It was a major carrier along the East Coast, pioneering the shuttle service from New York to Boston and Washington. Wegel said there were years in the 1980s when Eastern had the most passengers of any U.S. airline, because of the shuttle and its extensive Latin American route system. ""We've done extensive surveys and polling on the name,"" he said. ""It has 80% recognition in Miami, and overall it has very positive name recognition still."" The airline was sold in 1986 and filed for bankruptcy protection in 1989. Labor unrest and a drop-off in air traffic associated with the January 1991 Gulf War forced it out of business.","Revived Eastern Air Lines will be based in Miami .

"The deafening roar of state-of-the-art warplanes being catapulted into the air from its huge flight deck signaled that the USS George Washington was back in combat mode after its recent detour to the Philippines to take part in the aid effort in the wake of Super Typhoon Haiyan. Barely a week on and the 90,000-ton Nimitz-class aircraft carrier is now patrolling waters off the island of Okinawa as part a huge naval exercise -- AnnualEx 2013 -- involving dozens of warships, submarines and aircraft from the U.S. Navy's 7th fleet and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF). The aim? To provide a stern test of their ability to effectively and mutually respond to the defense of Japan or to a regional crisis or contingency situation in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region, according to the U.S. Navy. But this year's war games have taken on an added dimension given the high-pressure atmosphere in the region at present -- they take place in the shadow of a controversial new Air Defense Identification Zone announced by the Chinese last weekend. This zone, which incorporates among other areas an East China Sea island chain at the center of an acrimonious tug of war between Tokyo and Beijing, requires that all military aircraft in the area must report their flight plans to China, maintain two-way radio and clearly mark their nationalities on the aircraft. China has warned it will take ""defensive measures"" if their orders are ignored. 'Steady as you go' The commander of the U.S. 7th fleet, Vice Admiral Robert L. Thomas, appeared relaxed about the situation while addressing a group of reporters aboard the USS George Washington. He said while China's air defense zone did not appear to be ""well thought out"" given the overlap with both Japanese and South Korean territorial claims, he did not think U.S. military activity in the region would be negatively affected. ""We are going to continue with our operations in international airspace as we always have,"" he said. ""It's about international norms, standards, rules and laws. When anybody makes an extreme claim it is really an imperative that the international community can continue to operate in accordance with international law and not be distracted. ""So for us it's 'steady as you go.' Our operations in the East China Sea will continue as they always have."" 'Profoundly dangerous' Japan, which administers the largely uninhabited island chain -- known as Diaoyu by China and Senkaku by the Japanese -- has described China's move as ""a profoundly dangerous act that may cause unintended consequences in the area,"" while U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said ""this unilateral action constitutes an attempt to change the status quo in the East China Sea. Escalatory action will only increase tensions in the region and create risks of an incident."" China has rebuffed any criticism by stating that its action is not directed at any one in particular, and that other countries -- including Japan -- have established similar control zones in the past. In recent months, both sides have been involved in a dangerous game of ""cat and mouse,"" prompting fears that any miscalculation could set the two Asian powers on a collision course -- with the United States likely to be dragged into such a conflict to defend its Japanese ally. Tokyo says it has twice scrambled fighter jets this month after Chinese aircraft appeared on course to enter its airspace. For its part, China lodged a complaint after it said a Japanese warship recently entered waters where the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy was holding live-fire drills, noting ""the provocative move may have led to unexpected emergencies."" Meanwhile, China's first aircraft carrier, the ""Liaoning,"" set sail this week from its home port of Qingdao in eastern China. According to the PLA Navy's website, it will head for the South China Sea to ""conduct scientific experiments and military training."" This course would take it through the East China Sea accompanied by four other warships. Restraint . Yet with so many potential flashpoints in the region, Thomas is optimistic that conflict will be avoided. He pointed to the professionalism shown by the armed forces on all sides in the region as the basis for this confidence. ""The South Koreans have shown great restraint with regard to North Korea and those severe provocations, while the Japanese Self Defense Force has also been very measured,"" he said. Significantly, he pointed to China's development of a ""world class"" navy, with a level of professionalism that matches its improving infrastructure. ""The more confident they become in their own capabilities, then this will actually 'depressurize' the situation,"" he said. He added that the People's Liberation Army Navy was no longer an unpredictable, conscription-based force training only at certain times of the year. He said the PLA Navy was now showing signs of being able to operate far beyond its own waters, carrying out missions -- such as anti-piracy patrols -- that could make it a useful and responsible global operator. Humanitarian challenge . With F-18 fighters taking off and landing almost every few minutes, it was easy to forget the role the carrier played in the Leyte Gulf more than a week ago. Many of its fighter jets were flown back to Japan to make room for more helicopters able to ferry in supplies to remote areas of the Philippines in the wake of Super Typhoon Haiyan. ""The ship became a 'lily pad' for relief operations,"" said the carrier's commander, Rear Admiral Mark Montgomery. ""This is something we'll train more for,"" he added, citing the need for a modern navy to be able to adapt to an increasingly diverse range of challenges and missions within its theater of operations. ""It was humbling to be able to take part in the extraordinary humanitarian effort in the Philippines."" Yet the sight of dozens of warships in tight formation in high seas off Japan was another reminder of how serious the U.S. and Japan are taking the threat to regional security -- undeniably their biggest challenge.","USS George Washington in huge naval exercise -- AnnualEx 2013 -- off Okinawa .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The Taliban's release of a new video purportedly showing a captured American soldier in Afghanistan ""is a horrible act,"" a U.S. military official said Friday. Pfc. Bowe Robert Bergdahl, 23, disappeared from his combat outpost in southeastern Paktika province sometime after he finished his guard duty shift on the night of June 29. The military believes the man in the video is Bergdahl. ""To release this video on Christmas Day is an affront to the deeply concerned family and friends of Bowe Bergdahl, demonstrating contempt for religious traditions and the teachings of Islam,"" said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Gregory Smith, spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force. Family members viewed the video shortly after being notified about its existence Friday morning, said Lt. Col. Tim Marsano, public affairs officer for the Idaho National Guard, who has been serving as a liaison between Bergdahl's family and the media. ""The Bergdahl family pleads with the captors to let our only son come home,"" Bergdahl's relatives said in a statement released through the Idaho National Guard. ""To Bowe: we love you and we believe in you. Stay strong."" Wearing U.S. Army combat fatigues stripped of the name tag and rank, the man in the video identifies himself as Bergdahl and emphasizes that he has been treated humanely. He says America has lost any hope of winning the Afghan war and that U.S. political leaders such as George W. Bush and Barack Obama cannot be trusted. He also asserts that the U.S. military's opponents in Afghanistan are ""very smart"" and have ""perfected"" warfare. In the past, freed hostages have indicated their statements during captivity were forced and made against their will. Smith said the soldier in the video ""was clearly compelled to read a prepared statement."" Watch part of the video . ""It reflects nothing more than the violent, deceitful tactics of the Taliban insurgency. We will continue our search for Bowe Bergdahl as well as our efforts to ensure the security of the Afghan people and our coalition partners,"" he said. A senior U.S. official, who could not speak on the record because of the sensitivity of the circumstances, said the sections of the video with interviews of Bergdahl appear to have been filmed some months ago. The official said the document is not considered a ""proof of life"" video. The timing and authenticity of other sections of the video and the locations where it was made have not been determined, the official said. Bergdahl, an airborne infantryman, also appeared in a 28-minute Web video released by the Taliban in July, in which he was calm but became emotional when speaking about his girlfriend and family and going home.","Family views video, pleads for soldier's safe return .

"(CNN)Jo Jin-hye, who escaped North Korea, wanted to watch ""The Interview."" The comedy lampoons North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, whose dynasty she loathes. Her father died in custody of North Korean security forces, who tied him by his wrist in a torturous position for 10 days without food. Her younger brother starved to death and her older sister is missing. Read her story: A brutal choice . Jo escaped North Korea with her mother and sister, and was granted asylum in the United States in 2008, where they now reside in a quiet suburb. When told ""The Interview"" would not be shown in theaters, Jo asked, ""Are we that afraid? It's sort of embarrassing. I thought America is strong. If North Korea is that frightening, I think that speaks for itself."" If North Korea hacked the United States, she said, ""Of course, people have to hack North Korea."" Satire and North Korea . There's nothing like canceling a satire to anger a nation. From celebrities to politicians, just about anybody with a social media account has been venting about Sony Picture's decision to pull ""The Interview"" from U.S. theaters. Critics say it's caving to hackers and muzzling free speech. The FBI announced North Korea is officially responsible for the cyberattack on Sony Pictures, an attack law enforcement officials called a ""game changer."" In a press conference Friday, Obama said the United States will respond ""proportionally"" to the attack,though he would not say how it would specifically retaliate. ""Right now people are angry in the U.S., people are angry at Sony,"" said Alex Gladstein, director of institutional affairs at Human Rights Foundation. ""It's not the greatest movie of all time, but they can't even go see it."" He said he'd like to harness the interest about the film and North Korea to ""get people to hack North Korea back in a educational way, to look at what we're doing, some of the groups of North Koreans who've escaped, who are hacking for educational purposes. If we can hack North Korea back, it'd be pretty powerful."" Gladstein doesn't mean hacking in the sense of exposing emails or using the tactics of the Sony hackers, who call themselves the Guardians of Peace. It's a type of hacking ""to disrupt North Korea and help end the Kim regime's monopoly of knowledge. It's nonviolent and we're figuring out the best way to get Hollywood movies, Korean dramas and offline Wikipedias, different art, music into North Korea."" For years, activists have been disseminating radios, launching balloons near the border and circulating secret cell phones, USB drives through smugglers to communicate with North Koreans -- who are at great threat if they're caught.  They face severe punishment, imprisonment and even death for possessing or watching foreign media. ""Satire and creative thinking are dangerous for dictatorships and the ability to control society. It's losing control and it's very afraid of that,"" Gladstein said. Balloon activists vow to send copies of ""The Interview"" The group wants to drop DVDs of ""Team America: World Police,"" a 2004 film that pokes fun at North Korea's former leader, Kim Jong Il, along with several other movies in a campaign it's calling #Hackthemback. The country's human rights record is under increasing scrutiny as the UN General Assembly called for the Security Council to refer North Korea to the International International Criminal Court and sanction those most responsible for ""crimes against humanity."" Silicon Valley meets North Korean defectors . In August, a group of human rights activists, coders, engineers and Silicon Valley types gathered in SOMA, a San Francisco neighborhood known for its concentration of start-ups and tech companies. North Korean defectors flew into the event, called Hack North Korea to share their insights in spreading information inside the country. DVDs and Korean dramas give North Koreans a peek into the forbidden, outside world they had never known. ""When North Koreans describe their 'Aha' moment, when they realize they were lied to by their government, they got information from a movie or reading a book or seeing something -- something that jived,"" said Alex Lloyd, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, who also co-organized the event. Some of the hackathon ideas included retro tech like smuggling pagers into North Korea to decidedly no tech, like a slingshot to fling media across the border.  One centered on using the Raspberry Pi, a popular microcomputer that fits in the palm of the hand. Why everyone wants a slice of Raspberry Pi . The winning idea at the hackathon was a satellite receiver that would get broadcast signals from South Korea. That team has an 18-year-old hacker, named Justice Suh, who traveled to South Korea this year to show a prototype to North Korea activist groups. If the receivers are small enough, they could be smuggled into the country for North Koreans to receive outside information, Suh said. The first hackathon was a test and future North Korea-focused events will likely focus on solving certain technical issues, Lloyd said. ""What's lasting is the relationships made between the North Korean community living in South Korea and Silicon Valley,"" he said.

"Washington (CNN)The lame duck is loose. Little more than two years before the moment he stands next to his successor at the presidential inauguration of 2017, President Barack Obama is feeling unshackled from the constraints of eyeing the next election cycle after last month's disastrous midterms for Democrats. Simply put, top White House officials say, the President is on a mission to get stuff done. From his dramatic decision to open up diplomatic relations with Cuba to his executive actions on immigration, Obama no longer has to worry about the hand-wringing of endangered Senate Democrats concerned with reelection. ""I think it's absolutely true,"" former White House press secretary and CNN political contributor Jay Carney said. ""Having lost (the Senate), it does provide some liberation to him."" The unbridled Obama even took the time to call in to a Massachusetts radio show to needle his friend, outgoing Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. The ""fourth quarter"" policy blitz that is underway at the West Wing is similar in some respects to the ""bear is loose"" image strategy the White House employed last summer. The looser and more active Obama appears, the more the public likes him, aides thought at the time. Asked how he felt about being a ""lame duck"" at his post-midterm news conference, Obama said he planned to squeeze as much as he could into his final years in office. ""You know, if you look at the history of almost every President, those last two years, all kinds of stuff happens. In some cases, stuff that we couldn't predict,"" the President said. Current White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama accomplished his goal of making 2014 a ""year of action,"" filled with executive orders carried out with the President's ""pen and phone."" ""There is a lot more that needs to get done and the President has a long list of things that he's looking forward to tackling in the new year after a couple weeks with his family after the holidays,"" Earnest told reporters at his final press briefing of 2014. Privately, senior aides push back on the notion that Obama has adopted the newly frenetic pace solely because the midterms are behind him. The administration's sanctions on Russia may only now be paying dividends but they were applied over a course of the last year.  Re-establishing ties with Cuba, one official notes, was a long-term project that began 18 months ago. ""If Democrats had kept the Senate, Obama would still be doing this,"" Carney said about Cuba. But Carney said the transfer of the gavel of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee from current chairman Sen. Bob Menendez -- a Democrat and fierce critic of Obama's Cuba policy -- to Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee may have helped somewhat. ""It's more difficult when the chairman is your own party member,"" Carney added. Losing control of Congress to Republicans has pushed Obama into the late presidency ""refuge"" of foreign policy. ""He has an enormous capacity to act and that, I think, is what he is doing,"" said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East analyst at the Wilson Center. Case in point is the administration's long-delayed but persistent hope to contain Iran's nuclear program. A deadline for a deal with the Iranian government was pushed back again just weeks ago. ""He's now in a position for a comprehensive agreement,"" Miller said of post-midterm Obama. Cuba is another matter. The unpredictability of the Castro brothers could create headaches for the Obama administration and, by extension, the Democrats heading into 2016. ""Hillary is going to have a hard time with this one,"" Miller said. But successes in foreign policy could easily translate into higher approval ratings. Witness the strides made by Ronald Reagan at the end of the Cold War. Reagan's cry, ""Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall,"" still resonates today. Obama's standing in public opinion polls are situated nearly where Reagan's popularity stood at the same point in his second term, according to Andrew Kohut, the founding director of the respected Pew Research Center. ""Indeed views of Obama are not any worse than were attitudes toward Ronald Reagan at about this time in his second term. Understanding the arc of a presidential popularity rating, especially one as varied as Obama's, requires a longer perspective than a single midterm snapshot,"" Andrew Kohut, Pew Research Center's founding director wrote in a Politico op-ed. Reagan was also buoyed by a rapidly expanding economy.  As the Obama White House is finding, the economic picture is finally brightening after the worst recession since the Great Depression. ""The economy is doing well. It's in a good place. It's going to be in a better place,"" Carney said.","President Barack Obama, freed from the burden of further elections, is hoping to get things done .
From normalizing relations with Cuba to pressing for immigration changes, Obama is active ."
"Syria's civil war is not America's problem. Syria is surrounded by Turkey, Israel, Egypt, Jordan, and other Arab nations with large standing armies and advanced military equipment. Their cowardice in acting to stop a war on their doorstep should give us pause for thought. Why will they not act, but we must? Why is American gullibility for war so strong that countries such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and Israel can dispense of their moral duties to the American taxpayer? Make no mistake about it: al Assad is a war criminal, having had his own civilians and soldiers slaughtered in a war to keep his family in power. The sectarian, ethnic, and religious dimensions of the war have kept the Obama administration (rightly in my view) away from direct military involvement in the conflict. But what has changed now? The use of chemical weapons to kill people jolts us into probable action, but millions displaced, wounded and 100,000 dead did not. Why? Because the banality of the policy shift rests on the assumptions that American cruise missiles can prevent further use of chemical weapons, provide a face-saving measure for President Barack Obama who can argue that he acted after his ""red line"" had been crossed in Syria, and neuter critics of Obama's Syria policy. There is no absolute certainty as to whether al Assad used chemical weapons, or rebel factions did. Al Assad has no credible motivation to use these weapons at this stage, and in this phase of the conflict. He is not losing. If, as the Russians claim, it was al Qaeda-affiliated al-Nusrah group or Free Syrian Army elements that used weapons to bait America into the conflict, then U.S. firepower would be futile in establishing how a ragtag army and terrorists obtained chemical weapons. No amount of surgical strikes on government facilities will prevent non-state actors from further use of these weapons. What justifies intervening if Syria uses chemical weapons? But if we believe that al Assad used these weapons, and launch punitive attacks on Syria, what exactly are we targeting? The secretive and globally isolated nature of the Assad regime and therefore his chemical stockpiles means that we do not know where these are located. We intervened in Libya with greater confidence because Gadhafi's chemical weapons were mostly eliminated by an international inspection arrangement prior to the Arab uprisings. By bombing Syria now we increase the risk of al Assad using chemical weapons on populations and cities that are not under government control, or to quell new rebellions. Damaging his air force and known military installation would force him to consider his more extreme options for regime survival. Syria is now a fight to the death for both sides. U.S.-led military strikes in Syria will not change the tide of the war. That is not the mission, nor is it achievable by aerial blitzing. The Syrian opposition is not a government in waiting. It is too fragmented ideologically, overwrought by al Qaeda affiliates, deeply anti-American, and dominated by suburban fighters with little control of major cities, mercenaries who are not committed to peaceful coexistence with Syria's religious Christians, nor its Jewish neighbor. Syria after al Assad will be worse. A new civil war will break out between opposition factions. By bombing Syria today, we bear the burden of the instability we leave in our wake.

"Peshawar, Pakistan (CNN)The high brick wall outside the Army Public School and Degree College in Peshawar gives the first clue into the horror that unfolded inside its classrooms. A section of barbed wire has been cut at the top, allowing some of the Taliban attackers who struck Tuesday to scale the wall with bamboo ladders and drop inside, intent on killing. Another team of militants got in further down the wall. And then they took off toward the school buildings. As they burst into the main auditorium, full of children taking classes, the attackers split into two teams. Now the media, allowed into the school by the Pakistani army, can see close-up the carnage they wrought. Overturned wooden chairs lie on the floor, pools of reddish-brown dried blood beneath them. More blood has pooled under red fabric-covered seats set in rows. It was here that so many children cowered, trying to hide under benches and chairs. A single brown shoe sits discarded under one seat, the fate of its owner unknown. A brigadier was giving a lesson in first aid when the attackers charged in. Bandages and other first aid equipment lie tumbled on a desk. A dummy used in class remains on the floor where the brigadier fell. ""They shot me as soon as they came in,"" says 17-year-old survivor Sadeel Ahmed, speaking from his hospital bed. ""We tried to run. I was shot in my shoulder. The people they came, they had no sense of humanity in them. They killed little children. Muslims would not do this."" Cold-blooded murder . More puddles of drying blood and abandoned shoes lie by one of two doors through which the army says the students sought to flee the auditorium. A hundred of them were gunned down as they tried to escape, in an act of cold-blooded murder. It was the place where the greatest number of lives were lost. Beyond the auditorium, blood splatters can still be seen on the ground in all directions. Not satisfied with their slaughter in the auditorium, the Taliban attackers went upstairs to a computer lab. Pools of blood on the floor show how their young victims, many of them sons and daughters of army personnel from around Peshawar, were sprayed with bullets as they sat at each machine. Classroom after classroom tells the same brutal story. A pair of glasses on the floor here, children's pencils and pens there, a page from a schoolbook lying torn and crumpled. Bullet holes punctuate a blackboard where the teacher would have been standing. Below, another gruesome red stain where the teacher fell. Final showdown . In the administration block, where the final showdown took place between Taliban militants and security forces, shattered bricks by the door show where one attacker detonated his suicide vest. Shrapnel from the ball bearings packed inside the vest, to cause maximum harm when detonated, pockmarks the wall to one side. Soldiers with guns still stand guard as the media are allowed in to see the culmination of a bloody siege that lasted several hours. Rubble on the far side of the room shows where another suicide bomber blew himself up, leaving chaos and devastation behind. The principal's office is nearby. She also was killed, one of a dozen teachers to lose their lives in the attack. Right at the end of the corridor, its painted walls pocked and blasted, is the spot where the last suicide bomber detonated his vest. The deputy principal, who hid in a room nearby, survived. In the dusty, sunlit yard into which the corridor opens lie the remains of the last attacker -- a small mound covered by a white cloth, another soldier standing by. A day earlier, the people of Peshawar mourned as they buried their dead -- more than 140 of them, mostly children, who'd blithely left home for an ordinary day at school, never to come home. CNN's Nic Robertson reported from Peshawar and Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. Victoria Eastwood, Sophia Saifi and Javed Iqbal also contributed to this report.","Pakistan's military allows media in to see the devastation inside the Peshawar school .

"Talent, a 20-1 outsider, dominated rivals to capture the Oaks, the premier fillies' Classic of the season. The Ralph Beckett-trained filly made a brilliant last-to-first move in the home straight at Epsom under jockey Richard Hughes to lead home a talented field including stablemate Secret Gesture in second and The Lark in third. All the attention pre-race had been on Beckett's other runner, the Qatar Bloodstock-owned Secret Gesture. Qatar's Sheikh Fahad decided to buy a half-share in the filly just this week after her impressive 10-length victory in the Lingfield Oaks trial. The endorsement of one of the most competitive owners in the business helped propel her to early favorite in the markets, leaving Talent relatively unexposed. But the chestnut daughter of New Approach showed her true colors as she swept past her rivals to claim victory by 3¾ lengths.  The Lark was a further ¾ length behind in third, with favorite Moth in fourth. After a somewhat fractious start in which several of the fillies appeared to become unsettled by the atmosphere on course, an early break-neck pace was set by David Simcock's Miss You Too, who appeared to taking a keen hold with jockey Ian Mongan. By contrast, Hughes was content to settle Talent towards the back of the field, choosing to make his move after rounding the famous Tattenham Corner and gradually moving up through the field before letting Talent hit her stride inside the final furlong. At the start of the season, veteran jockey Hughes had yet to capture an English Classic. He is now two for two in the fillies' Classics, having won the 1,000 Guineas on Sky Lantern last month. ""It's like buses isn't it?"" Hughes said.  ""I thought that I would win five furlongs out, she was going that well. I would say that she would be even better on better ground."" Beckett added: ""I wasn't watching her until she suddenly loomed up on the outside. He just put her in the race and she got keen and started tanking then. ""What a day. Having the first two doesn't happen, does it?"" The Oaks is English racing's premier fillies' race and was first run in 1779, making it one year older than the Derby itself. It gives its name to, among other races, the Kentucky Oaks.","Talent, not expected to win, makes a move in the home straight to claim the Oaks .

"The tanking Russian economy seems to be doing little to encourage President Vladimir Putin to repair relations with the West. In fact, Putin is slipping deeper into a revisionist Cold War mindset, sending the worst East-West standoff in decades into a potentially more dangerous phase. With Russia's economy on the verge of collapse, Putin could have used his annual marathon news conference on Thursday to show flexibility over Ukraine and to raise the prospect of relief from Western sanctions. But instead, in powerful  rhetoric, he dug in, comparing Russia to a ""bear"" that the United States and its allies are determined to chain down before ripping out ""its teeth and claws."" His comments solidified a cycle of escalating confrontation and recrimination which will see the year end with U.S.-Russia relations at their lowest point since the fall of the Soviet Union. And there is no sign that things will improve in 2015. That's a problem for President Barack Obama, who is holding a year-end press conference on Friday at which global issues like the tension with Russia will likely come up. Obama would rather concentrate on foreign policy crises elsewhere. Though Russia is not the Cold War superpower it once was, it can't be ignored: It has 1,600 deployed nuclear warheads and casts a huge geopolitical shadow in Europe. Moscow can also thwart U.S. foreign policy goals vital to Obama's legacy in Iran, the Middle East and beyond. The White House responded to Putin's news conference by saying that Putin's ""revisionist narrative"" was troubling ""but utterly unconvincing."" ""President Putin has repeatedly attempted to shift blame of the conflict in Ukraine and the internal problems that Russia is experiencing away from his own policies,"" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. Obama, meanwhile, risked further irking the Russian leader by signing a bill that gives Obama the power to impose new sanctions on Moscow, though he does not plan to do so right away. Despite Putin's defiance, the White House is convinced that U.S. and European sanctions on Russia, combined with steep drops in the price of oil, are sending the economy into a tailspin that Putin can't ignore. Western officials hope that will persuade Putin that the price of his annexation of Crimea and support for separatists in Ukraine is now too great. They reason the economic crunch could turn Russia's middle classes against Putin despite his current popularity, or prompt oligarchs cut off from Western banks to force his hand. As panic hit Russia's financial markets this week, the central bank was forced into a hurried intervention to hike interest rates to 17 percent and the government stepped in amid fears of a disastrous run on the banks. This stemmed the bleeding but the ruble has still lost more than 50% against the dollar this year, leaving the Kremlin in a bind. ""They are between a rock and a hard place,"" said Jason Furman, chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, adding that the Russian economy was ""on the brink of crisis."" But there is a chance that Putin could respond not by offering concessions, as the West hopes, but by stoking nationalism and shows of Moscow's military power not seen since the Cold War. Trying to prove it's still a global power, the Kremlin has sent its warplanes and ships to test NATO defenses. Sweden expressed outrage last week, saying a Russian military plane with its transponder turned off narrowly missed colliding with a Scandanavian airliner. Moscow denied the incident. Russian officials, meanwhile, are accusing the West of plotting regime change in Moscow. Despite rising tensions, some of Obama's critics, like Republican Sen. John McCain, want him to supply arms to Ukraine, a step the administration fears would not much help forces vastly outnumbered by Russia's military. ""The argument that I hear from the administration is that we don't want to provoke Vladimir Putin. That is just Orwellian... history will judge this administration incredibly harshly,"" McCain told CNN in an interview. ""The only thing that will dissuade Vladimir Putin from what he is doing is when coffins come back to the families in Russia."" The administration is concerned that imposing more U.S. sanctions unilaterally could fracture the united front with Europe, which has much greater exposure to the Russian economy. Europe has generally been more reluctant to maintain sanctions than Washington, and some experts believe one Russian tactic could be to pull back forces from Ukraine's border and back peace talks between Kiev and separatists to further soften European resolve. U.S. officials and western Russian experts are also anxious about Putin's state of mind. People who have met and studied him argue that his strategic choices are distilled from a worldview that insists the West is depriving Russia of its rightful role as a great power. ""We are concerned that the frame just doesn't seem to track with events on the ground,"" said a senior administration official. ""That's one of the reasons why world leaders do continue to reach out and talk to appropriate Russian interlocutors,"" the official said. ""It is a matter of concern."" In a phone call in March, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Obama she questioned whether the former KGB agent was in touch with reality. He is ""in another world,"" she said, according to the New York Times. Fiona Hill, a Brookings Institution scholar and author of an acclaimed book on Putin, says the Russian leader's anti-Western instincts have hardened since he returned to the Kremlin as President in 2012. ""Putin projects onto us the kind of actions he would take — believing that the CIA Cold War operations are still in place. He understands the world from a different vantage point. He is acting within that on the assumption that we are at war."" Obama, already beset by foreign policy problems, has no desire for a new Cold War and says Russia's actions are simply not in its own interests. But the world looks a lot different to Moscow. ""This insistence that Russia is headed in a disastrous direction, that Putin needs to recognize that and reverse course implies an expectation that at some point, Putin will realize that and give in to the West's pressure over Ukraine"" said Matthew Rojansky of the Wilson Center. ""He has sent implicit and explicit messages to the West that that is not going to happen."" Along with sanctions, the West hopes another, more personal tactic will break Putin's resolve -- depriving him of the recognition he craves of the world stage. Putin left the G20 summit in Brisbane last month after he was given the cold shoulder by many world leaders in a nation still mourning 28 Australians among the dead when a Malaysia Airlines plane was shot down over rebel-held Ukraine in July. ""I think they are getting the message,"" the senior official said. ""Putin got it very clearly. His body language was quite clear.""","Putin's annual press conference spikes tensions .

"President Barack Obama praised basketball star LeBron James for wearing an ""I Can't Breathe"" protest shirt during his pre-game warmup last week. ""You know, I think LeBron did the right thing,"" Obama told People magazine in their issue out Friday. ""We forget the role that Muhammad Ali, Arthur Ashe and Bill Russell played in raising consciousness."" The Cleveland Cavaliers player wore the shirt, which shows support for Eric Garner, the unarmed African American man who died after a white police officer put him in a chokehold, before the Cavaliers played the Brooklyn Nets on Dec. 8. RELATED: Obamas say they're still affected by everyday racism . Other athletes in both major league and college sports have worn the shirts, and others protesting the recent deaths of African Americans at the hands of white police officers, during warmups in recent weeks, prompting controversy and some criticism from police. But Obama encouraged other athletes to speak out on issues important to them. ""We went through a long stretch there where [with] well-paid athletes the notion was: just be quiet and get your endorsements and don't make waves,"" Obama said. ""LeBron is an example of a young man who has, in his own way and in a respectful way, tried to say, 'I'm part of this society, too' and focus attention. ""I'd like to see more athletes do that,"" he added.

"A $50 million settlement has been reached in connection with the deadly collapse of a stage at the Indiana State Fair, a lawyer for injured survivors and relatives of those killed said Friday. The incident occurred August 13, 2011, when a strong storm packing winds estimated by the National Weather Service of 60 to 70 mph rolled through just before Sugarland, the country music duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, was set to perform. Authorities took the stage to warn the crowd to seek shelter at one point, due to the rough conditions. Four minutes later, speakers and metal scaffolding fell into the ""Sugar Pit,"" a section usually occupied by Sugarland's most ardent fans. Five people died soon after the collapse, with two more succumbing later to their injuries. Scores more were injured and survived. The $50 million settlement reportedly includes $11 million that had been previously paid out by the state of Indiana. It also ""resolves the claims arising from the seven deaths and over 58 injuries against 19 of the 20 defendants in the case,"" according to Kenneth J. Allen, whose firm represented many of the victims and the families of those killed. Allen said the terms of how the $50 million will be distributed are being kept confidential, but noted that ""all of (his) clients are gratified to reach a conclusion and pleased by the settlement."" He also noted a historical distinction of the settlement: ""For the first time in the state of Indiana -- and to our knowledge in the U.S. -- a lesbian widow has received a settlement for the wrongful death of her wife."" Allen was speaking of Christina Santiago, a well-known figure in Chicago's LGBT community who died in the collapse. Santiago's domestic partner and executor, Alisha Brennon, will receive compensation as her surviving spouse. ""It's a legacy particularly befitting of (Santiago) and I'm sure she's proud of it,"" said Allen. The settlement was reached with 19 companies. There's still a case out against one remaining defendant: ESG Security -- a company that employed a guard who was among those killed -- that ""will likely go to trial in 2015,"" Allen said. Two investigative reports released in spring 2012 found that the scaffolding was not up to standards and the Indiana State Fair Commission did not have adequate emergency planning in place. The findings were presented by representatives from the firm and officials from Witt Associates, a public safety and crisis management consulting group. At the time, then-Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels promised to implement the reports' recommendations even as he insisted his state fair wasn't much different from many others. ""It's ... now clear that most, if not all states, have been deficient in this area and have much to learn from this tragedy,"" Daniels said then in a statement. Earlier that year, the Indiana Department of Labor announced penalties totaling $80,800 following a worker safety investigation into the collapse. The largest fines -- totaling $63,000 for what the agency said were three ""knowing violations"" -- were levied on Mid-America Sound Corp., which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair.","Scaffolding collapsed around an Indiana State Fair stage, killing 7 and injuring dozens .

"(CNN)What is Africa's most prosperous country? According to new research from the Legatum Institute, which last week ranked prosperity in 38 African countries around criteria ranging from economics to education to health, the title belongs to Botswana, the diamond-rich country in southern Africa. As well as posting a relatively high per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of $15,176, Botswana also fared well in terms of governance, education and personal freedom. As the country spends 8% of  its GDP on education, it is among the biggest proportional spenders in the world according to the World Bank. This is the third year in a row that Botswana has topped the index. In contrast, the Central African Republic  was the lowest ranked country on the continent. The country, which has a per capita GDP of $584, has seen increasing violence since the end of 2012, and only 21.5% of the population have access to sanitation according to the prosperity index. Biggest gainers . Rwanda was the best improver, gaining five ranking places to end up as the eighth most prosperous country in Africa. The country was found to have the sixth highest ranking in regulation and government effectiveness, the eighth highest score in rule of law and the lowest perceptions of corruption in Africa. ""Rwanda deserves credit for actively encouraging women to play a central role in shaping the future of their country. And it seems to be paying dividends,"" says the report. These findings bucked trends across the continent, where 41% of women are out of work, as opposed to 23% of men. ""We cannot talk about the prosperity of women in Africa if we don't change the inappropriate policies that hinder their progress,"" argues Marieme Jamme, a Davos Young Global leader and CEO of SpotOne Global Solutions. ""We cannot sugar coat the issues of funding, mentoring, gender equality, recognition and representation and expect women to come winners within the current framework and plans we have in Africa."" Other notable gainers since 2012 included countries from East Africa -- while neither Kenya nor Mozambique featured in the top 10 most prosperous countries in Africa, they both rose by four places in the rankings since 2012. As over 44% of Kenyans thought it was a good time to find employment, the country ranked ninth in terms of entrepreneurship and opportunity. But following the 2013 siege in Nairobi's Westgate Mall, the country ranked 32 of 38 in terms of safety and security. Falling down the ranks . Regional partner Tanzania, by contrast, fell eight places since 2012 going from 11th to 19th in the latest rankings. A drop in five-year average growth and an increase in inflation were coupled with a decline in confidence in financial institutions and falling satisfaction with living standards. The country fared particularly badly in terms of personal freedom, where it fell from 24th to 28th. While Tanzania's education score rose by one place in the rankings, the report argues that Tanzania needs to improve the quality of education in schools rather than focusing on enrollment rates. ""Tanzanian education is not producing graduates with the skills needed to work in the formal sector,"" the report says. ""The lack of an adequately skilled workforce is a hindrance to investment in sectors such as manufacturing, construction, mining, agriculture, finance, and communications...Tanzania needs education that improves students' chances of finding employment."" The biggest faller was Malawi, which dropped 11 places since 2012 to 20th in the index. The report cites a drop in the five-year GDP growth rate as part of the reason the country fell by 18 places in the Economy sub-index. In all, average prosperity in Africa has been on the up since 2012. In the past two years all countries have seen increases in at least one area tracked by the report. But Nathan Gamester, program director of the Prosperity Index ,added a cautious note to the findings: ""As African economies grow, a chief concern for many governments is how to ensure that the fruits of growth benefit a majority of the population and contribute to true long term prosperity.""

"Before Rolling Stone ran an article about rape on the University of Virginia campus, the reporter and school officials traded dozens of emails from September 5 to November 19. On Friday, UVA released that correspondence to CNN and other media outlets that had made freedom of information requests. The magazine's article was published November 19 and started by telling about ""Jackie,"" a student who said she was gang-raped in a fraternity house in fall 2012. After the Washington Post and other media outlets found inconsistencies in the article, Rolling Stone apologized for several reporting mistakes, such as not trying to reach the men who allegedly committed the rape. ""We apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening,"" the magazine said earlier this month. Also on Friday, UVA Rector George K. Martin spoke to the school's Board of Visitors, or governing body, saying the article had hurt innocent people, set back efforts to stop sexual assaults and tarnished the school's reputation. Martin said the school wanted to find the truth, but faced several obstacles, including ""the massive failure of journalistic ethics reflected in the Rolling Stone article"" and ""the rush to judgment by some who first faulted the university."" Martin said the results of investigations by police and the state attorney general's office will be released eventually, subject to restrictions of state and federal law. Here are five things revealed by the correspondence. 1. Jackie was never mentioned in emails between writer Sabrina Rubin Erdely, the magazine fact checker and university officials. Though Jackie's story of being raped was the most sensational part of the Rolling Stone story, it never comes up in 100-plus pages of emails. Most of the emails concern scheduling for interviews, discuss policy and ask for facts and figures. However, Erdely did mention Jackie in an October 27 email to a student who told the reporter she had been sexually assaulted. ""You figure into the article as a survivor, activist and mentor/support for Jackie,"" Erdely said. 2. UVA told Erdely she got it wrong in describing a spring 2014 sexual assault complaint. In the article, a woman the magazine called ""Stacy"" said a male friend groped her and stuck his hand down her sweatpants one night while she vomited into a toilet after drinking too much whiskey, then ""digitally penetrated"" her. Stacy said she discovered two other women had been assaulted by the same man. She filed a formal complaint, expecting him to be expelled after a hearing, but was disappointed when the Sexual Misconduct Board only suspended him for one year. ""Your characterization of the facts of the spring 2014 case you referenced during our interview is incorrect,"" a UVA spokesman, Anthony Paul de Bruyn, told Erdely in an October 9 email. De Bruyn told fact checker Elisabeth Garber-Paul in a November 13 email, ""It has been brought to our attention by a few students that Sabrina has spoken to that she is referencing an incident where a male student raped three different women and received a one-year suspension. That is in fact objectively false."" When Erdely asked him to clarify what she got wrong, de Bruyn said, ""Due to privacy concerns, we are unable to be more specific about the spring 2014 case."" 3. UVA severely limited Erdely's access to university officials. In the first email, on September 5, Erdely contacted Nicole Eramo, head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board, and said she's writing a story about ""rape/rape culture on college campuses"" and how sexual assaults are handled at UVA. Eramo seemed interested in cooperating and said ""I'm glad you reached out."" They set up an interview for September 12. Erdely told McGregor McCance, chief university spokesman, on September 10 that she'd like him to clear an interview with Claire Kaplan at the Women's Center. But on September 11 McCance said Erdely could not interview Eramo and Kaplan, saying either he or the university president will answer all the questions. He apologizes for the ""change in direction."" Eramo was mentioned many times in the article, but never quoted. 4. Only school President Teresa Sullivan was allowed to comment for the university. When Erdely was setting up an interview with Sullivan, she complained that UVA's public affairs office insisted some of their employees be present. ""I don't generally conduct interviews with PR people sitting in,"" she wrote on September 15. McCance replied: ""Either I or somebody from my office would be in the room for the phone call and perhaps somebody from the office of student affairs, too. We would do this whether the interview was on phone or in person, and we would record it as well."" Erdely said, ""If that's the only way I will be allowed to talk with President Sullivan, then so be it. But I imagine a university president is fully capable of getting through a phone conversation on her own, without help. My article will obviously mention the way UVA has sought to restrict and pad my access to administrators."" McCance replied, ""I'm sorry you think your story would need to describe the university as restricting access but I am happy that we are able to connect you with our top administrator -- the president -- for an interview."" 5. The reporter explained why another alleged sexual assault victim's story was downplayed. ""I talk about your own assault in the broadest of strokes,"" Erdely said in an October 27 email to a student who said she was raped after a party during the early part of her freshman year. ""Sadly there was no room in the article for the full contours of your story, in all its detail, which frankly could be an article unto itself! Same can be said of basically every survivor I had the honor of interviewing.""","CNN, other media outlets obtain correspondence with freedom of information requests .

"It is safe to assume that the world reacting to news of Boko Haram's latest abductions will be a somewhat disillusioned one. Such weariness is understandable, considering what has happened in the eight months since the abductions that first brought Boko Haram into the global spotlight. First it took almost three weeks for the Nigerian President to address the country on the incident. In September, ""#BringBackGoodluck2015"" banners appeared on the streets of the Nigerian capital, Abuja, ostensibly the work of supporters of the President, who had somehow assumed it would be a great idea to make political capital out of the #BringBackOurGirls campaign. It took a backlash to make the President's spokesman put out a disclaimer. And this week, just before the news of the latest kidnappings broke, a military court in Abuja convicted 54 Nigerian soldiers on charges of mutiny, and cowardice in the face of Boko Haram, and sentenced them to death: a symbolic victory for Boko Haram if ever there was one. The icing on the cake was the news, in October, of a ceasefire with Boko Haram. Military units obeyed the prompting of their commanders. Boko Haram didn't. By the time it dawned on the world that the ceasefire was a ruse, Boko Haram had launched a devastatingly successful offensive, capturing several towns in Adamawa State, including the hometown of Nigeria's most senior military officer, Chief of Defense Staff Alex Badeh, a man given to inopportunely boasting, of the impending end of Boko Haram. Today, eight months after the abductions, none of the girls has been rescued. The handful of girls who escaped did so on their own, not because a band of special-forces soldiers set them free. ‎And lest we forget, this week's incident is not the first since April; Boko Haram has never once let up on its attacks on civilian targets. Perhaps the most important lesson from the last eight months is this: that outrage, no matter how focused it is, or how much it trends on social media, is not what stops terrorists. Especially not groups like Boko Haram and ISIS, so steeped in brutality that even al Qaeda has been compelled to disavow them. The outrage has its uses, no doubt. It can help jolt government out of its nonchalance, in the face of several distractions (like the general elections forthcoming in February, in which President Jonathan will be seeking a second and final term), and force it to pay attention to matters like equipping the military. At the beginning of December, Nigerian journalist Aliyu Tilde toured towns recently liberated from Boko Haram by Nigerian troops, and reported an upswing in morale on the part of the Nigerian military. Outrage can also turn ordinary citizens into crusaders against poor governance, and make them more likely to exercise their voting rights in the quest for something more inspiring. But only a demonstration of superior military force will make a lasting difference, and ensure that Boko Haram is reduced to a position in which it can no longer routinely carry out these kinds of attacks. Negotiations will be meaningless; Boko Haram under Abubakar Shekau has repeatedly insisted it will not negotiate with the government. That superior force will be the result of a combination of factors. Improved intelligence gathering is one. One defining characteristic of the Nigerian military's moves has been its largely defensive nature. It has tended to stay one step behind Boko Haram; occupied mainly with fighting to capture towns seized by Boko Haram, instead of preventing Boko Haram from seizing the towns in the first place, or abducting civilians. ""If you don't have good information you have nothing,"" says Mohamed Kashkoush, a retired Egyptian Major General, now on the faculty of the Regional Center for Strategic Studies, in Cairo. ""Good information makes you act in advance, not react."" Training is another matter. The relatively higher rates of success Cameroon appears to be enjoying in its confrontations with Boko Haram may in part be due to the training its forces have received from abroad. It is not clear if any of the several offers of support that Nigeria received following the April abductions translated into action. Now would be a good time to revisit them. The United States government can also play a role in re-engaging with Nigeria, regarding the sale of game-changing military hardware. In recent months the Nigerian government has expressed its frustration with the attitude of the Americans, who are wont to insist that they cannot supply arms to countries that violate human rights. (Puzzling when one considers the sort of regimes the U.S. routinely considers military allies). Human rights groups say the Nigerian military is a serial offender; the military continues to deny this. While we wait for progress on these fronts, one thing is already clear. If the immediate reaction of the Nigerian government to this latest incident is anything to go by, no lessons have been learned from April. Several hours after the news broke, no word emerged; from the President or his office, or from the Defense Headquarters. This is probably going to be like April all over again.","Boko Haram's latest abductions may meet a weary global reaction, Tolu Ogunlesi says .

"(CNN)  -- A Southern California assemblyman resigned Wednesday after a recording of him whispering about sexual exploits to a colleague was made public. Assemblyman Mike Duvall said he was resigning so his actions didn't remain a distraction for colleagues. Former Republican Assemblyman Mike Duvall was at an appropriations committee meeting in July when a microphone picked up his licentious conversation. ""I am deeply saddened that my inappropriate comments have become a major distraction for my colleagues in the Assembly, who are working hard on the very serious problems facing our state,"" Duvall said in a statement on his Web site that had been set up for his 2010 run for the Assembly. ""I have come to the conclusion that it would not be fair to my family, my constituents or to my friends on both sides of the aisle to remain in office."" On video and audio footage from the California Channel, a television organization that tracks California governance, Duvall is heard laughing at times as he tells of an extramarital affair with a colleague's female staffer who is 18 years his junior. He said he likes spanking her. He also mentions another woman, who his colleague said was ""hot."" ""I talked to her yesterday. She goes, so are we finished? No, we're not finished. And I go, but you know about the other one the other one doesn't know about you,"" Duvall said on the audio portion of the tape. CNN affiliate KCAL-TV has reported that both women are lobbyists and that one works for a firm that represents a utilities company. Duvall was a member of the Assembly's Utilities and Commerce Committee and the Rules Committee, according to Assembly Speaker Karen Bass. San Diego-based Sempra Energy said that it is ""investigating this matter and the recent media reports that named one of our employees."" ""The employee has denied the speculative media reports,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our investigation will be conducted to ensure not only that our policies on employee conduct are strictly adhered to, but also that our employee is treated fairly."" Despite his resignation, the former representative of the 72nd assembly district may face further political turmoil for his apparent transgressions. ""In response to inquiries, the resignation does not remove the responsibility of the Assembly Ethics Committee from reviewing the matter,"" said Bass in a statement. According to the California State Assembly Web site, Duvall served two terms as an assemblyman, beginning in 2006. He is a former city councilman of Yorba Linda, California, which is about 40 miles east of Los Angeles. Duvall and his wife have two children, according to the Web site.","Assemblyman Mike Duvall's phone conversation about his affairs was recorded .

"The U.S. decision to cripple the finances of the insurgent Haqqani network has put the limelight on its influential and respected leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani. Based in North Waziristan, a tribal area of Pakistan, the group is aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda and is considered one of the most significant threats to stability in Afghanistan. Jeffrey Dressler, a senior analyst with the Institute for the Study of War, said Siraj, as he is known to intelligence sources, is the ""name, the face"" and the ""guy with all the clout"" in a group that has been a major problem for coalition forces along the Afghan-Pakistan border. ""He's very, very competent, a very capable leader who has really grown the network over the past five, six years,"" Dressler said. Clinton labels Pakistan-based group as terrorists . U.S. intelligence officials believe Sirajuddin began turning the Haqqani Network into a ""killing machine"" in 2007. The network -- long regarded as a proxy of Pakistani security services -- is believed to have been behind a slew of attacks. One was a 2008 coordinated suicide bomb attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul that left six dead. Another was a strike in June 2011 that killed 12 at the InterContinental Hotel. A third was an attack on a military base near Kabul around 10 years after the September 11, 2001, attacks that left 77 coalition soldiers injured. The Haqqani clan is believed to be holding Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who disappeared in June 2009 after finishing guard duty at a combat outpost in southeastern Afghanistan's Paktika province, U.S. military officials have said. The Taliban previously claimed to have captured the soldier but it is possible, because of the close ties between the two groups, that Bergdahl was handed over to the Haqqani network. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will notify Congress of her intent to formally designate the Pakistan-based Haqqani network as a terror organization on Friday, Clinton said. Individual commanders such as Sirajuddin have already been blacklisted. The United States put a $5 million bounty on him shortly after the Treasury Department designated him as a supporter of global terrorism. But Clinton's plan to designate the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization and a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity would make it easier to pursue those who provide support for the movement. Sirajuddin has taken over leadership of the group from his father, Jalaluddin Haqqani -- once considered a U.S. ally because of his role organizing Afghan fighters in the war against the Soviets in the 1980s. The elder Haqqani developed a close relationship with Taliban leaders and Osama bin Laden after the war with the Soviets, according to writings of journalist Ahmed Rashid, one of the foremost experts on al Qaeda, the Taliban and Afghanistan. The Haqqani network, a family and a terror group . The top leadership is a ""family business,"" said Bill Roggio, managing editor of The Long War Journal, a website that tracks terror-related events and trends. Along with Sirajuddin, Jalaluddin's son Nasiruddin and brother Ibrahim run the network's extensive financial operation. Another son, Badruddin, had been the day-to-day operational commander, but last month he was reported killed in a drone strike. The Taliban denied reports of his death, but Dressler said authorities have confirmed the killing. Badruddin's death will ""seriously alter"" the daily operations, he said. ""Siraj will take a little more of an active role"" as a result, ""picking the slack in the meantime,"" Dressler said. Sirajuddin has been described as the more radicalized and more violent of Jalaluddin's sons. He is ""very much into the global extremism of al Qaeda. ... He has got those ties (to al Qaeda) so he tends to be more violent than his father ever was,"" according to Jane's Information Group, which cited an unnamed U.S. intelligence official. Several security experts and U.S. military officials say he has extended the Haqqani network's reach to countries far from Pakistan and Afghanistan. The group has managed to recruit fighters in Chechnya and Turkey, for example, according to a November 2010 Jane's report. Since 2001, global security experts have said the Haqqani network's specialty has been bold and complex suicide bombing attacks. In a rare interview, Sirajuddin Haqqani told Al Jazeera in 2010 that the group's fighters were becoming more advanced and that in the future their techniques ""will be even better."" ""At the beginning of this war, the coordination between our fighters was useless,"" he said. ""But there are so many attacks now, we can't count them ourselves. But it's still not enough. The future will show what I mean."" Dressler said Sirajuddin is ""increasingly seen as a respected figure in the tribal areas."" He has the ability to ""hold sway with a variety of militant groups harboring different agendas."" They pay deference to Siraj, he said. ""He's supposedly pretty sharp and maintains very good relations"" with entities ranging from al Qaeda and its affiliates and Pakistan's security services, Dressler said. U.S. and Pakistani intelligence have estimated the Haqqani network has between 4,000 and 12,000 fighters. Adm. Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that the Haqqani network acted ""as a veritable arm of Pakistan's intelligence."" The allegations have strained relations between Washington and Islamabad, which have been in an uneasy alliance in the war against terror since 2001. The relationship between Pakistani intelligence and the Haqqanis goes back to the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan when Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United States supported the resistance. Intelligence officials believe Pakistan still regards the Haqqanis as an important tool in countering Indian influence in Afghanistan and helping shape any future peace process.

Secret Cinema has not specified what has prompted its move. But its announcement follows the decision by Sony Pictures this week to cancel the release of its movie ""The Interview"" after a cyberattack and threats against moviegoers from a group of North Korea-backed hackers. Critics have slammed that decision as caving to hackers and muzzling free speech. Washington outraged over Sony decision . The Secret Cinema screening is being held in partnership with the global free speech campaign group Article 19. ""Secret Cinema passionately believes in the freedom to create and is looking for partners to join them in hosting a screening that will happen simultaneously across the globe,"" a Facebook page created for the event says. ""The film, for the moment is secret. ""Please come dressed in a dark suit, and bring a small gift for a stranger."" Any proceeds raised from the London event -- to be held at an as-yet undisclosed location in the capital's east -- will go to Article 19, Secret Cinema said. Tickets go on sale Friday. The company urged anyone else around the world who wants also to hold a screening to get in touch. Balloon activists vow to send copies of 'The Interview' ""The Interview,"" which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, is a comedy with a plot that involves a plan to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. U.S. officials say they think the attack on Sony was ordered by North Korea's angry leadership. North Korea's government has denied responsibility for the crippling hack, even as its state news agency applauded it as a ""righteous deed."" North Korea deep into cyberwarfare, defector says . Three U.S. movie theaters -- the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in Dallas-Fort Worth, the Plaza Atlanta Theatre and Cleveland's Capitol Theatre -- planned to screen ""Team America: World Police"" instead of ""The Interview."" But Paramount Pictures canceled that, too, the theaters said. A spokeswoman for Paramount declined to comment. Released a decade ago, ""Team America: World Police"" used puppets to lampoon Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, memorably featuring him singing about his loneliness at the top of the despotic state.","Secret Cinema announces a simultaneous screening in London, San Francisco, Rome .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Bush on Friday defended his administration's methods of interrogating terrorism suspects, insisting, ""This government does not torture people."" ""When we find somebody who may have information regarding a potential attack on America, you bet we're going to detain them and you bet we're going to question them, because the American people expect us to find out information, actionable intelligence, so we can help them -- help protect them,"" Bush said. Bush said his administration sticks to ""U.S. law and our international obligations."" He said, ""The techniques that we use have been fully disclosed to appropriate members of the United States Congress.""  Watch Bush defend the detainee interrogation program » . Bush's remarks followed a report Thursday in The New York Times that said a secret Justice Department memo in 2005 amounted to ""an expansive endorsement of the harshest interrogation techniques ever used by the Central Intelligence Agency."" The 2005 legal opinion was issued after then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales took over Justice, the Times reported, and authorized using a combination of techniques such as head slaps, freezing temperatures and simulated drownings, known as waterboarding. The Times said the memo was strongly opposed by then-departing Deputy Attorney General James Comey, who had repeatedly clashed with the Bush White House over terror-related policies. The Times said its investigation over three months had included interviews with more than two dozen current and former officials. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary Dana Perino confirmed the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel wrote a previously undisclosed February 5, 2005 memo, but she insisted the classified document did not undercut or reverse a 2004 memo that rejected torture. ""U.S. policy is not to torture -- and we do not,"" Perino told reporters. ""Regardless of where we are, we do not torture anybody, but getting information from them is critically important to protecting this country."" Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse issued a statement declaring the December 2004 anti-torture memo remains binding on the executive branch. ""Neither Attorney General [Alberto] Gonzales nor anyone else within the department modified or withdrew that opinion,"" Roehrkasse said. CIA spokesman George Little issued a statement saying all interrogations are conducted ""in strict accord with U.S. law."" ""The agency's terrorist detention and interrogation program has been conducted lawfully, with great care and close review, including extensive discussion within the executive branch and oversight from Congress,"" Little said. On Capitol Hill, Democratic lawmakers sharply criticized the Bush administration. ""It appears that under Attorney General Gonzales, they reversed themselves and reinstated a secret regime by, in essence, reinterpreting the law in secret,"" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. ""I suspect that former Deputy Attorney General Comey will again prove to be right in his prediction that the Department of Justice will be ashamed when we learn more about all that they have done,"" Leahy said. Leahy, who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned that the ""ongoing scandals"" at the Justice Department ""now encumber"" the nomination of retired federal judge Michael Mukasey, selected to replace Gonzales as attorney general.

"When we imagine the robots of the future, they often look and move like humans, standing up on two legs and using a pair of arms to grab and move objects. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory is working on a different kind of robot for disaster response that's designed to move like an ape. Headless but covered with seven cameras that act as ""eyes,"" the RobotSimian has four identical limbs that do double duty as arms and legs. Together, they ably move the robot across rough terrain and rubble but can also pick up and manipulate objects. It has wheels it can coast on if the surface is smooth enough. The RoboSimian is JPL's final entry into the DARPA Robotics Challenge, a 27-month-long competition among some of the world's top robotic talent to create an emergency response robot. In situations such as a nuclear disaster, one of these robots could go into environments too dangerous for human rescue workers and execute simple tasks such as lifting debris off survivors or turning off a valve. In June, RoboSimian and up to 18 other finalists will have to make their way through an obstacle course that simulates eight common scenarios. Each robot will attempt to drive a car, move across rubble, use a tool and climb stairs, all without a human controlling it. DARPA says the final competitors should be as competent as a 2-year-old child. The winning team will receive a $2 million prize. JPL used leftover parts from RoboSimian to create another robot called Surrogate. The more traditional upright robot has a flexible spine, head and two arms. While better at manipulating objects, Surrogate ran on tracks and wasn't as adept at traversing the complicated terrain that is common in a disaster. After considering both candidates, the team decided to take RoboSimian to the finals. One trade-off is that RoboSiman is slower than many other competitors. JPL's team is working with the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Caltech to increase the robot's walking speed. ""It is intentionally the tortoise relative to the other hares in the competition. We feel that a very stable and deliberate approach suites our technical strengths and provides a model for one vital element of the 'ecosystem' of robots that we expect to be deployed to disaster scenarios in the future,"" said JPL's Brett Kennedy, who is supervisor of the Robotic Vehicles and Manipulators Group. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is most known for designing robotics for space exploration, such as the Mars rovers. But the DARPA competition was an opportunity for the JPL group to take its existing robotics research and compare approaches directly to other talented teams. NASA also has a long history of taking technology developed for space exploration and using it here on Earth. RoboSimian software was influenced by programs used to control the Mars rovers. In both cases, the system is designed to let the robots work as autonomously as possible when communication with a human operator is dropped. Spotty communications are common in disaster scenarios (and on Mars). The team has thought hard about all aspects of RoboSimian's design, even making sure it has the right look. ""We included industrial designers in the team in an effort to create a robot that looked professional rather than either threatening or overly cute,"" said Kennedy. ""Basically, we wanted the perceptual equivalent of a St. Bernard."" While JPL is focused on perfecting the ape-like design for Earth-bound applications for now, this is just one stop in the circular life of NASA technology. ""We intend to spin the technologies developed for the terrestrial RoboSimian back out to applications in space,"" said Kennedy. ""These tasks include assembly and maintenance of orbital structures; exploration of low-gravity bodies like asteroids, comets, and moons; exploration of caves and cliffs on Mars or our moon; and even preconstruction of habitats wherever humans care to venture in the solar system.""","NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has designed the ape-like robot RoboSimian .

"Humans are causing a steep decline in populations of reef sharks in the Pacific Ocean according to a new study by a group of international marine scientists. The new estimates of reef sharks compared numbers around populated islands with those living near uninhabited ones. The results were sobering, say researchers. ""We estimate that reef shark numbers have dropped substantially around populated islands, generally by more than 90% compared to those at the most untouched reefs,"" said lead author Marc Nadon from the Joint Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Research at the University of Hawaii. Over 1600 underwater surveys across 46 U.S. Pacific islands and atolls were undertaken in the study and combined with data on human population, habitat complexity, reef size and satellite records. The estimates were gathered using ""towed-dive surveys"" where paired SCUBA divers record shark sightings while being towed behind a small boat. It's a method which provides a more accurate census of mobile reef fish like sharks over large areas, according to researchers. ""Around each of the heavily populated areas we surveyed -- in the main Hawaiian Islands, the Mariana Archipelago and the American Samoa -- reef shark numbers were greatly depressed compared to reefs in the same regions that were simply further away from humans,"" Nadon said. ""We estimate that less than 10% of the baseline numbers remain in these areas,"" he added. Co-author of the study, Julia Baum from Canada's University of Victoria says the human disturbances to reef shark populations are likely down to fishing -- either incidentally caught in the nets of commercial or recreational fishermen or by direct targeting for their fins. ""Reef shark fins are not the most valuable because they tend to be smaller than other sharks, but a lot of other oceanic sharks have already declined a lot so that's why fisherman are now turning to them,"" Baum said. She estimates these fins sell for around $100 per kilogram with demand coming from Asian markets where shark fin soup can be found on the menu for weddings and business banquets. Reef sharks, which are around six to eight feet long (1.8 meters to 2.4 meters), are the ""apex predators"" of coral reefs Baum says, and like predators in other eco-systems play an important role in structuring food webs. But there is still much to learn about their specific role. ""Frankly, we're still trying to figure out what predators do on reefs. The reason for that is because most predators have been removed from reefs. Most reefs that coral reef biologists study are moderately to heavily degraded,"" Baum said. The study forms part of the U.S.'s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Pacific Reef Assessment and Monitoring Program and is published online in the journal Conservation Biology.","New study provides estimates on reef shark populations near islands in Pacific Ocean .

"Christmas in the United States is a combination of traditions from around the world. Evergreen trees inside homes were popularized in Germany during the 16th century. Decorating with poinsettias? That idea came from Mexico (and the name of the plant came from Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first U.S. Minister to Mexico). And 18th-century England helped to change mistletoe's image from a poisonous plant to a poisonous plant that's also a festive kissing trap. However, there's one favorite tradition with an All-American origin: electric Christmas tree lights. It started when Edward H. Johnson, a friend and business partner of Thomas Edison, put a string of 80 hand-wired red, white and blue electric lights on a Christmas tree in 1882. Since the majority of Americans didn't have access to electric power until the 1930s, it took about 50 years for Johnson's creation to become popular. Since then, it's become an essential part of American Christmas celebrations, whether that means a couple of strings of ""tasteful"" white lights around the family tree or a pulsating public display synchronized to ""Jingle Bell Rock"" that can be seen from low orbit. With a nod to Mr. Johnson's first tree, here are eight of the best locations in the United States where the electric light tradition continues to shine brightly. Disney's Hollywood Studios (Lake Buena Vista, Florida) Back in 1986, Arkansas businessman Jennings Osborne started decorating his Little Rock home for his daughter during the holidays. What began with 1,000 lights snowballed into three million lights and numerous court challenges to turn the lights off (though the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case). Eventually, Osborne agreed to move his display, now known as The Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights, to Disney's Hollywood Studios in Florida. With five million lights, the show requires more than 10 miles of rope lighting and another 30 miles in extension cords. Visitors can even don a special Made with Magic ear hat, a version of the classic Mickey Mouse ears that flashes colors along with the music. November 7, 2014 to January 4, 2015 . Disney's Hollywood Studios, 351 South Studio Drive, Lake Buena Vista, Florida . Las Vegas Motor Speedway (Las Vegas) It may seem counterproductive to leave the Las Vegas Strip to look at bright lights, but to find Christmas lights in the Nevada desert, visitors can drive down to the racetrack. The Las Vegas Motor Speedway hosts Glittering Lights, a 2.5-mile circuit that gives car-bound visitors the opportunity to see more than 400 animated displays. It should be noted that while Glittering Lights is hosted at the speedway, the event doesn't have visitors drive on the superspeedway track, so crash helmets and lead feet aren't required. For the upcoming holiday season, up to 30,000 vehicles are expected to make the circuit. November 14, 2014 to January 4, 2015 . Las Vegas Motor Speedway, 7000 Las Vegas Blvd. N., Las Vegas . Smithsonian's National Zoo (Washington, D.C.) During the holidays, the nation's capitol is home to a unique event that manages to combine sparkling Christmas light displays with animals that prefer the dark. Zoolights turns Smithsonian's National Zoo into a 500,000-LED-light winter wonderland. At this free event, families can take a spin on the solar-powered Speedwell Conservation Carousel, which features custom-carved figures of 58 species of animals, including a clouded leopard and a sloth bear. The zoo's Small Mammal House, Great Ape House and Reptile Discovery Center are open, so visitors can warm up and see some of the zoo's nocturnal animals.

The theme park is a celebration of Ozark Mountains culture and, for more than two decades, host to An Old Time Christmas festival. With more than 5 million lights and 1,000 decorated trees, along with nightly parades and two musical productions, An Old Time Christmas is home to the 5-Story Special Effects Christmas Tree that features 350,000 LED lights and, synchronized with Christmas music, can make up to 100 light changes per second.

Macy's at Center City (Philadelphia) Since 1956, parents have brought their children to Philadelphia's Center City to marvel at a department store's resident light display during the holidays. Macy's (formerly Wanamaker's) Christmas Light Show has a Magic Christmas Tree and more than 100,000 LEDs arranged behind a four-story velvet curtain that tell a story with reindeer, toy soldiers and ballerinas. At the end of the show, the 287-ton Wanamaker Organ, the largest operational pipe organ in the world, plays ""O Tannenbaum.""

Located in the Texas capital's Zilker Park, the popular light show is currently celebrating its 50th anniversary. The 1.25-mile walking circuit features more than 50 light displays, 100 lighted trees, a nightly Yule Log and a 90-foot Ferris wheel. Standing above it all is the Zilker Tree, at 155 feet it's the tallest man-made free-standing Christmas tree in the world. December 7, 2014 to December 21, 2014 . Zilker Park, 2100 Barton Springs Road, Austin, Texas . Santa Claus House (North Pole, Alaska) North Pole, Alaska's, name comes from an attempt to convince a toy company to move to town. The toymaker never materialized, but residents of this Fairbanks suburb did embrace the Christmas spirit and for the last eight years have hosted the six-week Christmas on Ice festival that combines festive Christmas lights with intricately carved ice sculptures. And despite the fact that this is Alaska in winter, there are outdoor activities for kids, including ice slides and massive ice bowl ""twirlers"" where kids can sit and be spun until the colorful lights become a nauseating blur.

"Barack Obama actually looks like he's having fun being President. The commander-in-chief showed the world an unfamiliar face in a punchy end-of-year news conference Friday. He said he was energized and excited, and his bouncy body language suggested he was telling the truth. Obama's mood offered a surprisingly upbeat end to a gruesome political year, in which he grappled with fast moving crises overseas and watched Democrats lose the Senate and move further into the minority in the House. Republicans will take full control of Congress next month for the first time in nearly a decade, pledging to block most of Obama's goals during his final two years in office. But Obama didn't seem too fussed. ""I am energized,"" he said. ""I am excited about the prospects for the next couple of years."" The press conference wasn't entirely light. He lashed out at North Korea, lifted the lid on his phone call with Cuba's President Raul Castro, and expressed confidence that the Americans could work together to make progress toward healing racial divides. But he joked around with the White House press corps, after taking pot shots at scandal-driven news coverage for much of his presidency, and made waves by taking questions exclusively from female reporters. Underlying Obama's message was a clear and deliberate attempt to lift the country's mood after a six-year trudge back from the worst economic slump since the 1930s and with American power assailed as never before by rising states, stubborn foes and terror groups abroad. ""We've gone through difficult times,"" Obama said but added, ""through persistent effort, and faith in the American people, things get better. The economy's gotten better."" ""Part of what I hope, as we reflect on the new year, this should generate, is some confidence. America knows how to solve problems. When we work together, we can't be stopped."" The President appeared to justify a growing media narrative that this so-called lame duck feels liberated now he is not beholden to Democrats facing tough elections. In just the past few weeks, he's decided to bypass Congress on issues like immigration reform and normalizing relations with Cuba. ""My presidency is entering the fourth quarter. Interesting stuff happens in the fourth quarter. And I am looking forward to it,"" Obama said. The president's blithe confidence, however, likely infuriated Republicans who are laying plans to subject his presidency to unprecedented scrutiny next year. The GOP contends that much of what Obama has done by wielding his executive power in recent months is illegal and flouts the Constitution, and has left the United States less safe at home and abroad. Obama was at his most caustic as he took swipes at North Korea, which he mocked for hacking into computers of Sony in a massive cyberattack because it was outraged by a film that depicts an assassination plot against its leader, Kim Jong-Un. But he also bluntly told Sony it had done the wrong thing by canceling showings of the film ""The Interview,"" saying it was unwise to bow to dictators -- especially those who he said need to be ""offended."" ""We cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,"" Obama warned. ""Let's not get into that way of doing business."" The President also made clear that he would respond to the cyberattack ""forcefully"" and at a time of his choosing but didn't specifically say what he would do. Obama opened the 50-minute session with a 'Morning in America"" moment -- making his most explicit case yet that his leadership has led the nation out of the darkness of economic pain to sunnier times. ""Take any metric you want. America's resurgence is real. We are better off,"" Obama said told journalists, before he leaves wintry Washington for his annual vacation in his balmy home state of Hawaii. 'We are better positioned than we have been for a very long time,"" said Obama who has for years been reluctant to publicly tout his achievements on the economy because the recovery has been uneven and so many Americans have been left behind. ""We are better positioned than we have been in a very long time, and the future is ready to be written. We've set the stage for this American moment,"" Obama said. The President rattled off a string of economic success, proclaiming he had created ""more jobs, more people insured, a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy."" ""America knows how to solve problems,"" he said. He also sought to try to extricate himself from the aura of crisis that has stifled his administration for much of a year marked by the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and the horror of Ebola in west Africa and racial tension everywhere from Ferguson, Missouri, to New York. ""Yes, there were crises that we had to tackle around the world -- many that were unanticipated,"" Obama said.  ""We have more work to do to make sure our economy, our justice system and our government work not just for the few but the many. But there is no doubt we can enter into the new year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts."" Despite feuding with the GOP for much of his administration, Obama offered some home that he and his foes will be able to get something done. He said tax reform was one area where he and the GOP could get together. But he showed no sign of compromise on the Keystone XL pipeline which would carry oil from Canada's tar sands to the Gulf of Mexico, which Republicans leaders have said will be the first order of business in January. He said the project, which environmentalists say will worsen global warming, is ""not even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers."" Obama didn't threaten to veto a bill that would take approval of the 1,179-mile, pipeline out of the State Department's hands but said Republicans should work with him to create jobs if they were so concerned about employment. The President also defended his bombshell announcement this week that he would end a half-century of estrangement with Cuba by establishing diplomatic relations and seeking to expand trade and travel to the communist island. ""I don't anticipate overnight changes. But what I know deep in my bones is that if you've done the same thing for 50 years and nothing's changed, you should try something different if you want a different outcome,"" he said. ""Suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways that it has not been before."" Republicans, including potential 2016 presidential hopefuls Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio reacted angrily to Obama's move, saying he had rewarded a brutal dictatorship and ignored the need to promote human rights. Obama again proved himself more open to talking more freely about race than he had in his first term, reflecting on what needed to be done after several young men died in confrontations with white police officers, sparking mass protests and a consuming national debate. ""This isn't a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying,"" he said. ""I think that troubles everybody. So there's an opportunity for all of us to come together and take a practical approach to these problems."" Obama largely steered clear of some of the intractable foreign crises that have exhausted his White House in recent weeks, including the rise of ISIS, the vicious civil war in Syria and the worst showdown with Russia since the end of the Cold War. Instead, he appeared to be in an almost mischievous mood. He teased several top network television correspondents in the front row that they weren't on the list of questioners handed him by spokesman Josh Earnest because ""you've been naughty."" And when one reporter reeled off a long list of questions, Obama jabbed with a smile ""do I have to write all these down?"" Often in presidential news conferences. Obama's answers become drawn out and labored, like the lectures of the law professor he once was. But his responses on Friday were often snappy and precise, reflecting his cheerful mood. Then, after 50 minutes and eight questions, he was off, with the surf and sand of his home state beckoning. He put the turbulent political year of 2014 behind him, wishing reporters ""Mele Kalikimaka"" or Merry Christmas in Hawaiian.","President says he is energized and excited .

"(CNN) -- While this year's Super Bowl commercials ran the gamut from sentimental to silly, some were downright offensive to viewers who used the Twitter hashtag #NotBuyingIt to flag what they considered the most sexist spots of the night. Web host GoDaddy.com earned more than 7,500 #NotBuyingIt tweets for its ad featuring an intimate smooch between supermodel Bar Refaeli and a bespectacled computer programmer, putting it at the top of the list of offenders, according to Miss Representation, the social activism nonprofit leading the Twitter campaign for the second year. The ""Perfect Match"" and its ""smart meets sexy"" tagline drew criticism from men and women for ""stereotyping programmers and objectifying women"" in the words of one male Twitter user. ""@GoDaddy, continuing the tired stereotype that programmers are geeks, while women are sex objects. Disgusting,"" a female user tweeted. Overall, #NotBuyingIt generated more than 10,000 tweets and reached more than 8 million people on Twitter during Sunday's Ravens-49ers showdown, a spokesman for Miss Representation said, citing statistics from Topsy and Hashtag.org. Two days after the Super Bowl, the ads continue to generate conversation and controversy. ""Love 'em or hate 'em, you have to admit Go Daddy's Super Bowl ads are effective,"" begins one story published Tuesday on news that the domain name provider had its biggest sales day in history after its Super Bowl campaign. 'God made a farmer' ad stirs pride, passion in agriculture . Others continued to criticize some of Sunday night's ads for playing on typical gender stereotypes, promoting sexual assault and making the Super Bowl into a less than family-friendly event. ""The #superbowl commercials are a window into American culture & values.

GoDaddy.com wasn't the only company to earn the #NotBuyingIt designation. The main goal of the campaign is to make consumers think twice about their purchasing power, said Imran Siddiquee, social media coordinator of MissRepresentation.org. But, as the response to the GoDaddy spot showed, the campaign not only highlights demeaning portrayals of women but also the limited depiction of manhood on display in most Super Bowl commercials, he said. Breaking down Super Bowl tech ads . ""Masculinity in America is so very narrowly defined, and it's an interesting juxtaposition to have that conversation during the Super Bowl,"" Siddiquee said. Viewers have come to expect women seductively devouring fast food or throwing themselves at men during Super Bowl commercials, he said. But more surprising was the reaction to ads featuring what Siddiquee called more ""subtle"" forms of sexism, such as Audi's ""Prom"" ad, which showed a teen boy strutting onto the dance floor, grabbing a girl and pulling her in for a kiss. ""(S)top teaching our boys that bravery is kissing a girl you've never talked to & that girls are simply objects or rewards,"" one person tweeted. A spokesman for Audi said the prom queen's reaction to the kiss was meant to indicate there was history between the two, showing that ""in no way was the kiss something less than mutual."" ""While trying to tell a complete story within the 60-second format, much of the backstory has to be implied or set up off-camera,"" the spokesman said in an e-mail. After the kiss, another prom-goer, presumably the girl's date, lunges at the guy and punches him in the face. Change scene to the protagonist driving away in his Audi with a bruised eye. ""So getting punched in the face makes someone a man?"" another person tweeted. KIA, Mercedes-Benz and Fiat USA were also targeted for ads playing the ""nice car = get the girls"" trope, in the words of one person. ""Hey @MBUSA More WOMEN drive than men AND we influence 85% of car buying decisions. Stop the sexist ads,"" @WellVersedMom said. The lesson of the evening?

"Indians expressed outrage Tuesday at a top telecommunication official's push to get social media sites to screen content considered defamatory to religious and political leaders. Telecommunications Minister Kapil Sibal told reporters Tuesday that he is asking Facebook, Twitter and other online sites to regulate content before it is published. Sibal insisted such regulation would not amount to censorship, but Indian bloggers and online users posted a different view. #IdiotKapilSibal was trending on Twitter Tuesday. And blogger Shivam Vij urged Indians to use the hashtag and post it on their Facebook pages ""because there may soon be a day when he may prevent you from doing so."" Sibal said he first approached providers including Facebook, Twitter and Google several weeks ago. The New York Times reported that Sibal showed the service providers a Facebook page that maligned Congress Party President Sonia Gandhi and said it was ""unacceptable."" But he said that in a meeting Monday, those companies informed him they could not do what he was asking. ""They pretty much said they cannot do anything,"" he said, adding that material that is incendiary or blasphemous has no place in India, where sensitivities differ from those in the West. Sites like Facebook already have built-in mechanisms to flag and filter defined categories of objectionable content. In a statement sent to CNN's sister network, CNN-IBN,  Facebook said: ""We want Facebook to be a place where people can discuss things freely, while respecting the rights and feelings of others, which is why we already have policies and on-site features in place that enable people to report abusive content. We will remove any content that violates our terms, which are designed to keep material that is hateful, threatening, incites violence or contains nudity off the service. We recognize the government's interest in minimizing the amount of abusive content that is available online and will continue to engage with the Indian authorities as they debate this important issue."" Sibal's proposal is ""extremely worrying,"" but the idea is not new one in India, said Nikhil Pahwa, editor of MediaNama, a firm that analyzes digital media. Information technology rules issued earlier this year allow officials to demand the removal of objectionable content. The difference with what Sibal is proposing now, Pahwa said, is that service providers would have to censor content before it is even published. ""Absolutely, it's censorship of free speech,"" Pahwa said. ""The fear I have is that this is the beginning of something bigger."" There are no exact numbers, but it's estimated that as many as 100 million Indians are online. And that number is rapidly growing in a nation of 1.2 billion people. Sites like Facebook and Twitter have gained popularity through their use on mobile phones. Pahwa said he suspects the Indian government got spooked by the use of social media this year to galvanize popular uprisings in the Middle East, riots in the United Kingdom and the anti-corruption movement at home. The Indian government, Pahwa said, is arming itself with the tools to stave off mass anti-government demonstrations. Even more troubling is if the government tries to stifle political opposition by censoring online content, Pahwa said. Increasingly, Indian political groups are using the Internet to generate support. ""What I am worried about is the arbitrary decision taken to go down this path,"" he said. ""What is the government trying to hide? Why this cloak-and-dagger approach?"" Meanwhile, Tuesday evening, Twitter was still buzzing in the world's largest democracy. Wrote r2the: ""Just ridiculous. What's next? They prevent thoughts from ever developing in our brains?""","India's top telecommunications official wants service providers to screen comments .

"(CNN)  -- Air carriers are watching the situation at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant closely, making contingency plans and routing adjustments to keep operations running smoothly and protect passengers and crew from radiation risks. German airline Lufthansa and Italian carrier Alitalia have rerouted flights to and from the Tokyo area to other Japanese airports. Lufthansa's flights to and from Frankfurt and Munich are going to Osaka and Nagoya instead of Tokyo/Narita ""in an effort to ensure that [the airline's] operations to Japan remain as stable as possible and provide sufficient capacity for its passengers,"" Lufthansa said in a statement. The altered schedule is expected to last as least through the weekend. Since Sunday, the airline has been scanning aircraft returning from Japan for radiation. ""To date, none of the tests has detected any radioactivity,"" the statement said. Alitalia started rerouting all of its flights in and out of Tokyo airports to Osaka on Wednesday. Spokesman Clemente Senni said the change is designed to guarantee uninterrupted service to its passengers. Travelers will receive a refund for the trip between Tokyo and Osaka, Senni said. ""We are obviously testing planes for radiation, but nothing has been registered so far,"" he said. British Airways is routing its Tokyo flights through Hong Kong for a brief stopover, and its flights bound for Tokyo's Haneda Airport will now land in Narita instead. Tokyo is more than 150 miles from the damaged nuclear power plant in Fukushima. U.S. airlines are in close contact with the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies and regulators in the U.S. and abroad, monitoring conditions around the nuclear facility, according to the FAA. American Airlines is operating its normal schedules in and out of Tokyo's airports, according to spokesman Tim Smith. The majority of customers have traveled as scheduled, he said. ""At this point, we're monitoring things very closely and have not made any immediate decisions to change,"" Smith said. Delta and Continental airlines did not respond to requests for comment Wednesday afternoon. Japanese aviation authorities have imposed a no-fly zone within 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) of the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The FAA is alerting pilots to that restriction, spokeswoman Laura Brown said. On Wednesday, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission advised U.S. residents within 50 miles of the Fukushima reactors to evacuate. The commission's statement did not reference airspace. Representatives from the Allied Pilots Association, the union that represents American Airlines pilots, said its members, flight attendant union members and others are working closely with American Airlines management to make contingency plans should the situation at the reactors deteriorate. ""What we're hearing at Narita is basically things are pretty normal,"" said Captain Sam Mayer, the association's communications director. The real concern, he said, will come if the situation worsens. First Officer Scott Shankland, a national union representative, said he believes the airline is in a good position to react to new developments. Mayer and Shankland said government security officials routinely scan U.S. airliners for radiation as part of normal operations. On Wednesday afternoon, U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it was monitoring the situation in Japan carefully. ""Out of an abundance of caution, CBP has issued field guidance reiterating its operational protocols and directing field personnel to specifically monitor maritime and air traffic from Japan,"" the agency said in a statement. ""No aircraft entering the United States today tested positive for radiation at harmful levels,"" it said.","Lufthansa and Alitalia have moved Japan departures and arrivals out of Tokyo .

"(CNN) -- The CEO of GoDaddy.com on Friday defended an online video that shows him shooting and killing an elephant in Zimbabwe. ""It takes a guy like me"" to protect villagers' crops from rogue elephants, he said. Bob Parsons, founder of the Scottsdale, Arizona-based web-hosting service, posted the graphic video on his Twitter account on March 14. The footage, shot March 8, shows him hunting an elephant on a farm and posing with a shotgun beside its corpse. Then, it shows locals crowding around the dead animal and cutting off pieces of its meat. Parsons said he killed the animal for the good of local farmers whose crops are often destroyed by elephants. ""They would say 'please come back,' "" he said, arguing the measure is an effective way to protect crops and feed hungry local residents. The video shows him walking through a field of flattened sorghum plants, which he said had been crushed by roaming elephants. The reason he posted the video, Parsons said, is because he wants ""people to know what goes on over there."" ""There were people who walked 25 miles to get to that elephant,"" he said, referencing a food crisis that has often plagued developing countries. But critics call his methods extreme. The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals initiated an online boycott of GoDaddy.com and its services until Parsons ""stops shooting animals,"" according to the organization's website. Parsons' own website has also been inundated by negative comments about the video. ""A lot of the people who are upset about this are animal lovers,"" Parsons said. ""Their heart is in the right place but they just don't understand the situation."" He called the fact that the elephant meat provided food for the people ""a bonus."" ""They literally have nothing and they're on the brink of starvation,"" he said. Parsons has traveled to Zimbabwe for several years, but only last year began hunting elephants at the request of local farmers, he said. Elephant experts say it is not illegal to kill rogue elephants in Zimbabwe. Parsons said he has killed five elephants. PETA rejected Parsons' explanation, with the organization's president, Ingrid Newkirk, releasing a statement saying, ""If Bob Parsons really wanted to help African villagers, he would use his money to promote one of the many effective, nonlethal methods available to protect crops -- not act like a little boy with a gun."" In a press release, PETA said it is pulling its business from GoDaddy.com, and the group labeled Parsons ""Scummiest CEO of the Year."" Meanwhile, asked if the PETA boycott had affected GoDaddy.com's business, company spokeswoman Elizabeth Driscoll said, ""There has been no significant change in business.""","NEW: ""It takes a guy like me"" to protect villagers' crops from rogue elephants, Parsons says .

"He's a beloved mayor, who's held the top office in Talkeetna, Alaska, for 16 years. So imagine the townfolks' shock when he was attacked. Brutally mauled. By a dog. Oh, did we mention, this mayor's a cat? Mayor Stubbs, a yellow tabby with more responsibility than your average cat, survived -- but is in bad shape. A punctured lung. A fractured sternum. A 5-inch gash on his side. Doctors took out a chest tube Tuesday, and he was breathing on his own for the first time since the weekend attack. ""It's a shame,"" said Ashley Kearns, who works at a pizza shop in the small town about 110 miles north of Anchorage. ""He's the mayor, it's not a joke. I know it's ridiculous, but the town is run really well."" Profile: Mayor of Alaska village walks on four paws . Political career . The story of how Mayor Stubbs rose to power made international news after he was found in a box full of kittens in front of Nagley's General Store in town. Lauri Stec, manager of the general store, decided to keep one kitten and named it ""Stubbs"" because he had no tail. Soon afterward, residents weren't happy with any of the human candidates in the upcoming mayoral election and voted for Stubbs as a write-in candidate. The kitten won, set up its unofficial mayor's office in the general store and spent more than a decade running the town. Because the town of Talkeetna is a ""historical district,"" the mayoral post is more symbolic than functional, locals say. That distinction makes it easy for the community of about 800 human beings to be led by a feline. The weekend attack . Even though dogs run loose and outnumber people in Talkeetna, the canines seem to respect Stubbs' authority, Todd Basilone, owner of Mountain High Pizza Pie told CNN last year. But at least one dog may have had a problem with him. Stubbs was strolling about the town Saturday night as he does every night, when an unleashed dog came running across the street and bit into him. ""He had a big gash on his side about 4-5 inches long and once we got him to the vet we found out the gash went down to his organs,"" said Stec.  ""Right now is a crucial time cause he's heavily sedated on pain meds.  He's in a lot of pain."" Stubbs'  medical bills could top $2,000, Stec said.

"I use a Keurig coffee machine at home because I'm lazy. And, quite frankly, don't feel like I've really done my duty to God and country until I've added a little something to the landfill. ""Here ya go, America. Have another K-Cup. Go Braves."" Though, to be fair, I do actually use 97% biodegradable French roast OneCups from San Francisco Bay, a brand of the Rogers Family Company out of Lincoln, California. Mind you, I use these OneCups not so much for environmental reasons, but because the price is right and I quite like the taste. So hold your praise. I'm still a delightfully lousy, wasteful human being. However, my day-to-day brand of single-serve coffee may soon be a thing of the past, because this fall Keurig plans to launch a new system that will use DRM (Digital Rights Management) technology. It's fancy science, but ultimately it means unlicensed cups won't work with the new machines. Kate Binette, senior public relations specialist from Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, the parent company of Keurig, couldn't tell me exactly how their new interactive technology would work -- and even if she did I'd probably have to take a 40-minute nap -- but I did get the basics. ""Each Keurig 2.0 brewer will have a camera that can 'read' a proprietary taggant material,"" Binette says, adding that it's similar to current anti-counterfeiting technology and will be ""embedded on the lid of each Keurig brand pack."" So, essentially, our coffee is going bionic, and if your current pod doesn't have that taggant, it's no coffee for you! This includes my OneCups from San Francisco Bay. Which can only mean ... Brace yourself. Litigation is coming. Welcome to the Great Electronic Coffee War of 2014! Green Mountain argues that its new advancements in roasting and flavor extraction, as well as thermodynamics, have been expertly developed to ensure perfect consistency with each cup. Therefore, Binette told me, ""It is critical for performance and safety reasons that the system only brews Keurig brand packs."" And I didn't have to look far to find someone who agrees with that assessment. My co-worker, Tiago, says he doesn't want somebody's inferior brand of K-Cup malfunctioning and screwing up his system, declaring from his desk three cubicles away, ""The sanctity of the K-Cup should be respected!"" Mind you, I once said the exact same thing about Lean Pockets. It was 2:30 a.m. I was outside. Not wearing pants. In the rain. ""The sanctity of the Lean Pocket should be respected!"" Looking back, that probably wasn't my finest moment. Anyway, while Keurig says adding DRM is all about performance, Jon Rogers, founder and president of the Rogers Family Company (makers of my San Francisco Bay coffee) calls it ""baloney."" He thinks it's all about money and keeping non-Green Mountain coffee out of your hands. By e-mail, he explained to me, ""Prices would be higher to the consumer. Innovation would be stifled."" In February, another company, TreeHouse Foods Inc., even filed a lawsuit against Green Mountain. The Rogers Family Company is considering legal action as well. Jon Rogers says, ""If Green Mountain Coffee Roasters is allowed to introduce Keurig 2.0 with the feature that, in our opinion, is clearly in restraint of trade, the Keurig 2.0 monopoly would be reinstated as it was when Keurig 1.0 was the only brewer on the market."" Whatever happens, it'll be interesting to see this play out over the coming months. But I do have to say that the new Keurigs are really sexy. Plus, in addition to brewing single cups, they'll also do full carafes. So, never mind whose cup you choose (or are allowed) to brew. Brace yourself. Multiple sprints to the bathroom are coming.

"It's official, Crimea is Russian. In the words of Vladimir Putin, ""In people's hearts and minds, Crimea has always been an inseparable part of Russia."" Indeed Russia said that in Sunday's referendum 97% of its participants, mostly ethnic Russians, insisted that to belong to the Great Russia versus Small Russia (Malorossiya, another name for Ukraine) had been their dream for 60 years since the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, my great-grandfather, transferred the peninsula's jurisdiction to Kiev. In his address to Parliament on March 18 announcing the annexation, Putin said that by this Khrushchev action Russia was not ""simply robbed, it was plundered."" There are many reasons for transfer that Putin could have outlined: administrative, economic, desire to overcome Joseph Stalin's legacy of central control. Yet he chose to say my great-grandfather was atoning for ""the mass repressions of the 1930s in Ukraine."" Well, Khrushchev became the First Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party in 1938, when most of the repressions -- namely Holodomor, the Great Famine, brought in part by Stalin's heavy industrialization -- were over. It is rich of the Russian President to accuse Khrushchev of repressions. What about Stalin, the true tyrant? Putin is not Stalin, of course, not yet, but he sees himself walking in the dictator's shoes: he adds lands to the great Russia, while other sorry leaders like Khrushchev only squandered it away. Not that Khrushchev, a Soviet autocrat, shied away from brutality, indeed participating in repressions and purges -- that was the style of the times. Nonetheless, after Stalin's death in 1953 his goal was to decentralize the Communist monolith, hence the Crimea transfer. No stranger to propaganda -- Communism excelled in arguing Soviet superiority over ethnic national pride, Ukrainian or any other, as well as over decadent and dying capitalism -- Khrushchev still would have cringed at Putin's distortions. ""Kiev is the mother of Russian cities. Ancient Rus is our common source and we cannot live without each other,"" the president said, implying that given this closeness Russia must have control over the Malorossian territory. Khrushchev too thought that Ukraine and Russia were almost one -- after all a symbolic reason for the 1954 transfer was the 300th anniversary of the Ukrainian-Russian unification. But he would think of them as equal nations, assigning the original primacy to the 9th century Kiev, not to Moscow, which until the 1100s was just an obscure place in the woods. Khrushchev, who valued diversity (as much as the Soviet despot could) would have condemned the Putin Doctrine -- development of the military industrial complex based on the Kremlin-centric heavy industry and export of raw materials. In Soviet times that complex was a staple of the economy, as the main slogan of the Kremlin was the class struggle against global imperialism. And even if my great-grandfather used that argument in Budapest, sending tanks to suppress the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, a popular uprising against hardline communism, he lamented similar tactics in 1968 when his successor Leonid Brezhnev squashed the Prague Spring. Under Brezhnev this kind of incursions into neighboring territories became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine. It declared that forces hostile to socialism should not be tolerated, and to cement this argument in 1979 the USSR send troops to Afghanistan to provide security to its recently formed Democratic Republic. Khrushchev died in 1971 and didn't see what harm the Afghan war did to his country -- thousands of lives lost and the economy strained by the time it withdrew with defeat exactly a quarter of a century ago -- but he, who in retirement spoke candidly of his and Communism's mistakes, would have been horrified by the stanchness of the Kremlin's patterns. Today Putin would undoubtedly suggest that Crimea is not different from Afghanistan. Speaking to the veterans about the Afghan invasion in February 2004, he explained there were legitimate geopolitical reasons to protect the Soviet Central Asian border. Now citing security of nations within Moscow's sphere of influence he has justified the Ukraine territorial takeover. What's more, in the Brezhnev era the expansionist policies of the military industrial complex were a result of the oil prosperity. After the 1973 oil crisis its prices reached 41 dollars a barrel by 1981. They provided some material comforts to the Soviets, fueled their belief in the USSR's stability and strength. Similarly, with oil at around $100 a barrel in recent decades, the GDP growth under Putin -- up 8% until just a few years ago -- allowed Russians to live well like never before, also cultivating a sense of superiority. The success of the Sochi Olympics last month has only made it greater. In fact the Crimeans' desire to join Russia is partially based on their trust that Putin will turn them into another Sochi, with posh hotels and pristine beaches. But the cost of upgrading or rebuilding the peninsula's economic and social infrastructure will range from $10 billion (300 billion rubles) to $85 billion (3 trillion rubles). Can Russia really foot that bill? A bitter lesson from the Brezhnev USSR is that the state, driven by an undiversified and oil-based economy, runs out of funds to support its extra territories because nationalistic emotions take over economic calculations. Russian inflexible financial system was suffering even before the Ukrainian crisis began. Last year's forecasts suggest that in the next 15 years Russia's growth rate would fall from 4.3% to 2.5% if it keeps its raw material focus. Now with the United States, Europe and Japan hitting the Kremlin with sanctions -- account freezes and visa bans for the high level Putin government officials -- further economic downturn is inevitable. The Brezhnev Doctrine -- defense of socialism through expansion and the military industrial complex -- had led to the inglorious Soviet collapse. The doomsday of the Putin Doctrine must be approaching fast.","Putin says when Khrushchev handed Crimea to Ukraine, Russia was not ""simply robbed, it was plundered""

"Phil Mickelson, aka Lefty, is thinking of leaving California and perhaps America because, according to his own reckoning, he is facing tax rates of 62% or 63%. Mickelson, probably the second-most-famous professional golfer in the world after Tiger Woods, later backed off from his initial comments about making ""drastic changes."" Reports suggest that Mickelson earned more than $60 million in 2012. In that sense, he appears to be doing better than the Romneys, and perhaps you are not all that sympathetic to him. The Romneys (remember them?) paid so little tax. In 2011, Mitt and Ann Romney paid federal taxes of $2 million on reported income of $14 million, for an effective tax rate of 14%, all roughly. The Romneys even had to foreswear taking all of their available charitable deductions to make their tax rate seem so high for appearance's sake. It does bear noting that Mickelson is doing something to earn his $60 million.  Whoever is paying him that much believes that he is worth it. Who are we, really, to argue? Mickelson's instinctive reactions to high tax rates, even if his math may be a bit muddled, are sound and sensible ones. Tiger Woods certainly agrees with him. But that is not the problem in the story. Lefty faces such seemingly inescapably high tax rates that he might just pack up his golf bags and leave home. Mitt pays so little tax that he has to ignore the law to pay a higher rate for appearance's sake. How can this be? The Mitt-Lefty paradox has a simple explanation: In America, we tax work. And highly.  We do not tax capital or wealth much at all. Indeed, if you have wealth already, taxes are essentially optional under what I call tax Planning 101, the simple advice to buy/borrow/die. In step one, you buy assets that rise in value without producing cash, such as growth stocks or real estate. In step two, you borrow to finance your lifestyle. In step three, you die, and your heirs get your assets, tax free, and with a ""stepped up"" basis that eliminates all capital gains. That's it. Romney, with a personal fortune estimated at $250 million (his five kids have another $100 million) has figured this out.  When he pays taxes, at all, he does so at the low capital gains rate. Not so with Lefty. He is a wage-earner, albeit a very highly paid one, and he's going to pay over one-half of his income in taxes if he stays in California.  We may not be shedding any tears for Lefty any more than we feel for Gerard Depardieu, who recently left France for Russia to escape taxes, or for the Rolling Stones, who many moons ago left England and recorded Exile on Main Street from France. Yet one fact not making news is that it is still the case that the highest marginal tax rates in America do not fall on the highest incomes, like Lefty, but on certain of the working poor, many of them single parents, who are being taxed at rates approaching 90% as they lose benefits attempting to better themselves. It's a ""poverty trap"" that works just like the severe marriage penalties for the lower-income classes. But the working poor do not have the options of going to Canada, Russia or France. Lefty has a point -- high tax rates create disincentives. If the rates are high enough, people react by moving. This should not surprise us: American companies have been fleeing our shores for years, in droves. Ask Mitt. But this should worry us, for two reasons. One, the fact that the high incomers do flee jurisdictions, or flee from the productive activity of working, is a bad thing for the U.S. Two, the very risk that the rich and famous might leave, aided by the appearance that some do, holds tax reform hostage. We have struggled to raise rates at all on the rich, blocked by the mostly mythical Joe the Plumber as much as by the realities of Mickelson or the Rolling Stones. When we do finally raise rates, as we did at the fiscal cliff, we do so on the wrong rich, in the wrong way.  Lefty's taxes went up, Mitt's need not. The problem -- and it is the same problem as with Mitt's taxes -- is that we are taxing the wrong thing, in the wrong way.  In sum, we tax work, not wealth. This is backward. We should be taxing the act of spending, not the socially beneficial ones of work and savings.  Then we could raise tax rates without fear of ill effects. Mitt's taxes would go up, for he is surely spending more than $14 million a year, as by running for president, and we wouldn't need any special capital gains preference under a consistent spending tax. Lefty's taxes would go down to the extent he saves some of his $60 million, helping us all by working and saving.  When and if Mickelson or his kids spend, we could tax him or them then. And if Lefty is really insisting on both earning and spending $60 million a year? Well, I figure he can buy a lot of borscht in Russia with that.","Golf star Phil Mickelson is thinking of leaving California to avoid paying high taxes .

"A JetBlue pilot who was locked out of the cockpit by his co-pilot after his odd midflight rants in March was ruled competent to stand trial Friday morning. U.S. District Court Judge Mary Lou Robinson ruled that JetBlue Capt. Clayton Osbon is ""mentally competent, that he is able to understand and does understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him, and that he is able to assist properly in his defense,"" according to a court order. Osbon attorney Dean Roper plans on using an insanity defense, according to court documents filed April 18. The pilot was indicted April 11, in a federal court in Amarillo, Texas, accused of interfering with a flight crew. The flight landed safely in Amarillo after the incident, according to the indictment filed that day. Osbon is still employed by JetBlue ""but is removed from active duty,"" JetBlue spokeswoman Allison Steinberg wrote in an e-mail. She declined to answer questions about the hearing: ""We don't comment on pending litigation."" This week, a group of 10 passengers who were aboard the March 27 flight out of John F. Kennedy International Airport that was diverted because of Osbon's erratic behavior filed a lawsuit against the airline and pilot Wednesday in state Supreme Court in Queens. The lawsuit, which was obtained by CNN, accuses JetBlue of being grossly negligent for allowing Osbon to fly and says the airline knew or should have known that Osbon was unfit to fly. As the Airbus A320 was climbing out of New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on its way to Las Vegas, Osbon talked about his church and needing to ""focus,"" an FBI affidavit said. He then told the co-pilot to take the controls and to work the radio, and began talking about religion, making statements that were incoherent, it says. The lawsuit alleges that Osbon caused significant distress to the passengers, specifically by yelling obscenities and things such as ""Say your prayers,"" ""We're all going down,"" ""I'm going to show you Iraq and Iran right now"" and ""There's a bomb on board."" Pilot breakdown draws attention to mental health standards . The concerned co-pilot suggested that they invite an off-duty JetBlue captain into the cockpit. Instead, Osbon ""abruptly left the cockpit to go to the forward lavatory,"" the affidavit says. The co-pilot used the opportunity to get the off-duty captain into the cockpit and change the combination to the door lock. When Osbon tried to enter his code into the cockpit door lock, the co-pilot announced an order to restrain him over the public address system. Several passengers wrestled Osbon to the floor. The flight was diverted to Amarillo, and Osbon was taken into custody.","Ruling: JetBlue pilot who had midair meltdown fit to stand trial .

"Washington (CNN) -- Overriding objections from China, the Obama administration unveiled a $6.4 billion arms deal with Taiwan on Friday -- including about $2.85 billion in missiles. The sale includes 60 Black Hawk helicopters (totaling $3.1 billion), 114 advanced Patriot air defense missiles; a pair of Osprey mine-hunting ships; and dozens of advanced communications systems. China has complained to the United States about the sale of Patriot missiles and other weapons to Taiwan, which neither Beijing nor Washington recognize as a sovereign nation. The deals do not include F-16 fighter jets, which China has vehemently opposed. China's Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei issued a statement in response to Friday's announcement, saying the arms deal was a ""rude interference in China's internal affairs, severely endangering China's national security."" He added, ""China expresses its strong indignation."" The State Department described the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan as a way to guarantee security and stability, despite China's objections. ""This is a clear demonstration of the commitment this administration has to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons it needs and as provided for in the Taiwan Relations Act,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said at his regular Friday briefing. ""We think this action is consistent with the U.S. one-China policy ... and contributes to maintaining stability and security across the Taiwan Strait."" He said the State Department had informed the U.S. Congress as well as China and Taiwan about the arms package. Crowley would not speak directly about the timing of the announcement of the sales, and about the fact that the arms package does not include F-16s. The arms sales come as the United States is hoping to persuade China to sign on to harsher sanctions against Iran and just after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized China for its policies relating to the Internet. A senior U.S. official said later that the United States expected Chinese criticism of the arms deal, but does not expect permanent damage. ""We've worked through these issues before. We will do so again,"" the U.S. official said, seeking anonymity on such an important policy issue. ""What is important here is the stability in the region. And we do think our ongoing sales of arms to Taiwan is fully consistent with everyone's long-term interest in stability in the region."" The official said he believed Clinton had discussed the sale in London with her Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of Thursday's international conference on Afghanistan. ""This relationship between the United States and China is broad, it's deep. There are a large number of issues. We don't see eye to eye with them and we have to have and do have the ability to speak honestly,"" the official said. The arms deal is the latest chapter in a decades-long uneasy standoff; China claims Taiwan is its own territory and has threatened to invade if Taiwan ever declares independence. The United States has said it will defend Taiwan if China ever attacks. The government in Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China until a Communist insurrection proved victorious in 1949. With the Communist takeover of mainland China, the losing faction fled to the island of Taiwan. Taiwan is formally known as the Republic of China, while Communist China's official name is People's Republic of China. Many Western nations and the United Nations recognized Taiwan as the legitimate Chinese government until the 1970s.","Sale includes 60 Black Hawk helicopters, 114 air defense missiles, mine-hunting ships .

"Twelve months ago, Ruler of the World made history for trainer Aiden O'Brien by capturing the 2013 Epsom Derby, arguably the world's most prestigious flat race. O'Brien's former stable jockey, Kieren Fallon, was not in contention that day.  He was not even at Epsom.  He was 200 miles away in Doncaster, where his best result was second place in a low-key Class 4 handicap. On Saturday, Fallon will resume his rightful place alongside the country's best jockeys when he lines up for the Derby's 235th running aboard 12-1 chance True Story. It caps a remarkable reversal in fortunes for the veteran, who turns 50 next year. Yet, like all the best true stories, this one has something of a ring of fiction about it. To many in racing, Fallon is at once the most brilliant and most controversial jockey of his generation. His numerous successes on the track are matched only by his excesses off it. Born in County Clare, in the west of Ireland, he was one of six children. Although not from a racing family, Fallon always had a natural affinity with animals. His love of horses was sparked by the wild Connemara ponies that roamed the harsh landscape near his childhood home. ""I'd have to say it was a gift, because the first time I sat on a horse I was able to ride,"" remembers Fallon. ""I rode them through the fields with no saddle and bridle, just loose and wild. They would tear off across the field and I'd stay on them as long as I could!"" From there he found his way to The Curragh, Ireland's horse racing heartland. After serving his apprenticeship with trainer Kevin Prendergast, he crossed the Irish Sea and eventually wound up as stable jockey to Henry Cecil, a relationship that would prove fateful for both parties. Auspicious beginnings . In his first season with the Englishman, Fallon recorded his first Classic success, winning the 1,000 Guineas on Sleepytime, following it up with the Epsom Oaks a month later. He ended that 1997 season with 202 winners and the first of his six Champion Jockey titles. He retained the jockeys' championship for the next two seasons, during which time he also won the first of his three Epsom Derbies with Oath. However, less than two months later Fallon was summarily dismissed following allegations -- which he denied -- of an affair with Cecil's wife. It was the first of a series of spectacular highs and lows which would come to define Fallon's career. Indeed, few sportsmen can boast a résumé as checkered as Fallon's. In addition to his 16 English Classic wins, he has Group 1 victories in the United States, Dubai and Hong Kong to his name, and has twice captured Europe's ultimate prize, the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, with Hurricane Run in 2005 and Dylan Thomas in 2007. But he has also served two bans for testing positive for recreational drugs, spent time in rehab for alcohol dependency, and was a defendant in a high-profile race-fixing case in 2007, although he was cleared of all charges. He suffered a potentially career-ending shoulder injury in a fall at Royal Ascot in 2000, earning him a place in the medical annals as the recipient of the world's first successful nerve graft. Then there are his fractured personal relationships: he was punched by owner David Reynolds in 2010, and banned for six months for pulling jockey Stuart Webster off his horse during a race meeting at Beverley 16 years earlier. As recently as last year, he was effectively blackballed by owner Sheikh Mohammed Obaid Al Maktoum, the main patron of his then employer Luca Cumani, seemingly ending his top-flight career once and for all. ""From there it just fizzled out,"" admits Fallon. Last season, he rode just 80 winners. A new start . Yet Fallon has rebuilt his career more times than he has rebuilt his battered body, and today he is once more a force in top-class races, 11 years after his last champion jockey title. Last month, he won the 2,000 Guineas for the fifth time in a dramatic finish aboard Night of Thunder, some 14 years after his first victory in the race. Come Saturday, he has a realistic chance of landing his fourth Derby and completing what would surely rank as one of the all-time great sporting comebacks. His road to redemption began last winter when he headed to Dubai to ride work for Godolphin trainer Saeed bin Suroor following his dismissal by Sheikh Obaid. He picked up a chance ride in an important race on Prince Bishop, the horse he credits with saving his career. ""Prince Bishop was going to be my last ride,"" he confesses. But then he won. Two weeks later, he won again, and Fallon was back. ""From being more or less dead and buried and on the way out, that really rekindled my buzz and my love for winning,"" he says. Fallon was soon snapped up by bin Suroor and occupies the coveted top jockey spot at the stable. ""I'm really enjoying riding for Godolphin,"" he says. ""You couldn't be in a better place, riding better horses for better people."" Hard work rewarded . Indeed, Fallon has now completed a unique full house, having been stable jockey for both Coolmore and Godolphin, as well as Michael Stoute and a pre-knighthood Cecil when their stables were at their peak of dominance. ""He's one of the best jockeys in the world,"" explains bin Suroor.  ""In big races you need a guy like him who has experience. ""He's very tough and he's very fit. He comes every day to ride in the mornings and knows every single horse in the stable."" Fallon's work ethic is something that even his detractors appear to agree on -- even Cecil called him a very hard worker. In 2008, when Fallon received an 18-month ban for his second positive drug test, he continued to ride out for Stoute. ""I spent from first lot to fourth lot riding out and I really enjoyed it,"" he says of that time. ""I loved riding out with the lads and having a laugh, and getting physical exercise as well."" Now in the twilight of his career, Fallon appears to be in the best shape of his life, both physically and mentally. ""I play golf and  I play squash,"" he says. ""I like to cook -- fish, chicken, stews. I don't eat a lot but I'll eat little and often. I never let myself get hungry."" Stranger than fiction . Has he finally banished the demons that haunted him throughout so much of his career? ""I'm happy doing what I'm doing at the moment. This time I'm able to enjoy it because I can't really go anywhere now, this is it for me.  I'm just planning to get out there this weekend and just take it from there."" Fallon could not have picked a more aptly-named horse for what might prove to be the final chapter of what has been, by all accounts, a sensational career. ""True Story is really going well,"" he says of his Derby mount. ""He's a big, well-balanced horse with a turn of foot. I don't think he'll have a problem handling Epsom."" Standing in the way of Fallon and his fairytale ending is Australia, trained by his former boss O'Brien and widely regarded as favorite to win the race. O'Brien's Coolmore and Godolphin are, of course, great rivals. And Godolphin, no stranger to reversals of fortune, having weathered its own doping scandal last year, is yet to capture English racing's biggest prize. These omens do not appear to faze Fallon: ""I believe you make your own luck.  Enjoy it while you can."" From enfant terrible to master of reinvention, you would not bet against Fallon producing an ending that is stranger than fiction.","Kieren Fallon thought his career was over last season but is back at the peak of the sport .
Now just shy of his 50th birthday, he is targeting another prestigious Epsom Derby win .

"(CNN) -- Ethnic tensions in the Balkans and an incident involving a drone led to the abandonment of a major European international football game Tuesday. Serbia's European Championship qualifying match with Albania was abandoned after 41 minutes following ugly clashes between both sets of players. The brawl followed the arrival of a mini-drone, which flew over the stadium while carrying a flag depicting the ""Greater Albania."" When Serbian player Stefan Mitrovic ripped the flag down, it provided the catalyst for an already combustible tie to fully ignite. Martin Atkinson, the English referee, took the players off the field with the game goalless following clashes between rival players. See images of the incident . There were no signs of the tie being restarted with UEFA, the game's European governing body, confirming the game had been abandoned. Albanian players ran from the field, while a number of missiles and flares were thrown from the stands by some home supporters. Images from photo agencies showed fans had invaded the pitch. In a statement on its website, UEFA said that the match ""was abandoned and the circumstances will be reported to the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body."" It is expected to make an announcement on disciplinary proceedings on Wednesday. The ""Greater Albania"" insignia refers to the idea of an extended area in which all ethnic Albanians reside -- one which would include Kosovo. The two figures on the flag were Isa Boljetini, an Albanian nationalist who led uprisings against the Serbs and Ottomans in 1912 and 1913, while the other, Ismail Qemali, is considered to be the founder of the modern Albanian state, which became independent in 1912. The word ""Autochthonous,"" which refers to an indigenous inhabitant of a place, was emblazoned at the bottom of the flag and is considered an offense to Serbians. The brother of Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama was arrested in Serbia on Tuesday night following the brawl, the office of the Serbian Prime Minister told CNN on Wednesday. Olsi Rama was held briefly before being released at the insistence of Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic, then put on a plane home, Vucic's office said. ""What happened is something we can't comprehend at the moment,"" Serbia captain Branislav Ivanovic told reporters. ""On behalf of my team, all I can say is that we wanted to carry on and that we shielded the Albanian players every step of the way to the tunnel (after the riot broke out). ""The Albanian team said they were unfit physically and mentally to carry on after talking to the officials and they will now decide the fate of this match. ""We can only regret that football took a back seat but it is difficult to draw any conclusions or make any comments now."" Security had been tight in the lead up to the contest in Belgrade with no away fans present with tensions running high over Kosovo -- a majority-Albanian former Serbian province which declared independence in 2008. In 1999, a 78-day air war was launched by NATO to stop the killing off ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces. Kosovo's independence is recognized by many countries including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France -- but not Serbia. Four of Albania's starting lineup were born in Kosovo, with Lorik Cana of Italian club Lazio, goalkeeper Etrit Berisha, midfielder Burim Kukeli and Ermir Lenjani. With Kosovo not recognized as a state by the United Nations, it is unable to join FIFA or UEFA, meaning some of its players have adopted other countries. Xherdan Shaqiri, who plays his club football with Bayern Munich, represents Switzerland as does Valon Behrami and Granit Xhaka. While Kosovo is able to play friendly matches, the team cannot compete in international competition. Belgium-born Adnan Januzaj, one of the most exciting talents in the English Premier League with Manchester United, turned down the opportunity to play for Kosovo, where his father is from. He was also eligible for Albania through his mother's lineage. ""We came to Belgrade to play football, but we were physically attacked by the Serbian supporters,"" Cana told reporters. ""We just wanted to take the flag, and everything would be under control if the stadium security at the stadium had prevented the supporters from attacking our players. ""I was defending my teammate, I have injuries to my face, as does Taulant Xhaka. They asked us to play in front of empty stands (instead of abandonment) -- however, we did not feel good because of our injuries."" Albania had not played in Belgrade since 1967 and must now wait for UEFA to make a decision on whether the game should be replayed. ""It is a regretful situation on which we will report; the referee, myself and the security adviser. The circumstances were such that we couldn't continue the match,"" UEFA's match delegate, Harry Been told reporters. ""You all saw what happened and I cannot comment on who is to blame or what to blame. I will submit a report with my colleagues to Uefa and Uefa will decide what will happen further."" Germany stifled . Elsewhere, Germany's poor run of form continued after it was held to a 1-1 draw in Gelsenkirchen by the Republic of Ireland. Toni Kroos' long-range effort appeared to have sealed victory for the home side but John O'Shea marked his 100th appearance with a dramatic late equalizer. Poland, which defeated Germany 2-0 last time out, was forced to settle for a point following a 2-2 draw with Scotland. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrated reaching 100 million Facebook fans by scoring a 95th minute winner in Portugal's 1-0 victory over Denmark. Elsewhere, Northern Ireland's remarkable run of form means it has now won three qualifying games in a row. A 2-0 victory in Greece courtesy of goals from Jamie Ward and Kyle Lafferty means it sits top of Group F with maximum points. CNN's Alexander Hunter and Alba Prifti contributed to this report.","Brother of Albanian PM was arrested after the brawl, Serbian PM's office says .

"(CNN) -- Even though she was 4 years old at the time, Deborah Gouin remembers it like it was yesterday. This plaque hangs in Buddy Holly's high school, where iReporter Cliff Giles graduated a few years later. ""My mother would listen to this light brown Zenith radio every morning to see if the school was closed,"" she said of her childhood in snowy Michigan. One morning, Gouin's mother heard the news and notified her brother. ""She said, 'Kenny! Buddy Holly died last night!'"" Gouin asked her mother, ""Who's Buddy Holly?"" Her mother explained that he sang ""Peggy Sue.""  Gouin remembers her brother being saddened at the news. ""My brother was at the age where he was interested in rock 'n' roll music, and would play the new songs on his trumpet."" It was February 3, 1959, a day that would be immortalized more than a decade later in the Don McLean song ""American Pie"" as ""the day the music died."" Holly, as well as fellow rock 'n' roll musicians Ritchie Valens and J.P. ""The Big Bopper"" Richardson, lost their lives in a plane crash early that morning. It is often recognized as the end of an early era for rock 'n' roll music, and iReporters shared their thoughts on on that tragic day and what it meant. In Gouin's case, she discovered Holly's work later in life. She owns a five-volume set of his work. ""I'm totally a huge fan of Buddy's music,"" she said. ""It was a huge loss. I think he would have had an even bigger influence on music if he had lived."" iReport.com: Gouin shares her memories of that day . Beverly Cummins clearly remembers hearing about the tragedy as well. Her sister and cousin had spent the night at her house. ""My cousin had a crush on Ritchie Valens and played his 45 record 'Donna' the night before, among others."" That morning, she heard her cousin screaming as a radio station delivered the news. ""I heard it for myself about an hour later,"" she said. ""It was stunning, and I started crying because she was crying. Even though I was 7, I knew what death meant."" Her cousin continually played records by Valens ""while young and old tried to absorb how a series of tragic circumstances could have taken these three so young and full of life and promise."" Cummins said her cousin had her friends over for a memorial sleepover. ""They even got the Ouija board out to see if they could contact them. It was quickly put away when it scared everybody enough. ""I can hardly conceive that 50 years have passed since this defining moment in my own little life."" iReport.com: How teens of the time paid tribute to the trio . Cliff Giles attended Lubbock High School in Lubbock, Texas, the same school Holly had attended a few years earlier. He was eating at a nearby restaurant when he heard the news. ""I remember thinking that it was a shame his life and career ended so quickly,"" he said. Giles never met Holly but became a fan of his music from listening to the radio at the time. ""Like most teenagers then, I liked his early, up-tempo music best,"" he said. ""I remember kids complaining about how he had turned soft with the orchestra-backed album."" iReport.com: Concert re-creates final tour . Giles, a pilot, said, ""It's probably easier for me to imagine the panic that gripped the very young pilot as he came to realize that he had lost control of the airplane on that dark and stormy night, and how easily it can happen."" During the 40th reunion of his high school class, Giles toured the building where both he and Holly received their education. He says, ""I'm proud of the photo that my son -- also a Buddy Holly fan -- made of me standing by a plaque commemorating Buddy's homeroom."" iReport.com: Read more about Holly's fellow alumnus .

"It's trust in English, confiance in French, and a word used a lot Tuesday by President Barack Obama and visiting French President Francois Hollande to describe what has changed once thorny relations between the NATO allies. At a news conference on the second day of Holland's state visit, the two leaders talked up continuing a new cooperation between their governments that butted heads a decade ago over the Iraq War. Obama will host Hollande at a state dinner on Tuesday night -- the first of his second term -- in another sign of what both depicted as a diplomatic bromance in the face of international challenges that include the Syrian civil war, Iran's nuclear ambitions and economic malaise in Europe. ""We're standing shoulder to shoulder on key challenges,"" Obama said at one point, while Hollande declared that ""we trust each other in an unprecedented manner."" Obama to France in June . To underscore the improving relations, Obama said he would travel to France in June at Hollande's invitation to mark the 70th anniversary of the Normandy invasion during World War II. For his part, Hollande said that ""mutual trust has been restored"" between his government and the Obama administration in the aftermath of classified leaks by Edward Snowden that disclosed widespread U.S. surveillance operations in foreign countries. A socialist elected in 2012, Hollande arrived alone for the trip after revelations in France of an affair with an actress and the subsequent end of his longtime relationship with Valerie Trierweiler, who was considered the equivalent of the French first lady even though they weren't married. During Tuesday's news conference that stretched to an hour, no one asked about Hollande's personal life. Even for issues on which they may not see completely eye-to-eye, Obama and Hollande emphasized a cooperative spirit in seeking an end to the Syrian war and a deal with Iran to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. Asked about the nuclear talks with Iran involving their countries along with Russia, Britain, China and Germany, the two leaders avoided directly answering if France had concerns that the United States might push for a less-than-ideal final agreement in order to declare success. It's up to the Iranians to guarantee their intentions are for peaceful use of nuclear power, Obama said, adding that ""if they meet what technically gives us those assurances, then there is a deal to be made. If they don't, there isn't."" Iranian problem . For his part, Hollande said a six-month agreement reached with Iran to freeze its enrichment in return for easing some sanctions while talks continue ""doesn't mean that there is no longer an Iranian problem."" ""There is an Iranian problem, for we need to make sure that Iran renounce the nuclear weapon in a definite and comprehensive manner,"" he said. Obama has stressed the United States would enforce remaining U.S. and U.N. sanctions on Iran, pending a permanent accord on the nuclear issues. When a reporter asked about a French business delegation visiting Iran, Obama warned any companies violating sanctions would ""do so at their own peril now, because we will come down on them like a ton of bricks."" He added that the United States expects allies such France to fully observe existing sanctions against Iran. Hollande, meanwhile, said it was critical that Iran renounces nuclear weapons in a ""comprehensive manner"" in talks going forward, but noted that he lacked authority to tell French businesses who they can talk with as long as no sanctions violations occur. The next round of Iran talks begin on February 18 in Vienna. Iranian and International Atomic Energy Agency officials jointly said Sunday that Iran has agreed to take additional steps by May to ease international concern over Tehran's nuclear program. Syrian conflict . On another Middle East issue dominating global concern, Obama said there was ""a horrendous situation on the ground in Syria"" and he called the ongoing civil war and humanitarian crisis ""one of our highest national security priorities"" because of extremists gaining greater influence in the ""crumbling"" nation. Obama also said his administration was putting pressure on Russia -- a major ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad -- to help the international community gain access to provide humanitarian aid. The message to Moscow was that expressions of concern about the welfare of Syrians were not enough ""if there are starving people,"" Obama said. Hollande noted the threats of military action by their countries that he credited with forcing the Syrians to negotiate the handover of its known chemical weapons stockpiles. However, he said Syria's compliance with an agreement worked out by Russia had brought ""only partial destruction"" of Syrian chemical weapons so far that he said ""doesn't go nearly far enough.""

"A strong storm over the Bering Sea -- the remnants of Super Typhoon Nuri -- will bring intense winds, massive waves and heavy rain and snow to coastal Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. But don't ignore it just because it is a sparsely populated area with residents who are accustomed to severe weather. The powerful storm will whip the jet stream, causing a ripple effect that will carry the cold air to the East Coast. This arctic outbreak will funnel down through Canada over the next week, bringing a deep freeze to the eastern United States, with temperatures forecast 20 degrees below average. The ripple of frigid air starts in Alaska, where the remnants of Super Typhoon Nuri -- which earlier in the week was tied for the strongest storm typhoon of the year based on wind speed  -- have strengthened, though it isn't a typhoon any longer. Technically, it's called a mid-latitude storm. The storm carries the energy of the typhoon and its current strength is derived from clashes of hot and cold air. This incredibly strong cyclone will alter the jet stream allowing for the cold air to plunge into the United States next week. The effects of the cold air will be felt as early as the weekend, as temperatures will cool in the East Coast. But a second cold front with really cold air will make its way into the Upper Midwest Sunday and the East Coast by the end of next week. That second front will bring snow from Montana to the Great Lakes starting on Sunday. By Wednesday, snow may reach as far north as New England. The name ""Polar Vortex"" has been attached in the past to weather like this, but that is a misnomer. There is a thing called the Polar Vortex, and it is always present in the arctic atmosphere. The current storm is affecting the jet stream and allowing polar air to plunge farther south, but it is not a direct result of the Polar Vortex.","The remnants of Super Typhoon Nuri will bring severe weather to Alaska .

Willis explained that ""Instagram had recently deleted my account over what they called 'instances of abuse.' Which in reality amounted to a photo of myself in a sheer top and a post of a jacket I made featuring a picture of two close friends topless."" ""My situation was in no way unique; women are regularly kicked off Instagram for posting photos with any portion of the areola exposed, while photos sans nipple -- degrading as they might be -- remain unchallenged,"" Willis wrote. ""So I walked around New York topless and documented it on Twitter, pointing out that what is legal by New York state law is not allowed on Instagram."" It is not illegal in New York City for a woman to be topless in public as long as she is otherwise law abiding. The young actress wrote that she understands that many ""don't want to take me seriously."" ""Or would rather just write me off as an attention-seeking, overprivileged, ignorant, white girl,"" she said. ""I am white and I was born to a high profile and financially privileged family. I didn't choose my public life, but it did give me this platform. A platform that helps make body politics newsworthy."" The discussion is worth it to Willis, who points out that the Free the Nipple campaign has been around for a few years fighting to do away with the ""taboo of the nipple in the 21st century."" She said she's happy to have furthered the discussion. ""I am not trying to argue for mandatory toplessness, or even bralessness,"" Willis wrote. ""What I am arguing for is a woman's right to choose how she represents her body -- and to make that choice based on personal desire and not a fear of how people will react to her or how society will judge her. No woman should be made to feel ashamed of her body.""","Scout Willis, the daughter of Bruce Willis and Demi Moore, says she loved Instagram .

"Utah officials have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to immediately block enforcement of a federal judge's ruling allowing same-sex couples to be legally married in the state. An emergency appeal was filed on Tuesday with Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who could rule herself or ask the rest of the court to weigh in. Any action from the high court would be limited and temporary and would not be the final word on the constitutionality of the state's ban on same-sex marriage. A Denver-based federal appeals court will take up the larger issues on an expedited basis in coming weeks, but in the meantime has allowed those marriages to take place. Sotomayor told lawyers for a group of gay and lesbian couples who brought the initial legal challenge to respond to the state's latest appeal by noon Friday. The Supreme Court could then issue an order on the enforcement question. U.S. District Court Judge Robert Shelby struck down Utah's ban on same-sex marriage on December 20, saying the law conflicted with equal protection and due process guarantees under the U.S. Constitution. Utah voters approved a law banning same-sex marriage in 2004. Shelby's ruling drew national attention partly because Utah is viewed as being among the more conservative states and because the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled this past summer on separate issues involving same-sex marriage. In June, the nation's highest court cleared the way for same-sex marriages in California to resume after it ruled private parties did not have ""standing"" to defend California's voter-approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state-sanctioned wedlock. The justices also rejected parts of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in a 5-4 decision, concluding same-sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits such as tax breaks. In the Utah case, the state argued Tuesday that numerous same-sex marriages ""are now occurring"" daily in Utah as a result of the district court decision. ""And each one is an affront not only to the interests of the states and its citizens in being able to define marriage through ordinary democratic channels, but also to this (high) court's unique role as final arbiter of the profoundly important question it so carefully preserved"" in the DOMA case, the state said. The federal judge's ruling prompted a rush of same-sex couples to courthouses in Utah where they obtained marriage licenses, despite the state's ongoing legal challenge. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert had criticized Shelby's ruling, calling him ""an activist federal judge."" Shelby, appointed to the bench last year by President Barack Obama, said the state's ""current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and, in so doing, demean the dignity of these same-sex couples for no rational reason. Accordingly, the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional."" Same-sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming. It is legal in 17 other states and the District of Columbia: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

"Kaitlyn Hunt, the 19-year-old who faces charges of lewd and lascivious battery in Florida after police learned of an alleged sexual relationship she had with a 14-year-old girl, has accepted a plea deal, prosecutor Brian Workman said Wednesday night. The case garnered attention as Hunt's lawyers claimed that authorities wouldn't have gone after her if the situation had involved a male and a female instead of two teenage girls. Under the plea deal, Hunt will plead no contest to five charges, including two counts of misdemeanor battery, misdemeanor contributing to the dependency of a child and two counts of felony interference with child custody, according to a copy of the plea deal provided to CNN by Workman, who is an assistant state attorney. The felony charges originate from the times she picked up the 14-year-old against the girl's parents' wishes. Hunt has been in jail since August 20 for violating a court order not to contact the alleged victim. A hearing is set for 11 a.m. ET Thursday in Vero Beach, Florida, Workman said. Under the terms of the agreement, Hunt would be sentenced to four months in jail, to be followed by two years of house arrest with electronic monitoring, and nine months of monitored probation after that, he said earlier. If she has no violations, she will not be a convicted felon under Florida law, and she will have the possibility of sealing her file and having the case expunged after 10 years, he said. Hunt's attorneys were involved in crafting the deal, Workman said. Hunt's attorneys said Wednesday night they would not comment on the case. She had refused at least two other deals. ""I believe this is a fair and balanced offer that protects the victim while giving Ms. Hunt the ability to avoid the most severe consequences of her crimes by demonstrating that no further punishment is necessary,"" Workman said Wednesday afternoon. Hunt was 18 when she was charged with two felony counts of lewd and lascivious battery after allegedly having sexual relations with the girl, who was 14. In Florida, a person under the age of 16 is not legally able to consent to sex.

"Much has been said about the rivalry between Airbus and Boeing and the Airbus A320 features prominently in this. The twin-engined A320 entered service in 1988, some two decades after its single-aisle rival, Boeing's 737. There have been a total of 11,163 orders for the A320, with 6,331 deliveries to date and slightly less aircraft flying globally by over 300 operators. The A320 family ranges from the smaller A318 (around 100 seats), to the upgraded A321 (around 185 to 220 passengers depending on the class configuration). The short to medium-range A320 is the most popular version with a range of about 3,300 nautical miles or 6,150 kilometers. It has a wing span of 35.80 meters (with Sharklets), a length of 37.57 meters and a max payload of 16.6 tonnes, according to Airbus. Budget carrier AirAsia is the largest commercial airline customer of the A320, with 184 orders and 157 deliveries of the A320. It has an additional 291 orders of the next generation A320, the A320neo (new engine option), according to Airbus data. The A320neo is powered by twin Pratt & Whitney Geared Turbo Fans -- a 20-year research-and-development gamble that brings Pratt & Whitney back into the arena as a major player in single-aisle airplane powerplants. The A320neo first flew in September and is due to enter service in October 2015. Flight QZ8501 . The aircraft involved in Sunday's AirAsia Flight QZ8501 incident is an A320-200 operated by AirAsia Indonesia. A statement from Airbus said the plane was powered by CFM 56-5B engines and had accumulated around 23,000 flight hours in some 13,600 flights. Airbus says it will provide full assistance in the investigation into flight QZ8501. The A320-200 can sit up to 180 passengers in a single-class configuration. The AirAsia Indonesia plane was carrying 162, including seven crew. According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database, there have been 54 incidents involving the A320. ""Aviation is safe -- it is crucial to observe the full detail on why the aircraft crashed,"" says Kane Ray, an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation, a global aviation consulting group. ""In the A320 family, accidents and incidents range from fan-cowl detachment, landing gear collapse, bird strikes right through to hull-losses through pilot error. Most aircraft have teething problems and in most cases these are eradicated. Very rarely, these issues cause disasters -- largely because of a culmination of factors that lead to the event."" The worst in terms of fatalities was the 2007 crash of a TAM Linhas Aereas plane that killed all 187 on board, plus a further 12 people on the ground when it failed to stop and went off the runway during landing in Sao Paulo in wet conditions. In 2009, in an incident known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" pilot Chesley Sullenberger landed a U.S. Airways A320 on the Hudson River in New York when the plane lost lost power in its engines after hitting a flock of geese.

"Rolling Stone magazine has revised its apology to readers about an article on an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia. The apology was originally posted Friday on the magazine website and said of Jackie, the woman who described the alleged rape, ""Our trust in her was misplaced."" In the updated apology, those words have been removed. The magazine said of its reporting errors, ""These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie."" The apology was changed Saturday without any explanation by the magazine. Rolling Stone was criticized by some people for ""victim-blaming"" in the first version of the apology. Hanna Rosin, a writer for Slate.com, said on Brian Stelter's ""Reliable Sources"" show on CNN: ""It essentially said this is Jackie's fault but, you know, Jackie is not a journalist. She doesn't know the rules of journalism. She's just telling her own story. It's on us to know that you have to trust but verify. You have to check the sources. You have to figure out with the story is true because if not you end up in a mess like the one we're in now."" Magazine managing editor Will Dana sent out a tweet Friday afternoon that reflected that sentiment, saying ""That failure is on us -- not on her."" But those thoughts were not put into the apology until Saturday. The November 19 article, titled ""A Rape on Campus: A Brutal Assault and Search for Justice at UVA,"" chronicled the school's failure to respond to that alleged assault in a fraternity house. One of the major criticisms of Rolling Stone is that the reporter did not seek comment from the men Jackie says raped her. The updated apology says Rolling Stone honored a request from Jackie, a pseudonym, not to interview the men because she feared retaliation. ""We should have not made this agreement with Jackie, and we should have worked harder to convince her that the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story,"" said the updated apology written by Dana. ""These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie."" The updated apology mentions discrepancies in Jackie's account that have already been reported by The Washington Post and other news outlets. For instance, Phi Kappa Psi did not have a party the night in September 2012 Jackie said the rape occurred and the man she identified as her date that night was not a member of that fraternity, the apology says. The apology says, ""A friend of Jackie's (who we were told would not speak to Rolling Stone) told the Washington Post that he found Jackie that night a mile from the school's fraternities. She did not appear to be 'physically injured at the time' but was shaken. ""She told him that that she had been forced to have oral sex with a group of men at a fraternity party, but he does not remember her identifying a specific house. Other friends of Jackie's told the Washington Post that they now have doubts about her narrative, but Jackie told the Washington Post that she firmly stands by the account she gave to [reporter Sabrina Rubin] Erdely."" After the article ran in November,  It prompted an emergency meeting by the school's governing board and the announcement of a zero-tolerance approach toward sexual assault cases. The school suspended fraternity social events until the spring semester. According to the magazine, Jackie, who at the time had just started her freshman year at the Charlottesville school, claimed she was raped by seven men at Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, while two more gave encouragement, during a party. However, the University of Virginia's Phi Kappa Psi chapter did not have a party the night of September 28, 2012, the date when the alleged attack occurred, or at all that weekend, the chapter said in a statement Friday. The chapter's lawyer, Ben Warthen, told CNN email and fraternity records are proof.","Rolling Stone revises apology after complaints of victim blaming .

"Thanks to a NASA physicist, the notion of warp speed might just travel out of sci-fi and into the real world. NASA's Harold White has been working since 2010 to develop a warp drive that will allow spacecraft to travel at speeds faster than light -- 186,000 miles per second. White, who heads NASA's Advanced Propulsion Team, spoke about his conceptual starship at a conference last fall. But interest in his project reached a new level this week when he unveiled images of what the craft might look like. Created by artist Mark Rademaker, who based them on White's designs, the images show a technologically detailed spacecraft that wouldn't look out of place in a ""Star Trek"" movie. Rademaker says creating them took more than 1,600 hours. For now, warp speed is only possible in TV and movies, with both ""Star Trek"" and ""Star Wars"" referencing an idea that was completely speculative at the time. White has fittingly named the concept spacecraft IXS Enterprise, for the starship famously piloted by Captain James T. Kirk in the ""Star Trek"" TV series and movies. At the SpaceVision 2013 Space Conference last November in Phoenix, White talked about his design, the concepts behind it and the progress that's been made in warp-drive development over the decades. He discussed the idea of a ""space warp,"" a loophole in the theory of general relativity that would allow for massive distances to be traveled very quickly, reducing travel times from thousands of years to days. In his speech, White described space warps as faraway galaxies that can bend light around them. They work on the principle of bending space both in front of and behind a spacecraft. This would essentially allow for the empty space behind the craft to expand, both pushing and pulling it forward at the same time. The concept is similar to that of an escalator or moving walkway. ""There's no speed limit on the expansion and contraction of space,"" White said at the conference.  ""You can actually find a way to get around what I like to call the 11th commandment: Thou shall not exceed the speed of light."" It's the idea of space warps that inspired physicist Miguel Alcubierre in 1994 to first theorize a mathematical model of a warp drive that would be able to bend space and time.  While studying Alcubierre's equations, White decided to design his own retooled version of the Alcubierre Drive. His recently unveiled design has much less empty space than the first concept model, increasing its efficiency. The warp drive that White's team has been working on would literally transcend space, shortening the distance between two points and allowing the craft to break the speed of light. This would be a spaceship with no speed limit. Because travel into space has been extremely limited due to existing means of propulsion, such a technology could blow open the possibilities of space exploration. It could allow for study of the farthest reaches of space, parts that scientists once considered unimaginable. Although the technology to create the spacecraft or the warp drive doesn't yet exist, the artistic renderings Rademaker created could potentially be a model of what's to come -- the first spacecraft to break the speed-of-light barrier and journey beyond our solar system. In his design, White says he drew from Matthew Jeffries' 1965 sketches of the Enterprise from ""Star Trek,"" saying parts of that ship were mathematically correct. He worked with Rademaker and graphic designer Mike Okuda to update the math and produce what he believes to be a viable spacecraft. According to NASA, there hasn't been any proof that a warp drive can exist, but the agency is experimenting nonetheless. Although the concept doesn't violate the laws of physics, that doesn't guarantee that it will work. ""We're starting to talk about what the next chapter for human space exploration going to be,"" White said at SpaceVision.","NASA physicist Harold White has been working since 2010 to develop a warp drive .

"(CNN)While veterans in recent years were dying as they waited for care at Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals, the VA has wasted billions of taxpayer dollars on controversial projects across the country, according to government reports and members of Congress. Critics say budget overruns and construction delays on several projects are burning money that could have been used to help more veterans access timely health care, with one lawmaker even comparing the elaborate projects to the Taj Mahal. For example, a massive construction project near Denver mired with problems ran hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and ended up in court over design and contract issues, according to court documents. The joint venture building the medical center near Denver, Kiewit-Turner, estimated the total project would cost more than $1 billion -- almost double the contractual estimate of $583 million. Kiewit-Turner took the matter to court, saying the VA never provided a design for the medical center that could be built for its budget. The court sided with the builder, allowing Kiewit-Turner to walk away from the project earlier this month. Kiewit-Turner and the VA subsequently reached an agreement to resume construction. Judges with the U.S. Civilian Board of Contract Appeals said the total cost of the medical center remains unknown but will be ""significantly in excess"" of the VA's original budget. Various forms of VA mismanagement and changes in the medical center's design contributed to cost overruns and construction delays, according to court documents. During court proceedings, private contractors criticized the VA for including expensive, non-health-related projects within the medical center's design, such as an estimated $82.6 million, three-story glass concourse that would connect different parts of the facility, which included a ""zigzag"" wall to block the sun. ""All of this was aesthetics,"" Paul Blatnak, a private construction manager on the project, said at a court hearing in May. ""Nobody was interested in cleaning up the aesthetics so that we could improve or add to the patient care."" The VA and contractor Kiewit-Turner resumed construction on the medical center Monday, but only after the VA paid the contractor $157 million in owed costs. ""This isn't about building a medical center, but about building a facility where VA can provide high-quality health care to the more than 390,000 Colorado Veterans who have served our nation,"" VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson said last week. GAO official: 'Conflicting direction' caused cost overruns . A 2013 report by the Government Accountability Office found that delays and mismanagement contributed to a total cost increase of $1.5 billion at VA construction projects in Denver, Las Vegas, New Orleans and Orlando. The report said that an average construction delay of 35 months at each project contributed to the cost increases, such as in Las Vegas, where construction was delayed more than six years. Those delays were blamed on changes in local veterans' needs and shifting VA policies, according to the GAO. Lorelei St. James, the GAO director of infrastructure issues at the time of the investigation, told CNN ""conflicting direction"" from the VA has repeatedly caused cost overruns on different projects. As an example, St. James said VA managers have told contractors to wait for equipment before designing specific hospital rooms, but VA's central office or other VA managers have ordered contractors to proceed with designs anyway. These contradictions have caused unnecessary work and extra costs, she said. Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, whose district includes the VA project near Denver, said the agency should be stripped of its authority to oversee major construction projects. ""This is money that is not going to the care of veterans,"" Coffman, himself a veteran, told CNN, adding that some of these medical centers are given unnecessarily elaborate designs, like ""Taj Mahals."" Coffman said the construction problems are deeply rooted in the VA's culture, since these projects have had consistent delays and cost overruns despite different VA managers overseeing construction on different sites. At a hearing before the House VA Subcommittee on Oversight & Investigations in April, a top VA construction official, Glenn Haggstrom, admitted there have been challenges but said the VA has improved its construction process by better defining costs, adding staff and using an online tool to track design changes, along with other reforms. ""VA is moving toward its goal of improving and streamlining our processes to increase access to our veterans and their families,"" Haggstrom said in his testimony. The GAO report additionally found in 2014 that the rent the VA paid for 31 leased outpatient facilities increased by a total of $34.5 million primarily due to VA delays and project changes, among other issues. The VA will have to pay these extra costs annually for each of the properties' 20-year leases, according to the GAO's report. Additionally, the VA's Office of Inspector General found the VA could inappropriately handle $795 million worth of service contracts in the next five years if its contract management processes do not change, according to a report released this year. Wind turbine debacle . One of the VA's green energy initiatives has also been a source of spending controversy. The VA hired the firm JK Scanlan Co. to build an energy-saving wind turbine in 2009 at the VA hospital in St. Cloud, Minnesota -- for a price of $2.3 million. The project was completed in 2011, but it was shut down the same year due to oil leaks, and although a litany of repairs was ordered, a variety of technical issues caused the turbine to sit idle for years. In October of this year, the VA terminated its contract with JK Scanlan, the company overseeing the turbine, and said it will seek to recover the wasted costs. A 2014 report released by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Oklahoma, argues the VA has misused or mismanaged billions of dollars on initiatives ranging from lavish employee trips and conferences to faulty IT systems and call centers that handle just a few calls a day, among other programs. Some of the specific expenses Coburn highlighted as wasteful include $489 million spent on ""office makeovers"" in less than five years, $5 million spent on unused computer software between 2006 and 2011, and even $50,000 spent on the production of a parody of the movie ""Patton."" Coburn's report also criticized the VA for maintaining and renovating unused buildings, such as a historic monkey house on the property of the VA medical center in Dayton, Ohio. ""Even a small amount of waste in the way VA has contracted for each facility could easily mean over a billion dollars in taxpayer dollars lost that could have paid for veterans' essential medical care,"" Coburn's report said. Congressman: Management is the problem, not money . The VA's budget has grown from about $114 billion in 2010 to about $154 billion in 2014, but a CNN investigation found veterans were dying while waiting for care despite this increase in funding. A VA internal audit this year found extreme delays in patient care and scheduling issues were systemic throughout the department. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned as a result. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, told CNN delays in care at VA hospitals cannot be attributed to lack of money since VA has left hundreds of millions in health care funding unspent each fiscal year since 2010. ""VA doesn't have a money problem, it has a management problem,"" Miller said, explaining that Congress has repeatedly passed legislation to increase VA resources, yet problems have persisted. In August, President Barack Obama signed into law a bill that provided the VA with an additional $16 billion to hire more VA doctors and nurses, open mobile clinics and enable more veterans to obtain private medical care. A VA audit released in December showed more than 13,000 appointments still had wait times longer than 120 days. Secretary Robert McDonald, who began leading the VA this summer, has vowed to reform the agency and uphold patient care as its top priority. ""I'm convinced that our comprehensive reforms will enable us to better meet the needs of our Veterans because we will be looking at everything we do through their eyes. We owe them nothing less,"" McDonald said in a November press release.","VA critics say project cost overruns and construction delays are burning money .

"Traveling these routes inspires wonder and awe in those willing to shrug off the discomforts and heart-in-mouth moments that they entail. Whether you're gazing through a dirt-smudged window on a clapped-out bus, its engine revving desperately to clear a narrow pass, or grinding through an endless expanse of sand in a 4WD, these roads have gained a reputation for being among the most brutal in the world. If you long for white-knuckle adventure, sometimes it really is more about the journey than the destination. Lonely Planet: Top sights of the Islamic world . Canning Stock Route, Australia . Crossing the historic Canning Stock Route through Australia's rugged red sand wilderness is a modern-day explorer's dream. One of the world's most remote tracks, the dust-tinged, take-no-prisoners toughness of this 1,820 kilometer old drover's trail is tempered by the opportunity to meet the traditional owners of this isolated land. The Tjurabalan, Ngurrara, Martu and Birriliburu of the Western Desert still live along, and are the custodians of, the route. The chance to interact with these Western Desert communities and visit rock-art sites that date back tens of thousands of years is an enriching glimpse into the fascinating culture of this region. Where: Running from Wiluna to Hall's Creek in Western Australia. When: The cooler months of May to September. Headless horseman and other frights . How: You can begin at either end and the route takes at least 18 days to complete. There are five communities with fuel and supply amenities along the way but for much of the journey it really is simply just you and the sprawl of the Australian desert. Understandably then, navigating the Canning Stock Route independently requires a lot of pre-emptive planning and a permit must be obtained before travel. As well as a 4-wheel-drive vehicle, you'll need to carry all the necessary equipment, supplies and spare parts in case of breakdowns and emergencies. The track is not maintained (although it is signed clearly) and there are hundreds of sand dunes to navigate. Prior desert driving experience and mechanical ability are mandatory for anyone contemplating a journey here. An extremely helpful booklet on preparing for and driving the route is available to download on the Four Wheel Drive Australia website. Karakoram Highway, Pakistan and China . A centuries-old trading trail, which once formed part of the famed Silk Road, the Karakoram Highway (more commonly referred to as the KKH) is the world's highest altitude paved international road. Its 1,200 kilometers slice through the mighty Karakoram Range, passing through remarkable mountain scenery and providing access to top-notch trekking and mountaineering. Blasted through one of the most challenging landscapes on earth, the KKH is a triumphant feat of engineering and a monumental reminder of the more than 1,000 lives lost during its construction. A journey here, in the rooftop of the world, is not only a stunning salute to the power of nature but also of man's constant struggle to contain it. Where: From Abbottabad (near Islamabad) in Pakistan to Kashgar in China. When: Spring (May to June) and early autumn (September to October). Parts of the road are closed during winter due to snowfall and sometimes in summer because of landslides caused by the monsoon. The Sost/Tashkurgan border post along the KKH officially closes between 31 December and 1 May each year but, depending on weather, the annual reopening can be delayed. If you're intending on traveling in early May it's worthwhile checking beforehand. How: Public transport between the main towns on the KKH is cheap and plentiful and many travelers take two to three weeks to cover the full route, allowing time to stop off and explore. Wherever you begin your journey, you'll need to acquire visas for both countries before you set off along the route as they aren't issued on the Sost/Tashkurgan border post that straddles either side of the Khunjerab Pass. Road conditions deteriorate on the Pakistan side and the word 'highway' should be used in its loosest sense. However, the entire road is being overhauled (the Chinese portion is already finished) with an extensive program of road works for the Pakistan section being funded by the Chinese. Eventually this will mean that the road will be open year-round. Travelers should be aware that rebuilding of the section of the KKH that runs through Pakistan's upper Hunza Valley is still ongoing after the 2010 landslide which created a lake submerging 22 kilometers of road. At the moment this portion of the route is navigated by boat. Lonely Planet: Vanishing history: the most intriguing lost cities . North Yungas Road, Bolivia . Well, it's not nicknamed Camino de La Muerte (Death Road) for nothing. Bolivia's infamous route from La Paz down into the rainforest-clad Yungas region is a dizzying descent of terrifyingly tight turns flanked by sheer cliff on one side and dramatic drop-offs on the other. Notorious for traffic accidents (an estimated 200 deaths used to occur on the 69 kilometer route annually), the Bolivian government completed a series of road modernizations in 2007, building an entirely new branch that bypasses much of the original tract. Despite (or perhaps, because of) the road's infamy, the old route has become a tourist attraction in its own right. Where: From La Paz to Coroico . When: Due to safety considerations, it's best to avoid the rainy season from mid-December to early March. How: For anyone who wants to experience the heart-in-mouth palpitations of the North Yungas Road, the best (and safest) option is the Death Road Cycle; a hurtling, adrenalin-junkie ride down twisting bends. With the opening of the modernized bypass in 2007, cyclists no longer have to worry about the extra danger of dodging trucks and buses as they rush headlong down the narrow ridge chiseled out of the mountainside. The hundreds of tiny crosses scattered along the route are a sobering reminder of the many lives this road has claimed in its perilous history. The road ends at Coroico, a 1,100-meter drop in altitude from the high Bolivian altiplano at its start. Coroico is a popular starting point for further adventures in the Bolivian Amazon and most travelers spend at least a night here before moving on to Rurrenabaque. Manali-Leh Highway, India . Flanked alternately by vistas of staggering snow-capped mountains and arid high-altitude plains this winding 490 kilometer route is one of India's most beautiful. Traffic along the Manali-Leh Highway ascends and descends through nail-biting mountain passes, fording across streams and glacial melts, which results in some seriously hair-raising moments but also some of the most incredible photographic opportunities the subcontinent can offer. Where: Beginning in Manali (Himachal Pradesh) and ending in Leh (Ladakh). When: Only open during the summer, approximately from June to mid-October. How: Due to snow cover, the highway is only traversable for roughly four months of the year. The cheapest way to travel along the route is by bus, with both public and private transport operators running regular transport along the route during this time. The main public bus company is HPTDC and seats on their buses should be reserved a couple of days in advance. With the highest pass along the route measuring a whopping 5420 meters above sea level, the bus journey is staggered over two days, with an overnight stop usually spent in the town of Keylong which alleviates your chances of suffering AMS (Acute Mountain Sickness). Shared taxis are also plentiful but best avoided: completing the journey in a dizzying long haul of 16-18 hours, known as the 'Cannonball Run', is not only tough on your body due to the altitude, but also leaves you no time to contemplate the scenery. Lonely Planet: Best 'middle of nowhere' places . Trans-Sahara Highway, Algeria, Niger and Nigeria . The ultimate desert adventure. Running for a mammoth 4,500 kilometers through three countries, driving the Trans-Sahara Highway is a test of mettle and guts which attracts the brave, the foolhardy and the crazy. Although plagued by security risks along some sections, the bigger danger is in going head-to-head with one of the world's most intensely harsh environments. Adventure-seekers may covet traveling this route for the all-out kudos involved but its real attraction is the opportunity it affords to savor the Sahara at its most spellbinding. Where: Algiers (Algeria), via Niger, to Lagos (Nigeria). When: The cooler months of November to February. How: This isn't a trip to be undertaken lightly. You'll need a 4WD, extensive desert driving and mechanical experience, and you must be self-sufficient in supplies and equipment. You'll also have to jump through several bureaucratic hoops in order to get the paperwork and visas necessary for this kind of expedition. Anyone contemplating a trip here should be aware that travelers with their own vehicle are required by Algerian law to hire a local escort in Southern Algeria and that the Algeria-Niger border is often closed to foreigners due to instability in northern Niger. The Trans-Sahara Highway itself is in much better condition these days. The road is sealed all the way through Algeria and Nigeria and most of Niger with only one 150-kilometer stretch from the Algeria-Niger border post to Arlit in Niger being a hard sand surface. For the most recent developments and up-to-date advice on driving the Trans Sahara Highway, travelers should check the Sahara Overland website.

"Diane Butrym doesn't fit the stereotype of an eating disorder patient. She's a 51-year-old microbiologist and mother of two, not a troubled teen or 20-something, yet for the past decade she has struggled with bulimia. Butrym's problem began in 2002, which was an eventful year for her. That March she was diagnosed with breast cancer, and in October, after a successful course of treatment, she was struck by a car in a crosswalk on her way home from work, sustaining multiple ankle and knee injuries that required surgery. She had always been slim and athletic, and exercise was her outlet for stress. Sidelined with her injuries, Butrym began sharply restricting her calorie intake so she wouldn't gain weight, and before long she was binging and purging. The cycle started to feel addictive; it gave her much-needed pleasure and also eased her stress. ""I was really angry about what was happening, and I didn't know any other way of getting rid of my anger,"" says Butrym, who lives in Schenectady, New York. Butrym's case is hardly textbook. Bulimia and anorexia tend to emerge during adolescence, not middle age, and the disorders are more prevalent among young people. Butrym may not be as exceptional as she seems, however. In recent years, doctors and researchers have begun to look more closely at disordered eating in mid-life. Despite the growing attention, experts say the problem is likely underreported, partly because adult women disguise behaviors such as purging, and partly because eating disorders typically aren't on the radar screen of doctors who care for this age group. ""Eating disorders are still in the closet to a large extent, especially for adult women,"" says Margo Maine, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist in private practice in West Hartford, Connecticut, who specializes in treating the disorders. ""Adult women have such shame about admitting it."" Health.com: Are eating disorders a form of substance abuse? How eating disorders differ in mid-life . Full-fledged eating disorders are rare at any age, affecting fewer than 3% of teenagers and 1% of adults at any given time, according to government estimates. (An overwhelming majority of cases occur in women.) However, a smattering of data from around the world suggests the behaviors associated with bulimia and anorexia may be more common in mid-life than previously believed. The most recent evidence comes from a survey of 1,849 women age 50 and up, the results of which were published last week in the International Journal of Eating Disorders. Eight percent of the respondents reported purging in the previous five years, and 7% said their efforts to control their weight led them to exercise so much that it had begun to interfere with their daily functioning. The survey, which was conducted online, isn't a reliable gauge of how common these behaviors are among adult women in the general population. But the results do provide a glimpse into disordered eating in middle age that rings true with the growing anecdotal evidence, the researchers say. ""My gut says this is pretty on-target,"" says Cynthia Bulik, Ph.D., the lead researcher of the survey and the director of the eating disorders program at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. What's driving these women to purge or work out excessively? Although the survey didn't examine this question in detail, a majority of the survey respondents said they felt dissatisfied with their bodies -- a hallmark of eating disorders across all age groups. Indeed, previous research suggests that many of the factors that underlie eating disorders in young people may contribute to similar problems in older populations. According to a 2008 study in the Journal of General Psychology, the most common drivers include stress, depression, perfectionism, and social pressure to be thin, in addition to body dissatisfaction. Health.com: How to help someone who's depressed . Butrym's story is unusual in that most middle-aged women with eating disorders do not become ill for the first time as adults, Mainesays. But there is some evidence that certain stressful experiences that are more common in middle age -- such as divorce, the death of a spouse, or medical scares like Butrym's -- may help trigger, or reawaken, an eating disorder. Weight gain and body changes related to aging likely play a role as well. As menopause approaches, metabolism slows and estrogen production drops, causing shifts in fat distribution that can lead to a thicker middle, even for women who are eating healthy and exercising regularly. Most women gain eight to 10 pounds during the transition through menopause, which could aggravate any predispositions for disordered eating, Maine says. An epidemic of body dissatisfaction . Women like Butrym who develop full-blown eating disorders may simply be the most extreme examples of a widespread fixation on body size among middle-aged women, Bulik's survey suggests. More than 70% of the women in the survey said they were currently trying to lose weight, and 62% said they felt concerns about weight, shape, or eating had a negative impact on their life ""occasionally"" or ""often."" Forty-one percent said they scrutinized their body at least once a day -- by pinching their waist, for example. Frustration with menopause-related weight gain, in particular, shone through in the answers to the survey's open-ended questions, Bulik says. ""A lot of the women said, 'Who stole my waist? Where did my waist go?"" Health.com: Tips for eating healthy during menopause . Maine and Bulik agree that the pressures adult women face at home, in the workplace, and in society are probably making matters worse. The changes associated with menopause are perfectly natural, but they aren't always easy to reconcile with catchphrases like ""30 is the new 50"" or the day-to-day demands of modern life. Many middle-aged women are juggling child rearing and work responsibilities, or caring for aging patients. That can leave little time for planning healthy meals or exercising, at a stage of life when the amount ofexercise needed to maintain one's weight -- let alone drop a few pounds -- goes up. ""As a culture, we live in a very, very stressful time, and for women this is even more so, because our roles have changed so dramatically,"" says Maine, coauthor of ""The Body Myth: Adult Women and the Pressure to be Perfect."" ""We have little time [and] few avenues with which to cope with the stress, and dieting and exercise abuse and weight loss are ritualistic ways for us to manage our stress."" The preoccupation with body size seen in the new survey can take a psychological toll even when it doesn't develop into an eating disorder. Many women who took the survey reported feeling distracted and preoccupied by their weight and shape as they went about their everyday tasks, Bulik says. An often-overlooked problem . Eating disorders are hard on the body, especially over a long period of time. They can be fatal, and even in less dire cases they can lead to serious heart problems, digestive problems, tooth decay, and osteoporosis, which is already a major concern for postmenopausal women. ""We're actually more concerned about the physical consequences for women as they get older, because their bodies just don't bounce back as well,"" Bulik says. ""All of those systems start not being as robust as we get older. ... Add an eating disorder and the risk goes up."" Health.com: When eating healthy turns obsessive . The standard treatment for disordered eating typically includes psychotherapy, as well as counseling about nutrition and eating habits. Women need to be proactive about seeking care, Maine says, since doctors -- and especially primary care physicians -- often overlook problematic eating behaviors in older women. ""There's really a lot of help available, but women have to find it,"" Maine says. ""It's not going to come to them, unfortunately."" A good place to start, she adds, is the National Eating Disorders Association. Butrym sought treatment in 2003. She recovered, but her life stresses snowballed: She failed to receive workers' compensation for her accident injuries, and she wound up losing her job in a hospital lab. She started purging again, and she has cycled out of inpatient and outpatient treatment since then. Butrym is currently in recovery, and going back to school to study public health. ""I'm excited about having a new career and having a new life,"" she says. ""That's what recovery and therapy is all about, ... realizing and seeing that you're more important than that number on the scale, or the number of wrinkles you have. You have more to give people than that superficial life.""","Diane Butrym's eating disorder developed after she was diagnosed with cancer .

"The research engineer's rising career seemed enviable. Shane Todd of Montana was working abroad in Singapore on the latest cell phone and radar technology, coveted by global corporations. Todd was found dead at age 31, however, in his Singapore apartment last June, and his death has become an international controversy that involves local police, the FBI, an independent forensic analysis and, the parents allege, corporate intrigue found on their son's hard drive. Singapore police have been investigating Todd's death as a suicide by hanging. They refer to a pulley system around a toilet and over a door in Todd's flat. His parents, however, say that's absurd and they assert foul play. Shane Todd's suicide note spoke of family events that never happened, they say. The family hired a Missouri forensic pathologist, who said photos of their son's body and the Singaporean coroner's report show a different story: homicide. In the wake of family's revelations about the hard drive, Singapore police on Friday asked the FBI for assistance pertaining to evidence on U.S. soil. The hard drive ended up in the parents' possession when they packed up their son's apartment, and the mother had thought the device was a small speaker for a computer, she said. They later discovered it really was a hard drive, they said. Parents Mary and Rick Todd met with a U.S. State Department representative this week in Washington. The FBI, which earlier said it was watching the case, didn't immediately respond to a request for a comment on the Singapore police announcement. Eric Watnik, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Singapore, said the FBI will comply with the request. ""The request is focused on issues entirely within the United States,"" he said. ""To be clear, the investigation into Shane's death continues to be led by the Singaporean police."" Documents on the hard drive and its login activity suggest their son was working on a project that may have led to his death, his parents say. The circumstances of their son's death have upended the couple's life in Marion, Montana. ""I just fell to the floor and said it couldn't be my first-born son. It couldn't be,"" said Mary Todd, mother of four boys, who learned of her eldest child's death from his girlfriend. Rick Todd, an airline pilot whose wife told him of his son's death right after he flew a long flight, said: ""I just, just screamed in the airport."" Shane Todd worked for the Institute of Microelectronics in Singapore from December 2010 until his resignation last May 2, the government research institute said. He is believed to have died during the overnight hours of June 22 and June 23, the family said. Though the institute said he was ""thought of highly by his supervisor and peers,"" he disliked his job, his parents said. That's another reason why his suicide note is suspicious, his parents said: It thanked his company. The note also spoke of his family drinking Shirley Temples on a beach -- an event that never occurred, they said. ""When I read the note I handed it back to the officer and I said my son may have killed himself, but he did not write this note,"" Mary Todd said of meeting with authorities in Singapore last year. The couple also found no evidence of a pulley system: there were no pulleys or holes in the ceramic walls in the bathroom, Mary Todd said. Shane Todd's apartment appeared as if he were about to return to the United States: clean clothes were folded and boxes packed. A plane ticket sat on the table. He also had a new job lined up, the family said. Holding a doctorate in electrical engineering, Shane Todd worked for his prominent employer, helping to develop faster, more powerful semiconductors by using the compound gallium nitride. In his last months, Todd expressed stress about his work and even fear for his life, his family said. He wondered if his work might be illegal or a risk to U.S. national security, his parents said. After his death, Todd's parents found that his hard drive contained a proposal between the Singapore outfit and a prominent Chinese telecom firm, Huawei, to build a powerful amplifier using gallium nitride technology. The Todds showed the documents to CNN. Huawei has been at the center of controversy. It and another Chinese telecom company, ZTE, were cited last October by the U.S. House Intelligence Committee, which said the two firms ""cannot be trusted to be free of foreign state influence and thus pose a security threat to the United States and to our systems."" That comment referred to the firms' business practices, and the committee report said, ""the United States should view with suspicion the continued threat of the U.S. telecommunications market"" by the Chinese companies. Huawei rejected the committee report, calling the findings ""baseless."" In reference to the proposal found on Todd's hard drive, Huawei and the Institute of Microelectronics in Singapore insisted they had no such project or even a business relationship, though they acknowledged preliminary talks. Nothing became of those talks, they said. ""There is speculation by the Todd family that Shane's death was related to a project undertaken by IME with Huawei. Neither IME nor Shane was involved in any classified research project,"" IME said in a statement. ""The research and development carried out in IME is to advance economic growth for Singapore and deliver on healthcare and social benefits,"" it said. IME isn't commenting further because Todd's death is under police investigation. ""IME has cooperated fully with the authorities and will continue to do so,"" the institute said. Huawei spokesman Scott Sykes said that gallium nitride, or GaN, technology improves power amplifier efficiency and is ""widely recognized as a key technology for next-generation wireless base stations."" ""IME approached Huawei on one occasion to cooperate with them in the GaN field, but we decided not to accept, and consequently do not have any cooperation with IME related to GaN,"" Sykes said in a statement to CNN. The Singapore police have said they received ""no response"" from the Todd family to share evidence, including the hard drive. ""If they were not comfortable handing evidence in their possession to the Singapore Police Force (SPF), they could seek the FBI's help to review the evidence,"" a spokesman said. ""As there has so far been no response to this request, SPF has sought the FBI's assistance to engage the family and for FBI to examine the evidence."" On February 20, Singapore police told the Financial Times that they had already examined the hard drive. The couple, however, doubts that because the police description of the drive doesn't match the one they found in their son's apartment, they said. The drive shows someone accessing it for only three minutes the night their son died and then again four days later, right before the parents visited his apartment for the first time, the parents said. A forensic analysis of the drive shows someone reviewing, creating and deleting files during those two access events, the family said. That forensic analysis was conducted by a computer expert, the family said. Singapore officials have invited the Todds to a coroner's inquest, scheduled to be held sometime this month. The parents aren't saying whether they would to return to Singapore. Meanwhile, Max Baucus (D-Montana), chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said his staff has met with U.S. Embassy and Singaporean officials in Singapore, and he has spoken with White House officials ""to ensure this issue on their radar,"" a spokeswoman said. Rick Todd had pictures taken of his son's body when it was returned to the United States. The photos show bruises on Shane Todd's hands and a lump on his forehead, which the independent forensic pathologist said showed a fight, the parents said. The back of Shane Todd's neck was cut, the family said. Shane Todd most likely was strangled by a wire, the pathologist told the family. Bruises also indicated that Shane Todd was trying to squeeze his hands under the wire, the family said. There was little fluid in his lungs; hanging typically takes several minutes making the lungs heavy with fluid, the pathologist told the parents. ""It's hard,"" Rick Todd said. ""Every time I open those pictures, it's difficult. ""But we will go to the ends of the Earth to see justice is done,"" he said.

"(CNN)Scores of people have been killed in worsening violence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo's eastern region, leaving the local population in urgent need of aid, according to the United Nations and Human Rights Watch. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Friday it had credible reports that at least 256 people, including children, had been killed in ax and machete attacks since October in the Beni area of North Kivu province. ""Multiple attacks over the last three months have caused widespread fear and displacement. We are appealing for humanitarian access to help people in distress,"" UNHCR spokesman Adrian Edwards told reporters in Geneva. On Tuesday, Human Rights Watch also sounded the alarm, saying its interviews with victims and witnesses indicated unidentified rebel fighters had killed at least 184 civilians -- though the actual number is likely significantly higher -- and injured many others in attacks on villages in Beni territory. About 88,000 people have been forced from their homes in Beni and the surrounding area, with some finding shelter with families while others seek sanctuary in schools or churches, UNHCR said. The violence has also spread northward into Orientale province, the agency said. Meanwhile, more attacks have been threatened, prompting frightened villagers to flee again toward larger towns and cities, the UNHCR said. 'Constant fear' ""The survivors and the displaced live in a desperate situation and in constant fear. They remain at risk of new attacks and have had no respite for the past three months. They have little protection against violence and have received hardly any assistance,"" Edwards said. People need shelter, basic aid items, clean drinking water and access to health services and schools, he said. Aid projects have been suspended because of the violence, of particular concern where disease is already rife. The UNHCR called on the government to protect civilians and ensure humanitarian organizations safe access to Beni and the surrounding areas. Human Rights Watch urged government forces and the U.N. peacekeeping force in DR Congo, MONUSCO, to work together to restore stability and to identify those behind the violence. ""Large-scale rebel attacks occurring nearly weekly have terrorized residents of Beni and left them uncertain where to seek safety,"" said Ida Sawyer, senior Congo researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""UN and Congolese forces need to urgently coordinate their efforts and improve protection of civilians in Beni."" Killings, rights violations . Human Rights Watch cited U.N. and Congolese army officials as saying they believe the recent attacks were carried out by the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan-led Islamist rebel group that has been active in Beni territory since 1996. Beni is located near the border with Uganda. In mid-October, MONUSCO chief Martin Kobler called for ""decisive joint military actions"" by the U.N. peacekeeping force and the DR Congo's military to ""start as soon as possible in order to relieve the population from the terror imposed by the ADF, once and for all."" ""This sequence of violence, killings, assassinations, and human rights violations in Beni territory needs to stop immediately,"" he said, speaking after a visit to Beni to pay tribute to the victims of previous suspected ADF attacks. Radio Okapi, a radio network operated in DR Congo by MONUSCO and the Fondation Hirondelle, a Swiss nongovernmental organization, quoted Gen. Jean Baillaud of the MONUSCO force as saying Wednesday that it must do more to protect local people as it combats ADF rebels in the Beni area alongside the DR Congo military. Baillaud acknowledged that the U.N. force could improve in terms of coordination and the swiftness of its response. He said political efforts, not just military, were also needed to resolve the situation. The eastern part of DR Congo has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals following the genocide there. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report.","UN refugee agency says it has credible reports of at least 256 deaths since October .

"Pakistani security forces said they killed several Taliban insurgents in and around Peshawar on Saturday, four days after Taliban gunmen massacred scores of children the northwestern city. At least five militants, including a key commander, were killed Saturday in a battle between security forces and militants in the Mattani area of Peshawar, sources said. In addition, at least two suspected militants and two police officers were killed in Charsadda, a suburb of Peshawar, sources said. On Friday, the Pakistani military said it killed 32 militants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of which Peshawar is the capital. A military statement didn't specify whether any of those killed were Taliban members or whether the ambush was linked to Tuesday's deadly school attack, in which 145 people, including 132 children, were killed. The school massacre prompted widespread revulsion across Pakistan. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif responded by announcing an end to a moratorium on the death penalty in terrorism cases. The Pakistani Taliban, known as the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, said they targeted a school, which mostly admits soldiers' children, because the students aspired to follow in their fathers' footsteps and target militants. They also said it was revenge for the killing of hundreds of innocent tribesmen and their children during a recent offensive by Pakistan's military. The Pakistani army has been conducting a ground offensive aimed at clearing out Taliban and other militants in the loosely governed tribal areas of northwestern Pakistan. The campaign has displaced tens of thousands of people. Drone strike kills five in North Waziristan, sources say . In one of those tribal areas Saturday, a drone strike killed five suspected militants, including someone who might be a high-value target, Pakistani intelligence sources said. Missiles stuck a compound in the Datakhel region of North Waziristan, killing the suspects, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The suspects' identities had yet to be confirmed, and the sources didn't say which group or groups the militants represented. North Waziristan is one of the northwestern Pakistan tribal areas bordering Afghanistan that have long been a base for anti-government militants. Other militant groups condemn Pakistani Taliban's school attack . The Pakistani Taliban, which have close ties with their namesake in Afghanistan, have long taken credit for an extensive list of assaults on civilians and security forces in Pakistan. The attack on schoolchildren, however, was repellent even in the eyes of other militant groups in the region. A spokesman for the Afghan Taliban condemned the Peshawar school attack because it involved the ""deliberate killing of innocent people, women and children."" Osama Mehmood, a spokesman for al Qaeda's affiliate in India, similarly condemned the attack, blasting it as being against Sharia, or Islamic law. ""Our hearts are tearing apart with pain at the killing of innocent children,"" he said in a statement. ""The fighters of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent condole the death of these children. Our target is not innocent civilians, women and children, instead we are responsible for their protection.""","Security forces: At least five militants and two suspected militants are killed Saturday .

"Dallas (CNN)It has been almost one year since Corey Knowlton bid $350,000 for a hunting permit issued by the government of Namibia to hunt an endangered black rhinoceros. He hasn't gone on the hunt and it's still not entirely clear if he will ever shoot the animal. The controversial auction, held inside the Dallas Convention Center on a chilly Saturday evening in January, sparked a contentious debate over the best way to protect the species that has been brought to the edge of extinction because of humans' appetite for its horn, which is used for daggers, ornaments and, in Asia, traditional medicine. The auction became so heated that both Knowlton and the auction organizers feared for their safety after receiving strings of death threats that were investigated by the FBI. The Dallas Safari Club sponsored the auction, and billed it as a fundraising effort to help save the endangered species in Africa. Biggame.org and Knowlton said the auction was done in the name of conservation, to save the threatened black rhinoceros.  All proceeds were to be donated to the Namibian government and earmarked for conservation and anti-poaching efforts, according to club officials and the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism. Animal welfare groups strongly oppose the auction's conservation approach, and call the ""kill it to save it"" rationale misguided and outrageous. In spring, Knowlton applied for a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that would enable him to import the ""trophy"" parts of the animal's body at the completion of the hunt in Namibia. The hunt would be organized and overseen by the Namibian authorities. ""In my opinion, I thought it would have happened by now,"" Knowlton told CNN in an exclusive interview, when asked if he was surprised that the permit process has taken so long. Knowlton said he is waiting to see what will happen with the permit request before he makes his decision whether to move forward with the hunt. ""Namibia wants us to come and participate in the hunt desperately,"" Knowlton said. ""The entire point of the auction in the United States was to be able to import the carcass, the remains of the black rhino into the United States. That's why they had the auction here, in the hopes that it would bring more money to conservation than the previous permits they have sold in Namibia."" In addition to importing the rhino ""trophy,"" Knowlton also plans to distribute the rhino meat to Namibian villages after the hunt. The Endangered Species Act requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to determine that the import will enhance the species' survival and not be ""detrimental"" to the survival of the species.  The act also requires that any federally authorized activity may not jeopardize the continued survival of the species in any way. ""The service looks closely at the individual circumstances of each import application, including the biology of the species, its current status in and beyond the country where the hunt will take place, and the threats it may be facing, as well as the overall management program for the species in that country, where the funds for the hunt will go and how they will be used,"" said Gavin Shire, chief of public affairs for the U.S. Fish And Wildlife Service. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said it received over 15,000 public comments opposing the permit in the 30-day allocated comment period on its federal register, which closed on December 8.  Many of the comments were ""identical or near identical form letters arguing to 'save the last of the black rhinos ... from American trophy hunter's greed and vanity.' "" Shire said all the comments will be ""examined for substantive information,"" and was unable to provide a time frame for when the service will make a decision on the permit. Helping or hurting the species? Animal conservationists estimate there are  5,000 black rhinos in the world, about 2,020 of which are in the southern Africa nation. They are considered a ""critically endangered species"" by wildlife organizations around the world. 5 white rhinos left in the world . Dr. Michael Knight, chairman of the International Union for Conservation of Nature African and Asian Rhino Specialist Groups, said the Namibian black rhino populations have been performing very well, growing at a very healthy 7% per year, thanks to conservation efforts. ""In population terms it's of minor significance, as we are talking about one old bull that would have contributed genetically to the rhino population already. In monetary terms, it's important as it generates funds that go directly into the Wildlife Products Fund that feeds 100% back into rhino conservation,"" Knight said. Knowlton stressed that the rhinos picked for hunting have no benefit to the population at large, and are in fact ""a detriment to the population."" ""The animals chosen are earmarked ... at the end of their life.  They are not going to help the enhancement of the black rhino species in any way. This way there is a chance that the death of that animal helps the entire species."" Knowlton said by raising money from hunters like himself, the Namibian government can use the money for much needed ""anti-poaching"" resources and ""habitat enhancement."" But sacrificing one animal for the greater good of the endangered species is a move that critics and animal conservation groups call ""perverse"" and a ""sad joke."" ""They need to be protected, not sold to the highest bidder,"" said Jeffrey Flocken of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. ""It's a farce to say that this is being done for conservation,"" Flocken said. ""It's saying the rarity of this animal is worth more dead than alive."" Several groups such as Flocken's argue it would be better to use these rhinos to promote wildlife viewing and ecotourism by charging people for the experience of seeing one of these ancient beasts up close in the wild. ""It also sends a dangerous message that these iconic and disappearing animals are worth more as dead trophies to be mounted and hung on a wall in a Texas mansion than living in the wild in Africa,"" Flocken said. Namibia was the first African country to incorporate protection of the environment into its constitution, and said its conservation program has contributed to it having the largest free-roaming population of black rhinos in the world . The Dallas Safari Club obtained the hunting permit from the Namibian government, which would oversee every aspect of Knowlton's expedition.  It's the first time a black rhino hunting permit has been auctioned outside the country. In recent years, the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism, which oversees the protection of the black rhinos, has allowed three permits a year. In a 2013 letter to the Dallas Safari Club, the Namibian government said, ""To hunt a black rhino is not taken lightly by Namibia. ... Only old geriatric bulls, which are marginalized in the population and do not contribute to reproduction, are trophy hunted."" 'It really is a dilemma' The biggest threat to these massive beasts is poachers across the African continent. Rhino horns are lucrative on the black market. In Asia, where there are claims it can treat everything from headaches and food poisoning to rheumatism and cancer, horns can fetch up to $60,000 per kilogram, putting the value somewhere between gold and pure cocaine. In the 1980s, the black rhino population had dwindled to just a few dozen. Conservation efforts have slowly helped increase herd numbers, but poachers are still a threat. Marcia Fargnoli, chief executive officer of the Save the Rhino Trust in Namibia, which works with the government to fight poachers, said the group has tried to persuade the Namibian government to stop issuing hunting permits. But a poor African country like Namibia, where the World Bank estimates the gross per capita income to be less than $6,000, struggles to fund conservation efforts, Fargnoli said. It's difficult for the government to ignore the chance to raise so much money so quickly. ""I really believe every rhino counts,"" said Fargnoli. ""It really is a dilemma. ... But I really struggle to say I'm saving rhinos and then say that one can be hunted."" Knowlton hosts the hunting show ""Uncharted"" on The Outdoor Channel and he also organizes high-end hunting adventures around the world.

"Another Pacific storm is expected to pound the West Coast this weekend and could unleash flash flooding, mudslides and debris flows, just a week after similar rains left widespread devastation. Flood watches and winter weather advisories now exist throughout Oregon and Washington state, and a coastal flood advisory will continue through Monday for the San Francisco Bay Shoreline, the National Weather Service said Saturday. In all, a moisture plume from the China Sea across the Pacific could drop between 4 and 6 inches of rain on the coast and as much as 8 inches in Oregon. The Cascades could receive 6 to 10 inches of new snow, and northern California could experience 3 inches of rain . ""These disturbances, along with their surface cold fronts, are forecast to bring heavy rain for the coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest, with some amounts in excess of 4 inches possible by Sunday morning,"" the National Weather Service said. ""Very heavy snow in the higher mountain ranges could reach 1 to 3 feet with copious moisture being forced up the topography."" As the West Coast front energizes climates across the country, rain and cold could create delays in holiday travel from Tuesday through Wednesday in the Southeast, the Ohio Valley and the Eastern Seaboard's Interstate 95 corridor, CNN forecasters said. A Christmas Eve storm could strike the Great Lakes basin from Minneapolis to Chicago to Detroit, delivering snow showers and freezing temperatures. The storm would taper off by Christmas Day, said CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis. Landslide anxieties . More than a week ago, storms pummeled the Pacific Coast, killing two people in Oregon when trees fell, knocking homes into the sea in Washington state, burying houses in a California rockslide and even spawning a rare tornado in Los Angeles. Power outages struck hundreds of thousands of customers. The weekend warnings of debris flows conjure up a tragedy in March, when a landslide killed more than 40 people in Oso, Washington, about 60 miles northeast of Seattle. Oregon geologists also expressed concern, especially in areas hit earlier by this year's wildfires. ""Landslides will be a reality in future major flood events,"" Bill Burns, engineering geologist with the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries, told CNN affiliate KATU. ""And because Oregon's population is growing, more people, places and property may be at risk."" Holiday travel . The forecast promised a rocky start to next week's Christmas holiday and was immediately posing problems for early holiday travel. ""There's such a headwind that I'm getting terrible gas mileage today,"" Elaine Howard told CNN affiliate KCRA. She drove from Redding, California, on Friday to visit her son in Herald. One upside for travel, though, has been low gasoline prices. The national average on Saturday was $2.43 a gallon, the lowest level in five years and 70 cents lower than last year, AAA said. That price could fall as low as $2.25 by New Year's Day, AAA said. At those prices, AAA is projecting 98.6 million Americans will travel 50 miles or more from home during the year-end holidays, an increase of 4% over last year. ""Lower gas prices are filling stockings with a little more cash to spend on travel this year as travelers are expected to pay the lowest prices since 2009,"" said Marshall L. Doney, AAA president and chief operating officer. Luis Gonzalez told KCRA that such prices were one reason he chose to drive rather than fly his family from Portland, Oregon, to Orange County, California. ""I found the tickets. But it was like $1,500 for four people. So I said, 'Eh, I can go back and forth with the gas in my car,'"" Gonzalez said.","Flood watches and winter weather advisories are now in effect for coastal Northwest .

"(CNN) -- Here's an airline safety video passengers might actually watch. Air New Zealand has published another in its recent series of ""Hobbit""-themed videos, complete with cameos by director Peter Jackson and Elijah Wood, star of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. The slick, 4-minute clip, cheekily titled ""The Most Epic Safety Video Ever Made,"" features costumed figures from the ""Hobbit"" movies cavorting in a mountainous Middle-earth like setting while urging passengers to buckle seat belts, use oxygen masks and so on. Shot in New Zealand, the video also is a not-so-subtle plug for the third and final film in Jackson's ""Hobbit"" trilogy -- ""The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,"" set for worldwide release in December. It's also latest example of a creative push by airlines to make in-flight safety videos more entertaining so that passengers won't ignore them.

"Three more anti-police protesters being sought for allegedly assaulting a pair of New York officers on the Brooklyn Bridge have been arrested, police said Saturday. The assaults occurred one week ago when tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in major cities, including New York, Washington, Boston, San Francisco and Oakland, California. In New York, two police lieutenants were monitoring a large crowd on the Brooklyn Bridge when a man attempted to hurl a garbage can on roadway, police said. The man ""violently resisted"" when the officers tried to take him into custody, with other demonstrators punching and kicking the lieutenants. The protesters also tried taking the officers' police radios and NYPD jackets. The officers were treated for their injuries at a local hospital, police said. The protests started after a New York grand jury declined to indict a police officer in the July death of Eric Garner, who died after the Staten Island officer wrapped his arm around Garner's neck and wrestled him to the ground. Zachary Campbell, 32, was arrested Saturday and charged with riot, resisting arrest, obstructing government administration, said police spokeswoman Sophia Mason. Another protester, Maria Garcia, 36, a Brooklyn resident, was arrested Friday on charges of riot, resisting arrest and obstruction of government administration, according to Mason. Jonathan Oberman, the lawyer for Garcia, told CNN affiliate WABC that Garcia was not on the bridge at the time and that police misidentified her because she is the wife of a suspect. In an email to CNN, Oberman said, ""... our investigation into the allegations, which commenced last night, had enabled us to speak to a number of people who challenged the prosecutor's claim that the woman pictured in the video -- relied on by the police and prosecutor as the basis of the arrest -- was Ms. Garcia."" A third suspect, Robert Murray, 43, also of Brooklyn, turned himself in Thursday and was charged with two counts of assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, inciting riot and obstruction of government administration, Mason said. It's unclear whether Campbell and Murray have lawyers. A fourth suspect, Eric Linsker, 29, who police said allegedly initiated the incident, was arrested last Saturday on charges of robbery, assaulting a police officer, riot, obstruction of governmental administration, reckless endangerment and unlawful possession of marijuana.","New York police arrests five of six people sought in alleged assault on lieutenants .

"Like many parents, Carrie Goldman was thrilled to learn that Britain's biggest department store recently reopened its toy department with a fresh look: dolls and trucks side by side. Instead of organizing toys into color-coded aisles of pink for girls and blue for boys, Harrods' new 26,000 square-foot ""Toy Kingdom"" is broken into six interactive ""worlds."" Looking for costumes, a rocking horse or stuffed elephants? Try the Big Top, which Harrods describes as ""a fairground of circus acts and candy floss, with magicians and jugglers on stage."" In the Odyssey, ""a gigantic space rocket crashes through the floor and a huge sun bursts through the wall in front of an Area 51-inspired space and gadget zone, complete with alien space pods and limited-edition pieces."" For Goldman, a mother of three in suburban Chicago, it's a step in the right direction toward breaking down the gender divide erected at an early age through playtime. She experienced firsthand how those barriers can hurt children and make them feel like they need to change who they are to gain acceptance on the playground. Two years ago, Goldman's 7-year-old daughter came home in tears after classmates teased her for carrying a ""Star Wars"" thermos to school, saying ""Stars Wars"" was for boys. Goldman shared the story on her blog, Portrait of An Adoption, and within a matter of days, the tale of ""Star Wars Katie"" went viral, drawing support from around the world. Her plight didn't just strike a nerve with parents and children -- George Lucas' daughter, also named Katie, and the actor who played Chewbacca also had words of wisdom for Katie based on their experiences getting bullied for somehow being different. The sheer volume of responses compelled Goldman to delve into why so many people could relate to Katie's story. That research culminated in her first book, ""Bullied: What Every Parent, Teacher and Kid Needs to Know About Ending the Cycle of Fear,"" released this month. In it, she explores the subtle and not-so-subtle ways in which society fosters a fear of those perceived as different and what parents can do about it. The negative effects of enforcing gender norms emerged as a prominent theme, including the way girls are often nudged in the direction of princess fantasies and dolls while building blocks and train sets are traditionally boys' toys. It's part of the reason why Goldman saw the move by a large retailer such as Harrods as promising. Removing gender-specific connotations from packaging or displays sends the message to children that they're open to everyone, she said. When stores separate toys into aisles for girls and boys, however, they learn that anyone who deviates from their designated shelves deserves to be ridiculed. ""We can't truly address bullying without talking about the fear of people perceived as different,"" Goldman said. ""If you have a 6-to 8-year-old boy who goes into Harrods and sees 'Star Wars' toys next to other dolls and action figures, maybe it'll make him think differently when he sees a girl with a 'Star Wars' thermos. We could be preventing future bullies by teaching them to be open-minded now."" In the chapter ""Calling on Toy Retailers to Eliminate Gender-Based Marketing,"" Goldman posits that the reason stores segregate by gender is so they can sell more of the same product. If a store carries soccer balls in pink and blue, a mother shopping for her son and daughter can buy one for each. In addition to reinforcing gender stereotypes, the brother and sister no longer need to share, ""eliminating an opportunity to develop their social skills,"" Goldman says in the book. With children returning to school, Goldman's book lands at a time when bullying is front and center in parents' minds. It also comes in an era when the connection between gender norms and bullying is getting increased scrutiny from parents, educators and activists, prompting more direct action instead of just talk. When Lego announced plans to sell a new line of sets packaged in pink boxes and containing busty characters, salons and spas, girl-led activist movement SPARK launched a petition to quash the toys. Restricting train sets to boys and dress-up to girls not only reinforces outdated gender roles but also stifles creativity, said psychology professor Deborah Tolman of the Hunter College School of Social Work in New York and co-founder of SPARK. ""Kids get a lot of ideas early from play about what they can do, what they like and what they can aspire to,"" Tolman said. ""By making those themes gender specific, it leaves out a whole range of possibilities."" Efforts at gender neutral play are not about eradicating the sight of pink or blue from toy stores or necessarily pushing children away from toys traditionally associated with their gender, she said. It's simply a matter of making them feel like all options are open. ""It's about making all these ways of playing part of the human experience. Anxiety about gender has created codes that have nothing to do with how people should be people,"" she said. ""There's nothing wrong with pink. It's the meaning we infuse it with."" Many independent toy stores across the United States have been doing what Harrods is doing for decades. Nancy Stanek was tired of toy shopping for her children and seeing the same limited offerings of Barbies and baby dolls in the girls' aisle and cars and action figures designated for boys. So she opened a toy store in Chicago in 1974 with ""open-ended activities"" in mind: puzzles, games, building blocks, train sets and dolls arranged by theme instead of color-coded aisles of pink for girls and blue for boys. But more than 30 years later, Stanek is concerned by the marketing direction she said some toy manufacturers are pushing on her. She's reluctant to carry makeup sets and spa kits targeted at tweens and doesn't see the point of selling green Rollerblades with a picture of a boy on the box. For that matter, why should she fill her tiny store with pink bicycles adorned with flowers instead of yellow or purple ones that might appeal to boys and girls? ""I am becoming increasingly concerned with how we seem to be veering back into very gender-specific toys and activities,"" said Stanek, who owns four Toys et Cetera locations in the Chicago area. ""It's almost as if we've backtracked. We're pushing little girls into princess dresses and ballerina costumes."" That's not to say her stores don't carry fairy dresses or knights. But she tries to balance it out with costumes of doctors, chefs and pirates that show boys and girls on the packaging. She wouldn't even mind selling green in-line skates as long as the packaging isn't directed at one gender over the other. ""There are a lot of good, responsible manufacturers out there that go out of their way to depict objects in play showing both girls and boys,"" she said. ""I generally opt for the ones that are basically presenting the activity appropriate for both sexes."" Goldman's book also looks at how reducing a woman's value to her physical attractiveness plays into bullying, especially among girls. With makeup kits being marketed to children at younger ages, beauty and body adornment become ways in which children choose bullying targets. ""Toys for girls are overwhelmingly spa kits and princess parties, all these things to beautify themselves with,"" Goldman said. ""There's nothing wrong with wanting to look pretty, but if your reason to look pretty is to please the kids at school, that's where it's a problem."" It's not just an issue for parents of young girls. Cheryl Kilodavis and her son are used to dealing with odd looks and comments from strangers over his affinity for all things pink, including dresses, jewelry and toys. When 7-year-old Dyson's preference for ""pretty things"" emerged at an early age, Kilodavis  struggled with how to handle it. The bumpy road to acceptance prompted her to share her family's story in the picture book, ""My Princess Boy,"" which came out in 2010, stirring a bit of controversy. Kilodavis said she supports him, even though she still has occasional moments of hesitation when he emerges from his room in a red dress. ""As parents, we all want our kids to be happy and to be themselves,"" she said. ""But things get in the way of expression and letting kids choose toys or clothes that express who they are."" In public though, adults seem to have the hardest time accepting it. Just last week, a little girl in the toy aisle told Dyson that he couldn't have the mermaid toy he wanted because ""it's not for boys,"" Kilodavis said. When the girl looked to her mother for guidance, she agreed. ""I think there's a lot more anxiety around it on the parent's side, but we set the example for our kids,"" Kilodavis said. Boys are more likely to get picked on for stepping outside of the box to play with dolls or wear a pink backpack than girls are for playing with cars or wearing jeans, said Tolman, the psychology professor. It only makes matters worse when parents attach negative connotations to boys acting on traditionally feminine tendencies out of fear that they'll be labeled ""gay,"" she said. ""If kids are coming into social situations with more constrained ideas about what boys and girls should be from playing, you can see how that would contribute to the negative reinforcement of ideas about identity and sexuality,"" Tolman said. Well-intentioned parents might feel like they're saving their sons from bullying by pointing them away from traditionally feminine toys or behaviors. But Goldman said that encouraging them to change for the sake of others protects the bully and not the child. ""In the short term, they might protect the child from being taunted, but in the long term, it shows the world that who he really is isn't as important as the status quo,"" she said. ""Those are the kids who are really tormented because they're not allowed to express themselves."" Are you a parent whose child plays across gender lines?

"Federal authorities have accused a New York man of defrauding investors out of millions of dollars and using the misappropriated funds to pay for a lavish lifestyle -- luxury cars for himself and something a bit more unusual for his wife. Authorities say Whileon Chay spent more than $150,000 in order to have his deceased spouse cryogenically frozen. She died in ""in or about 2009,"" according to the indictment. Cryogenic freezing has been portrayed as a way to preserve living or dead people in order to revive them in the future, according to the Cryonics Institute. The indictment, unsealed on Friday in Manhattan federal court, accuses Chay of soliciting more than $5 million from investors in commodities pools, which supposedly were primarily engaged in foreign exchange trading. Chay, 38, lost more than $2 million in commodities trading and in 2011 fled the United States for Lima, Peru, according to a release from the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office. ""Whileon Chay deceived investors about the commodities pools he managed, claiming to be a successful trader when he in fact was losing millions and misappropriating investors' money for his own use,"" said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in a statement. Chay has been charged with mail and wire fraud, which each carry a maximum term of 20 years in prison. He also was charged with commodities fraud, which has a maximum of 10 years. According to Bharara's office, Chay promised investors approximate annual return rates of 24% and claimed that ""[t]here is no risk in this activity."" ""[W]e have never had a loosing [sic] month,"" he told investors, according to the release. The U.S. Commodities Futures Trading Commission had previously sued Chay and his company, 4X Solutions, Inc.","Federal prosecutors accuse Whileon Chay of defrauding investors out of millions .

"(CNN) -- What dare I think about Cuba? My mom left the island to escape the poverty, the racism and the sweltering heat. She left before Fidel Castro's ascent and U.S. politics had hijacked foreign policy. She left before both governments stranded thousands of people on a communist island suffering a punishing boycott. Her departure was not about politics. She was black and poor and looking for an opportunity to study. She was just 14 when she left her family to live with the Oblate sisters, an order of black nuns in Maryland. She never looked back -- because she just couldn't. That's when my family's disconnect from Cuba began. My mom almost never ever spoke about Cuba, not about her culture or her distant family, not about the life before she met my dad, another immigrant, and they had the six of us. For me, and the thousands of people like me who lost touch with Cuba, this is what Thursday's news is about. A president born 10 months before the boycott -- the 10th president during Castro's rule -- has finally given us a chance to see for ourselves what our parents left behind. President Obama is banking on younger Cuban Americans like me to be more open to change than the angry exiles from the first wave of immigration. He also relies on statistics showing six in 10 Americans want the United States to have ties to Cuba. The Cold War has passed, and to some younger people from all walks of life, the issue of Cuba is old news. The anger toward Cuba no longer makes sense. He is letting us get a real look at where Cuba stands today, hoping the anger toward that nation will subside, even as some Republicans hope it will not. I have interviewed people on both sides of that anger -- at the embargo or at Castro, at communism or the limits to any exchange. There is a commonality to their pain: their longing to see and relate country-to-country, family to family. I once interviewed the Latin music stars Willy Chirino and Lissette Alvarez, both Cubans who support the embargo and raged about the traitors who traveled back. Yet they wanted so much to go some day. They wished me well when I followed the Latin rock star Juanes to Havana to cover a massive concert for peace. It was on that trip that, as an anchor for CNN, I was able to walk through crowds of Cubans and sway to their music, which has exported their isolated culture around the world. I felt the bodies of people pushing and laughing and wondering about me and my life -- Cubans limited by circumstances but glad to spend three hours getting a rare view of what's going on outside their island prison. They were warm and friendly, and some had the cocoa black skin of my mom, and our family's curly hair. They didn't talk about embargoes or Cubans in Miami or about Fidel Castro. They wondered how much rock stars made, whether I'd traveled anywhere fun, if I wanted a ride, a meal, a cigarette or a chance to spend time on the Malecon sipping rum. It was my birthday and I felt very much at home. Politics aside, I am so eager to feel that way again. On some level, Obama's move means I can finally share something tangible with the rest of the Latino community. They can go back and touch home base, reconnect with the country of their ancestors, with their culture and way of life, taste the food and chat with the people and celebrate and understand their roots. I had grown up rootless, disconnected from our family, unable to see firsthand what my mother's country had become. The politics of the embargo alarmed me on both sides, even though I had no dog in that fight. The poverty astounded me, the restrictions, how people suffered a universal lack of opportunity. Yet I longed to remove the mystery surrounding the place and people my mother left behind. Now, perhaps, I can. I did meet my mother's family briefly during an earlier trip as a journalist, escaping from the pack and the Cuban minders to sit in their modest white home and hear stories of how they lived. I answered so many questions about my life. It was awkward. The difference in our circumstances was so vast, and we only had a few hours to broach it. I did get to look at their eyes and freckles and cocoa black skin, the curls and the friendliness and the warmth of family ties, to feel familiarity and truly appreciate my Mom. I wished I had been able to grow up around these people. I didn't even speak Spanish anymore, so we could barely communicate. This visit wasn't enough, yet I was uncertain if I could ever get more. Thursday means I can. I can visit my family, do some reporting and writing, visit a church or take a class. I can go to a concert and share a drink. I can even take home some rum. I know the politics are complicated. I haven't forgotten about Castro and the many people I've met here and there who can never forget the past, or the excesses of the present. But the question hovering above all this is not just whether reconnecting our two countries was the right thing to do, it was whether it will expand the cultural, political and personal view that the two have of each other. I think so -- it has for me.","Soledad O'Brien's mother left Cuba at 14, settled in Maryland. She never looked back .

"When Regina Zimmer bid $40 on an abandoned storage unit in Colfax, California, near Sacramento, all she did before the purchase was look at the unit from the outside and hope to find something valuable. But after going through the contents and coming upon a storage ottoman, tape-sealed and with a ""fragile"" sticker on top, she ""had a feeling it wasn't something good."" Zimmer, who went through the unit with her son in November, told CNN affiliate KOVR that ""as soon as we opened it and took the lid off, the smell was horrible."" Inside, she said, there were garbage bags and a stuffed animal. She told affiliate KTXL that she also came upon a red sleeping bag with more bags inside. She called the Placer County Sheriff's Office. Deputies said that while ""investigating the contents of a container,"" they ""discovered the decomposing remains of a fetus or small infant.""

"This autumn sees the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall.  In the world of today, it can be hard to recall that the collapse of Soviet communism left U.S. prestige at a major high. So great was the shift to what was termed Washington's ""unipolar moment"" that some, such as French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine, quickly warned of the dangers of Washington's ""hyperpower"". A quarter of a century on, the United States remains the most powerful country in the world -- certainly in a military sense.  It can still project and deploy overwhelming force relative to any probable enemy. However, Washington is not, to use a term of art in international relations, an all-powerful hegemonic power.  This core fact has been demonstrated repeatedly throughout the last two-and-a-half decades, from Somalia in 1993, Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11, and also most recently to Ukraine and Syria. Since 1989, other hopes and expectations of how the post-Cold War world might look have also been dashed. The vision of a universal order of liberal, capitalist, democratic states living in peace and contentment -- as painted by Francis Fukuyama and others -- has been replaced by a reality in which authoritarian states such as Russia and China appear to many to be in the ascendancy, so-called Islamic terrorism has become a significant international concern, and several unstable countries, including North Korea, have acquired nuclear weaponry. This complex picture is reflected in the multiple challenges confronting the US-led international order today.  To take just one example, following Russia's annexation of Crimea, Washington's relations with Moscow are now more strained than at any time since 1989, yet many of its allies in Europe remain dependent on Russian gas supplies as the continent heads into winter. Meanwhile, the rise of China, which is forecast to imminently surpass the United States as the world's largest economy on purchasing parity terms, is one of the biggest game changers in global affairs since the collapse of the Soviet Union.  This development has potential to be either a growing source of tension with Washington or develop into a fruitful partnership. Growing bilateral rivalry, rather than an increasingly cooperative relationship, is especially likely if Beijing's economic and military power continues to grow rapidly, and its leadership embraces an increasingly assertive foreign policy stance towards its neighbors in Asia. Moreover, terrorism remains a threat to U.S. national interests: more than a dozen years after 9/11, the Obama administration is still engaged in Iraq and Afghanistan to a degree that reduces the ability of the Pentagon to deal with new crises elsewhere.  Meanwhile, the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has collapsed again, and Washington and Pyongyang remain locked in nuclear stand-off on the Korean peninsula. To be sure, the post-Cold War world contains multiple opportunities as well as risks for Washington, including the potential forthcoming agreement of the Trans-Pacific Partnership with around a dozen countries in the Americas and Asia-Pacific that collectively account for about 40% of world GDP. Washington hopes that this will embed U.S. influence in Asia-Pacific and is part of the so-called U.S. pivot to the region. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama also wants to secure in coming months the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the 28 states of the European Union. This would represent the largest regional free trade and investment agreement in history, with the U.S. and Europe accounting for more than 50% of global GDP, and embed Washington's role as guardian of the ""rules of the road"" for international commerce, as an administration trade official put it recently. The fall of the Wall is rightly celebrated. However, it is possible to detect these days -- and not just in Washington -- a certain nostalgia for what is sometimes seen as the greater ""strategic stability"" of the ""simpler"" bipolar era that preceded it. Indisputably, there are a range of significant, complicated challenges to the U.S.-led order today that were not fully anticipated by many, including Fukuyama, when Soviet Communism collapsed.  However, rose-tinted recollections for a Cold War-era need to be put in the context of that fact that the period of U.S.-Soviet rivalry from 1947 to 1989 also had some exceptionally dangerous moments. Perhaps the best example is the Cuban Missile Crisis which was probably the time that the world came closest to nuclear annihilation. More generally, while the U.S. and the Soviets did not formally engage directly in war, there were multiple proxy battles fought across the world with destabilizing consequences -- far from their borders but deadly to those caught up in them. Taken overall, despite all the challenges that Washington faces today, the country will remain, for the foreseeable future, the primary actor in many theatres across the world.  While its relative power may erode, it will seek to continue set the international agenda in the political, economic and security spheres and succeed in doing so more often than any other state. However, U.S. success in managing the complexity of global affairs will also increasingly depend upon the cooperation of others, both competitors and allies. And a key uncertainty here is the direction of the bilateral relationship in coming years, with a rising China which could be a force for greater global instability and tension, or much deeper, collaborative strategic partnership.","In wake of fall of Berlin Wall, United States' prestige was at a major high .

"People in cars and on bikes whizzed by Moustafa Mohamad as he sat on a sidewalk in Washington one day not so long ago. Commuters poured out of the Dupont Circle Metro station and rushed by on their way to school or work. Tourists rumbled by on a double-decker bus. Mohamad hoped some of them paused to take notice of him. He hoped that somehow his presence on the sidewalk would help relatives and friends nearly 9,400 miles away, in his hometown -- the besieged Syrian city of Kobani. That city near the Turkish border has been the site of intense fighting for weeks between ISIS extremists and Kurdish forces backed by fighter jets and bombers from the United States and other countries. Mohamad longed to do what he could to help his fellow Kurds -- even from a great distance, in the relative safety of America. For a few recent weeks, that meant he sat on a sidewalk, refusing to eat and surrounded by signs. ""America: Support Kurdish boots on the ground,"" one sign said. ""Stand up for freedom before it's too late,"" read another. A third told people how long he had been on hunger strike. ""I felt it was my duty to undertake this hunger strike to share the pain and suffering of the people of Kobani with the people of America,"" he said from his perch on an overpass above Connecticut Avenue, strategically chosen for its foot traffic and proximity to a Starbucks. The 51-year-old Kurdish activist came to the United States in 1999 after seeking asylum from Syria. Mohamad had been a member of the Syrian parliament before he fled out of fear of becoming a target of political violence. He now lives in Denver, where he works at a pastry shop, with activism occupying all of his free time. On the sidewalk . The 15th day of his hunger strike began like most others before that. Though it had been more than two weeks since he had eaten solid food, he remained in good spirits. He and a supporter, a Kurdish activist from Washington, unfurled banners. Mohamad went to a convenience store to stockpile Gatorade. He unfolded his chair and loaded his sustenance into a large gray cooler bearing a sign that said ""Slavery... abolish it forever!"" Next to him stood a mannequin adorned in the brightly colored, beaded clothing traditionally worn by Kurdish women. At the foot of the mannequin sat yet another sign. This one said ""ISIS Slave Sale: $500.00 for Kurdish Women."" That's a reference to an ISIS practice documented by human rights organizations: Members of ISIS have enslaved and sold women in parts of Iraq and Syria they have captured since their dramatic and bloody ascent. Most of the passers-by in Washington have no doubt heard news of the horrors ISIS has inflicted on people in Iraq and Syria. They may have heard that the terrorists in ISIS have beheaded people and gloated about it in online in gruesome videos. For many of them, what's happening in parts of Iraq and Syria under ISIS control is a daily horror they hear about on the news. For Mohamad, it's personal. Worrying about friends and relatives . Many of his friends and family lived in Kobani when ISIS attacked this year, he said. ""My immediate family, the women and younger siblings, they all left for Turkey,"" he said. ""The able-bodied relatives of mine are fighting."" He said militants kidnapped his nephew and held him for five months, forcing him to watch violent videos. ""He now prays five times a day,"" Mohamad said. ""We feel he has been disturbed but we are lucky to have him."" He said ISIS also held two of his cousins for a time. His accounts are difficult to verify, but there is little doubt that ISIS has kidnapped Kurdish children. Human Rights Watch said in July that ISIS kidnapped 133 Kurdish boys and held them hostage for a month. ""Two of the boys who escaped told the media that ISIS was forcing the children to undergo lessons in Sharia and jihadist ideology, and one of these boys said that ISIS beat the children who misbehaved,"" Human Rights Watch said. A Kurdish teenager told CNN in June that he was among dozens of students abducted by ISIS in May. He said he and the other students were on buses, riding home from school after final exams, when ISIS fighters in pickups stopped them. The boys wound up in an ISIS-controlled city, where they were forced to watch videos of executions and suicide bombings, said the teenager, Mohammed, who asked that his full name not be used for fear of his safety. ""If you try to leave,"" he recalled the militants saying, ""we will cut your heads off."" Yet he said he and three other boys managed to escape after a few days. What can one person do? Thousands of miles away in Washington, Moustafa Mohamad hoped his hunger strike cast a spotlight on the suffering of people like the Kurdish teenagers kidnapped by ISIS. Family and friends encouraged him to try a less hazardous form of protest, but he declined. Instead, he sat and passed out fliers to anyone who would take one and tried to promote an online petition calling for a humanitarian corridor into Kobani. Days turned into weeks. On Day 18, a supporter surprised Mohamad with a rocking chair to replace his weathered folding chair. That brought a grin to his face as he nestled back into his new home away from home, blocking the erratic wind with a placard reading ""Fasting for Kobani."" On Day 19, a Kurdish string duo strummed traditional music. Mohamad tapped his foot in rhythm, seeming to forget about his appetite for a short time. On his 22nd day of hunger strike, Mohamad held strong, exclaiming, ""My stomach has stopped ordering me around!"" His doctor admired his spirit but ordered him to wrap it up. So the next day, surrounded by friends and supporters, Mohamad enjoyed a bowl of lentil soup there on the sidewalk he had occupied for more than three weeks. His hunger strike was over. Did he accomplish anything? Was it worth it?  Did he accomplish anything? Mohamad mulled the question a few weeks after ending his hunger strike. ""In doing what I did, I was not only trying to share the suffering of my compatriots, but also pay homage to the likes of Gandhi and Dr. King, who thought if suffering has to be endured for the social good, the activists should undergo it first,"" he said. A protest like the one he engaged in doesn't lend itself to ""immediate metrics,"" he said, so it's hard to quantify whether his efforts made a difference. ""I may have reached thousands in person,"" he said. A few news organizations told his story. So he reached people that way, too. Did it do anything to help people in Kobani? That's a hard question to answer, he said, but he has no regrets. ""Now that it is over,"" he said, ""I am glad I was able to do my bit for the people of Kobani.""","Syrian Kurd living in U.S. goes on three-week hunger strike on Washington sidewalk .

"Former employees of Sony Pictures Entertainment have filed four lawsuits against the company following a massive security breach. The suits alleged Sony was negligent because it didn't prepare for a massive cyberattack despite warnings and previous security breaches. The two other suits were filed but were not available for inspection Saturday. Michael Corona and Christina Mathis's complaint put the situation in dramatic terms: . ""An epic nightmare, much better suited to a cinematic thriller than to real life, is unfolding in slow motion for Sony's current and former employees: Their most sensitive data including over 47,000 Social Security numbers, employment files including salaries, medical information, and anything else that their employer Sony touched, has been leaked to the public, and may even be in the hands of criminals."" The suits were filed December 15-19. Four are class-action lawsuits, meaning the plaintiffs want the suits to include all other former and current employees affected by the breach, not just themselves. The plaintiffs contend that stored information about former employees was compromised. Forever vigilant . How many people would be included in possible class-action lawsuits is unknown. A complaint by Michael Levine and Felix Lionel said information about 47,000 current and former employees and their family members had been posted online recently because of hacking linked to North Korea. Another complaint estimated 15,000 current and former employees were affected  but said the number could only be determined by company records. Sony Pictures did not respond to a CNN request for a comment Saturday; it declined to comment in a Friday Washington Post story about the lawsuits. The complaint filed by Levine and Lionel says employees and family members ""will have to remain vigilant for the rest of their lives to combat potential identity theft. ..."" Despite efforts to scrub the personal records from the Internet, the information will be ""forever recoverable by anyone who wishes to find them."" The information ""contains the most intimate details of personal and professional lives including ... medical records, Social Security Numbers, birth dates, personal emails, home addresses, salaries, tax information, employee evaluations, disciplinary actions, criminal background checks, severance packages, and family medical histories,"" the complaint says. Suits: Previous hacks occurred . The former employees say Sony should have known the system had a problem because of previous hacks. A breach occurred in January 2011 when hackers made the PlayStation game Modern Warfare 2 unplayable through the PlayStation network, the complaint by Corona and Mathis says. In April 2011, hackers stole millions of user accounts from the PlayStation video game network, their complaint says. The hacker group Anonymous warned Sony of that impending breach weeks in advance, the complaint says, but Sony didn't implement safeguards to protect the system. The company settled a class-action lawsuit over the April 2011 breach for $15 million in games, online currency and identity theft reimbursement, the complaint says. Hackers struck again in August 2014, taking down the PlayStation network and Sony Entertainment Network, the complaint says. Sony has received warnings more recently, according to a complaint by Susan Dukow and Yvonne Yaconelli. North Korea issued warning . North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations warned Sony that release of its movie ""The Interview,"" in which Americans try to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, was tantamount to ""an act of war"" and threatened a ""decisive and merciless counter measure,"" according to their complaint. U.S. seeks China's help against North Korean cyberattacks . Sony executives knew that producing a movie about an attempt on the life of an existing world leader ""would cause a backlash,"" the complaint says. The chronology of the most recent hacking is described in all of the lawsuits. A group of hackers called the Guardians of Peace took over Sony's network on November 24. The hackers displayed their own messages and skeleton image and the words ""Hacked by #GOP,"" said Dukow and Yaconelli's complaint. On November 27, five Sony films, including four that had not been released, were shared online. On December 1, the pre-bonus salaries of the top 17 Sony executives were leaked along with files showing the salaries of 6,000 current and former employees, the suits contend. On December 3, files showing passports and visas of cast and crew members were put online, along with film budgets and confidential contracts. On December 2 and 5, company leaders acknowledged the personal information was compromised, but said they weren't sure how seriously, the Corona-Mathis complaint said. 'Your family will be in danger' Sony announced Wednesday that ""The Interview"" would not be shown in theaters. Two of the four lawsuits ask that Sony be ordered to provide five years of credit monitoring, identity theft insurance and other services. One of the suits seeks $1,000 for each violation of a California law that requires companies to keep medical information secure. All four suits seek unspecified damages and attorney fees. Republicans to theaters: Don't be bullied, show 'The Interview' The FBI says that North Korea is responsible for the cyberattack. An FBI investigation linked the malware, infrastructure and techniques used by the Guardians of Peace in the Sony attack to previous North Korean cyberattacks. The hackers broke into Sony's servers, published private emails and information, and threatened to attack movie theaters screening ""The Interview,"" a comedy film about an assassination plot on North Korea's leader. North Korea denies being responsible. On December 5, employees received an email from the Guardians of Peace saying they needed to support the group by signing their name to an online document, the Corona-Mathis complaint said. ""If you don't not only you but your family will be in danger,"" the email said. Three suits were filed in U.S. District Court in California and one in Los Angeles County Superior Court. No hearing dates were listed.","Sony Pictures faces lawsuits following security breach .

"Miles O'Brien, award-winning science journalist and former CNN correspondent and anchor, revealed in a blog post that his left arm was amputated recently after an accident. ""I wish I had a better story to tell you about why I am typing this with one hand (and some help from Dragon Dictate),"" he wrote. The story is not, he wrote with bittersweet humor, as ""entertaining"" as an ""out-of-control quad copter that turns on its master,"" or perhaps a shark attack or assassination attempt. What led to the loss of O'Brien's arm was a case of TV gear. On February 12, he was stacking cases onto a cart after a reporting trip to Japan and the Philippines, and one of them fell on his left forearm. ""It hurt, but I wasn't all '911' about it. It was painful and swollen but I figured it would be okay without any medical intervention. Maybe a little bit of denial?"" O'Brien wrote. His arm seemed sore and swollen the next day, but didn't appear worse. That night, though, he experienced greater pain and swelling, and the next day asked the hotel where he was to refer him to a doctor. The doctor told O'Brien he may be experiencing acute compartment syndrome. This condition involves increased pressure in a muscle compartment, according to the National Institutes of Health. Muscles in the arms and legs are separated from each other by thick layers of tissue called fascia, and each fascia has space in it, called a compartment, with muscle tissue, nerves and blood vessels. When there is swelling in a compartment, pressure in that area will increase and press on the muscles, blood vessels and nerves. ""If this pressure is high enough, blood flow to the compartment will be blocked,"" according to the NIH's MedlinePlus resource. ""This can lead to permanent injury to the muscle and nerves. If the pressure lasts long enough, the muscles may die and the arm or leg will not work any more. It may need to be amputated."" Symptoms of severe cases of compartment syndrome include skin paleness, numbness, tingling, decreased sensation, weakness and severe worsening pain. Early diagnosis and treatment are key for a good recovery. Amputee pilot: O'Brien could return to flying 'in no time' Patients need immediate surgery, which involves making long cuts through the muscle tissue to relieve pressure. O'Brien's doctor recommended this procedure, also known as a fasciotomy. After entering surgery, O'Brien woke up to learn that his blood pressure had dropped during the procedure. To save him, the doctor had made the decision to amputate just above the elbow. ""He later told me it all boiled down to a choice...between a life and a limb,"" O'Brien wrote. Since then, O'Brien has dealt with ""phantom pain, the vicissitudes of daily life with one hand and the worries about what lies ahead,"" he wrote. But he says he is grateful to be alive and urged readers not to worry. O'Brien, who covered the U.S. space program for CNN, currently lives in Washington and focuses on science, technology and aerospace in his journalistic work, which includes being the science correspondent for PBS NewsHour. His website says he frequently pilots his own airplane to assignments. He ended his blog post poignantly: ""Life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you. Actually, I would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now -- in more ways than one."" Artificial hand lets amputee feel objects .","TV gear case fell on journalist Miles O'Brien's arm .

"EL DORADO HILLS, California (CNN) -- The attorney for Nancy Garrido, charged in the Jaycee Lee Dugard abduction case, expressed concern Wednesday that intense media coverage may prejudice his client's ability to get a fair trial. Phillip Garrido and his wife in 1988, shortly after his release from jail for rape. ""There have been some misstatements made in the media, and possibly very innocent misstatements like, you know, 'She's charged with 29 counts, she was there, therefore she must be culpable,' "" Gilbert Maines told CNN's ""American Morning"" on Wednesday. ""That's good speculation, but any good prosecutor will tell you that they can't prosecute and convict on speculation. ""The media can do that, but the prosecutor can't.""  Watch Maines talk about Nancy Garrido's case » . Nancy and Phillip Garrido have been charged in connection with the kidnapping and rape of Dugard, 29, who police say was abducted by the Garridos in 1991 at age 11.  Dugard grew up in a backyard compound of tents and outbuildings, and gave birth to two daughters, now 11 and 15, fathered by Garrido during her captivity, police said. The Garridos were arrested last week and have pleaded not guilty. Philip Garrido is a registered sex offender. Maines said his client has been charged with ""about half"" of the 29 counts against the couple. He said he has discussed ""what she says happened."" He would not elaborate, citing attorney-client privilege. But, he added, he is still ""trying to establish a line of communication"" with his client. ""We are in the process of formulating any defense that we have, or that we may have,"" he said. ""We are still in the process of investigating this entire thing."" Maines said he was not aware of the case before he was appointed by the court to represent Nancy Garrido. ""I'm sure you understand that this is a horrendous thing for her,"" Maines said. ""I mean I realize it's horrendous for Jaycee and her parents and the children, but my concern right now is that my client get a fair trial.""

"The U.S. government continues to shrink its ranks of Guantanamo Bay detainees, announcing Saturday that four more have been repatriated -- this time to Afghanistan. The Defense Department identified them as Shawali Khan, Khi Ali Gul, Abdul Ghani and Mohammed Zahir. The U.S. Air Force C-17 carrying them arrived in Afghanistan around 6 a.m. Saturday (10 p.m. ET Friday), Pentagon spokesman Lt. Colonel Myles Caggins told CNN. An administration official told CNN the four detainees are not expected to face further detainment in Afghanistan. In a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul expressed appreciation to the Afghan government -- which, since September, has been led by President Ashraf Ghani -- ""for helping to reintegrate these former detainees."" ""We have full confidence in the Afghan government's ability to mitigate any threats these individuals may pose and to ensure that they are given humane treatment,"" the embassy said. The move was also made to further President Barack Obama's goal of drawing down the number of those held at the U.S. naval base in southeastern Cuba, something that has been ongoing for years. ""This repatriation reflects the Defense Department's continued commitment to closing the detention facility at Guantanamo in a responsible manner,"" said Paul Lewis, the Pentagon's special envoy for the closure of Guantanamo. 132 now being held at Guantanamo . The departures of these four Afghan men means that, as of Saturday, 132 people are still detained at Guantanamo. This is down significantly from the numbers soon after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when the facility widely known as Gitmo was repurposed to hold detainees from the ""war on terror."" The administration of then-President George W. Bush claimed that, since Gitmo detainees weren't held on American soil, they could be considered ""enemy combatants"" and be denied some legal protections. Almost all of the nearly 800 detainees were held without charges. Senate torture report restarts fight on terror policy . This legal limbo, as well as allegations of torture and other mistreatment, spurred criticism of Gitmo. Shortly after his 2009 inauguration, President Barack Obama signed an executive order to close the detention facility within a year. Some worry ex-detainees will engage in terrorism . That didn't happen. One reason was because of strong opposition from lawmakers, many of them Republicans, who cited the risk of freeing men who had fought to kill Americans. About 17% of the 620 Gitmo detainees released -- most of them during Bush's presidency -- went on to engage in terrorist activities, a September semiannual report from the director of national intelligence found. Another 12% are suspected of having engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities. Still, the number of detainees has steadily gone down, including six transferred to the government of Uruguay earlier this month. Four of these were Syrians, one was Tunisian and the sixth was Palestinian, according to Rear Adm. John Kirby, press secretary for the Pentagon. Uruguayan President Jose Mujica said on his website December 5, ""We have offered our hospitality for humans suffering a heinous kidnapping in Guantanamo(.) The unavoidable reason is humanitarian."" U.S. transfers 6 Gitmo detainees to Uruguay . House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, said this and other releases by Obama's administration are dangerous, claiming many nations that receive former detainees aren't up for the job and that these countries don't stop them from rejoining the fight. ""We knew that was going to happen,"" Rogers told CNN. ""That's why those of us who were trying to do the review of this were so concerned, because they were so interested in getting them out, that they forgot to do the due diligence -- I think -- that would allow them to at least protect those that were going to go back into the fight, from getting back into the fight."" Embassy: Transfer shows U.S. supports reconciliation . While they came from many countries, many Guantanamo detainees were captured during the U.S.-led military fight against al Qaeda and its Taliban allies in Afghanistan. It's been rare for them to be sent back there, especially given some diplomatic discord and concerns about the country's security situation. The American military's future in Afghanistan had been uncertain, too, amid contentious talks involving former President Hamid Karzai. The countries signed a security agreement soon after Ashraf Ghani took office. While the U.S. military won't participate in combat operations in Afghanistan, some U.S. troops will remain there into 2015 and beyond as part of the deal. The U.S. Embassy in Kabul expressed hope that the latest transfer can mark ""a step forward in strengthening relations between the two countries and can provide an opportunity for greater confidence among Afghans to engage in political dialogue to end the violence in their country. "" The statement backed an ""Afghan-led reconciliation"" that includes ""all opposition groups, including the Taliban."" ""As part of the outcome of any reconciliation process, the Taliban and other armed groups must end violence, break ties with (al Qaeda) and accept Afghanistan's constitution, including its protections for women and minorities,"" the embassy said. ""This transfer demonstrates U.S. support for such a reconciliation process.""","Spokesman: A U.S. Air Force C-17 flew the ex-detainees to Afghanistan .

"Paris (CNN) -- Flamboyant fashion designer John Galliano was found guilty Thursday on charges of making anti-Semitic comments against at least three people in a Paris cafe. The French court gave him a suspended fine of 6,000 euros ($8,415) in total, but he was not sentenced to jail time. The three plaintiffs were awarded one symbolic euro each in damages. Aurelien Hamelle, Galliano's lawyer, told CNN he was not surprised by the verdict. He said the designer was happy it was all over and wants to put the whole episode behind him. Galliano was not present at the trial because he didn't want to face the media, his lawyer added. Galliano was convicted on charges of making public insults based on origin, religious affiliation, race or ethnicity, related to two incidents at the same Paris cafe, one in February this year and one in October 2010. He must pay a 4,000-euro ($5,620) suspended fine for the incident in February and the remainder for the incident four months earlier, the court ruled. He was also ordered to pay the costs of four anti-racism groups involved in the trial. The designer could have faced up to six months in jail and a fine of 22,500 euros ($32,410), prosecutors said before the verdict. Galliano, who was fired by fashion giant Christian Dior in March after a video surfaced showing him praising Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, testified at the start of the trial in June that drugs were to blame. Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud read out a list of the abuse Galliano was accused of hurling at Geraldine Bloch and Philippe Virgitti in February, including obscenities mixed with remarks about their ethnic backgrounds. ""He said 'dirty whore' at least a thousand times,"" the judge said. Galliano said on the witness stand that he had no memory of making the comments. Asked to explain his ""lack of memory,"" he said: ""I have an addiction. I am currently undergoing treatment."" Galliano's attorney said before the trial began that the designer ""was a sick person, who was suffering from addiction and this is something we are demonstrating through medical evidence, expert reports."" ""We must not judge a man who for 30 years has been dedicated to diversity, who has been a loving person for all races, cultures and religions ... based on 40 minutes where he was sick through alcohol and medication,"" Hamelle said. Galliano testified that he suffered from an increasing workload and that he had had no time to mourn after the 2007 death of his alter ego at Dior, designer Steven Robinson. ""With his death, I found I had no protection,"" Galliano said. His body became dependent on drugs, he said. ""I was taking sleeping pills during the day,"" he testified. ""I've only just discovered since rehab what a lethal mix I was taking."" Bloch testified June 22 that she encountered Galliano on a crowded cafe terrace, which led to an angry exchange. ""I don't remember his exact wording; there were different phrases,"" Bloch told the court. ""It's true that I was angry. I insulted him, too."" Virgitti testified that the confrontation, which he called ""just an argument in a bar,"" began when Galliano sat down next to his party at the cafe. ""He started speaking to us very quickly after arriving,"" Virgitti said. ""He told Geraldine to speak less as she was disturbing him. We didn't know what to do. The situation got worse. He started touching her hair, saying she had no hair. I told him, 'Don't touch her.'"" He acknowledged during his testimony that while Galliano ""said things he shouldn't have,"" the incident ""has been so overly played out in the media."" After the incident in February, Galliano was taken to a police station where a test revealed he had a high level of alcohol in his blood, authorities said at the time. He was later released. The video is from yet another incident. He is not being tried for that incident because the couple involved chose not to press charges. ""I love Hitler,"" Galliano said in a video obtained by Britain's Sun newspaper. ""Your mother, your forefathers would be f---ing gassed and f---ing dead."" Christian Dior condemned his ""deeply offensive statements and conduct."" French law prohibits the incitement of racial discrimination, hatred or violence based on a person's origin or their membership -- or nonmembership -- in an ethic, national, racial or religious group. Galliano apologized after the video was released. ""I only have myself to blame and I know that I must face up to my own failures and that I must work hard to gain people's understanding and compassion,"" Galliano said in a statement. ""Anti-Semitism and racism have no part in our society."" Galliano has kept a low profile since his firing, but Vanessa Friedman, fashion editor of the Financial Times newspaper, said that given time, he could return to the industry. His career is over in its present form, she said. But he could return to Britain, where there is ""residual love for him,"" lay low and make a comeback in a few years, she said. ""People love a redemption story,"" Friedman said. CNN's Saskya Vandoorne and Niki Cook contributed to this report.","NEW: Galliano is ordered to pay the court costs of four anti-racism groups .

"European leaders warned Friday that reports of widespread spying on world leaders by the U.S. National Security Agency have raised ""deep concerns"" among Europeans and could affect the cooperation needed for effective intelligence gathering. ""A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field,"" the leaders said in a joint statement issued at the conclusion of a two-day European Union summit in Brussels, Belgium. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced that Madrid has summoned U.S. Ambassador James Costos over the matter. The U.S. Embassy in Madrid declined to comment, saying that Rajoy's statement stands for itself. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the assertions that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on her and other world leaders had ""severely shaken"" relationships between Europe and the United States, and trust will have to be rebuilt. Germany's Angela Merkel: Relations with U.S. 'severely shaken' ""Obviously, words will not be sufficient,"" Merkel told reporters Thursday in Brussels. ""True change is necessary."" Germany and France intend to seek talks with the United States ""with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field,"" the EU leaders' statement said. Other nations are welcome to join these talks, it noted. French President Francois Hollande, speaking in Brussels, said the aim of the talks would be to establish a joint cooperation framework with the United States ""so we put an end to these practices and ... these monitoring schemes."" Hollande said there is an ""ongoing dialog"" with the United States over its past actions, but the priority is establishing a ""code of conduct"" for the present and future. This is essential because France and its European allies ""cannot accept"" the kind of monitoring which has gone on, whose purpose ""is not just political -- it is mainly an economic issue,"" Hollande said. ""It is relevant to the markets, to the prices, to the mergers and acquisitions. This is where the monitoring may have the highest impact -- on jobs in particular,"" he said. The main purpose of intelligence efforts is tackling terrorism and ensuring security, he said, but no one should have to fear their personal data being used. Meanwhile, Merkel is under pressure to take a strong stance back home, where her conservative party is in negotiations with the Social Democratic Party, known as the SPD, to form a grand coalition government. In remarks quoted Friday by the German newspaper Der Spiegel, SPD chief Sigmar Gabriel criticized the outgoing government's handling of spying allegations made this summer. ""Of course, it is outrageous that an American secret service would tap the chancellor's cell phone,"" Gabriel said. ""I recall quite well, though, that some politicians and, by the way, the media, too, declared the NSA affair as over and done with. We cannot repeat that error."" Gabriel said the SPD would ""vehemently push in the coalition talks for the effective protection, not only of the chancellor's privacy, but just as hard for that of 82 million other citizens in Germany. ""It's about more than just a bugging scandal with the chancellor. It's about freedom and civil rights in the digital age."" At the summit, EU leaders discussed data protection and privacy. 'Lack of trust' Angela Merkel raised the surveillance issue in a phone call with U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday after the German government said it had information that the United States might have monitored her cell phone. On Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney repeated what he had said Wednesday -- that Obama assured Merkel that the United States is not monitoring and will not monitor her communications. He did not say anything about possible past monitoring. The German spying allegation came in the same week that the French daily newspaper Le Monde reported claims that the NSA intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in France over a 30-day period. Der Spiegel reported in June that leaks from government contractor-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden detailed how the agency bugged EU offices in Washington and New York, and conducted an ""electronic eavesdropping operation"" that tapped into an EU building in Brussels. Merkel spoke with Obama by phone in July about allegations that the United States was conducting surveillance on its European allies. The Guardian newspaper -- citing a document obtained from Snowden -- reported Thursday that the NSA monitored phone conversations of 35 world leaders. The confidential memo is from 2006, prior to Obama's election as president. None of the world leaders is identified. Their phone numbers were among 200 handed over to the NSA by a U.S. official, the memo states. It says that the NSA encouraged ""senior officials in its 'customer' departments, such as the White House, State and the Pentagon, to share their 'Rolodexes' so the agency can add the phone numbers of leading foreign politicians to their surveillance systems,"" even though tracking until then had yielded ""little reportable intelligence,"" the Guardian reported. 'Significant challenges' In a USA Today op-ed published online Thursday night, Obama's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco conceded that recent ""disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships."" To address them, the President has ordered a ""review (of) our surveillance capabilities, including with our foreign partners,"" she wrote. ""We want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not because we can,"" said Monaco. Michael Desch, a professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, said this is ""an important piece of evidence that our technological capabilities have far outstripped our thinking about how we should use those capabilities to best advance U.S. national security."" While the allegations of U.S. spying on world leaders will soon drop out of the headlines, Desch said, ""the larger problem of the disconnect between our capabilities and our thinking about how to use them (will) remain for years to come."" He added the diplomatic fallout resulting from the controversy ""should encourage U.S. leaders to ask, even if we have the technical capability to target these leaders, whether it is in our interest to do so.""","Hollande says France and Germany want to set a code of conduct with United States .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Comedienne Joan Rivers says she will ""stand behind"" what she told a paparazzo about not feeling sadness for civilians killed in Gaza. Rivers made her controversial comments at the Los Angeles airport Wednesday when a photographer for Splash News Online asked her about the nearly 2,000 Palestinian killed over the last month since Israel launched military operations in Gaza in response to Hamas rocket attacks. ""When you declare war, you declare war,"" Rivers said. ""They started it. We now don't count who's dead. You're dead. You deserve to be dead. You started it. You started it. Don't you dare make me feel sad about that."" Rivers compared Israel's operations against Gaza to the United States' dropping atomic bombs on Japan 69 years ago.

""The media, as usual, has decided to only quote the most out of context and inflammatory non sequitur rather than giving an accurate account of what my intentions were behind the statement,"" Rivers said.

"(CNN) -- Caroline Kennedy is on a public campaign for Sen. Hillary Clinton's Senate seat, which may make it difficult for New York Gov. David Paterson not to send President John F. Kennedy's only living child to Washington. Caroline Kennedy vists Syracuse, New York, on Wednesday. While she has to win over only one voter -- Paterson -- Kennedy essentially began a political campaign for the seat, which was once held by her uncle, Robert F. Kennedy, with a visit to upstate New York on Wednesday. And on Thursday, Kennedy met with civil rights activist Al Sharpton, an influence in national and New York politics, in Harlem. ""You know, I come at this as a mother, as a lawyer, as an author, an education advocate and ... from a family that really has spent generations in public service, and I feel this commitment,"" Kennedy said after her meeting with Sharpton. ""This is a time when nobody can afford to sit this one out, and I hope that I have something to offer."" Kennedy added, ""There are many qualified candidates in this race, and it is up to the governor. But this is a commitment I've made over many years, and I'd love to take the skills and relationships I have to Washington to fight for the people of New York."" New York law gives Paterson the sole power to decide who will succeed Clinton after she gives up her Senate seat to become President-elect Barack Obama's secretary of state. Clinton has said she is staying out of the process of picking her successor and letting Paterson decide. During a stop in Syracuse, New York, Kennedy said, ""I've told Gov. Paterson that I'd be honored to be considered for the position of United States senator. I wanted to come upstate and meet with Mayor [Matthew] Driscoll and others to tell them about my experience and also to learn more about how Washington could help these communities."" But when pressed by reporters on what her qualifications for the office are, Kennedy initially provided little insight. ""There's a lot of good people ... that the governor is considering,"" she said, adding, ""He's laid out a process, and I'm proud to be in that process."" Later, during a stop in Rochester, New York, Kennedy said, ""I have had a lifetime commitment to public service. I've written book on the Constitution and the importance of individual participation.""   Watch Kennedy's trip to upstate New York » . But some are questioning whether she's ready to follow the path taken by her father and her two uncles. Kennedy, 51, has been involved in education reform and women's issues but has never held public office and has mostly stayed out of the public spotlight. Kennedy's high-profile campaign -- and powerful backers like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid -- may force Paterson's hand.  Watch Reid back Kennedy » . ""She's clearly floated to the top. If it's not a done deal, it's starting to look more and more like ... Gov. Paterson is boxed in,"" Democratic strategist Hillary Rosen said. ""By the way, it wouldn't be a bad choice,"" Rosen added. ""She's a classy woman, deeply intelligent and compassionate. But from what I'm hearing from my sources, Gov. Paterson still wants that group of a few folks to stay in this, so he has a choice to make."" Recent polls suggest that Kennedy is not the top choice of the public, however. A poll released by Siena College on Wednesday found that 26 percent of New York voters wanted another Democrat with a famous last name to be appointed to the seat: state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, son of former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Kennedy was the choice of 23 percent of New York voters, the polls found. Sending Cuomo to the Senate, however, might anger feminist groups that are pressuring Paterson to appoint a woman to replace Clinton. Considering that Clinton's departure will leave only 16 women in the Senate out of 100 senators, many feminists believe women are underrepresented on Capitol Hill. ""It's really important to us that we don't lose another seat in the U.S. Senate,"" said Cathy Lasry, president of the Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Committee. ""I think that we've proven that once we are in there, obviously we can govern. ... We just need that extra push and some help in getting in there.""  Watch the Kennedys' hold on American politics » . Choosing Kennedy would allow Paterson to maintain the number of women in the Senate, but she is not the only female candidate the governor is reportedly considering. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-New York, has also expressed interest in the seat. But one New York Republican believes that the number of women in the Senate shouldn't influence Paterson's pick and that Kennedy is not ready for the job. ""We should go beyond gender politics and racial politics, and we should pick the best person for the job,"" said Rep. Peter King, who was mentioned as a candidate for the Senate seat in 2010. ""I quite frankly don't think Caroline Kennedy has shown the experience or the qualifications to be a United States senator.""  Watch King question Kennedy's qualifications » . Democratic strategist Hank Scheinkopf, who once worked for President Bill Clinton, also said he thought Kennedy should not be chosen. ""There are a lot of Democrats who aren't happy about this, frankly,"" Scheinkopf said. ""Why go outside the home team when there's a lot of good players here?"" But Kennedy would continue one of America's most powerful political legacies, which will force Paterson to take a hard look. ""As a woman, as a feminist, I think it's time to put another woman in the seat,"" CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile said. ""I think Caroline Kennedy will bring a great deal to the table."" When asked about Kennedy on ABC's ""The View"" on Thursday, New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who had praised her as a candidate, said he would not back any of the candidates publicly, saying, ""I should stay out of the race personally. ... It's not my call."" He said Paterson should pick ""somebody who is smart, who can get access, who will hire good advisers, who has character and judgment."" When asked if Kennedy fit that profile, Bloomberg said, ""yes, but there are other people as well.""

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Hollywood star Will Smith led a crowd of 46,664 in a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" to Nelson Mandela on Friday at a party for the South African prisoner, president and Nobel Peace Prize winner. Nelson Mandela had a smile and a message. Smith introduced Mandela to the London crowd celebrating Mandela's life with the words ""The one, the only, the birthday boy, Nelson Mandela, Nelson Mandelaaaaaaaaaa."" London was the scene of a concert 20 years ago to celebrate Mandela's 70th and to raise awareness of his imprisonment. Mandela told cheering fans, ""Your voices carried across the water to inspire us in our prison cells far away. Tonight, we can stand before you free. ""We are honored to be back in London for this wonderful occasion. ""But even as we celebrate, let us remind ourselves that our work is far from complete. ""Where there is poverty and sickness, including AIDS, where human beings are being oppressed, there is more work to be done. Our work is for freedom for all.""  Watch Mandela at the party » . As Mandela walked on stage, Smith led the crowd in a chorus of ""Happy Birthday."" Proceeds from the concert in London's Hyde Park will go toward the 46664 Campaign, which Mandela founded in 2003 to raise awareness about the impact of AIDS, especially in Africa, and to promote HIV-prevention measures around the world. The name of the charity represents Mandela's prison number when he was incarcerated at Robben Island. Organizers put 46,664 tickets up for sale. The finale of the concert was scheduled as Queen, Amy Winehouse and Jerry Dammers performing ""Free Nelson Mandela,"" a 1980s hit from the Specials that quickly became an anti-apartheid anthem, but pretty much every act joined them on stage. Dammers was also one of the driving forces behind the London concert in 1988 to awareness of Mandela's long imprisonment by the South African authorities. The former South African president turns 90 on July 18.  Watch the crowd celebrate » . Speculation surrounded whether Winehouse would perform after being  hospitalized with lung problems last week. More than a dozen African artists, including Johnny Clegg and the Soweto Gospel Choir, performed. Smith, music legend Quincy Jones and Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton were among the stars introducing acts. Other guests at the concert included British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, former U.S. President Clinton, talk show host Oprah Winfrey and actor Robert De Niro. Mandela served as his country's first democratically elected president from 1994 to 1999. In recent years, he has campaigned on behalf of HIV and AIDS awareness and has long called the battle against AIDS a basic human right. In 1964, a court sentenced Mandela to life in prison for plotting to overthrow the government by violence. He spent the first 18 years at Robben Island Prison, off Cape Town, South Africa, and later spent time at Pollsmoor prison and Victor Verster Prison, closer to the mainland. While in prison, Mandela became recognized as the most significant black leader in South Africa, and he became a potent symbol of resistance in the anti-apartheid movement. Mandela consistently refused to compromise his political position to obtain his freedom. South African President F.W. de Klerk released Mandela in February 1990 after 27 years in prison. Mandela was elected president of the African National Congress the following year, and in 1994, he was elected president of his country.","Celebrities, statesmen gather in London to celebrate Mandela's 90th birthday .

"(CNN) -- The cities of Annecy, Munich and Pyeongchang will battle it out to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. Munich is aiming to become the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee have confirmed they have received applications from France, Germany and South Korea ahead of this week's deadline. The IOC will now decide which of the applicants will become official candidate cities, before they undergo a full evaluation process. The final decision will be made in July 2011. France has hosted three editions of the Winter Olympics, most recently in 1992 in Albertville. Munich confirmed its run for the 2018 Games by officially launching the bid at the IOC's headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland earlier this month. Should Munich -- together with the sporting facilities in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and the Berchtesgadener Land region -- get the vote from the IOC in July 2011, the scene would be set for another chapter in Olympic history. A city has never before hosted both the Summer and Winter Games, and Munich is now attempting to duplicate its success in attracting the Olympics back after hosting the 1972 Olympics. Pyeongchang formally submitted its bid last month. The city narrowly failed in its bids for 2010 and 2014, losing by three votes to Vancouver for next year's event and by just four votes to Sochi for the 2014 event. The runners and riders for the 2018 Winter Olympics were shortened earlier this week after China's Sports Ministry decided against backing bids from Harbin and Changchun for the Games. The move signalled an about-turn from the authorities after September saw the Chinese government announce it would throw its weight behind bids from any of its cities for the Games.","Three cities will battle it out to host the 2018 Winter Olympics, the IOC reveal .

"Washington (CNN) -- The House of Representatives on Saturday night passed a sweeping health care bill by a vote of 220-215. With the passage of H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act, proponents of health care reform took an important step forward, but turning the bill into law remains uncertain. It's unclear when the Senate will vote on a version of the health care legislation debated in that chamber. If the Senate passes its bill, the House and Senate bills would have to be reconciled into one document and voted on again. The House Democrats needed 218 votes to ensure passage of the bill. On Saturday, it appeared the vote would come down to the wire, as the intentions of some conservative Democrats remained unknown. In the final tally, 219 Democrats voted for the legislation, and 39 voted against it. Rep. Joe Cao (R-Louisiana) was the only Republican who voted in favor of the bill. Read the House bill (PDF) Democrats began counting down with eight seconds left in the voting period and erupted in a loud cheer when the hotly debated legislation was passed. Republicans in the chamber stood across the floor, some with their arms folded. ""Oh what a night,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a news conference after the House adjourned its session for the night. She thanked President Obama and her colleagues who fought to get the bill passed. The Republican National Committee released a statement after the vote. ""Today with help from their liberal House allies, President Obama and Nancy Pelosi finally got what they have been creating behind closed doors these past months -- a government-run health careexperiment that will increase families' health care costs, increase the deficit, increase taxes on small businesses and the middle class, and cut Medicare,"" the statement said. Earlier, the House passed an amendment to pending health care legislation that prohibits federal funds for abortion services in the public option and in the insurance ""exchange"" the bill would create. The vote passed 240-194. Share your thoughts on the health care debate . A second amendment considered by the House, introduced by Minority Leader John Boehner, which would have substituted several sections of the health care bill dealing with insurance, did not pass. Legislators voted against the amendment 258-176. The first amendment, introduced by anti-abortion Democrats, bans federal funds for abortion services in the public option and in the insurance ""exchange"" the bill would create. Its consideration was considered a big win for them and for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, which used its power -- especially with conservative Democrats in swing congressional districts -- to help force other Democratic leaders to permit a vote that most of them oppose. The prohibition, introduced by Democratic members, including Rep. Brad Ellsworth, D-Indiana, and Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, would exclude cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. Republicans strongly supported the measure. The GOP accounted for 174 of the votes in favor of the amendment, with 1 Republican voting ""present."" On the Democrats' side, 64 voted for the measure, and 194 voted against. Earlier Saturday, President Obama said members of the House of Representatives face the chance of a lifetime as they consider the legislation. After a meeting with the House Democratic leadership, the president said he told lawmakers that ""opportunities like this come around maybe once in a generation."" ""This is their moment, this is our moment, to live up to the trust that the American people have placed in us,"" Obama told reporters in the White House rose garden.

"(CNN) -- Julie Sculley got married in a hotel that looks like a castle. There was no way she was going to miss the ultimate royal fairy tale. The 37-year-old mother of one from Framingham, Massachusetts, took the day off work Friday to watch Prince William and Catherine Middleton tie the knot. Like so many wedding fans and Anglophiles -- you know who you are -- she was up before dawn, camped on the living room couch, watching the bride make the magical transition from mere commoner to Duchess of Cambridge. And yes, she may have shed a tear or two. ""The anticipation kind of catapulted me into this somewhat weepy state,"" she admitted after a bit of prodding. By all accounts, Sculley was in good company. Countless Americans from coast to coast woke unusually early to mark the day. Some attended royal wedding parties complete with tea, scones and, in a few cases, clipped British accents. ""There's something about William and Catherine,"" Sculley said. ""It's so romantic, and I love all the tradition. It's just not something you get to see every day."" Down South in Atlanta, Sally Gachunji rose at 4 a.m. ET to ensure that she did not miss a thing, from the wedding dress to the bride's long walk down the aisle at Westminster Abbey. ""I'm actually on a conference call with some pals. Oh, my God, did you see those hats?"" she said breathlessly. ""I cannot miss it. This is history. It is an opportunity to watch a modern-day fairy tale."" Across town, Christy George, 41, gathered with a group of friends -- nicknamed the duchesses -- in the Atlanta suburb of Marietta. The duchesses, decked out in frocks and fancy hats, munched on petite cucumber sandwiches as they waited for the royal couple's first public kiss. ""It's sort of like a fairy tale, an escape from ordinary life for a while,"" said George, with a light purple hat adorned with a flower perched on her head. Americans, who once fought a war to escape the rule of a British monarch, are fascinated by royalty, she said. ""The whole country is enamored because we don't have that here. ... I remember watching Princess Diana's wedding as well,"" George said. Events at George's gathering included a hat-making contest, with the winner getting a replica of Princess Diana's ring. Royal fans say it is easy to relate to Catherine and her princely husband. Catherine ""is a commoner who fell in love with a prince, and for a romantic like me, that's huge,"" Gachunji said as she sipped a cup of tea. To spice up her viewing experience, the 32-year-old spoke to her friends in a British accent, using words such as ""cheerio"" for goodbye. In Tennessee, Dena Oneal woke at dawn but had to persuade her family to part with the remote. ""My husband and two sons did not want to watch it at first, but it's a once-in-a-lifetime event,"" the Murfreesboro resident said. ""Just seeing the ceremonial aspect of having royalty, the carriage, the hats, the ornamental aspects -- it turned out to be a royalty learning experience for them."" Lise Caldwell, a 37-year-old freelance writer from Indiana, set her alarm for 4:45 a.m. On Thursday night, she went over to a friend's house to make scones. The two had them during the wedding, with cream and jam. ""I was a little girl when Charles and Diana got married,"" she recalled. ""I was absolutely obsessed with it. ... I wanted to see their son get married."" ""I'm a grown woman,"" she said.  ""I have a sense that it's a little bit ridiculous to get up and watch someone else's wedding but it's fun."" Jennifer Slocumb, a resident of Roswell, Georgia, said the pomp and circumstance of Friday's pageantry were welcome distractions from the news at home. ""We don't have exposure to the politics or costs of it,"" she said. ""We just see a handsome man and beautiful woman all dressed up."" A number of festivities were held nationwide Friday as businesses capitalized on the wedding. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel in the Washington neighborhood of Georgetown was hosting a royal viewing party with accommodations the night before. The package, which was not exactly free, included cocktails named after the couple and engraved champagne flutes. And of course, a modern fairy tale is not complete without a technology twist: The hotel allowed guests to use its iPad interactive feature to add to the viewing experience. In New York, venues such as Trinity Church touted royal ties with wedding screening. The gothic Anglican church got its charter from England's King William III in 1697. On the West Coast, Madame Tussauds Hollywood was hosting an ""all-nighter"" viewing. The Los Angeles facility, which features a museum for celebrity wax figures, displayed the broadcast of the royal wedding live starting at 1 a.m. local time. Its broadcast featured special guest appearances by singer Elton John and soccer star David Beckham -- in the form of their $300,000 wax likenesses. ""It's a once in a lifetime chance to experience history,"" Madame Tussauds said in a statement. The real Beckham and John attended the wedding in London. Scores joined the viewing on televisions worldwide, with British Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt predicting that the ceremony would be seen by an estimated 2 billion people. In the United Kingdom, crowds held street parties amid tight security following threats by Muslim radicals, anarchists and anti-royalists. Royal fever, however, may not quite so widespread in Britain.  Just under half of British respondents to a recent poll said they were planning to watch it on television, and 56% said they were not interested. Back across the pond, there was a price to be paid for the royal devotion. ""I might take a nap later today,"" said Sculley, who was up at 4:15 a.m. ""I'm a bit tired.""

"(CNN)A little under two years ago, Borussia Dortmund was a mere 90 minutes away from being crowned champion of Europe. The Champions League final against domestic rival Bayern Munich at Wembley on May 25, 2013 didn't quite go to plan, but for a team that had won back-to-back German Bundesliga titles against the odds in the previous two seasons, there was still plenty to smile about. ""We will come back, maybe not to Wembley, but we will try to come back to another final,"" Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp said after the final whistle. Fast-forward to February 2015, and the club with such lofty ambitions finds itself bottom of a Bundesliga table it had previously been used to ruling. Seven of the players who graced the Wembley turf for Dortmund two seasons ago took to the field Wednesday against Augsburg -- a game that would prove to be the nadir of a so far disastrous campaign. Klopp's men slumped to a 1-0 defeat at home to a side reduced to 10 men, with further salt rubbed into the wound by the fact that Augsburg had never before beaten Dortmund in its history. The latest defeat proved to be the tipping point, with fans at the Westfalenstadion finally venting their anger and frustrations after having stayed patient through previous setbacks. So much so that, after the match, a couple of Dortmund players were moved to publicly apologize to the supporters, with Mats Hummels speaking to them through the perimeter fence. Goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller went even further, scaling the fence to ensure a more intimate dialogue with the unhappy Dortmund fans. Confidence has drained away and, with every passing defeat against the underdogs of Hertha Berlin, Cologne and Mainz, Dortmund's next win seems ever harder to secure. ""There's no doubt that nerves play a part in our situation,"" Klopp told the Dortmund website after Wednesday's defeat. ""We need to bring them under control."" A club that finished the 2011-12 season as champion with just three losses to its name has now suffered 11 defeats from 19 games this term, with relegation from Germany's top flight for the first time since 1972 a real possibility. What makes Dortmund's decline even more galling is the ceding of dominance to Bayern, which has made a habit of poaching of its star players -- notably Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski. A talented team . Admittedly, Dortmund have struggled with injuries this season, and Wednesday's defeat by Augsburg brought further bad news on that front after Kevin Grosskreutz suffered a torn thigh muscle, ruling him out for the next six weeks. Even so, a team still boasting world-class talent such as Marco Reus and Hummels -- reported targets for some of the game's biggest clubs -- should be sitting above the majority of teams in its division. ""We're always chasing games,"" bemoaned Hummels after the Augsburg setback. ""What's missing is us taking the lead so that we can then sit back and play on the counter. We're all aware that we've got to fight in the next 15 games."" Surely Dortmund are too good to go down? One only needs to take a quick glance at the Champions League to notice that on its day, the club can still prove to be a match for Europe's best. Dortmund remains in Europe's premier competition after topping a group also including Arsenal, Galatasaray and Anderlecht, with a 2-0 victory against the Gunners in September showcasing the side at its most fearsome. Without the pressures and trappings of the Bundesliga, Dortmund is a different beast altogether. Italian champion Juventus awaits in the last 16, and you would not bet against Dortmund progressing to the quarterfinals. The same cannot be said of its league clash with Freiburg Saturday. But CAN Dortmund go down? Part of the problem is often acknowledging that there is, indeed, a problem. Klopp, in his own mild-mannered way, has refused to hit the panic button and has been under little pressure from the German media, while the club's board has yet to publicly question the coach. The Dortmund fans, too, known as some of the most passionate in the world, have continued to voice their support. ""There are several stadiums with a great atmosphere in the world, but only a few who go wild like [Dortmund's] when you are [struggling],"" Klopp said of the club's fans in December. That was until Augsburg. Reports, meanwhile, have suggested that Dortmund will give Klopp -- who to some, given the resources at his disposal, has taken the club as far as he can -- until the end of the month to offer up signs of survival. Realization has struck that Dortmund's quality alone will not be enough to turn things around and something has to change soon, with the one-month winter break failing to turn around its fortunes. If it doesn't, the Dortmund team widely considered too good to go down may end up doing just that.","Borussia Dortmund sits bottom of the German Bundesliga table .

"On the surface, it resembles just about any other high school in Japan -- or any high school in most places around the world. Students sit quietly studying math, science and English; some struggle to stay focused, looking at the clock and waiting for the bell to ring. When the school day ends, some move out to the sports fields for rugby or soccer practice, while others study music in emptying hallways. What makes this school different is the pictures of two men scattered throughout the building -- portraits of North Korea's founder Kim Il Sung and previous leader Kim Jong Il. The Tokyo Korean Middle and High School, which is currently home to 650 students, is one of 10 high schools in Japan with long standing ties to North Korea. It's something the school's principal, Gil-ung Shin, is very open about. ""Yes, North Korea has given us financial support over the years, sending us money and textbooks,"" he says. The school also organizes annual trips to Pyongyang, where students are given highly orchestrated tours of the reclusive North Korean capital. But the students we spoke with laughed at suggestions from some quarters that they are being trained as spies. ""People think we're being brain-washed. We're not. We just want to study Korean culture and language,"" 17-year-old Kyong Rae Ha says. Sang Yong Lee, also 17, laughs at such notions, saying, ""No, I'm not being trained to be a spy. This is just a place where I can show my pride as a Korean, living in Japan."" In fact, most of the students were born in Japan, as were many of their parents and grandparents. Korea was a Japanese colony until the end of the Second World War, and many Koreans were brought to Japan -- many against their will -- before the country was eventually divided between north and south. But the mistrust runs deep, and many Japanese are wary of such schools. Fresh on the minds of many in Japan is North Korea's admitted kidnapping of Japanese citizens from Japanese soil in the 1970s and 1980s. Pyongyang says it considers the matter resolved, but Japan has long demanded more answers. North Korea's strategic posture has also alarmed Japan. There's concern over an imminent nuclear test by North Korea -- which would be its third since 2006. And in December, Pyongyang launched a rocket that it said put the Shining Star-3 satellite into orbit. But that is only a small part of the equation. Amid increasingly threatening rhetoric from North Korea towards its neighbors and the U.S., Japan's new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is steadfastly refusing to consider requests for government funding for any pro-Pyongyang schools in Japan. It's a high stakes battle for millions of dollars. The students and their families argue they should get help with tuition from the central government, and the school should receive subsidies from local prefectures. They argue that they are no different from the students at other international schools in Japan, which are afforded such luxuries. ""We pay the same taxes as everyone else,"" Kyong Rae Ha says. ""It makes me angry as well as sad."" Shin acknowledges the abductions, and says the students learn about the crimes. And when we ask about the ever-present portraits of North Korea's leaders -- portraits that also hang in his office -- and whether he's thought of taking them down, he says it's simply a way of saying thanks to those who've helped fund the school over the years. But he adds, ""We don't force the students to pledge their loyalty to anyone. ""I just feel bad that my students are caught in the middle of all of this.""","Tokyo Korean Middle and High School one of 10 schools in Japan with ties to North Korea .

"Cynthia Osokogu had it all: Beauty -- she was a former model -- intelligence and business savvy. She also modeled herself on her idol, Tyra Banks, and was emerging as a successful businesswoman. ""She was hardworking, loving, industrious and beautiful,"" said her mother, Joy Osokogu. ""She had achieved so much at age 24."" On July 21 this year, Osokogu traveled to Lagos from the country's capital Abuja, ostensibly, to meet with retailers whom she thought might be able to offer her better prices on clothes and accessories for her fashion boutique. After landing, she called her mother to tell her that she had arrived safely. But Cynthia never made it to the meetings because there weren't any. She was found strangled to death in her hotel room the next morning. The trip was organized by Echezona Nwabufor -- a man, police say, she met through the BlackBerry messenger service and Facebook. For months, he and Cynthia had chatted through these social media platforms and soon she had also ""friended"" his cousin, Ezike Ilechukwu Olisaeloka. Police say Nwabufor told Cynthia that he was a student at Lagos State University but that he had connections and could help her with her fashion business. What Cynthia didn't know was that Nwabufor had been stalking her for months, patiently gaining her confidence through frequent chats and postings. Eventually, Nwabufor made Cynthia an offer that seemed too good to be true. He offered to buy her a plane ticket and to put her up in a nice hotel if she would come to Lagos to meet with his business associates. When Cynthia arrived in Lagos, she was taken to a hotel just outside of town, drugged, beaten, sexually assaulted and finally, murdered, according to police. Read related: L.A. police use social media to ID possible 'Grim Sleeper' victims . She was targeted, police say, because the suspects had figured out that she was the daughter of a retired Nigerian Army general. They assumed that she would come to Lagos with cash, a large bank account and jewelry. ""She got involved with the murderers while chatting,"" says Lagos Police Commissioner Umar A. Manko. ""At some point they discovered that she came from a very good home and felt that they could make some quick money out of her."" But her brother, Kenneth Osokogu, says that Cynthia never carried any large sums of cash. ""She doesn't even have an ATM card, she used a checkbook,"" he said. Cynthia's sad and tragic story has shocked Nigeria. But criminal acts through the use of social media are not uncommon around the world. In the United States, Julissa Brisman was murdered by Philip Markoff who used Craigslist to find his victims. And in August, Christopher Dannevig pleaded guilty to murdering 18-year-old Australian student Nona Belomesoff after stalking her, like Cynthia, through Facebook. Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, blogs -- Nigeria¹s internet use has exploded from just over two million users in 2005 to more than 44 million users today, according to the country's National Information Technology Development Agency. Nigerians are some of the most active users of social media on the continent and the BlackBerry Messenger service is how millions of Nigerians communicate every day. But Cynthia's murder has touched a nerve and exposed the dark side of the web in a way that most had not imagined possible. And while many outside the country may express shock that a Nigerian would fall for what seemed like an offer too good to be true in a country known for fraud and corruption, the sad irony is that many Nigerians are, in reality, very open and trusting people. And Cynthia's murder really does seem senseless. After the suspects were arrested several other women came forward to say that they too had been drugged, tied up and robbed by the suspects. But they all lived. It is difficult to understand why Cynthia was killed. The police have some theories. Perhaps, they say, the suspects became enraged at the lack of payday after spending so much money to get her there. Or, maybe, Cynthia struggled or attempted to scream even after being drugged with the sedative Rohypnol. Read related: Facebook video leads to teens' murder arrests . ""She was struggling to see how she could liberate herself or make noise that would attract people to come (to her aid),"" said the investigating officer FESTAC Area Commander, Dan Okoro. ""But they overpowered her."" The next morning, after having spent the night with Cynthia's body, the suspects left the hotel. A staffer and the police told CNN that the suspects placed a call to reception and told them to get ""the body of that bastard"" out of the room. While police attempted to identify the body, Cynthia's mother tells CNN that she tried calling Cynthia's cell phone for five days but that the phone was switched off. On the seventh day, she says the suspects answered the phone and told her that Cynthia was sick. Soon, they were asking her for ransom money. ""I asked them if they killed my daughter and they said no, she was just sick and couldn't come to the phone,"" she said. Within three weeks, the police were able to arrest the suspects through cell phone records and CCTV footage of them leaving the hotel. Several other men have been arrested in connection with the crime including the pharmacists who sold the Rohypnol to the suspected killers without a prescription, their driver who police say always accompanied them during their robberies and a ""fence"" -- the man who sold Cynthia's and the other victims goods. The suspects are due in court on November 5, exactly one month after Cynthia Osokogu was laid to rest. The police say this is a cautionary tale and issued a call to parents to become more aware and vigilant about what their children are doing while surfing the web. Cynthia's family and friends agree. Her father and older brother both believe that Cynthia's murder, as tragic as it was, will serve a higher purpose. ""An eye opener to younger girls and also future criminals with such barbaric intentions,"" said Kenneth Osokogu.","Police say Cynthia Osokogu was lured to Lagos using social networking sites under false pretenses .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Army will report Thursday the highest level of suicides among its soldiers since it began tracking the rate 28 years ago, CNN has learned. The Army is expected to announce a new effort to study soldier suicides and links to post-combat stress. Statistics obtained by CNN show that the Army will report 128 confirmed suicides last year and an additional 15 suspected suicides in cases under investigation among active-duty soldiers and activated National Guard and reserves. The confirmed rate of suicides was 20.2 per 100,000. Army officials were reviewing the suspected suicides Wednesday. If any of them are confirmed, the rate will rise. In 2007, the Army reported 115 confirmed suicides, the highest level since 1980, when it began tracking suicides. The Army is expected to announce a new effort to study the problem and determine why its suicide-prevention programs appear not to be working, and the extent to which post-combat stress may be a contributing factor. Many of the suicides occur after troops return home. The Army has long cited personal stress -- including financial, relationship and substance-abuse problems -- as the major reason for suicides, but it is also studying the extent to which deployments to a war zone may play a role. Last month, Army officials said the nation's suicide rate was 19.5 people per 100,000, a 2005 figure considered the most recent. Military officials have long said it is difficult to compare the military suicide rate with that of the private sector because of demographic differences and overall human stress factors. Another factor is that military suicides tend to be young men with access to weapons. Suicides for Marines were also up in 2008. Marines had 41 suicides in 2008, up from 33 in 2007 and 25 in 2006, according to a Marines report . The numbers did not surprise Kevin Lucey, whose 23-year-old son, Jeffrey M. Lucey -- a former Marine -- hanged himself on June 22, 2004 -- 11 months after returning from Iraq. The night before, ""Jeffrey asked if he could sit in my lap and if we could rock,"" Lucey said. ""It was about 11:30 at night. And I rocked him for about 45 minutes. Now here you have a 23-year-old, 150-pound Marine that I'm just rocking and his therapist said it was his last gasp. It was his last place for refuge, and then the next time I held him in my lap was when I was taking him down from the rafters. He had put the hose around his neck double-looped and he was dead."" He said his son had not been able to get the treatment he needed from the Veterans Administration. ""What is disappointing is that the intervention doesn't appear to be there at the present time,"" he told CNN in a telephone interview from his home in western Massachusetts. The government settled with the family for $350,000. ""The foolish part of all this is we just wanted someone to say they did wrong,"" he said. ""But no one would until recently."" Lucey said the U.S. attorney, acting on behalf of the Veterans Administration, told him his son's case had led the VA mental system to be changed. Fear of stigma also may have played a role in making his son reluctant to seek professional help. His son, Lucey said, was afraid that getting mental help would affect his chances of getting a job as a state trooper. Apparently it did not. ""A year after he died, they accepted him,"" the father said. CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr contributed to this story.","Army to report 128 confirmed suicides, 15 suspected suicides in 2008 .

"The main character in Nick Harkaway's new novel, ""Tigerman,"" is a British solider who becomes a self-made superhero. But all Sgt. Lester Ferris really wants to be is ""Dad."" ""Tigerman"" is about geopolitics, environmental disaster and the 24-hour news culture. But, at its core, Harkaways says ""Tigerman"" is a story about fatherhood and the ""power of paternal and filial love."" It's not your typical father-son story, says Harkaway, a married father of two and the son of legendary spy novelist John le Carré. But, ""something about the nature of guns and the similarities between being an NCO (noncommissioned officer) and a parent,"" combined with revelations in the British press in 2010 about rendition, led Harkaway to start writing. The book deals with darker themes of justice and vengeance, similar to another hero with father issues, ""Batman."" Despite the comic book overtones and its location on a fictional island scheduled by NATO for demolition, Harkaway says he tried to keep the story grounded in reality. In other words, no laws of physics are broken, he says. ""It's the most real, in a way, of the books I've written."" After years of dodging enemy fire in Afghanistan and Iraq, the main character Ferris is sent to the fictional island of Mancreu, a ""spit of land"" in the Arabian Sea, to serve as the last representative of Her Majesty's government. On Mancreu, Ferris meets a nameless, streetwise boy raised on comic books, action movies and video games. His self-taught English is a mish-mash of ""leetspeak"" -- the language of the elite -- riddled with pop-culture references and Internet slang. Most importantly, the boy may be an orphan. Ferris is also a man without a family. When he and the boy bond over their mutual love of comic books and afternoon tea, Ferris starts to imagine life as a father. Ferris' hopes bloom into a plan to adopt the boy (if he's willing) and forge a future together. But the sergeant and the boy face a deadline for their would-be family. After years of ecological abuse, Mancreu has become an environmental disaster. NATO has earmarked the island for destruction. Residents who can afford it are ""Leaving"" with a capital ""L."" Others are hanging on and facing eventual evacuation. With an end date looming, anarchy and lawlessness spread across the island, think Casablanca, only with ""discharge clouds"" of toxic pollution. When a group of gun-toting thugs kills a mutual friend, the boy inspires Ferris to become ""Tigerman,"" part vigilante, part myth and ""full of win,"" as the boy says. The sergeant dons a homemade mask, body armor and utility belt to battle bad guys and hopefully convince the boy to become his son when the dust settles. Comic book fans will recognize elements of the Caped Crusader, with Ferris playfully referring to the boy as ""Robin"" in the book. Harkaway names ""Dark Knight"" and ""Sandman"" among his childhood favorites. But ""Tigerman"" isn't so much his version of ""Batman"" as it is his take ""on me, or any of us, shoved into being a costumed hero,"" he says. ""Batman is one of a small number of characters who get the title 'superhero' despite having no actual superpowers. Although I've heard it said that he has the best superpower of all, that of being ridiculously rich in a world where technology can make you a god."" Harkaway is the author of two previous genre-bending and critically-acclaimed novels, ""The Gone-Away World"" and ""Angelmaker."" Despite his famous lineage, he says he doesn't pattern his work after his famous father. ""We haven't spent a lot of time consciously talking about writing in a master-student kind of way, but we have similar concerns, ethical worries, (and) geopolitical perceptions in some areas. I like to think that my thought influences his in some areas, too."" For now, Harkaway is already at work on his next novel about ""semiotics, murder, alchemy, sharks, banking, game design and the surveillance state,"" he said. He's also making time for fatherhood, something he describes as ""the best, and the most extreme"" adventure.","In Nick Harkaway's ""Tigerman,"" a soldier becomes a self-made superhero to impress a kid .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- President Obama began to flesh out the details of one of his signature campaign promises Tuesday, outlining his plan for a major overhaul of the country's education system ""from the cradle up through a career."" President Obama says the decline of education is ""unacceptable for our children."" ""We have let our grades slip, our schools crumble, our teacher quality fall short and other nations outpace us,"" Obama said in an address to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. ""The time for finger-pointing is over. The time for holding ourselves accountable is here."" ""The relative decline of American education is untenable for our economy, unsustainable for our democracy and unacceptable for our children, and we cannot afford to let it continue,"" he said. The president outlined a five-tier reform plan, starting with increased investments in early childhood initiatives. Obama noted that the recently passed $787 billion stimulus plan includes an additional $5 billion for Head Start, a program to help low-income families. He highlighted a proposal to offer 55,000 first-time parents ""regular visits from trained nurses to help make sure their children are healthy and prepare them for school and life."" He also pledged to boost federal support in the form of ""Early Learning Challenge"" grants to states that develop plans to strengthen early education programs. Second, Obama called for an end to ""what has become a race to the bottom in our schools"" through lower testing standards. Echoing former President Bush's call to end ""the soft bigotry of low expectations,"" Obama said states needed to stop ""low-balling expectations"" for students.  Watch Obama challenge states to raise their standards » . ""The solution to low test scores is not lower standards; it's tougher, clearer standards,"" he argued. At the same time, however, he urged states to develop standards ""that don't simply measure whether students can fill in a bubble on a test but whether they possess 21st century skills like problem-solving and critical thinking, entrepreneurship and creativity."" To help promote this goal, Obama said he would push for funding in the No Child Left Behind law to be more effectively tied to results. The Education Department, he said, would ""back up this commitment to higher standards with a fund to invest in innovation in our school districts."" Obama's third tier focused on teacher training and recruitment. He noted that federal dollars had been set aside in the stimulus plan to help prevent teacher layoffs. He also reiterated a promise to support merit pay, as well as extra pay for math and science teachers with the goal of ending a shortage in both of those subjects. At the same time, however, the president warned that ineffective teachers should not be allowed to remain on the job. ""If a teacher is given a chance but still does not improve, there is no excuse for that person to continue teaching,"" he said. ""I reject a system that rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences."" Teachers' unions have opposed merit-based pay, arguing that it is unfair because it leads to competition among teachers and because teachers face different challenges depending on where they are located. Fourth, Obama called for the promotion of educational ""innovation and excellence"" by renewing his campaign pledge to support charter schools. He called on states to lift caps on the number of allowable charter schools. He also urged a longer school calendar. ""I know longer school days and school years are not wildly popular ideas,"" Obama said. ""But the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom."" Obama's final reform initiative focused on higher education. Among other things, the president promised to boost college access by raising the maximum Pell Grant award to $5,550 a year and indexing it above inflation. He also promised to push for a $2,500 a year tuition tax credit for students from working families. The American Federation of Teachers, a union with 1.4 million members, said Tuesday that it embraces Obama's goals to provide ""all Americans with a comprehensive, competitive education that begins in early childhood and extends through their careers."" ""We also fully support the president's call for shared responsibility for education -- among public officials, school administrators, parents, students and teachers,"" the group said in a statement. ""As with any public policy, the devil is in the details, and it is important that teachers' voices are heard as we implement the president's vision."" In promoting his program, the president called for an end to the ""partisanship and petty bickering"" that many observers believe has typically defined education policy debates in the past. ""We need to move beyond the worn fights of the 20th century if we are going to succeed in the 21st century,"" he said. Obama also offered a rebuttal to critics who have accused him of diverting attention to issues such as education and energy at the expense of the deteriorating economy. ""I know there are some who believe we can only handle one challenge at a time,"" he said. But ""we don't have the luxury of choosing between getting our economy moving now and rebuilding it over the long term."" CNN's Kristi Keck contributed to this report.","Obama stresses investments in early childhood initiatives.

"(CNN) -- When Barbie burst onto scene in a black and white swimsuit in 1959, she was considered a rebel who embodied both ""the sensuality of Marilyn Monroe and the innocence of Debbie Reynolds."" Now, she's returning to her ""fashion model"" roots in an updated version of her iconic zebra swimsuit, and not everyone's pleased. Barbie caused a stir when Mattel and Sports Illustrated revealed last week that she would appear in the 50th anniversary edition of its annual swimsuit edition, which hit stands Tuesday. The partnership includes a promotional cover-wrap that will appear on 1,000 copies declaring Barbie ""the doll that started it all,"" a four-page advertising feature inside the magazine and video outtakes posted online. The doll is also for sale at Target. The official Barbie Twitter account tweeted about the campaign February 10. Responses to the tweet foretold the ensuing controversy, with one person calling ""unapologetic"" an ""ill-advised hashtag."" Another person asked if ""unapologetic"" really meant #sorrynotsorry. A post on ""Mommyish"" blog, ""The Sport's Illustrated Swimsuit Issue Will Feature Barbie, So Your Daughter Can Feel Bad Too,"" underscored criticism of the partnership for using a children's toy to promote sexualized images intended for adults. It further complicates Barbie's legacy for parents unsure of whether to view her as a positive or negative role model. Mattel, however, stands by Barbie's ""unapologetic stance."" ""This is not a program targeted towards girls. As a brand that is always a part of the cultural conversation, Barbie, for the first time, has an active voice in the debate with her #unapologetic stance. The goal of the campaign is to empower fans to engage and celebrate all that makes them who they are,"" a Mattel spokeswoman said. The 2014 swimsuit issues celebrates ""legends,"" and Mattel said Barbie is a fitting example. ""As a legend herself, Barbie has always been a lightning rod for controversy and opinions. Posing in SI gives Barbie and her fellow legends an opportunity to own who they are and celebrate what they have accomplished."" For some, it works. As one person said in response to a question posed on Twitter, ""no little girl reads Sports Illustrated. It's literally a doll in a bathing suit, calm down society."" For others, the issue was not so cut and dry. ""When you look at the history of Barbie and how she's 'grown' in career choices I believe she's a positive example ... and quite frankly, a more positive image than the SI models,"" Utah grandmother Holly Albrecht said on Twitter. ""Children KNOW Barbie is a toy but the 'skinny' models tell society ... that a woman must be skinny to be accepted as beautiful; a far more negative example than Barbie,"" she said. ""Parents need to remember THEY should to be the positive role in their child's life, not toys or Hollywood or athletes."" But a growing body of research suggests that children are influenced not only by what they see in the media, but by the toys with which they play. ""People who say it is just a doll obviously don't realize how it shapes thinking while playing house,"" nonprofit executive Alia Salem said on Twitter. ""If the image of what (you're) imagining yourself as is never attainable and is billed as what to strive for, you'll always be disappointed."" Her comments echo why many of the campaign's critics saw something especially ""creepy"" -- or tone deaf -- in placing a toy intended for children in the pages of a magazine targeting adults. ""I am #unapologetic for being grossed out by Mattel's desperation. Pairing up with Sports Illustrated to put Barbie on a cover mag? #yuck,"" digital strategist Jessica Lee said on Twitter. Barbie and the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition have both been accused of promoting idealized beauty in their own ways. For many, the campaign was problematic because they say the swimsuit edition objectifies women and promotes a homogenous view of beauty. ""It's actually kind of perfect,"" said Occidental College professor Lisa Wade, a feminist and media critic. ""Barbie is the perfect model for the SI swimsuit issue. It's always been about celebrating conventional definitions of attractiveness for women, and Barbie is an icon of idealized femininity. ""Both Barbie and the swimsuit issue have been making women and girls feel inadequate for decades. It's a perfect partnership."" Others took issue with blurring the line between women as objects and actual plastic objects. ""Yes, the swimsuit edition is made up entirely of hypersexualized images of women, but this pairing blurs a new line. Barbie is not a woman, she's an inanimate object. Juxtaposing her alongside real women as though the two are indistinguishable is dehumanizing, and in a literal sense, objectifying,"" said Nicole Rodgers, editor-in-chief of RoleReboot.org, an online magazine that focuses on culture and gender roles. It also comes at a time when many are demanding representations of women without airbrushing or Photoshop, she said. ""Featuring a plastic doll as an object of admiration and desire feels like a slap in the face,"" Rodgers said. Throughout the controversy, Mattel has remained ""unapologetic,"" citing Barbie's 150 careers, her turns in 26 animated movies and partnerships with renowned fashion designers as evidence that you can be ""capable and captivating."" But nobody is thinking about Barbie's career trajectory or its positive examples when she's wearing a one-piece in Sports Illustrated's swimsuit edition, said California State University-Long Beach professor Shira Tarrant, author of ""Men Speak Out: Views on Gender, Sex, and Power."" ""I would never want to deny anyone love for Barbie,"" she said, ""but my concern is when we use her to present this hyper-sexualized model of beauty."" After all, CEO Barbie and Dr. Barbie weren't the dolls appearing in SI. ""When you look at how the lives of women have changed since the doll originally launched, the choice strikes me as particularly tone deaf in 2014,"" said Rodgers, of RoleReboot.org. The fact that ""the version they want to focus their marketing blitz on is a sexy bikini Barbie tells us something.""

"(CNN) -- America is a less Christian nation than it was 20 years ago, and Christianity is not losing out to other religions, but primarily to a rejection of religion altogether, a survey published Monday found. Survey finds percentage of of Americans identifying themselves as Christian has fallen over two decades. Seventy-five percent of Americans call themselves Christian, according to the American Religious Identification Survey from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1990, the figure was 86 percent. William Donohue, president of the Catholic League said he thinks a radical shift towards individualism over the last quarter-century has a lot to do it. ""The three most dreaded words are thou shalt not,"" he told Lou Dobbs. ""Notice they are not atheists -- they are saying I don't want to be told what to do with my life."" At the same time there has been an increase in the number of people expressing no religious affiliation. The survey also found that ""born-again"" or ""evangelical"" Christianity is on the rise, while the percentage who belong to ""mainline"" congregations such as the Episcopal or Lutheran churches has fallen. One in three Americans consider themselves evangelical, and the number of people associated with mega-churches has skyrocketed from less than 200,000 in 1990 to more than 8 million in the latest survey.  Watch CNN report on new study » . The rise in evangelical Christianity is contributing to the rejection of religion altogether by some Americans, said Mark Silk of Trinity College. ""In the 1990s, it really sunk in on the American public generally that there was a long-lasting 'religious right' connected to a political party, and that turned a lot of people the other way,"" he said of the link between the Republican Party and groups such as the Moral Majority and Focus on the Family.  Watch author on mixing religion and politics » . ""In an earlier time, people who would have been content to say, 'Well, I'm some kind of a Protestant,' now say 'Hell no, I won't go,'"" he told CNN. Silk also said the revelation that some Catholic priests had sexually abused children -- and senior figures in the church hierarchy had helped to hide it -- drove some Catholics away from religion. And, he said, it is now more socially acceptable than it once was to admit having no religion. ""You're not declaring yourself a total pariah. The culture has changed in a way that makes it easier to say, 'No, I don't have a religion. Even in the past year, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama feel obliged to talk about 'those of no faith,' "" he pointed out. Obama mentioned people without faith in his inaugural address in January, making him the first president to do so. In the survey, one in five Americans said they have no religious identity or did not answer the question, and more than one in four said they do not expect to have a religious funeral. The rise in what the survey authors call ""nones"" is the only trend reflected in every single state in the study, Silk said. ""We don't see anything else in the survey that is nationwide,"" he told CNN. Still, Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, remained hopeful that people will return to their faith, noting there was a less dramatic decline in those affiliating themselves with a religion this decade than in the 1990s. Perkins told Lou Dobbs he sees that decline easing, and he thinks soon religion will be an even greater part of people's lives. ""If this poll is taken next year will the outcome be different?"" he asked. ""As the economy goes downward, I think people are going to be driven to religion."" Other findings include: . • The percentage of Catholics in the United States has remained steady at about one in four since 1990, while the percentage of other Christians has plummeted from 60 percent to 50 percent. • The percentage of Muslims has doubled since 1990, but remains statistically very small, only 0.3 percent in the original survey and 0.6 percent today. • Mormons have remained steady as a percentage of the population, even as the number of people in the United States has grown. They make up 1.4 percent of the population. • The number of Jews in the United States is falling if the category includes only those who define themselves as Jews religiously, but has remained the same if the category includes people who consider themselves ethnically Jewish. The survey polled 54,461 Americans between February and November of last year. Pollsters conducted the research in both English and Spanish. The survey is the third in a series, following polls in 1990 and 2001.","New survey finds Americans less likely to identify themselves as Christian .

"(CNN) -- With the passing of Nelson Mandela it might be timely to put aside out-of-date and ill-informed views of Africa, and see it the way Africans seem to: With a high level of optimism. Two-thirds of respondents to a CNN survey of more than 9,000 people across South Africa and 19 other African countries say they feel more confident about the future than when Mandela came to power.

The survey, conducted on smartphones, PCs and web-enabled feature phones, was an attempt to give a sense of the mood of Africans about their future and Mandela's legacy. It suggests a positive outlook, and perhaps surprising high levels of patience with African leaders, and immense respect for Mandela as a leader for Africa not just South Africa. The survey is weighted towards South Africa with 4,871 respondents, but gives insights to other countries across a hugely diverse continent where Mandela had a huge impact. Think you know Africa? Think again . If you think of Africa as war-torn, corrupt, beset by crippling poverty, starvation and a raging AIDS epidemic, that's not the reality or how Africans see themselves and their future. ""People in South Africa, including the youth, must keep on respecting, loving, and caring about other people,"" said one respondent, a 19-year-old woman from South Africa. ""The youth must also take education as a weapon, to live as Madiba said."" ""We are one nation' and we must live in peace, build our nation to a better place, and always remember him."" Nigerian blogger and columnist Tolu Ogunlesi, writing for CNN, said: ""Where once the continent was defined by its AK-47s ... it is now more likely to be defined by those mobile phones that have made this survey possible."" While corruption seems to be their greatest single concern, Africans generally give their leaders pretty good reviews, the survey suggests. Half said their leaders were ""doing their best,"" and one in four said their leaders were living up to Mandela's vision. Only a quarter said their leaders were doing badly. While a clear majority of respondents voiced optimism their own future and those of their family, there was a split down the middle from people across the continent about how South Africa would do after Mandela. Just under half said the country would succeed without him, while an equal number said it would ""struggle."" Only 3% predicted it would fail. The numbers in South Africa were very similar. Given a choice of five options, respondents listed corruption as the greatest challenge facing their country, followed by the gap between rich and poor, poverty, and HIV/AIDS, with war coming last. Questions and thousands of answers . CNN International asked: . 1. Are you more or less optimistic about your own and your family's future now than ... when Mandela came to power in South Africa? Across Africa, 64% said they were more optimistic, 12% less optimistic. South Africa, the greatest proportion of the entire survey, was almost identical with 65% more optimistic. In Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa with the second-highest number of respondents, 64% expressed greater optimism. Ivory Coast respondents were the most optimistic with 91% but the sample was insignificant. Rwanda had the highest percentage of ""less optimistic"" at just under 28% but a majority were still optimistic. 2. How well have your country's current generation of African leaders lived up to Mandela's vision? Across Africa, less than a quarter felt their leaders had performed ""well"" but 52% said their leaders were doing their best. The remainder ticked the ""badly"" box. In South Africa, where President Jacob Zuma was booed at Mandela's memorial service this week, 55% said the leaders were ""doing their best"", with 20% saying their leaders had done badly and 24% saying they'd done well. 3. How do you think South Africa will progress without him? In South Africa, accounting for half the total sample, half the respondents said the country faced a ""struggle"" without him while almost the same proportion said it would ""succeed"". Across Africa the proportions were almost identical given the weight of South Africa in the survey overall. 4. Which group in South Africa has most embraced Mandela's message of reconciliation? In answer to a question most relevant to South Africa itself, nearly 60% of respondents said all races had equally embraced the aim of reconciliation. 5. What is the greatest challenge in your country in the post-Mandela era? Of the total Africa sample, 37%, identified ""corruption"" as the biggest challenge, with 23% identifying the gap between rich and poor. Sixteen percent put HIV/AIDS as the greatest fear. Of South African respondents 27% rated corruption as the biggest concern and 23% the wealth gap. In Nigeria by contrast, 57% rated corruption their greatest conern. Mobile gives mass coverage . The Africa After Mandela survey for CNN International surveyed 10,000 people in 20 countries from the Ivory Coast to Mozambique using mobile market research methods developed by Jana Mobile, Inc. People who took the survey received a small payment of mobile airtime in return for answering five multiple-choice questions and two open-ended ones. The survey findings were not statistically weighted as they are in public opinion polling, and may not be representative of the overall population of the continent. Mobile phone use has skyrocketed in Africa, climbing from 9.2 million subscribers in 2000 to more than 648 million subscribers in 2011 -- more users than the U.S. or the European Union, according to the World Bank. Cheap handsets and low-cost connections mean they have spread to even the poorest areas and mobile is by far the fastest-growing way of connecting to the Internet in Africa. More than three-quarters of respondents were between the ages of 15 and 25. Thirteen percent were aged 26 to 30, and 10% were older than 30. Across Africa as a whole 40% of the population is under 14 and 56% are between 15 and 64, according to data from the African Economic Outlook. In South Africa, 30 per cent are under 14. The survey did not reach some of the most war-ravaged places in Africa, such as the Central African Republic and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. CNN International conducted a similar project with Jana earlier this year to gauge the sentiment in the continent around the chances of an African winning the Papacy. Last words on Mandela . CNN's request for answers to more open-ended questions about Mandela's legacy and what he meant to the thousands asked for views, produced an outpouring of poignant comments. In a ""word-cloud"" which shows the phrases most-used in the thousands of replies: Hero. Great Man. Father. Freedom. Leader are most prominent. ""Africa's booming mobile economy is a subject we report on in the context of the pace of economic and social change across the continent so it is exciting to be able to participate in the phenomenon,"" said CNN International Digital General Manager, Peter Bale, explaining the intention behind the survey. ""Mass research by mobile is an emerging method which challenges traditional polling by its sheer scale, made possible by the growth of the Internet and mass adoption of mobile phones in even the poorest communities. It gives us an opportunity to add the views of thousands of people to the reporting we do."" ""With Nelson Mandela's death, using a mass mobile survey allows us to collect the views of thousands,"" he said. Jana grew out of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology health project in Kenya where blood supply data around the country was delivered by mobile phones in return for small payments of airtime. It now offers market research over mobile networks around the world. The survey was conducted by mobile phone in 20 countries this week on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. A total of 9,286 people responded. They hailed from Benin, Burundi, Cameroon, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Mali, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The respondents were active users of Jana's rewards platform, mCent, and may not be representative of the overall population.

"The Senate Intelligence Committee spent five years reading and analyzing more than 6.3 million pages of CIA documents to assess the CIA's use of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" in the post-9/11 era. That review produced a more than 6,000 page review that was condensed into a 525-page summary the committee released Tuesday that delivered a brutal assessment of the CIA's practices. Here are the report's biggest conclusions and revelations: . 1. ""Enhanced interrogation"" includes torture . Sen. Dianne Feinstein writes in the report that the Committee's findings reveal that ""CIA detainees were tortured."" ""I also believe that the conditions of confinement and the use of authorized and unauthorized interrogation and conditioning techniques were cruel, inhuman, and degrading. I believe the evidence of this is overwhelming and incontrovertible,"" she writes. Feinstein isn't alone. President Obama said over the summer that, in the past, ""we tortured some folks."" And Sen. John McCain, who was himself tortured as a POW during Vietnam, said on the Senate floor Tuesday that the harsh interrogations described in the report amount to torture. The CIA has claimed throughout its defense of the program that these coercive interrogations ""saved lives"" -- the most significant point the Senate committee refutes in its report. Senate report: CIA misled public on torture . 2. Torture doesn't work very well . ""The use of the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques was not an effective means of obtaining accurate information,"" according to the Senate Intelligence Committee report. The report debunks the top 20 examples CIA has used to defend the now-shuttered enhanced interrogation program, claiming that each of the examples ""was found to be wrong in fundamental respects."" Additionally, false confessions obtained by enhanced interrogation techniques from detainees led the CIA to pursue dead leads that did not help in the fight against al-Qaeda. Information the CIA obtained through these harsh interrogations, which in some cases amounted to torture, was either false or had been previously obtained through alternative intelligence gathering, according to the report. ""While being subjected to the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques and afterwards, multiple CIA detainees fabricated information, resulting in faulty intelligence,"" the report reads. The CIA and other advocates of these enhanced interrogation techniques, including former Vice President Dick Cheney have continued to defend the practices as critical to intelligence gathering efforts in the fight against terrorism. Hagel on torture report release: 'We want to be prepared' The CIA pushed back against the report in its own assessment on Tuesday, saying information obtained ""substantially advance the Agency's strategic and tactical understanding of the enemy in ways that continue to inform counterterrorism efforts to this day."" 3. Torture did not help the CIA find Osama bin Laden . The CIA continues to claim that coercive interrogations were crucial to capturing Osama bin-Laden, but the Senate report concludes that  the most ""accurate' CIA information that led to bin Laden's capture came from a detainee before the detainee was tortured. The CIA claims that information obtained through coercion ""fundamentally"" changed the agency's calculations. The Senate report insists that bin Laden could have been captured without the torture of any detainees. The ""most accurate"" CIA intelligence that led to bin Laden's capture came from Hassan Ghul, who was captured in Iraq in 2004. While Ghul was later subjected to enhanced interrogations, the Senate report contends that Ghul provided information that led to bin Laden's courier through traditional interrogation -- before he faced anything resembling torture. 4. One detainee died, apparently from hypothermia, after being chained, nearly naked, to a concrete floor . A glimpse of these techniques details how the CIA employed sleep deprivation to wear down victims: It ""involved keeping detainees awake for up to 180 hours, usually standing or in stress positions, at times with their hands shackled above their heads."" Other techniques included ""rectal rehydration,"" ""ice water 'baths,'"" and threatening detainees with threats to harm detainees' families, including threats to ""sexually abuse the mother of a detainee,"" according to the summary of the report. Related: 'This is not America' Other psychological tactics involved keeping detainees in pitch-black rooms ""with loud noise or music and only a bucket to use for human waste."" And the rooms were cold -- freezing. One detainee, ""who had been held partially nude and chained to a concrete floor"" died in Nov. 2002 from suspected hypothermia. CIA detainees who underwent these interrogation tactics were later found to experience ""hallucinations, paranoia, insomnia and attempts at self-harm and self-mutilation."" Medical personnel were sidelined and their concerns quieted when it came to coercive interrogations -- which the report says took precedent. The waterboardings of 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed became, according to the report, ""a series of near-drownings."" Mohammed was waterboarded at least 183 times. Related: McCain makes passionate defense for torture report's release . Another detainee, Abu Zubaydah, became unconscious and nearly died while he was waterboarded by CIA personnel. ""In at least one waterboarding session, Abu Zubaydah 'became completely unresponsive, with bubbles rising through his open, full mouth,'"" the committee reports. ""[He] remained unresponsive until medical intervention, when he regained consciousness and expelled ""copious amounts of liquid."" Videotape of Zubaydah's two waterboarding sessions during a 21-hour period disappeared from the CIA's records. 5. The CIA misled the White House, Congress, and other agencies . President George W. Bush was not briefed on ""the specific CIA enhanced interrogation techniques before April 2006,"" according to CIA records cited in the Senate report. That means it took four years from the time the program began until the President of the United States had a full accounting of CIA interrogations. But by that time, 38 of the 39 detainees who faced the CIA's coercive interrogations had already been in custody and interrogated using those procedures. But a lack of CIA records means that more detainees may have also been tortured. The Senate report also concludes that the CIA ""provided extensive amounts of inaccurate and incomplete information"" to the White House and top national security staff."" The DOJ legal memo that justifies the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, according to the report, is based on evidence the report says is false. CIA officials overplayed or entirely misstated the success of the enhanced interrogation program when briefing White House officials, according to the Senate report. They told White House officials ""that the CIA's enhanced interrogation techniques were uniquely effective and necessary to produce otherwise unavailable intelligence that the U.S. government could not obtain from other sources,"" the Senate report attests. 6. There was little oversight of junior officers  placed in charge of prisons . Junior officers were tasked with oversight of detention facilities and untrained CIA officers interrogated detainees unsupervised. At the CIA detention facility referred to as COBALT in the report, a ""junior officer on his first overseas assignment with no previous experience or training in handling prisoners"" was placed in charge. During his tenure, a detainee died of suspected hypothermia in 2002. CIA leadership attested in 2003 that they had ""little or no awareness of operations at COBALT"" and in fact some did not know enhanced interrogation was underway at the facility. Kerry call to Feinstein exposed Obama administration torture rift . And the report also concludes that at least 17 detainees faced enhanced interrogations without a green light from CIA headquarters. Other techniques used, including ""abdominal slaps and cold water dousing,"" were never approved by the Justice Department. At least two mock executions were carried out at COBALT without knowledge or approval from CIA headquarters. 7. 9/11 mastermind ""beat"" waterboarding . Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind behind the 9/11 terror attacks, was waterboarded at least 183 times. The CIA said the method was effective in helping CIA interrogators pull information from Mohammed, but CIA interrogators painted a different picture in interview with the CIA's inspector general, according to the Senate report. CIA interrogators and medical personnel said Mohammed ""hated it but knew he could manage,"" and ""figured out a way to deal with [the waterboard]."" Mohammed ""beat the system"" and one of his CIA interrogators attested that the suspected terrorist responded better to non-confrontational approaches. Like others who were tortured, Mohammed often recanted information he told CIA officers to get them to stop the waterboarding. One of those fabrications included an assassination plot against former President Jimmy Carter, which CIA officials described as an ""elaborate tale."" 8. Two government psychologists started a company that banked $81 million on interrogations . Two psychologists who helped develop the CIA's enhanced interrogation procedures founded a company in 2005 to help run the CIA's interrogations program. Between 2005 and 2009, the company pulled about $81 million from the government. The psychologists were previously involved in the Air Force's ""Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape school"" and neither had ""specialized knowledge of al-Qa'ida, a background in counterterrorism, or any relevant cultural or linguistic expertise,"" according to the Senate committee's report. And before founding the company, one of the psychologists recommended the use of coercive interrogation in the case of Gul Rahman, days before Rahman was found dead of suspected hypothermia in 2002.","CIA detainees were tortured, but those enhanced interrogations didn't yield actionable intelligence, the report concludes .
The report also claims coercive interrogations did not lead to the capture of Osama bin Laden .
Grisly details of torture emerge in the report, including one who died after being chained, partially naked to a concrete floor .
The CIA misled the White House, Congress and other agencies to maintain a program that had little oversight ."
"Tokyo (CNN) -- With the ringing of bells and bowing of heads Monday afternoon, Japan marked the passage of a month since the deadliest earthquake and tsunami in its modern history. Buddhist monks at the Tsukiji Hongwanji temple in Tokyo struck their bells at 2:46 p.m., the time the March 11 earthquake struck off Japan's northern coast. The magnitude-9 quake sent walls of water slamming into the country's Pacific shores, sweeping away whole villages and leaving more than 27,000 dead or missing. In Youriso, a fishing village north of the quake's epicenter, Japanese troops stopped their ongoing search for bodies, took off their hats and safety helmets and bowed their heads to observe a nationwide minute of silence. Of the town's population of 400, 12 died in the tsunami and 150 remain in shelters. ""I recalled the relatives I lost in the tsunami,"" one woman, Fusako Endo, told CNN. ""I had all those people washed away in my mind when we all stopped."" As of Monday afternoon, the death toll from the disaster stood at 13,127, according to Japan's National Police Agency. Another 14,348 remained missing, and 4,793 were injured. In addition, at least two deaths and 283 injuries have been blamed on an aftershock, a magnitude-7.1 tremor that rattled the islands Thursday night. Japanese troops launched an extensive search for more victims in the coastal prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima over the weekend. On Monday, another powerful earthquake -- followed by a series of smaller quakes -- rocked northeastern Japan. The jolt from the magnitude-6.6 quake was felt in Tokyo, about 164 kilometers (101 miles) away, or about 50 kilometers (31 miles) southwest of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. In addition to the devastation that the March 11 disaster unleashed, it also knocked out power to the crippled plant -- triggering a crisis that Japanese authorities have yet to resolve. Two explosions, a fire and the continuous pumping of water into the reactors have spread radioactive particles over a wide area of the land and sea surrounding the plant. Everyone within a 20-kilometer (12.5-mile) radius of the plant was ordered to evacuate, and those living between 20 and 30 kilometers were told to stay indoors. Both the government of Prime Minister Naoto Kan and the plant's owner, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, have faced increasing questions over their handling of the disaster but can't say at this point when they expect to bring it to an end. Video taken by a pair of freelance journalists in the town of Futaba, about 3 kilometers away, showed stray dogs wandering the streets -- and one, horrifyingly, still chained. The photographers, Shuji Ogawa and Naomi Toyoda, gave some of their food to the animal before leaving. Some of the dozens of Futaba residents now living in a shelter in Kozo, north of Tokyo, watched the video and came away convinced they would never return to their hometown again. Nobuyuki Araki was roused to anger when he saw a Tokyo Electric sign touting the ""bright future"" of nuclear power. ""That sign was a lie,"" Araki said. ""For the last 40 years, TEPCO has only been saying nuclear power is safe, that there's no chance of a meltdown. We -- the people of Futaba -- feel we've all been betrayed."" But at a news conference Monday, Yukio Edano, Kan's chief Cabinet secretary and the government's point man on the crisis, defended authorities' performance over the past month. ""I believe we have have done our utmost under the current system in supporting the victims of the earthquake, as well as handling the nuclear power plant situation,"" Edano said. ""However, we must not forget people are still suffering, and we must realize what they are going through."" Ailing Chang and CNN's Brian Walker, Kyung Lah and Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","NEW: Powerful aftershock hits one month after deadly quake .

"Veteran flight attendant Lee Yoon Hye sensed something was awry as Flight 214 neared the San Francisco International Airport runway. As the plane was supposed to land, it rose briefly as if it was trying to lift off again. Lee had worked 18 years with Asiana Airlines and on Saturday, her skills were tested. The plane slammed down with ""great impact,"" said Lee, who sat in the front. Then boom -- the plane hit again. ""It was even more than a hard landing,"" Lee, 40, said. The plane teetered left and right. Shock and survival: Plane crash through the eyes of children . After striking the edge of the runway at San Francisco International Airport, the Boeing 777 tumbled into the ground, igniting flames and a trail of smoke. Its tail splintered off and parts of the plane peeled off as it skidded into the earth. When the aircraft finally stopped, she noticed that the emergency inflatable slide located at the right side of the front door had deployed inside the plane. Witnesses say the overhead bins dropped open. Hailed as a hero who ushered passengers out of the Asiana plane, Lee was one of the 12 flight attendants on Flight 214. Two other flight attendants were not in their seats at the rear of the aircraft when the plane finally ground to a halt, because they were ejected as the aircraft broke up. They were later found near the runway, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Lee calmly described the chaotic minutes of the Asiana plane crash. Dressed in her airline uniform, her name tag pinned to her jacket and her hair in the airline's trademark bun, she addressed  Korean journalists gathered in San Francisco earlier this week. According to the airline, flight attendants helped passengers get off the plane safely. They opened doors, deployed slides and helped passengers escape, according to JoongAng Daily, a South Korean newspaper. As soon as the plane stopped, Lee knocked on the cockpit door to make sure the pilots were OK. The captain opened the door. ""Are you OK, Captain?"" she asked. ""Yes, I am OK,"" he replied. ""Should I perform the evacuation?"" she asked.  He told her to wait, she recalled. Interactive: What happened with Asiana Flight 214? Lee made an announcement to assure increasingly agitated passengers, telling them that the plane had come to a complete stop. Once evacuation began, Lee said she had a plan. ""I was not thinking, but acting,"" she said. ""As soon as I heard 'emergency escape,' I conducted the evacuation."" ""When there was a fire, I was just thinking to extinguish it, not thinking that it's too dangerous or 'What am I going to do?'"" Asiana flight attendants undergo three months of training including emergencies and terrorist training before their first flight. Did passengers ignore safety messages? Lee said she saw her colleagues jump into action to help passengers and injured crew even as a fire burned in the back of the airplane.  They popped the first emergency slide that had deployed inside with an ax to free a crew member who was struggling to breathe underneath its weight. Another emergency slide in the back trapped another crew member and was deflated with a kitchen knife, Lee said according to South Korean news station YTN. One shaken elementary school-aged boy was afraid to go down the emergency slide, but one of the flight attendants lifted him on her back and escaped with him, Lee said. Earlier this week, Eugene Rah, who was flying his 173rd flight on Asiana Air, told CNN that he saw a 100-pound flight attendant carrying the injured on her back. Joanne Hayes-White, the San Francisco Fire Chief also praised the flight attendant for being ""so composed."" ""She was not concerned for her safety, but everyone else's,"" she said. Lee said she was the last to leave the plane. And she glanced back. ""The ceiling was coming down and I felt like something was dragging the plane. Behind me I couldn't see, because it looked like there was a wall."" She had no idea the tail had snapped off or how the plane would be nearly engulfed in flames moments after they had escaped. Two teenagers, both 16, died in the crash. The rest who were on board escaped: 305 of them.","2 flight attendants were ejected from plane and found on runway .

"The husband of Farzana Parveen, the Pakistani woman stoned to death for refusing to participate in an arranged marriage, told CNN he killed his first wife so he could marry Parveen. Authorities said the first wife was killed six years ago. ""I wanted to send a proposal to Farzana, so I killed my wife,"" Mohammad Iqbal said Thursday in an interview with CNN. Zulfiqar Hameed, district inspector general for the Punjab police, said Iqbal's son from the first marriage alerted police to the slaying six years ago. Iqbal was arrested but later released on bail because his son forgave him, Hameed said. The son, Aurengzeb, who is in his 20s, confirmed his father's statements to CNN. He said his father served a year in jail. Parveen, who was three months pregnant, was beaten to death with bricks Tuesday in the eastern city of Lahore by a group of about 20 people, including her brothers, father and cousin, police said. Police have arrested Parveen's father and are searching for the other killers in this all-too-common crime. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has requested that Punjab's chief minister, Shahbaz Sharif, submit a report on the incident. The United Nations estimates 5,000 women are murdered worldwide by family members each year in ""honor killings,"" so named because the woman's actions are considered to have brought shame on her family. But women's advocacy groups say the crime is underreported and the figure could be around 20,000 a year. ""Most 'honor' crimes can be traced to inflexible and discriminatory attitudes about women's roles, especially around sexuality,"" said Rothna Begum of Human Rights Watch. ""Women or couples seen as having brought 'dishonor' on the community face violence, which is then held out as a chilling example for others."" Most honor killings in the Middle East and Central Asia occur in rural areas. Tuesday's attack was unusual because it happened in a public area of a big city. Iqbal, a neighbor of Parveen's family, said he and Parveen were supposed to marry, with the family's approval, last year. As part of the arrangement, Iqbal said, he'd given Parveen's father 80,000 rupees and gold jewelry. Last December, Parveen's mother died and her father and brothers changed their minds about the marriage, Iqbal said. The family decided Parveen, who came from a village in Punjab, should marry a cousin, police said. Parveen, 25, and Iqbal eloped and were married January 7 in a court ceremony. He said she liked the color white and that she was a ""beautiful and good wife."" ""We were happy,"" he said, though they were constantly worried about their safety. ""She loved us,"" said Aurengzeb, Parveen's stepson. ""She always made the most delicious meat stew for us."" The marriage enraged her family, Iqbal said, and they demanded he pay them 100,000 rupees (about $1,000) to let the couple stay alive. Iqbal, a farmer in the village in Jurranwala, Punjab, didn't have the money. The family had challenged Parveen's marriage to Iqbal in the courts, accusing him of abducting her. The attack took place Tuesday as she was on her way from her lawyer's office to the high court in Lahore, where she was expected to make a declaration that she had married Iqbal of her own volition. ""They left my office around 7:40 a.m.,"" the lawyer, Rai Ghulam Mustafa, said. ""They arrived at the main gate of the High Court around 7:45 a.m. The opposite party, the family members of Farzana Parveen, had been lying in wait for her among the cars. They suddenly attacked her, repeatedly hit her with bricks and killed her."" One family member made a noose of rough cloth around her neck while her brothers smashed bricks into her skull, said Mushtaq Ahmed, a police official, citing the preliminary report on the killing. Iqbal witnessed the attack and tried to protest, but was held back. Police said they had arrested Parveen's father, whose name they gave only as Azeem. They said he had admitted to the killing and expressed no regret. Senior Police Officer Umar Cheema told CNN that law enforcement agents are conducting raids in areas near the village to find the other killers. Iqbal said nobody helped when the stoning began. People just stood around and watched. Farzana Bari, a human rights activist based in Islamabad, said in many cases people outside the family don't step in to protect the victim ""because it's a private matter."" Bari said the number of honor killings is probably much higher than studies show because many families don't report the killings, and the killers often avoid prosecution. Under an Islamic element of Pakistani law, known as the law of Diyat, the family of a victim is allowed to forgive the perpetrator, according to the human rights commission's report. Lawyer Maliha Zia told CNN that ""blood money"" is also part of criminal law in Pakistan. In certain cases, when both parties agree to reach a financial settlement, the court can take the settlement into consideration instead of jail time. Also, the courts can order financial reparations instead of imprisonment, Zia said. According to a report published in April by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, 869 women in that country were victims of honor killings last year. Honor-based violence has been reported in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Germany, India, Iraq, Iran, Italy, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Sweden, Turkey, Uganda, the United Kingdom and the United States, the U.N. said in a report titled ""Global Violence Against Women in the Name of 'Honour.'"" Hameed said Iqbal was on the run for several weeks after killing his first wife and eluded arrest, and those facts would be incorporated into the report on Parveen's killing.

"(CNN) -- A month after a devastating earthquake sent a wall of water across the Japanese landscape, the global terrain of the atomic power industry has been forever altered. The ongoing drama at the power plant in Fukushima -- a name now ranked alongside Three Mile Island and Chernobyl as history's worst nuclear accidents -- has erased the momentum the nuclear industry has seen in recent years. The growth in the emerging world, such as China and India, fueled increased demand in planned reactors. Oil-rich regions like the United Arab Emirates and smaller nations like Vietnam announced plans to build nuclear reactors in the past year. Once the bane of environmentalists, the nuclear industry enjoyed newfound ""green"" credentials as a cleaner alternative to coal-fired plants that belch greenhouse gases to produce electricity. Before Fukushima, a ""nuclear renaissance"" -- as it was termed in the press -- seemed well underway, except for this point: Nuclear power, as a total of world energy supply, has been in steady decline for the past decade. From 2000 to 2008, nuclear energy dropped from 16.7% to 13.5% of global energy production, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2009. The 2010-11 preliminary report, expected to be released Wednesday, will show the downward trend has continued, according to study author Mycle Schneider. While nuclear energy production has steadily increased, its piece of the global electricity pie is shrinking compared to traditional sources such as coal and alternatives like wind and solar power. ""This doesn't indicate there is a nuclear revival,"" said Brahma Chellaney, one of the architects of India's atomic strategy and a fellow at the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi. ""Had Fukushima happened two years later, the renaissance may have been underway. But if (the nuclear industry) was hoping for a real revival, you can safely say this won't happen now."" Political fallout . The shockwaves from the Fukushima plant disaster shook German politics, which could have economic implications far beyond the nuclear industry as Germany -- the largest economy in Europe -- attempts to steer the eurozone out of its debt crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats suffered a historic loss to the Green Party during a key state election in Baden-Württemberg, a traditional stronghold for Merkel's party. The elections came two weeks after the Japan disaster and the defeat was attributed in large part to nuclear fears in the wake of Fukushima and Merkel's pro-nuclear credentials. (Merkel temporarily shut down seven of the nation's 17 reactors and talked about an ""exit strategy"" from nuclear power in the week between the Japan temblor and the state elections; critics accused Merkel of flip-flopping to reflect a shift in opinion away from nuclear power.) The political hot potato playing out in Germany can be expected elsewhere as aging reactors come up for extension of licenses or replacement in the U.S., the UK and Japan. The average age of the world's 443 nuclear reactors is 25 years, according to the World Nuclear Industry Status Report. ""In the next 10 years, nuclear power will face enormous public pressure in large democracies like the U.S. and India,"" said Chellaney, a nuclear energy proponent. China, by far, has the largest number of plants planned with 27 reactors currently under construction, followed by 11 in Russia, and five apiece in India and South Korea, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Beijing announced that China would temporarily suspend construction of new plants pending review of the Fukushima incident, but few analysts believe China will scuttle planned reactors. ""The countries that are going to do big builds ... have said loudly and clearly, we are not backing down from nuclear energy,"" said Margaret Harding of the American Nuclear Society, a group for nuclear industry professionals. Fear factor . Nuclear power has had an uphill climb in public perception since the 1945 explosions over Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of World War II first put the word ""atomic"" onto headlines across the globe. ""Radiation in particular is a scary thing -- we can't see, we can't touch it, you can't look at the ground and know its there,"" said Harding, a former vice president of engineering at GE Nuclear Energy who now advises companies on nuclear industry issues. ""(Nuclear power) gets conflated in people's minds with weapons,"" Harding said. ""The fact that the first controlled nuclear plants were to run submarines and other military secrets, there is a web of secrecy as to what you can talk about, which adds to the mystique."" While the devastation in Fukushima is ""horrible,"" Harding and other nuclear proponents argue that nuclear crises aren't being judged by the same yardstick as other -- and statistically more deadly -- industrial disasters. ""Look at Bhopal: thousands of people died there -- did people walk away from chemical engineering?"" said Harding, referring to the 1984 Union Carbide chemical plant disaster in India. There were no deaths at the 1979 Three Mile Island crisis in the U.S. A 2005 report from the World Health Organization said as many as 4,000 people may die of radiation exposure from the 1986 Chernobyl disaster in Russia, although fewer than 50 deaths were directly attributed to the disaster. ""The numbers don't lie, coal kills millions every year"" through air pollution, said Michael Shellenberger, head of the Breakthrough Institute, a think tank that aims to modernize liberal thought, at Fortune's Brainstorm Green conference last week in California. Green nukes . When Harding moved to California in 1981, the young nuclear engineer attended a meeting of the Sierra Club, the environmental group. ""When they found out what I did, they kicked me out,"" Harding recalled. In the past decade, however, many environmentalists have embraced nuclear power as a better alternative than coal and gas-fired plants to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. France, for example, gets 75% of its power from nuclear plants -- the highest ratio in the world, according to the IAEA. By comparison, the U.S. gets just under 20% of its power from nuclear, although it has the most reactors in operation -- 104 reactors, nearly double the number in France. ""France's advance in terms of nuclear and hydraulic energy generation (allows) the country to maintain its emissions at the same level as they were in 1990,"" said Sabine Mezard, a spokesperson for French energy giant EDF. Still, the early promise of nuclear energy as a cheap, clean form of energy has never materialized. Costs of nuclear power plants can be as high as $10 billion, according to a 2010 report by the CIGI Nuclear Energy Futures Project at Carleton University in Canada. The average construction time is seven years, but with licensing approval new builds often take a decade, Schneider said. What's the alternative? Alternative energy production is faster and cheaper, Schneider said. ""In the U.S. in 2004, 2% of all new power produced that year came from alternative energy sources ... by 2009, 55% of all new power was from alternatives,"" Schneider said. ""There's no way nuclear could add that much, that fast."" Nuclear power reactors are dependent on government subsidies and loan guarantees to be built, cover costs in case of accidents and assume long-term responsibility for storage of spent radioactive fuel, critics say, which artificially lowers the cost of production. ""These plants are 30-year investments -- it's hard to get the market interested in more than two-year investments, and loan guarantees are not a subsidy,"" countered Harding of the American Nuclear Society. Government backing of insurance in case of disasters has resulted because ""the nuclear industry has had so few accidents, there is no actuarial for insurance companies on which to offer an insurance policy,"" she added. Market reaction has been swift against the nuclear industry after the Fukushima disaster. Companies on the Standard & Poor's Clean Energy Index rose on average 17% in the wake of the disaster, while companies on the S&P Nuclear Index fell 8.7%. ""We expect a number of impacts from the public and political backlash against nuclear, which could mean the focus switches to renewables,"" an HSBC report said in March. Still, no one expects the industry to fade. The U.S., Japan, South Korea, Russia and France have significant nuclear industries with important strategic as well as economic interests, analysts say. ""No one is going to walk away,"" Harding said. ""If the U.S. wants to be a leader in this technology, they've got to be playing in this technology.""","Nuclear power dropped from 16.7% to 13.5% of global energy from 2000 to 2008 .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Police arrested rapper-producer Kanye West on Thursday morning at Los Angeles International Airport on felony vandalism charges after an altercation with two paparazzi, airport police said. Kanye West attends a fashion show in New York City on Monday. The incident near the airport's Terminal 4 involved the rap star; his road manager and bodyguard, Don Crowley; and a photographer and a cameraman who were taking their photos, airport police said. The cameras of the paparazzi were damaged in the altercation, police said. West, 31, and Crowley were both arrested on charges of felony vandalism. Initial police reports that said Crowley also had been charged with battery were incorrect, police said. West was released later Thursday after posting $20,000 bond, according to Los Angeles police Officer Julianne Sohn. West, a 10-time Grammy winner, and Crowley were in the airport to catch a flight to Honolulu, Hawaii, police said. The pair were outside passenger security screening when the incident took place. Both men were taken to a Los Angeles police station for booking, airport police said. Neither of the paparazzi were identified. CNN could not immediately reach West's publicist for comment. Celebrity Web site TMZ reported that the rap star is said to have grabbed a photographer's camera as the photographer was snapping pictures of West. The site posted a video of the incident shot by one of its reporters, who was also in the terminal. The video was short and chaotic, and the man whom TMZ identifies as West never shows his face, which is shrouded in the hood of a gray sweatshirt.  Watch video of the scuffle » . According to the Web site, after West grabbed the camera from the photographer, Crowley took it from him, leaving the rap star with the lighting component. The video shows the man in the gray sweatshirt and another man in a red sweatshirt, whom TMZ identifies as Crowley, each smashing parts of a camera on the floor. The man in red then approaches another camera as it is filming. He reaches out for the camera, and it appears that a struggle ensues. As airport officials arrive, the man walks off. TMZ reported that after the incident with the first photographer, Crowley grabbed the TMZ reporter's camera and broke it. Police stopped West and Crowley as they tried to leave to go through security to board a plane, the Web site said. TMZ is partly owned by AOL, part of CNN's parent company, Time Warner. West quickly became a hip-hop star after his first album, ""College Dropout,"" debuted in 2004, earning him a Best Rap Album Grammy that year. He twice matched that feat with 2005's ""Late Registration"" and 2007's ""Graduation."" West also has won three Best Rap Song Grammys for his hits ""Jesus Walks,"" ""Diamonds from Sierra Leone"" and ""Good Life."" His other four Grammy's were two Best Rap Solo Performance awards, one for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and one for Best R&B Song for his role in helping write ""You Don't Know My Name,"" performed by Alicia Keys. The rapper is also known for controversial outbursts, most notably in 2005, when he went off script during an NBC telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina, saying, ""George Bush doesn't care about black people.""","NEW: West released on $20,000 bond, police say .

"(CNN) -- Sir Elton John is a father. The boy was born on Christmas Day. And he shall be Levon. Or, more accurately, Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John, the singer's publicist said late Monday. ""We are overwhelmed with happiness and joy at this very special moment,"" John and his long-time partner, David Furnish, said in a statement. ""Zachary is healthy and doing really well, and we are very proud and happy parents."" John and Furnish formalized their relationship in a much-publicized civil partnership ceremony in 2005 after 12 years together. The ceremony was held at the Windsor Guildhall -- the same venue where Britain's Prince of Wales and Camilla Parker Bowles married. John has a residence in Windsor, outside of London. The baby was born in California via a surrogate, according to Fran Curtis, a representative for the couple. Curtis said she would not discuss the details of the surrogacy arrangements. Like his namesake in John's early 1970s hit ""Levon,"" the baby boy was born on Christmas Day and weighed 7 pounds, 15 ounces, Curtis said. In addition to ""Levon,"" where the couple apparently snatched one of the baby's middle names, other classic John songs are likely to take on new meaning, such as ""I Guess That's Why they Call It The (Baby) Blues"" and ""I'm Still Standing"" for the toddler years. CNN's KJ Matthews contributed to this report.","Zachary Jackson Levon Furnish-John was born on Christmas Day .
