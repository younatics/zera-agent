"By . Chris Foy for The MailOnline . Follow @@FoyChris . When Stuart Lancaster had lunch with Bath head coach Mike Ford at a village pub outside Bradford-on-Avon earlier this month, Sam Burgess’s cross-code move was high on their mutual agenda. By the time they went their separate ways, the two men had a mutual vision too – of club and country being best served by the recruit from rugby league wearing No 12 on his back. In time, Bath may utilise Burgess as a back-row force of nature, but initially at least, he will serve a midfield apprenticeship, which suits England just fine. For now, the 25-year-old is focused on propelling his Australian club, South Sydney Rabbitohs, to the NRL title as a fitting sign-off before coming home and preparing for a crash course in the 15-man game, starting in October. Soon enough though, Bath expect him to be wreaking havoc at centre and Lancaster will monitor his progress in the hope that it leads him all the way into next year’s World Cup squad. Highly-rated: Big things are expected of Sam Burgess when he makes the switch from rugby league to union . International: Burgess dives for the line representing England's rugby league team . Ford revealed that he and the England head coach held face-to-face talks about Burgess and that it was very much a meeting of like minds: ‘I went for lunch with Stuart and we discussed it,’ said the long-time defence coach of the national team. ‘We’ve both got the same view really, in terms of where he is best off starting. ‘I think if he’s got any chance of playing for England at the World Cup, it is going to be at inside centre. I can understand that if he impresses at 12 for us; that is probably where England will look to put him. I spoke to Stuart about that. ‘I get a sense that they (England) are looking at him for his leadership qualities as well. When the opposition have a purple patch, who are the guys you turn to? He is certainly one guy who would just say, “Give me the ball and I’ll get us back on track now”. ‘Every coach is looking for a player like that. We talked about the way Stuart wants to play the game and clearly the 12 is a massive player in what you can and can’t do. He’s pretty clear, Stuart, in what he wants. His view on Sam is, “Let’s see how he goes at Bath” and if he plays really, really well they will probably look at him for their wider World Cup squad.’ Future planning: Stuart Lancaster, England head coach, has big plans for powerful Burgess . New boy: Bath coach Mike Ford will welcome Burgess to the fold in October . Despite the impression that Bath’s positional deployment of Burgess will suit the national cause, Ford was adamant that no pressure was applied – once the RFU had abandoned their intention to assist with the transfer fee. ‘He is our player,’ he said. ‘Bruce (Craig, Bath’s owner) paid for him. It was a normal transaction and we decide on how he is developed.’ As a former league international himself, Ford believes that Burgess will be in the right place for his education in union. He travelled to Australia to visit the player and his family back in June, armed with a hefty manual on the ‘Bath way’ and words of reassurance for a worried mother. ‘I spent eight days in Sydney,’ he said. ‘I saw him for three or four days. I met his family. He has a ritual, every night before a game his brothers come over for spaghetti bolognese – I got invited to that. I spoke to his mum about his move; she is from Dewsbury, her little boy is going back to England and she is upset. I said, “Look, I’ve got three boys, there’s one in Bath, one in Sale, one in London. You are quite lucky that all your boys are playing for the same team”.’ League connection: New Bath team-mate Kyle Eastmond knows Burgess from his time in rugby league . Double act: George Ford and Burgess could link up for Bath and England . Burgess has watched the Sydney-based Waratahs – the Super 15 champions – in training and spent time with their coach, Michael Cheika. He was also in the stands to watch Australia draw with the All Blacks earlier this month. He is gradually trying to adopt a rugby union mind-set, without detracting from the pressing task of finishing his league career on a glorious high. There is a buzz of anticipation at Bath about the high-profile arrival from the rival code. Some of the playing are ‘stalking him on Twitter’. Kyle Eastmond, who has already made the switch from league at St Helens to Bath and into the England team, is looking forward to renewing an old acquaintance, even though he and Burgess may be competing for the same starting place. ‘I’ve known Sam since I was 12,’ he said. ‘I’ve played with him all the way through; for Lancashire against Yorkshire, training camps, representative, national. I know what he’s like. He’ll come in here, work hard, be patient, learn the game. ‘He’s a great player and a friend of mine, so I’m looking forward to him getting here. In camps with him, Sam was always a stand-out player, he loves the contact, is always flying around making tackles and he has gone on to have a great career. I hope he’s going to have a great career in union. ‘It’s unbelievable, to think all those years ago all we thought of was playing rugby league and here we both will be at Bath. It’s going to be awesome and nice to have someone with you that you’ve been playing with since you were a young lad.’ There is history between Burgess and George Ford too. Mike’s son; the Bath and England fly half, recalled an amusing first meeting between them, saying: ‘He was at Bradford Bulls, I was about 15, 16 and I was making the decision whether to go to Bradford or Leicester. He came to the house with Steve McNamara (Bradford coach at the time) and basically said, “Sign for Bradford, it’s going places, we’ve got a young team…”. Six months later he signed for South Sydney – and I went to Leicester!’ Now, several years on, belatedly the pair will be joining forces, in what could emerge as a potent 10-12 combination for Bath. In time, they could form an effective double-act for England too.","Burgess will link up with Bath in October for his high-profile cross-code switch .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . A pioneering crook got away with £24,000 after 3D printing fake cashpoints facades, only to be caught because he used his own card to test them out. The thief, named Hamid P, used the printer to make fake fronts for ATM machines so he could clone hundreds of people's cards. When unsuspecting members of the public put their cards into the cashpoints in Nimes and Saint-Ambroix, southern France, they also put them through a 'skimmer' which was hidden by the 34-year-old fraudster. Scroll down for video . The thief, known only as Hamid P, 3D printed fake fronts for cashpoints to scam credit card users (file pic) Skimmers register card details and were found behind the fake machine fronts that Hamid P had secretly installed. The machine would then dispense cash as normal, leaving the user completely unaware that their details had been stolen. A police source told Le Parisien: 'The fake fronts were of a good quality and were different to those we normally see.' Hamid P was on the run with £24,000 of stolen money before the scam came to light when the bank discovered the false fronts. Police tracked him down as he had used his own credit card in the machine to test whether it worked. He was arrested in Marseille this month. When the police found the 3D printer at his home he admitted to the scam and has been charged with fraud. In September 2011 an American gang were prosecuted after stealing more than £241,000 by using the same 3D-printed fake ATM fronts scam. A gang in Australia were also caught out after scamming £56,000 from card users with a similar ploy. Criminals have also used the revolutionary printers to make keys and guns. However the machines have been put to good use too, to make objects including houses, replacement knees, and even 'mini-me' models. 3D printers, such as this CubeX Trio, can now be bought for home use. It is thought that the thief used a much larger 3D printer to make the fake ATM fronts, which were used in Nimes and Saint-Ambroix, southern France .","Man, known only as Hamid P, made ATM facades with a 3D printer .

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Hull KR have announced that Chris Chester is now their head coach on a permanent basis after almost two months in temporary charge. The 35-year-old former Rovers player and assistant coach became caretaker boss following the departure of Australian Craig Sandercock on July 3 and has now signed a three-year contract. Hull KR won just two of their six matches under the temporary guidance of Chester but that included the scalp of leaders St Helens and in their last match they held reigning champions Wigan to a draw to keep alive their Super League play-off hopes. Done deal: Hull KR have announced that Chris Chester is now their head coach on a permanent basis . Hull KR chief executive Mike Smith said: 'It's always been the plan to bring somebody through the ranks to one day take over as head coach and Chris has started very well in the role. 'He is somebody who understands the club and the squad of players he will be working with, but more importantly he is a young British coach who is ready for this position and responsibility. 'He's learnt his trade and he's very well respected within the game. The board had no hesitation in backing him with a three-year deal and I'm sure the fans will now join us in giving him their full support for the rest of this season and beyond.' Chester, who is nine months older than the youngest Super League coach, Wakefield's James Webster, joined Hull KR's backroom staff in 2008 after retiring as a player, working as assistant to both Sandercock and his predecessor Justin Morgan. 'I'm absolutely delighted,' Chester said. 'It's a dream come true for me and I'm going to do my utmost to get this side back to where it belongs. 'It's a great honour and privilege to be the head coach of Hull Kingston Rovers and I want to put on record my thanks to the directors who have been fantastic with me over the past six weeks. 'It's been a testing period with some ups and downs but I've really enjoyed the opportunity. I've not been afraid to make the big decisions, I've been honest with the players and they've been honest with me in return, so hopefully that will continue. 'The squad is coming together for next season - we've signed some exciting outside backs and we've hopefully got some more signings to be announced - but we're still very much focused on our goals this year. 'There's six points up for grabs and we've got to make sure we finish the season strongly and as high up that ladder as we possibly can. 'Moving forwards, I think we're better than just fighting for that eighth spot. We've struggled consistency wise this season and that's something that as coaches and players we have to address.' Chester's first match in his confirmed role will be Friday's derby against Hull FC, one of his former clubs, at the KC Stadium.","The 35-year-old became caretaker boss in July .

The Deutsche Bank Championship offers a prize fund of almost £5million with £870,000 going to the winner, but it will also effectively act as the last qualifying event for the Ryder Cup. Although qualifying for the United States team ended after the US PGA Championship and does so for the European team in Italy on Sunday, the second FedEx Cup play-off event could have major implications for several players. Both US captain Tom Watson and European counterpart Paul McGinley will name their three wild cards on Tuesday, the day after the Deutsche Bank concludes in Boston. McGinley said on Wednesday that 'something spectacular' could yet influence his decision, with Luke Donald and Ian Poulter both hoping to produce precisely that kind of performance to boost their case for a pick. Wildcard: Paul McGinley will announce his three Ryder Cup wildcard choices on Tuesday . VIDEO McGinley nears Ryder Cup decisions . Donald, who has won 10 and a half points from 15 Ryder Cup matches, is currently 80th in the FedEx Cup and needs to finish inside the top 40 in Boston to qualify for the third play-off event, the BMW Championship. Poulter, who has won 12 of his 15 previous Ryder Cup clashes, starts the week in 90th and needs to finish around 20th or better to climb inside the top 70 and claim a place in the field at Cherry Hills Country Club next week. As for the American team, Hunter Mahan became favourite for a wild card with his victory in the first play-off event, which leapfrogged him above Rory McIlroy at the top of the standings. Keegan Bradley, who was 13th in Ryder Cup qualifying, would also appear to be high on Watson's radar despite missing the cut in the US PGA and finishing 53rd last week, his three wins out of three matches with Phil Mickelson at Medinah strongly in his favour. Hopefuls: Ian Poulter, Luke Donald and Lee Westwood will all hope to be chosen as one of the three . Brandt Snedeker finished 20th in qualifying but looks to be rounding into form at the right time, finishing tied for 12th at the Bridgestone, 13th at the US PGA and fifth at the Wyndham Championship before missing the cut at The Barclays. While the top 100 in the FedEx Cup standings are eligible to compete in Boston, only 94 players will start on Friday. Graeme McDowell and Paul Casey both withdrew for family reasons, with McDowell's wife giving birth to the couples first child on Monday while Casey's fiancee is due to give birth shortly. Sergio Garcia and Justin Rose opted to rest ahead of the remaining events while Jason Dufner's season is officially over after bulging discs in his neck forced another withdrawal.

The top tier of Wembley Stadium will be closed for the first time at an England game because of the poor crowd expected for Wednesday’s friendly against Norway. The FA expect between 35,000 and 40,000 — less than half the 90,000 capacity. That would make it the lowest attendance since the new stadium opened in 2007. The previous lowest was in November 2011 when 48,876 turned up for a friendly against Sweden. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Rooney and Welbeck lead England train ahead of Norway .

England attracted 68,573 against Denmark in March and 83,578 against Peru in May, their two friendlies before the World Cup. But the fans have voted with their feet in the wake of a diabolical performance at the World Cup — England’s worst in a finals since 1958. England’s new captain Wayne Rooney insists the figures are still promising considering events in Brazil. He said: ‘It is lower than normal, but still 40,000 or so, which is great considering the disappointment at the World Cup. ‘We’re always grateful to the fans, their support is second to none. Hopefully we can repay them with some good performances and exciting, attractive football to qualify for Euro 2016. That starts when we play Norway.’ Opposition: Norway train at Wembley on Tuesday ahead of the international friendly . England manager Roy Hodgson added: ‘We can’t turn back the clock, we can’t play Uruguay and Italy again. We can only play the game against Norway. 'We are desperate to entertain the crowd who turn up. We’ve played matches against opponents who will not pull crowds in — San Marino, Moldova — in the last few years and had fantastic support. 'We had a group of fans in Brazil who were fantastic. We’re happy with 40,000.’ Preparation: England begin their road to Euro 2016 after a disappointing World Cup .

"By . Chris Cutmore for MailOnline . Follow @@Chris_Cutmore . Former Manchester United academy graduate Keith Gillespie has hit back at Mike Phelan's accusation that Manchester United have 'lost the way' by splurging £150million on foreign imports. United shipped out homegrown players in Danny Welbeck, who was sold to Arsenal, and Tom Cleverley, who joined Aston Villa on loan, to help pay for their summer spree, which included Radamel Falcao's £6million season-long loan on £280,000-per-week wages. But while Phelan lamented what he saw as the loss of a United identity cultivated by Sir Alex Ferguson, Gillespie says Louis van Gaal had no choice but to overhaul his squad and stop the 'death by 1000 cuts' being suffered at Old Trafford since the legendary Scot's retirement. VIDEO Scroll down for Radamel Falcao has moved to Manchester United from Monaco . Big-money signing: Manchester United left it late to sign Radamel Falcao on deadline day . 'In all honesty the players Louis van Gaal has moved on would have been my choice to,' said Gillespie on Twitter. 'Welbeck, Nani and Cleverley (were) never (seen) as United players. 'Drastic action was needed. Pursuing the path United were on was death by 1000 cuts. Quality of competing clubs was way better. We're back.' Gillespie burst into the United first team in 1993 as a lightning-quick winger in the mould of Ryan Giggs, but a series of personal issues, most notably a gambling addiction, meant he never fulfilled his huge potential. Nevertheless, the Northern Irishman enjoyed a top-flight career at United, Newcastle and Blackburn, and won 86 caps for his country. Concerns: Mike Phelan says Manchester United have lost their way with their summer spending . Class of 92: Keith Gillespie (second right) alongside United's most famous youth team, which included David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Gary Neville, Phil Neville and Nicky Butt, who all became legends at Old Trafford . Despite his breakthrough as a footballer coming through the ranks at Old Trafford, Gillespie insists that United must not be hampered by an ideal of developing youth players and instead should do anything required to achieve success on the pitch - even if that means making a break from Ferguson's methods. 'The United philosophy should be to compete and succeed at the highest level,' he added. 'It wasn't working. I believe it will now. Change had to come. 'Reality (is) United have to have the best players available to compete. Any youth system might assist in that quest but cannot be relied upon. Star signing: Angel di Maria joined Manchester United from Real Madrid for £59.7m . Finally, Gillespie posed a teasing question to Ferguson's former assistant: 'The question for Mike Phelan is if he had an option of Welbeck or Falcao in his team who would he choose?' Van Gaal's summer spending spree has included a British transfer record of £60m on Angel di Maria, plus Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, and Daley Blind. Phelan suggested this showed a lack of faith in United's youth system, renowned in the past for its production line of world-class talent like David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, who played alongside Gillespie in United's youth teams. 'Interesting how things have changed at Manchester United now,' said Phelan, Ferguson's right-hand man between 2008 and 2013, to BBC Radio 5 Live. 'A good young kid (Welbeck) coming through - part of the academy system - and they've finally decided now that might not be the way to go so they've moved him on. 'Obviously there is more and more money now in the game, looking further and further afield for players but probably they have lost the way of Manchester United a little bit in the fact that now rather than produce it may be the case where they're buying in.'","Manchester United spent over £150m on new signings this summer transfer window .

Despite the inquest into the Three Lions' miserable summer still being in full flow, they had to begin looking to the future at a sparsely-filled Wembley Stadium on Wednesday evening. The matchday programme called this 'a new journey' - one which began with the public's apathy still evident, with the lowest turnout for an international fixture since the stadium opened in 2007. No way past: Norway's Per Ciljan Skjelbred shoots as England's Phil Jones (right) tries to block . Never in doubt: England captain Wayne Rooney smashes home a penalty to give England the lead at Wembley . Just 40,181 made their way to Wembley, where a Wayne Rooney penalty was all they had to cheer about in an underwhelming display. It may not have been a performance that will strike fear into opponents, but a win defender Jones knows was important after the World Cup. 'They made it difficult,' the defender said. 'I thought we started the game really well, took control of the game. 'It was disappointing at the start of the second half. I thought we were a bit slow and sloppy in possession, but I thought we finished the game well. 'You're always going to get teams coming here making it difficult for us, making the pockets of space even tighter for the likes of Raheem (Sterling) and that to get on the ball. Sparse: The teams line up before kick-off with a sea of empty seats in the background at Wembley Stadium . All smiles: Rooney is congratulated after scoring the winner for England in his first match as captain . 'It is always important to bounce back after really disappointing times. 'It was a great exercise for us, they made it difficult for us. It was nice to get the win and overall it was a positive performance. 'I think we created quite a few chances, but just didn't stick them in the net. 'I am delighted for Wayne. He is always calm, composed and will make a great captain.' The Norway match was a good opportunity to blow away the cobwebs ahead of the main event: Monday's trip to Switzerland. The match in Basle is the toughest-looking of England's European Championship qualifying group and one they will need to raise their game for. Well played, captain: Rooney shakes hands with manager Roy Hodgson after being substituted at Wembley . Abject: England struggled to register shots on target against Norway and will need to improve quickly . 'It will be a very difficult test,' Jones said. 'They pose a good threat on the attack and I am sure we will study them in detail. I am looking forward to the game.' As well as Monday's match, Jones is looking forward to returning to club duty with Manchester United. Things have not gone to plan under Louis van Gaal, but the deadline-day arrival of Radamel Falcao has brought with it a feelgood factor. 'He is a massive player, a great signing for us,' Jones said. 'Hopefully he can hit the ground running and score us a few goals' It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There's £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .","Wayne Rooney scored from penalty spot as England beat Norway 1-0 at Wembley on Wednesday night .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Fifteen-year-old American wild card Cici Bellis stunned Australian Open finalist Dominika Cibulkova in the biggest upset of the US Open so far. Bellis, the number two junior in the world, was making her grand slam debut and showed remarkable composure to win 6-1 4-6 6-4 against the 12th seed. Cibulkova looked to be on her way to victory after recovering from a chastening first set to win the second and then lead 3-1 in the third. Delight: The young star celebrates her win against the 12th seed in the US Open first round . Serving up a shock: Although she is junior world no 2, little was expected of the 15-year-old wildcard . But back came Bellis and in her first ever tour-level match she broke the Cibulkova serve in the final game to take victory in a raucous atmosphere on Court 6. Bellis, ranked 1,208, is the youngest player to win a match at the US Open since Anna Kournikova in 1996. 'I went into the match thinking it was going to be such a great experience, but I never thought I would come out on top,' said the teenager, who next plays Kazakh Zarina Diyas. 'It's crazy to think that I'm actually here right now with all these other people. I never thought I would be practising or sharing a court with a player that I watch on TV frequently. It's crazy. But I love it.' Strain: Cibulkova looked to have sorted out her problems in the second set but Bellis came back to win . Bellis' amateur status means she is unable to claim the more than 60,000 US dollars in prize money for a first-round victory, but she is in no rush to turn professional. She said: 'I think I'm definitely going to stay an amateur right now to keep my options open for college, in case an injury or something happens. But I'd love to be a pro one day.' Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova avoided a repeat of 2011 in emphatic fashion with a 6-1 6-0 victory over Kristina Mladenovic. The first time the Czech won the All England Club title three years ago she struggled to deal with the expectation and lost in the first round at Flushing Meadows. Disbelief: Bellis sinks to her knees after winning the final point of a pulsating match . Kvitova, seeded third, went into the tournament with a title under her belt from New Haven on Saturday and is hoping to go beyond the fourth round for the first time. 'The other grand slams are a big challenge for me right now to do a good result,' she said. 'Especially here, where I don't really have a good result. So I'm really motivated to do well here. I remember 2011 when I lost my first round after winning Wimbledon, so I'm just glad that I'm better already.' Eugenie Bouchard showed once again that she is a different animal at the grand slams with a 6-2 6-1 victory over Olga Govortsova. Determined: Petra Kvitova performed better this time than the last time she came as Wimbledon champion . The seventh seed has won only won match since losing to Kvitova in the Wimbledon final but put her shaky form behind her. 'I'm happy,' said Bouchard, who has made at least the semi-finals at every grand slam this year. 'It's definitely never easy in the first round of a grand slam so I'm happy to get a win under my belt. I want to get on a roll and keep the momentum going.' Bouchard only made her debut at the US Open last year, losing a close match to Angelique Kerber in the second round. 'I was just very excited to be on-site in the main locker room, all that stuff,' recalled Bouchard. 'Going into this one, I feel like the past few weeks have been a bit of a struggle. I don't feel like I'm putting too many high expectations on myself. But I have the inner confidence that if I'm playing as well as I know I can, that I can do well.' Experienced: Bouchard says she is much better prepared this year after a second round exit 12 months ago . Victoria Azarenka survived a three-set tussle with Misaki Doi before grinding out a 6-7 (3/7) 6-4 6-1 win. Azarenka has lost to Serena Williams in the final the last two years but the chances of her making it a hat-trick of finals look very slim. The Belarusian is only seeded 16th after a nightmare season of injury and poor form and made heavy weather of beating her diminutive Japanese opponent. Pleased: The Canadian saw off Olga Govortsova in straight sets, dropping just three games in the process . There were no such problems for eighth seed Ana Ivanovic, who is back in the top 10 and having her best season since winning the French Open in 2008. The Serbian eased past American Alison Riske 6-3 6-0 and next plays Czech Karolina Pliskova. There were differing fortunes for two former champions, with Sam Stosur beating Lauren Davis 6-1 6-4 but Svetlana Kuznetsova marking the 10th anniversary of her title by losing in a third-set tie-break to Marina Erakovic.

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Gareth Southgate has delivered a stark warning to England’s young hopefuls, saying they will have no international future unless they show total commitment to his project. The Under 21 head coach names his squad for the forthcoming Euro 2015 qualifiers against Lithuania and Moldova on Thursday but it is unlikely to contain Everton’s John Stones or Arsenal’s Calum Chambers. Both defenders are expected to be selected for senior duty. There will also be no place for Wilfried Zaha or Ravel Morrison. They were key players in Southgate’s early games in charge but have slipped out of contention, while others like Swansea’s Jonjo Shelvey and Conor Wickham of Sunderland have never been selected. Warning: Gareth Southgate has told young England hopefuls they must show commitment to his project . Senior duty: Young defender Calum Chambers and John Stones are expected to be selected by England . Manchester United winger Zaha, who last week was caught speeding in his £188,000 Lamborghini Gallardo in Surrey, withdrew from the last squad Southgate selected to face Wales in May due to a minor injury, while West Ham midfielder Morrison has had his own fitness problems. But until the pair prove they are up to speed physically and ready to dedicate themselves, Southgate will stick with the group that has taken England to the brink of next summer’s tournament in the Czech Republic. ‘The door will always be open for lads to work their way back in,’ said Southgate. ‘But we want to be world champions and to get there it is going to take a certain mindset. We have a group of players who have that mindset. Penalty: Manchester United winger Wilfried Zaha was caught speeding in his £188,000 Lamborghini Gallardo . ‘If players don’t match that mentality and people pull out of squads, others will come in. It will be hard to get back in. ‘We had some boys who over the course of last year did not necessarily buy into what we wanted to do. I am only prepared to work with players who are committed to being the best they can be. There has to be a commitment to the international programme and a recognition of the values. We are not running a community programme. This is an elite sporting environment. ‘Not everybody has wanted to be where Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole have been. That is why they have got 100 caps and won the Champions League; they have been prepared to commit to being the very best. They are world class for a reason.’ Gerrard believes Raheem Sterling has the potential to win 100 caps and Southgate feels the Liverpool winger has an outstanding chance of reaching that target because of his mentality. Sterling is still eligible for Under 21 duty but Southgate feels he has graduated to the seniors. ‘He is a boy who posts a picture of himself in the gym straight after coming back from the World Cup so that tells you what he is like and something about his mentality,’ said Southgate. ‘The way he has started with Liverpool tells you that he doesn’t think, “Oh that was good, I’ve made it”. ‘It looks like he has had a taste of it and he likes it and he wants to go again. He is a tough kid and he wants to be the best he can.’ Potential: Former England captain Steven Gerrard believes Raheem Sterling can win 100 caps for his country .","Gareth Southgate warns young England hopefuls they must show commitment to his project .

"By . Chris Waugh . Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has heaped praise on former team-mate Daniel Sturridge - labelling the Liverpool forward as 'one of the best strikers in the world'. Kompany will come face-to-face with Sturridge once more on Monday night as City host Liverpool in the Premier League at the Etihad Stadium. And the Belgian expects a tough test from Brendan Rodgers' men, who he does not believe have been greatly weakened by the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona. Top: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge 'one of the best strikers in the world', says Man City's Vincent Kompany . Star performer: City captain Kompany expects a tough challenge from Liverpool at the Etihad on Monday night . Game winner: The forward scored the vital winning goal against Southampton last Sunday . Kompany told skysports.com: 'Suarez is a world-class striker and he is almost irreplaceable. However, Liverpool have strengthened in other areas and they still have one of the best strikers in the Premier League and in the world in Daniel Sturridge, who is still improving every season. 'We certainly will not be viewing them as any less of a threat from last season. If anything, we will be expecting an even tougher game and we have to make sure we are at our very best to get all three points.' Sturridge has netted an impressive 36 goals in a half-century of matches for Liverpool since moving to Anfield in January 2013 and could soon be partnered up front by former Blue Mario Balotelli. Former Blue: Sturridge played with Kompany at Manchester City before leaving the club for Chelsea in 2009 . Irreplaceable: Kompany says no-one can take Luis Suarez's place at Liverpool but they are still very strong . Elsewhere: Luis Suarez is now a distant memory as he trains with new club Barcelona after leaving Liverpool . The Italian is expected to complete a £16million move from AC Milan before Monday's match. But it is Sturridge - who scored six goals in 32 appearances for City between 2006 and 2009 before moving to Chelsea, Bolton Wanderers on loan, and then eventually to Anfield - who Kompany will be determined to keep a keen eye on at the Etihad. The City captain continued: 'He (Sturridge) was a City player, obviously, so I played with him while he was at the club and against him at Chelsea, Bolton and now Liverpool. All the way through he has always shown great talent and great ability. 'Outside the games against us, he is someone I have always wished the best for because he is a great person and a great player. He is hard to play against but, at the same time, I enjoy playing against the top strikers in the world and I consider him in that bracket.'

"By . Tara Brady . Suffering for beauty: Han Qiaoni is thought to be one of the few remaining women in China with bound feet . A 102-year-old is thought to be one of the few remaining women in China who has bound feet. Han Qiaoni, from Yuxian County in northern China's Shanxi Province, had her feet broken and bound when she was just two-years-old. She says her mother used a long cloth to wrap her toes, minus the big toe, so they were bent pressed against the sole of her foot. According to Han it took six months before she was able to walk properly and get used to the pain. Millions of Chinese women bound their feet to turn them into 'three-inch golden lotuses' or  'San Cun Jin Lian'. Having small feet was seen as beautiful and a status symbol - often the only way for a woman to marry into money. The practice was first banned in 1912 but some families would have children's feet bound in secret. Records show that footbinding dates back to the Song dynasty between 960 - 1279AD. Li Yu, who ruled over China between 961-975 is said to have fallen in love a dancer who bound her feet to look like a new moon and performed a 'lotus dance'. Over the following dynasties, footbinding became more popular and associated with the wealthy. Girls living in the countryside felt that had to bound their feet to marry a rich man. The first anti-footbinding committee was formed in Shanghai by a British priest in 1874. It wasn't until 1912 that the practice was banned and by 1915 inspectors could issue fines to anyone who bound their feet. It is believed around 40 to 50 per cent of Chinese women had bound feet during the 19th century however, all women born into the upper classses would have been subjected to the practice. Around two million Chinese women are thought to have bound their feet and in some villages like Liuyicun it continued despite being outlawed. However, despite it being a sign of beauty in China, some experts say it made women more dependent on men. Footbinding aimed to stop the growth of feet so they would not grow longer than three to four inches. A foot measuring a perfect three inches was called a 'lotus of gold' while four inches was considered silver. Millions of Chinese women bound their feet to turn them into 'three-inch golden lotuses' or  'San Cun Jin Lian' Children's bone is easier to break and mould which is why their feet were often bound from as young as two. The ritual would begin with the clipping of toe nails and soaking of feet in hot water to soften the tissue and bones. After the feet were massaged and doused with alum, all toes except for the big one would have been broken and folded under the sole. Ancient custom: Han Qiaoni who had her feet bound when she was just two-years-old . Having small feet was seen as beautiful and a status symbol - often the only way for a woman to marry into money . Painful: The custom of bandaging feet began in the 10th century and was done so Chinese women could have a chance of marrying into money . Sexual: Bound feet were also highly erotic in Chinese culture, with sex manuals describing numerous techniques to make the feet perfect . The toes would then be bound into place with a silk or cotton bandage. The bandage would be removed every two days to allow them to be washed to avoid infection. They would then immediately go back on and often tighter then before. Girls would be encouraged to walk long distances so their weight would crush their feet into shape. Shoes: Girls would use smaller sizes of footwear until their feet had shrunk to around four inches long . Throughout history, women have tried many techniques to make themselves as beautiful as possible, but foot binding may have been the most painful and debilitating. In 10th and 11th century China, girls from the upper classes would complete the practice, but it soon became a technique used by all young women in society. In Guangdong in the late 19th century, for example,the eldest daughter of a lower-class family would have their feet bound if they were . intended to be brought up as a lady. Many young girls used it because it was a mark of beauty and were was one of the main avenues for women to find a husband in China or marry into money. Women, their families, and their husbands took great pride in tiny feet, with the ideal length, being around 2.75 inches. It was also very erotic in Chinese culture with Qing Dynasty sex manuals describing 48 different ways women's feet could be bound, . The process began when girls were between four and seven years old, before the arch of the foot had developed. Their feet would be soaked in a warm mixture of animal blood and herbs. Afterwards their toe nails were clipped and they received a foot massage. Every toe was then broken except for the big toe. The broken toes would then be held tightly against the sole of the foot while the arch was forcibly . broken. Respect: Chinese women with the smallest feet were given the greatest chance of living a life of luxury and wealth . The foot was then wrapped tightly in cloth. Every day the foot would be unwrapped and wrapped again with the girls being put into smaller and smaller shoes until their foot was about 4 inches long. The process was mainly performed during the winter months, because feet were more likely to numb they would feel less pain as a result. Many of the foot bones would remain broken for years, but would start to heal as the girl grew older. However they were still prone to repeatedly re-breaking, especially during teenage years when the girl's feet were soft. Since they could not balance securely, older women who had bound feet were less able to rise from a sitting position and were more likely to fall and break their hips and other bones. Infection was the another common problem with toenails in-growing and becoming infected. Sometimes, this would mean the girl's toes would have to be peeled back and removed completely. In 1874, 60 Christian women in Xiamen called for an end of the practice and were supported by the Woman's Christian Temperance Movement in 1883. Intellectuals in China also began to realise this practice did not reflect well upon the progress of the modern rising world, suggesting it weakened the nation. In 1912, after the fall of the Qing Dynasty, the new Nationalist government banned foot binding, but it was not until the Communists took power in 1949 that a strict prohibition was enforced.","Han Qiaoni's feet were broken and bound when she was a toddler .

Neymar has endured his fair share of injury problems for Barcelona since joining the club last summer, making just 25 appearances in total last term but still scoring a respectable nine goals in the process. In an official statement on Barcelona's website they confirmed the news saying: 'Following Thursday's training session Neymar Jr. complained about some pain in his left ankle and tests have confirmed that the player has a grade 1 ankle sprain. 'The club's medical team has indicated that his return to training will depend on how the injury treatment evolves.

"By . Martha Kelner for the Daily Mail . David Rudisha is such a perennial winner that even his own coach mocked him when he missed out on gold at last month’s Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. ‘He was saying “how are you silver man?”,’ recalled the greatest two-lap runner of all time. His coach, the Irish missionary Brother Colm O’Connell, was only teasing. Anyone who appreciates Rudisha’s greatness realises it is not diminished by defeat to Nijel Amos, the 20-year-old Botswanan who was second behind Rudisha at London 2012 in what is widely accepted to have been the greatest 800 metres race in history. All smiles: David Rudisha is one of the greatest middle-distance runners in history . Second best: Rudisha was beaten into second place at the Commonwealth Games by Nijel Amos . At Hampden Park, Rudisha was not fully fit. Before March he had not been able to run for 10 months because of a knee injury. But missing out on that Commonwealth title has refocused the Kenyan ahead of Saturday’s Sainsbury’s Birmingham Grand Prix, where he will race over 600m for the first time. ‘The silver medal is what I settled for,’ said Rudisha. ‘It was the best I could do that night and I have to stay positive and learn from that. I know I wasn’t at my best. If I say “I have been out for almost a year and started training very late”, it is always going to be very difficult to be at top form. ‘Of course it’s difficult for me (not to win gold). I have to build up gradually because when you stop, you can easily lose shape. I’m not at my best, but I’m trying to get there.’ Lead: Rudisha was in front of Amos, but a late surge secured Commonwealth Games gold for the Botswanan . You can have this one: Rudisha and Amos share a joke after their 800 metres battle in Glasgow . Like all great sporting rivals, Rudisha and Amos are intent on using their battle to push the 800m world record lower than the 1min 40.91sec set by Rudisha in the Olympic final two years ago. ‘I don’t care who does it,’ Amos says. ‘I just want us both to run fast.’ Rudisha added: ‘We are looking forward to the coming years and seeing if we can bring down that world record together. It is a tough thing to go for, it needs a lot of preparation, proper training and perfect conditions.’ The world record over the rarely raced 600m is in more immediate threat tomorrow. It currently stands at 1min 12.21sec. ‘I’m planning something around there,’ said Rudisha, 25. It will not be long before he is a golden man again.

"By . Ryan Walters . Jonny Brownlee sacrificed hopes of a World Series title this season for Commonwealth glory, but he insists he still wants to prove a point to rival Javier Gomez in the final two races. It was never a secret the 24-year-old had his sights set on Glasgow gold this summer, with early-season disappoints in Yokohama and London evidence of a man who wasn’t yet at the peak of his powers. His plan paid off though as Strathclyde County Park proved a fruitful venue – Brownlee taking silver in the individual event and a gold in the relay with older brother Alistair, Jodie Stimpson and Vicky Holland. Glory: Jonny Brownlee (left) celebrates his silver medal with brother Alistair at the Commonwealth Games . Attentions now focus back on the World Series with Stockholm the venue for the penultimate leg this weekend, ahead of the Grand Final in Edmonton, Canada. And Brownlee insists while Gomez may have an unassailable lead at the top of the standings, he wants to finish the stronger with two wins from as many races. 'It has been an alright season but t has been a season of two halves,' said Brownlee. 'It didn’t start too well as I did a lot of travelling and went to Auckland, Yokohama and Cape Town and I didn’t pick up many great results. Team glory: The brothers, along with Jodie Stimpson and Vicky Holland also won gold in the team triathlon . 'My focus even then really was on the Commonwealth Games, that was what I wanted to do well in, but now with that done I can do better in the second half of the season. 'The Commonwealth Games was something that I aimed for at the start of the year and it is always great when you do well in what you have aimed for. 'To then complete the set as well for me is fantastic, as a kid I never thought I would reach this level so I am thrilled. 'I don’t think I am going to be able to become world champion now, I am behind Javier Gomez by quite a few points so I will struggle to beat him even if I do win the last two races. 'To be a world medallist and a Commonwealth medallist makes it a decent season really. I am racing in Stockholm next and that will be an interesting race as after a major Games it is always quite difficult to pick it up again but I’m back training and I want to do that. Rivals: Brownlee and Javier Gomez have been going tooth and nail against each other during the World Series . 'With two races left and because I won’t be able to win the World Series itself I want to focus all my energy on them and treat them as a mini world championships, I want to win them both.' Brownlee was allowed some downtime after the Games and in his role as a BT ambassador attending an athletics coaching session with members of The Bridge – a learning disability service for community health development organisation Health For All. The session, which took place at the John Charles Centre for Sport in Leeds, was held by charity Join In and formed part of their All Join In campaign, which aims to highlight the opportunities for integration of disabled and able-bodied sport. The next event on the calendar for their campaign is All Join In Week, which runs between August 23 and 29 – and Brownlee believes the general public can all find something rewarding from volunteering their time. Point to prove: Brownlee wants to show Gomez what he's got in the final two races of the season . 'It was inspiring for me to see people not being scared of taking something on and taking a chance is fantastic,' he added. 'Volunteering is crucial in all sports, if it wasn’t for volunteers I wouldn’t be Commonwealth champion or an Olympic medallist. 'For me personally I have not done much volunteering in sport and definitely not disability sport so All Join In Week is about encouraging people to do that. 'It might be something completely new, you may be a little nervous about it, but sport is perfect for breaking down barriers.'","Brownlee admits to sacrificing World Series title hopes this season .

"By . John Greechan for MailOnline . If winning is a habit, it’s one that Celtic would like to reacquire with some haste. If few are yet willing to entertain the notion of Ronny Deila’s men doing anything other than romping to this season’s SPFL Premiership title, they aren’t doing much cavorting at the moment. At Dens Park, they certainly played their part in a hugely entertaining 1-1 draw. Yet the fact that Paul Hartley’s home side were at least equally responsible for the thrills on a sunny afternoon said a great deal about Celtic’ s current state of readiness. When Deila admits, as he did yesterday, that his team looked ‘afraid’ in a game against newly-promoted opposition, something isn’t right. The Celtic boss insists that all will be better after the international break – and after the ins and outs of a transfer window are completed. They’ll need to be. Equaliser: Leigh Griffiths came off the bench to score and earn Celtic a point against Dundee . On Tayside, a James McPake header almost exactly one minute into this early kick-off was cancelled out when substitute Leigh Griffiths scored against one of his many former clubs not long after half-time. Over 90 minutes plus added time of cut and thrust, to and fro, give and go – not to mention some slap and tickle among a Celtic defence missing their star player, more of whom elsewhere and later, ad infinitum – both teams had their chances to win. Each settled rather uneasily for a point at the end of a day when off-field events often intruded on the thoughts of spectators. The curse of the closing days of any transfer window is that every aspect of team selection, every tiny gesture, is magnified and analysed to the nth degree. Often with good reason; most of us are long enough in the tooth to read the runes at this time of year. Virgil van Dijk being left out, then, was obvious. We knew he wanted to leave Celtic, we were aware of interest from several Premier League teams – and we knew that Celtic weren’t for turning on this issue. Opener: James McPake headed in a Phillip Roberts corner to put the hosts in front . Kris Commons being recalled, meanwhile, could be interpreted as the manager looking to rebuild some goodwill with a player whose agent is arriving in Glasgow for contract talks tomorrow. Pick your way through that one. As for Griffiths coming off the bench for the ineffectual Jo Inge Berget – hooked before half-time – to score and perform as well as any in Hoops? That’ll be the end of any silly talk about him being loaned out to Hibs. Celtic need all the livewires they can get at the moment. In a first half typified by Celtic sluggishness and Dundee’s vigour, the visitors were constantly troubled down their left flank. Partly because Emilio Izaguirre couldn’t cope with Dundee winger Philip Roberts, making his league debut for the club – and partly because Celtic counterpart Berget gave his full-back about as much protection as a paper mache tank. Berget was an empty jersey here, offering nothing in attack and less than zero in defence. On a day when Celtic could not afford to be carrying any passengers, it was a minor miracle that the Norwegian made it to 40 minutes before Deila replaced him with Griffiths. By that point Dundee were sitting fairly comfortably on a 1-0 lead, having started at a pace that clearly caught Celtic cold. It began inside the opening minute, Roberts leaving . Impressive: Dundee are currently sixth in the table, level on points with Celtic . Izaguirre for dead and forcing Jason Denayer into a last-ditch tackle at the expense of a corner. An early tester from a set piece, then. It was a test that Celtic failed. Or, rather, one passed easily by Dundee, as a Roberts delivery was met by the forehead of a soaring McPake, the bounce of his downward header beating Callum McGregor on the post. Celtic rallied to create a couple of near things but, with Peter MacDonald always lively for the home side, Dundee looked as likely to score as the reigning champions. Especially when Roberts got on the ball. The former Falkirk winger’s best moment came as he was being castigated for a perceived lack of go-forward by failing to show down the line for a breaking Paul McGowan. In reality, he was just biding his time, holding back to create the five or six yards needed to explode past Izaguirre, beat Denayer and fire in a low shot tipped on to the post by Craig Gordon. The introduction of Griffiths helped Celtic greatly, while central defender Eoghan O’Connell replacing Adam Matthews at half-time – forcing Efe Ambrose out to right back – also gave them more ability to carry the ball out from the back. Captain: Kris Commons' Celtic future is uncertain with a number of English clubs interested . When the equaliser came, with 54 minutes on the clock, no-one inside Dens would have been surprised by the identity of the scorer. They know ‘Sparky’ Griffiths in these parts. Remember him with a certain fondness. Taking the ball into feet on the edge of the box, the striker turned and hit a sweet low shot with his left foot, a deflection off the helpless Thomas Konrad helping the ball to fizz and spin beyond the reach of a despairing Kyle Letheren and in off the post. Celtic were certainly energised by the equaliser, a superb charge from O’ Connell ending with Stokes strangely choosing not to shoot, while a fading Roberts – eventually replaced – began to struggle with Izaguirre’s forward surges. Yet Dundee sub Martin Boyle, on for Roberts, could easily have scored from one of three – yes, that’s three – chances created by his blistering pace against a wandering Celtic back line. On each occasion Boyle stormed down the inside right channel, exposing gaps and skipping over a despairing Denayer at one point. Two of his shots were pulled just off target, the other swatted aside by Gordon, whose reactions were equal to the powerful thump. Chances came and went for both teams as this match rattled towards the finish, Anthony Stokes hitting the post and Griffiths forcing Letheren into a fine save from a 25-yarder that moved wickedly through the air, while Luka Tankulic twice came close to securing all three points for the hosts. It was breathless, occasionally brilliant, quite often barmy. Not the kind of experience that Celtic would like to make a habit of.","Dundee and Celtic draw 1-1 in Scottish Premiership match at Dens Park .

"By . Dale O'donnell . Sportsmail asked Manchester United blog Stretty News about the club's stuttering start under Louis van Gaal. The Old Trafford outfit were unbeaten throughout pre-season but lost their opening Premier League match 2-1 at home to Swansea. This was followed by a 1-1 draw at Sunderland on Sunday before suffering an emphatic 4-0 defeat at League One side MK Dons in the second round of the Capital One Cup. Stretty News' Dale O'Donnell gives his insight as to what's wrong at the Red Devils. Manchester United have struggled to start the new season like they would have imagined after an impressive tour of the United States. The pre-season tour saw victories over Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Roma and Liverpool but the new season has popped up with defeats against Swansea and MK Dons. Louis van Gaal is the only one that can explain what has changed in a matter of weeks, but when the 3-5-2 formation was introduced to the current United squad in Los Angeles, they put seven past David Beckham's former club LA Galaxy. Throughout the tour, Manchester United played with a high intensity, attacked quickly in numbers and moved the ball exceptionally well. Food for thought: Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has had a poor start in his new job . Winning smile: Darren Fletcher (left) and Wayne Rooney (right) lift the International Champions Cup . Thumped: Red Devils were thrashed 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup second round on Tuesday night . VIDEO Van Gaal blames injuries, errors and luck . Then, once returned in Manchester, a friendly against Valencia was organised on request of Louis van Gaal. While they won thanks to a last minute winner by Marouane Fellaini, United performed poorly and the La Liga side looked a much more comfortable unit. There was undoubtedly great excitement ahead of the new season under a manager full of experience at the top level. Van Gaal was also coming in with a change of philosophy and a similar aura to Sir Alex Ferguson. Serial winner: Sir Alex Ferguson enjoyed a trophy-laden spell whilst in charge at Old Trafford . Back in July, Van Gaal warned fans that it would take him three months to fix Manchester United and get them into shape. 'Every club where I have been, I've struggled for the first three months,' said Van Gaal, speaking in Washington DC. 'When we survive the first three months, it will be the same as for me as it was at Bayern Munich. At Bayern, after the first three months, we were sixth or seventh and we were third in our Champions League group.' Slow starter: Van Gaal admitted his reign at Bayern Munich started poorly in his first three months there too . Bereft of ideas: David Moyes was sacked as United boss in April with the club languishing in seventh . I trust Van Gaal more than I ever did under the management of David Moyes. He is a proven winner that even has a nack for overachieving with average players. When you look at the Dutch national team from the World Cup, it was hardly a side full of world beaters aside from one or two. At United right now there are lots of deadwood and players that are struggling with confidence since David Moyes' reign. In terms of giving Van Gaal time, he needs it more than ever. It can easily be argued that taking over from Moyes has been more difficult than taking over from Ferguson. The squad has withdrawn its bite and it's an even bigger ask to expect it back in one season. Meanwhile, the new system requires specific types of players in each position. The back three does seem an issue but that was always going to be the case when you lose players like Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra. Thus far, two defenders have been brought in but United's defensive crop of selections lack that experience that proves vital in tough times like these. Big miss: Manchester United have failed to replace defenders Nemanja Vidic (left) and Rio Ferdinand (right) Top talent: Summer signing Ander Herrera looks like a fantastic addition to United's midfield . In midfield we remain light. Ander Herrera has looked fantastic but is nowhere near the finished article. A signing such as Arturo Vidal or Nigel De Jong would accommodate him superbly and might even allow Louis van Gaal to play his preferred formation: 4-3-3. And while these reasons go a long way to explaining why it was always going to be a difficult to start to life under Louis van Gaal, I doubt many fans expected struggle of this magnitude. All football clubs go through transitions but that's not an excuse for losing games. Manchester United need a big win to give Van Gaal's players a boost. Roll on Burnley. On the move: Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal (right) has been linked with a move to United this summer .","Manchester United have made a poor start under new boss Louis van Gaal .

"By . Ian Drury . Updated: . 03:25 EST, 6 December 2011 . Controversy: Argentinean President Cristina Kirchner also wants her nation's Olympic team to wear badges declaring the Falklands are Argentine . Argentina has been accused of a ‘disgraceful’ campaign of intimidation against fishing boats which have UK licences to operate off the Falkland Islands. The government in Buenos Aires has stepped up its official policy of blockading the British territory by ordering the Argentine navy to board ships that it claims are fishing there illegally. Argentine president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner last year issued a decree requiring all vessels passing through its territorial waters to and from the Falklands to secure consent from Buenos Aires. In the latest breach of international law, Spanish vessels bound for the islands were intercepted and boarded by troops. The move will inflame tensions over the sovereignty of the Falklands, which are still claimed by the Argentinians despite their crushing defeat in the 1982 war. Diplomats in London were keen to play down the escalation as ‘sabre-rattling’ by President Kirchner. However, Argentina has secured a . resolution from 32 South American states at a Latin American conference . endorsing its claim to the islands, which were ceded to Britain in 1833. The intimidation has prompted a . furious response from campaign groups and politicians helping to fight . for the rights of the Falkland Islands population. Admiral Sir John ‘Sandy’ Woodward, . who led the task force to liberate the Falklands 29 years ago, said: . ‘Argentina is trying to colonise the Falklands. 'The population of the islands want to remain British but they are deaf to that in Buenos Aires. It is disgraceful.’ Bloodshed: More than 900 lives were lost when Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982 . In the latest interception, Argentine . naval commanders told the Spanish vessels they were in violation of a . blockade of sea channels to the Falklands. The trawlermen confirmed they had . faced increased pressure in the past three months, with 12 boats stopped . and threatened with fines. Buenos Aires’s ambassador to Spain . said the seas around the Falklands were ‘an integral part of the . Argentine territory’ and in a letter to Spanish fishing groups he said . his country was ‘duty bound to put an end to all those illegal fishing . activities’. The Falklands government issues licences to vessels wanting to fish inside the 200-mile maritime zone around the islands. Mike Summers, a member of the . Falkland Islands Assembly, said: ‘The Falkland Islands government has no . doubt about its right to issue licenses to foreign companies to fish in . its waters. Typhoons are met by Tornado F3 (left) as they arrive in the Falkland Islands for the first time. The RAF has four of them there as a show of strength . Boarding ships is a serious escalation by the Argentine government and it is completely contrary to international law.’ George Grant of the Henry Jackson . Society – a think-tank – said: ‘Argentina is behaving childishly by . trying to provoke a row. It is morally and legally indefensible.’ General Sir Peter de la Billiere, . vice president of the Falkland Islands Association, said: ‘Argentina is . trying to stir things up again. But we did not lay down 255 lives just . to walk out a few years later.’ Argentina’s junta invaded the islands, known in Spanish as Las Malvinas, in 1982. Margaret Thatcher sent a task force . including aircraft carriers equipped with Harrier jump jets and an . invasion force to retake the islands. Protests: Just last year the Argentine members of political and social organizations burnt a British flag protesting against the British ruling of the Falkland Islands . A 74-day war claimed the lives of 649 Argentines and 255 Britons. The seeds of the latest row were planted in January last year when British oil rigs arrived off the Falklands. President Kirchner threatened a . blockade and in July foreign minister Hector Timerman accused David . Cameron of acting like a ‘bully-boy thug’. The Prime Minister has insisted that the territory would remain British as long as the 3,000 residents wished. Britain has around 1,200 service . personnel on the islands, the Royal Navy has three warships in area and . four RAF Typhoon fighter-bombers have been deployed. The Foreign Office said: ‘Although we . are aware that Argentina has challenged vessels transiting between the . Falklands and the port of Montevideo we are not aware of any vessel that . has been fined or individual arrested. The UK has protested to . Argentina.’ War: Margaret Thatcher sent a task . force of 100 ships, a fleet of Harrier jump jets, four . submarines and 25,000 servicemen to regain control of the Falklands .","Ambassador in Madrid admits operating patrols in 'maritime spaces which are integral to its territory'

"By . Jennifer Smith . The son of an elderly hospital patient who was 'starved to death' on the Liverpool Care Pathway has called for police to launch a murder inquiry. Peter Tulloch believes the death of his mother, Jean Tulloch, was the result of 'negligent' and 'unlawful' care at the Western General hospital in Edinburgh. The 56-year-old has urged police to take action after an independent medical report found Mrs Tulloch had gone without food or water for up to 30 hours in the weeks before her death. Jean Tulloch, 83, died in March after being placed on the Liverpool Care Pathway at Edinburgh's Western General hospital . The widow was left without food or water for up to 30 hours by doctors who provided 'unlawful' and 'negligent' care, according to the independent report . The care-home resident died aged 83 in March after being admitted to hospital with a urinary tract infection. An investigation was launched into her death earlier this year by the Crown Office after her son raised concerns about the standard of care provided by doctors on the Liverpool Care Pathway. However an independent medical report found 'the starvation diet' his mother received on what Mr Tulloch describes as 'the death pathway' directly contributed to her death. Mr Tulloch has notified the report's findings to Lothian and Borders Police, who have referred the matter to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. 'I have called for a murder inquiry to be opened into this now. It is claimed the 83-year-old went without food or water for up to 30 hours without her legal guardian's permission . 'As far as I'm concerned this is proof that my mum was neglected in hospital,' said Mr Tulloch, a London Underground systems engineer. 'I was worried that my mother was not being fed at the time and raised the issue in formal complaints which were not treated properly. 'No attempt to feed her was ever made. 'She was let down by the NHS and I want answers. 'Doctors and nurses should face stiff penalties for neglect. 'A few prominent convictions would concentrate people’s minds and prevent a lot of the abuse that has been exposed recently.' A Crown Office spokesperson said: 'The Scottish Fatalities Investigation Unit is considering the facts and circumstances of the death of Jean Tulloch.' Mr Tulloch claims staff at the hospital put his ailing mother on the Liverpool Care Pathway without proper consent, and ignored his rights to make decisions on her behalf as her legally appointed welfare guardian. In the weeks before her death, it is alleged doctors detached a drip providing Mrs Tulloch with vital fluids without her son's permission. The report comes as both the Scottish and UK Governments look to introduce harsher punishment for doctors found guilty of wilful neglect. Mrs Tulloch, a retired nurse, was admitted to hospital in March with a urinary tract infection. Though doctors were able to stabalise her condition, her family was told she had only three weeks to live. But Mr Tulloch claims when he visited his mother at the Edinburgh hospital she was 'far from dying'. Mr Tulloch recalls how doctors were able to stabalise his mother in hospital, but told him and other family members she would have only three weeks left to live . Mr Tulloch believes his mother's death was in part brought about by poor care provided by staff at Edinburgh's Western General Hospital (pictured) He says the 83-year-old was able to smile and communicate, but was unable to talk because of sores in her mouth. 'Demanding answers': Peter Tulloch, 56, is urging police to launch a murder inquiry into the death of his mother . Doctors told the family to return to their homes where they would be notified of any change in her condition. Upon a visit the following day however, Mr Tulloch claims he found his mother had been put on the Liverpool Care Pathway, a course of treatment designed to allow 'people with a terminal illness to die with dignity', according to the NHS. Doctors took Mrs Tulloch off the treatment plan following her son's objections, but she died two weeks later. Cameron Fyfe, the lawyer responsible for commissioning the report said: 'Peter instructed me to obtain a report from an expert consultant on whether his mother was deprived of nutrition by the hospital. 'The expert believes this was the case and that the lack of nutrition materially contributed to Mrs Tulloch’s death. 'We have now intimated a claim for compensation against the Health Board.' A spokesperson for NHS Lothian said: 'We cannot comment on individual patient cases and as this is now a legal issue it would be inappropriate for us to comment further.'","Peter Tulloch claims his mother's death was the result of 'unlawful' care .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . Planned Parenthood has been accused of 'consistently recommending' the Fifty Shades of Grey series to 'minor girls.' As part of an ongoing investigation, Live Action - a pro-life nonprofit - has been sending female investigators to Planned Parenthood clinics around the country with hidden cameras, to pose as 15 and 16-year-old girls and asking for advice related to the book. Live Action president Lila Rose summarized her findings from the footage for the New York Post; claiming that a counselor in Indianapolis said: 'You need to read [Fifty Shades of Grey],' and another in Colorado said: 'It's pretty good.' Sex advice: Pro-life group Live Action has released undercover footage of Planned Parenthood counselors discussing, and in some cases recommending, Fifty Shades of Grey to 15 and 16-year-olds . Ms Rose reports that another counselor, who labeled the Fifty Shades of Grey series 'extreme', had said: 'If it’s consensual, again, completely normal.' Echoing this sentiment, another counseler claimed to 'personally dislike' the books, but said it would be 'a big eye-opener' for the girl she believed to be 15 years old. The best-selling book trilogy, written by British author E. L. James, has been a storming success among a widespread audience; selling over 100 million copies worldwide to date. It tells the story of Anastasia Steele, a 21-year-old virgin who falls under the spell of Christian Grey; a highly controlling 27-year-old business mogul who takes her as his sex slave. The books involve countless explicitly erotic scenes featuring elements of sexual practices involving BDSM; bondage/discipline, dominance/submission, and sadism/masochism. The long-awaited movie, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, is due to hit theaters on Valentine's Day 2015. Clash of the titans Lila Rose (pictured) is president of Live Action, and she argues that the best-selling erotic novel encourages dangerous sexual behavior, and should be avoided by 'all' During Christian and Anastasia's kinky and often violent sexcapades, Anastasia can signal her genuine distress to Christian by saying the 'safe word' 'yellow' for caution, and 'red' for stop. Ms Rose is dismissive of the concept of using safe words and points out  that in one scene of Fifty Shades of Grey, Christian ignores Anastasia's use of theirs. She also describes many of the sex scenes as 'reading like rape.' She writes of Live Action's investigation into Planned Parenthood: 'The staffers’ script was much the same everywhere. 'All of the employees went on to insist on “trust” and elevating the “safe word” - a word that sex partners who are intent on extreme behavior agree to use as code for “no, stop, and I mean it” - to set-in-stone status. 'In short, Planned Parenthood counselors told our investigators that “no” doesn't mean “no” anymore.' Upon reviewing the undercover footage however, these soundbites take on quite a different nature when seen in context. In all instances, it is the investigator - posing as the minor - who brings up the issue of BDSM or first mentions Fifty Shades of Grey. Fair trial? In all instances, it is the investigator - posing as the minor - who brings up the issue of BDSM or first mentions Fifty Shades of Grey, leading Planned Parenthood staff into thematic explanations . Coming soon: The long-awaited movie adaption of the book, starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson (pictured), is due to hit theaters on Valentine's Day 2015 . Rather than 'recommend' the books, most counselors actually appear to be answering questions about BDSM, using the book as a reference to underline the importance of consent. One counselor at a Minnesota clinic, when quizzed on the book, says: 'Anything within the sexual world is normal as long as it's consensual... My focus really would be on your safety, and just that it's consensual. Those are the two pieces that I would say are the most important part.' Another, at a Colorado clinic, says: 'You just want it to be safe.' This counselor, however, does also go into great depth on the subject of the book, and suggests the young girl further explores BDSM by getting someone she 'trusts' to buy related toys from a sex shop, since she is under 18. Opposed: Live Action has an established history of protesting against Planned Parenthood's abortion clinics (pictured) 'When Planned Parenthood counselors train our girls not to expect that “no” means no, they disable a crucial form of protection for all women in a violent world,' Ms Rose concludes. 'A world of compliant Ana Steeles and repulsive Christian Greys is nothing short of nightmarish. We all should turn away from any road that leads there.' Lila Rose issued the following statement to MailOnline: . 'If a minor girl comes to Planned Parenthood for advice because her boyfriend says he wants to try out ""kink,"" counselors should be strongly cautioning her on the many dangers of those practices. 'They should NOT be suggesting and promoting a variety of bondage and sadomasochistic activities and recommending pornographic material for more ideas. 'It's clear that Planned Parenthood's priority here is propagation of its radical sexual ideology, not protecting young girls' safety.'","Pro-life non-profit Live Action sent investigators posing as minors to ask questions about the erotic bestseller .

"By . Bianca London for MailOnline . It beat 'twerking' to be crowned word of the year by editors of the Oxford English Dictionary and it seems that the power of the selfie shows no sign of abating thanks to image-conscious, social media-obsessed Brits. So obsessed are we with capturing the perfect snap of ourselves that, according to new research, over 17 million selfies are uploaded every week on social media. And thanks to beautiful celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley constantly showing off their perfect faces we are always on the hunt for new ways to perfect our own shots. Scroll down for video . Testing, testing: FEMAIL writer Bianca London tested the Fearless Fuchsia shade of Avon's new lipstick in an office selfie . One beauty brand are hoping to capitalise on the demand for a stand-out selfie by launching a new lipstick designed to create a high definition, camera-ready pout with a pop of colour. Avon Cosmetics has unveiled the Ultra Colour Bold Lipstick - their highest concentrated lipstick yet. Available in 10 shades, the £7.50 lipstick is formulated with Avon’s new exclusive Pigment Loading Technology, which claims to give the wearer a 'highly pigmented bullet' and a lipstick that 'explodes with bold, bright colour'. The team behind the new lipstick discovered that no matter how vivid and bold the colour, lipsticks are generally obscured in pictures by an opaque base (the part of the formulation which carries the colour). The team identified that in order to create ‘true’ colour, which best harnesses the pigment’s potential, it was necessary to develop an entirely new base - one which is translucent - and the new product was born. Lady in red: Lisa Potter loved the highly pigmented lipstick and will be wearing hers on Saturday night for sure . Lisa Lamberty, director of new product innovation at Avon Research and Development said: 'We created Ultra Colour Bold lipstick because we know women want deep bold colour to accentuate their lips and make them look their best in photos.' Liz Pugh, Avon’s professional make-up artist, added: 'Requests on how to create the perfect lip are high in demand this year and my top tip is that a bold lipstick can hide a multiple of sins. The high pigmentation in this draws attention to the mouth, a simple trick for an attention-grabbing look which doesn’t require layers of contouring or smoky eyes. 'I've been using it whilst on AW14 shoots. Magenta Flash and Bold Bordeaux in particular are excellent shades when trying to achieve this attention grabbing look. 'With just one application the lipstick provides brilliant bold colour which lasts for hours.' VERDICT: Team FEMAIL gave two of the new shades a spin and found that while they did enhance selfies, they were best saved for a night on the town rather than a day in the office.

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . It's one of autumn/winter's biggest sartorial trends but the humble knitted jumper wasn't always so stylish. Now a new exhibition is to chart the history of the knit, from lowly beginnings as undergarments and utilitarian gowns to its current high fashion incarnation. Knitwear Chanel to Westwood opens at the Fashion and Textile Museum in London next month and will include 150 rare pieces, including Chanel cardigan suits, crocheted 1930s dresses and vibrant knits by Missoni and Bill Gibb. Scroll down for video . Seriously stylish: Jerry Hall wearing Jap & Joseph in 'Jamaica Blue', a shoot published by Vogue in May 1975 . Champion: Coco Chanel in striped knitted jersey photographed in 1929 by Alex Stewart Sasha . Accompanying the clothes will be a series of photos taken by greats such as Horst P. Horst which show off the knits in all their glamorous vintage glory. ‘Decade by decade, this incredible . collection charts over 100 years of knitwear history,' says Celia . Joicey, head of the Fashion and Textile Museum. 'It . is the first exhibition of its kind to explore not only key designers . but also technical innovations in hand, machine and industrial knitting.' But as the exhibition makes clear, knitwear wasn't always so glamorous with knitting and crocheting long associated with functional fashion and undergarments. That all changed when World War One broke out and wool, one of the first textiles to become scarce thanks to its use in army uniforms, became a luxury. By the 1920s, the flexible nature of wool and increasing demand for sportier pieces resulted in knitwear becoming truly fashionable for the first time, helped along by Coco Chanel. Key to the knit's new look was Chanel's championing of jersey, a wool-based machine woven textile, which was traditionally used to make men's pants. Chanel, however, had other ideas and reworked the material into easy-wearing twinsets and chic frocks - an innovation considered incredibly daring in the heady days of the 1920s. Later, the material was used to make evening dresses, as was crochet, all enlivened by metallic yarns, deco colouring and exotic details. By the time the Second World War arrived, the jumper was a firm fixture in the fashion firmament but clothing restrictions meant that once more, women had to invent creative ways to wear it. Many were unravelled and recycled when . they became too tatty to bear, with multicoloured jumpers becoming a . staple thanks to the reuse of wool taken from other garments. Renaissance: A 1920s knitted coat (left) and an elegant grey ensemble photographed by Horst P. Horst in 1947 . Cheerful: Multi-coloured designs such as these 1930s jumpers became popular during the war years . That, however, was the final time that the jumper played a purely practical part in women's wardrobes and almost as soon as VE day arrived, the knit began a trajectory that took it into the heart of the fashion world. The late 40s and early 50s saw the 'cocktail sweater' reign supreme in wardrobes around the world, thanks in no small part to the influence of Hollywood stars who wore theirs nipped in at the waist and embellished with embroidery and beading. Later, the crocheted cocktail dress became popular, with hems shortening exponentially as the 1960s approached and throughout the decade. With Chanel gone, Rudi Gernreich and André Courrèges led the charge to champion knitwear, embracing wool and jersey fabrics in their . futuristic designs. And it wasn't just designers who embraced the trend. Easier to make than the cocktail knit, short dresses became a favourite of young women all over the UK, who knitted their own using patterns published in magazines such as Vogue and Tatler. Luxurious: An elegant Diane Leslie top made from jersey shot through with gold yarn circa 1970 . Beautiful: A silk jersey duster coat circa 1919 (left) and a Jean Muir creation dating from the 1970s (right) The . novelty knit first seen during the war years reappeared in the 70s, this time featuring bright colours and kitsch . motifs, popularised by Fiorucci and Kenzo. The 1970s were also a . fertile era of fashion design, Ossie Clark, Biba, Rae Spencer Cullen for . Miss Mouse, Bill Gibb and Mary Quant all championing knitwear. But it wasn't until the 1980s that knitwear in its current incarnation really took off, with Vivienne Westwood, Rei Kawakubo for Comme . des Garçons, Zandra Rhodes and Sonia Rykiel all creating sophisticated collections based on the formerly humble jumper. By the time the 1990s and the noughties rolled around, knitwear was an established part of fashion although it hasn't completely lost its ability to astound. From Julien MacDonald to Mark Fast and Stella McCartney, the jumper continues to inspire fashion's hottest names - and those who buy them. 'Knitwear in fashion is often taken for granted,' comments Joicey, 'but this exhibition is an opportunity to celebrate knitwear centre stage and to inspire future design directions.' Curator Dennis Nothdruft added: ‘Knitwear is imbued with narrative and memory. This exhibition is a way of accessing other people’s stories.' Knitwear Chanel to Westwood opens on the 19th September at the Fashion and Textiles Museum in London.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . A beauty therapist who went abroad for a bargain boob job was horrified when the implants burst through her skin just days later, nearly killing her. Claire Hawker, 30, had been recommended the cosmetic surgeon in Prague by a friend and was initially delighted with her new figure. But just days after returning home, her size G breasts started leaking a brown discharge and suddenly burst. Scroll down for video . Claire Hawker was nearly killed by a boob job she had abroad after developing a raging infection . Ms Hawker before the breast enlargement (image right, pictured right). The mother-of-two said her confidence was at an all-time low because her breasts were sagging and different sizes, with one a B cup and one a C . After being rushed to hospital, surgeons warned the mother-of-two she would die if the implants were not removed immediately. ‘I remember feeling scared then angry when I was told my implants would have to be taken out - but I had no choice,' says Ms Hawker, from Reading. 'I had wanted bigger boobs for almost a decade because they had really sagged after having children. My  confidence was rock bottom.' While one breast was a 34B cup, the was other a C - and both began to droop following the birth of her daughter, Jasmine, at 17. ‘Working in the beauty industry it was important to me to look good and feel confident, though I hadn’t for a very long time,’ said Ms Hawker. ‘I would look in the mirror and feel so self-conscious about that part of my body. I wished my breasts could be bigger.’ But as a single mother, she couldn't afford expensive cosmetic surgery. 'It got to the point where my appearance was affecting how I felt at work, though. As a beauty therapist it was critical I looked and felt good, but my clothes hung on me like a sack of potatoes.’ Then in July 2008 a friend who’d had liposuction at a cosmetic surgery in Prague recommended the clinic to Ms Hawker. After researching the clinic online, she discovered she could have a breast uplift and implants for £2,300 – a third of the cost she would pay in the UK. Friends and family also backed her decision to go abroad, so she took out a loan for £4,000 to cover flights and expenses. Video courtesy of Tariq Ahmad Practice . She was also unhappy with her uneven breasts (left) and hoped surgery would sort the problem out. But even a week after surgery in Prague, she was in agonising pain (right) 'A year later as I got on the plane to Prague, I was so excited about having the body I'd always dreamed of,' she said. After five days exploring the city, Ms Hawker met the surgeon who would perform her procedure. She said: 'The receptionist at the clinic explained the surgeon didn’t speak much English, so I should show him photos of what I wanted. ‘But I assured myself he knew what he was doing and I showed him some magazine clippings of celebs with size G breasts, like I wanted.’ However on waking up two hours after the op, she was in total agony. 'My breasts were bandaged up so I couldn’t seem them and there was pain shooting through my chest. 'I told my friend I thought I was going to die.’ The next day, her bandages were changed again before she was discharged - still without having seen her new breasts. Surgeons told Ms Hawker her  implants were too big. This had ripped open the skin around them, which had become infected . Even as she boarded the plane home the day after, her breasts continued to ache and she took some tablets the surgery had given her to ease her suffering. 'I figured I should expect some pain following surgery, so I did my best not to worry,' she said. Back home, she spent the following few days slumped on the sofa, barely able to move her arms for the pain. But a week later, despite still being bandaged up, she decided she was ready to visit the salon where she worked to show her mother and colleagues her new breasts. As she lifted her top however, she noticed her bra was damp and a brown, smelly discharge was leaking from her left breast. ‘My mum said she could see my implant poking out of a 50p sized hole in my skin, which had burst open.’ After being rushed to Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, a surgeon examined her breast. As he did, the skin under her right breast split too. ‘He said my implants were too big and they’d ripped open the skin around them, which had become infected. 'They had to be removed or I would die.' He added she was the fourth person he'd seen that week who's been the victim of botched cosmetic surgery abroad. Later that day Ms Hawker was taken in to theatre to have her implants removed and she spent the next week having the infection washed out of them. 'I spent two weeks in hospital and regretted going overseas so much,' she said. 'It really hadn’t been worth it.’ Even after being discharged, Ms Hawker had to return every two weeks for the next year so that nurses could clean her wounds and check her breasts were healing. But nothing can repair her confidence, which is now even lower, having been left with small breasts and horrific scarring. She said: ‘My breasts looked even worse than before and I worried even if I got new implants, the skin under them would always look like I’d been burnt. ‘At least the uplift I’d received overseas hadn’t gone wrong, so my breasts looked alright when I wore strappy tops. ‘But I continued to miss the fullness my new breasts had given me and my confidence, at work and going out with friends, and I felt at an all-time low.’ She was told she would have to wait at least two years - and until she’d made a full recovery - before she could have further surgery. Though it would cost her thousands - and she was still paying off her loan for her original surgery, Ms Hawker said she couldn't stay the way she was. Then in May 2013, she spotted a magazine ad recruiting people for a documentary about botched cosmetic surgery called Botched Up Bodies. In return they’d receive free corrective surgery. Last year Ms Hawker underwent further surgery in the UK to correct the damage and enlarge her breasts again . She said: 'Having this surgery changed my life. I’m more confident now and love receiving compliments. I just wish I hadn't risked my life the first time for cheap cosmetic surgery' Ms Hawker said: ‘I was anxious about appearing on TV but my mum encouraged me and I decided it was worth it to get the body I wanted.’ At Royal Welbeck Hospital, in London, a leading cosmetic surgeon Dr Nick Percival, from Cosmetic Surgery Partners, examined her and recommended an E cup. On the day of her surgery last June she admits feeling nervous. 'But when I came round hours later - not in any pain and with new 34E breasts - she was thrilled. Then in November, she had a second procedure to remove the scar tissue she’d lived with for three years. She said: ‘Having this surgery changed my life. I’m more confident now and love receiving compliments. ‘I wish I hadn’t been so eager before to have cosmetic surgery. I should have researched my options and saved up to have it done in the UK. ‘Instead, going abroad almost cost me my life. It’s not worth risking it for cheap cosmetic surgery.’","WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT .

"By . Madlen Davies For Mailonline . Exposed midriffs made a big comeback this year, with celebrities such as Ellie Goulding and Rita Ora regularly showing off their toned stomachs at awards ceremonies, music videos, nights out and regular ‘selfies’ on Twitter and Instagram. But as a result doctors say increasing numbers of young women are seeking treatment to remove thread veins from this newly exposed area. Experts at Dr Newmans Clinic, a network of thread vein removal clinics based across the UK, have reported a 20 per cent increase in women undergoing treatment on thread veins in the ‘subcostal margin’ – the area between the edges of the ribs, down to the soft abdomen. Scroll down for video . Exposed: Rita Ora often rocks a  crop top to concerts and award ceremonies, as well as posting pictures of her toned stomach on Instagram . Washboard abs: Cara Delevingne is a fan of the high waisted trousers and crop top look that has been so popular this summer . Thread veins are often associated with heavy drinking, but experts say they can be caused by a myriad of factors, including too much sun, hormones and pregnancy, a genetic predisposition or an underlying skin condition such as rosacea. Women often have a genetic predisposition to suffering from thread veins on their midriffs, doctors say. Patients are usually very fair skinned and redheads are even more likely to have them. Dr Peter Finigan, medical director at Dr Newmans Clinic said demand for vein removal from the midriff area has soared this year. He said: ‘Whereas the top two most common areas women have thread veins treated are on their faces and legs, recently we have seen a sharp rise in the number of 20-40 year old women coming in with concerns about thread veins in the subcostal margin, and this area is now the third most common part of the body for treatment.’ Soaring numbers of young women are seeking treatment for thread veins found on their midriffs . ‘Many patients tell us they feel self-conscious wearing a bikini or crop top if they have thread veins in this area – which usually appear in a ‘belt’ of tiny, vertical red lines.’ Other celebrities who are fans of the exposed midriff include Emma Watson, Cheryl Cole, Cara Delevingne, and Abbey Clancy, who just weeks ago posted a ‘selfie’ of herself in her Calvin Klein underwear and boasted a picture perfect midriff. The women seeking treatment are becoming increasingly younger than their usual clientele, Dr Finigan added. He said: ‘Interestingly, the patients we have treated for this area over the last 12 months have been getting younger, with the majority aged between 20 and 30-year-old.’ He continued: 'We do also treat older women up to the age of 40, but patient numbers tend to fall after this age. 'This could be down to older women preferring not to bare their midriff, or perhaps becoming more body confident as they get older.'","Doctors report a 20 per cent increase in women in the UK having thread vein removal treatment from their midriffs .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A kind-hearted mother is dedicating her spare time to knitting breasts for women who have undergone mastectomies. Kay Coombes, 46, was diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and later had both breasts removed when she feared the disease could return. The brave lady has now teamed up with 'Knitted Knocker UK' to help provide cancer sufferers across the UK with lightweight artificial breasts made from cotton. After being sent her own 'knitted knockers', Kay decided to help women up and down the country who have also suffered . The Knitted Knockers are made by volunteers, in any size, and offer a much lighter and more breathable alternative to silicone prosthesis . Kay, from Bridgwater, Somerset, said: ‘After my double mastectomy I had a lot of time on my hands because I was off work for a while. ‘I belong to a few support groups online for breast cancer and one linked to an American website about knitted knockers. ‘I thought that sounded interesting so I ordered a pair of these knitted knockers. ‘Even though it was an American website, a few ladies in England belong to it and it was the ladies in England who sent me a pair of knockers. ‘I thought they were great, they were absolutely fantastic. They are comfortable to wear against your skin and scars and everything.’ Kay was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and underwent a lumpectomy and chemotherapy to remove it. However, she tested positive for the BRCA gene last year which drastically increased the chances of the cancer returning. To mitigate the chances she underwent a double mastectomy, as well as having her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. Kay joined a craft group and learnt to knit the Knockers herself before joining the group which was set up in January . After being sent her own 'knitted knockers', she decided to help women up and down the country who have also suffered. The civil servant joined a craft group and learnt to knit them herself before joining Knitted Knockers UK, a group which was set up in January. She said: ‘The lady who started the UK group was the one who knitted me my knockers. Kay says the group has also helped her through a difficult time after losing her brother . ‘Because of me she started the group up in the UK which I think is a lovely thing to have done. ‘I had to get involved - I learnt how to knit and crochet them and I'm now quite involved. 'Hospitals in the UK provide us with prosthetic ones, which are okay, but they are quite heavy. I've got the hospital silicon ones - and just one weighs 450 grams, and that is just a C cup. ‘But one of my knitted ones weighs less than 50 grams. You compare 450 grams and 50 grams in your bra and what would you prefer? ‘It is nice to have a choice, especially for comfort reasons. In hot weather, the knitted cotton ones - we make them out of 100 per cent pure cotton - are a lot more comfortable because they don't make you sweat like with the silicon ones.’ Taking a few hours to make each pair, they can be made in sizes AA to HH, with ladies requesting either one or a pair of knockers depending on what operation they have had. There are around 600 people who support the group, with 50 women regularly knitting. They buy the cotton themselves, knit, stuff, package and post - all for free. Kay said: ‘It is a lovely gift from one woman to another, especially from my point of view because I've been in the same situation which makes it more personal.’ Kay says the group has helped her through a tremendously difficult time. She added: ‘Not only did I enjoy making the knockers for women but the other members of the group helped me during that really tough time, and that was a real help mentally as well as physically.’ Women can request a pair of knitted knockers from http://www.knittedknockersuk.com.","Kay was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and had double mastectomy .

"By . Stephen Wright . Created: . 22:02 GMT, 17 February 2012 . Bizarre: Scotland Yard officers have been asked to enter a poetry competition on the theme of 'gender equality'. The prize is a chance to have 'elevenses' with the Met's head of diversity Denise Milani, pictured . It's enough to make the hard men of the Sweeney choke on their cigars and double whiskies. Scotland Yard officers have been asked to enter a poetry competition on the theme of ‘gender equality’. The prize is a chance to have ‘elevenses’ with the Met’s head of diversity Denise Milani, who is renowned in Britain’s biggest police force for her touchy-feely initiatives. Officers are told their poems must . focus on ‘recruitment, retention or progression’ at the Yard, creating a . ‘gender-sensitive working environment’ or ‘successfully managing . gender-diverse teams’. They . must also provide Miss Milani, 54, with insight on the progress made . with the ‘Gender Agenda’ from a male or female perspective and suggest a . ‘positive vision’ for the Met. Details of the extraordinary competition . were leaked to the Police Inspector blog, prompting a furious reaction . from serving officers who accused the Met of wasting taxpayers’ money. Inspector Gadget, the anonymous author . of the blog, wrote: ‘I can categorically say that this is the maddest . diversity nonsense we have ever featured. ‘I would like to hear from more female officers to see what they think of this, in between making tea for the lads of course!’ Within minutes of his posting, Inspector Gadget was inundated with examples of possible entries, some of which were obscene. Another . outraged policeman said: ‘Now that this is in the public domain, can a . member of the public write a letter of complaint to BHH (Met . Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe) about this scandalous waste of their . taxes?’. The poetry competition has been launched to coincide with next month’s International Women’s Day. On the force’s internal Intranet, officers and civilian staff are urged to ‘get creative’ in the run-up to the event. Miss Milani, the daughter of West Indian migrants, originally qualified as a teacher and joined the Met in 1999. She is believed to be paid more than £80,000 a year, although Scotland Yard refuses to reveal her exact salary. Despite a cost-cutting campaign at the Yard, her position as Director . of the Diversity and Citizen Focus Directorate appears safe. Angry response: Details of the extraordinary competition were leaked to the Police Inspector blog, prompting a furious reaction from serving officers who accused the Met of wasting taxpayers' money . The directorate promotes the recognition of the Met’s minority . employees – dealing with gender, disability, sexual orientation, age and . faith as well as race. It has a total of 36 staff. In . 2008, the Mail revealed how Miss Milani had urged Met staff to . ‘celebrate’ the contribution of Roma gipsies to ‘London’s culture and . diversity’. The Yard said: . ‘The Metropolitan Police polices one of the most diverse cities in . Europe and is the biggest single employer in London. ‘It . can only succeed by recognising and responding to the needs of the . varied communities and workforce it serves and the DCFD plays a key role . by providing specialist knowledge and strategic diversity guidance . across the organisation.’",Scotland Yard officers asked to enter a poetry competition on the theme of 'gender equality'
"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . Celebrity TV chef James Martin has blasted the Health Secretary over pitiful meals being served in NHS hospitals as he backed MailOnline's campaign to improve food given to patients. Mr Martin, a hospital food standards campaigner, took to Twitter to speak out against Jeremy Hunt after it emerged that the Department of Health said it would not consider introducing legislation to legally enforce food standards in NHS hospitals. Posting a . link to MailOnline readers' photographs of hospital food, he wrote: 'Eat . like this for a week and tell me there is nothing wrong like you did . before @Jeremy_Hunt. Scroll down for video . Mr Jackson's comments come as more MailOnline readers share their photographs of hospital meals. Pictured is a plate of potatoes with a slice of ham and fruit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary . Alex Jackson (left) with TV chef James Martin (right), who has backed MailOnline's campaign for better hospital food, said the only way standards will improve is to enforce them by law . 'You should be ashamed.' He went on: 'The majority of hospitals ruin it for the few that are doing well. 'That hurts the team in them #OperationHospitalFood. 'I've tried five years to speak to someone in government and the response is they're 'too busy'  #OperationHospitalFood' His comments come as a . former member of a government panel investigating hospital food said . the only way to improve patient meals throughout the NHS is to enforce . new standards by law. Alex . Jackson resigned from the Hospital Food Standards Panel after being . told the Department of Health would not consider putting forward . legislation regardless of the outcomes of a report into the standard of hospital food. On . the eve the report's publication, the campaigner has slammed the . ‘infuriating’ system which has placed the standards of prison meals . under closer scrutiny. Celebrity TV chef and hospital food standards campaigner James Martin tweeted a link to MailOnline readers' photographs of hospital food and mentioned Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in his post . ‘Restaurants are held to a legal standard and are shut down if they don’t comply – and these are places where people are choosing to eat,' said Mr Jackson of the Campaign for Better Hospital Food. ‘By not creating legislation specifically for this, the government has set about finding a solution which appears to be what we want but in practice, it isn't.’ Meanwhile, more MailOnline readers shared photographs of substandard meals at facilities across Britain. In 2012, Mr Jackson supported a bill proposed by Baroness Cumberledge in the Houses of Parliament to legally bind hospitals to meet food standards. After it was rejected, the Department of Health created the panel to investigate the situation across NHS hospitals. It was to report its findings to Dr Daniel Poulter, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Health, for his consideration. Its findings and recommendations will be published tomorrow. However upon the panel’s construction, Dr Poulter told its members no matter the outcome of their research, the department would not consider putting forward any legislation to enforce standards. ‘What I wanted and what I hoped to be the case was that we would be allowed to consider a number of things including having new legislation put through parliament,' added Mr Jackson. The campaigner, pictured with Prince Charles, resigned from his position on a government panel investigating food standards as he felt his 'hands were tied' Critics have slammed hospitals' failure to improve food standards despite other NHS initiatives in the past. This plate of mashed potato and quiche at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was among readers' photos . A patient at Kidderminster Hospital was served this mushroom stroganoff in November. A hospital spokesman said while a range of options was offered to patients, it constantly strives to 'improve and invest in nutrition' Lunch at the Royal Victoria Infirmary Hospital in Newcastle was a sandwich with side salad - a tiny piece of lettuce, tomato and one slice of cucumber . 'At the first meeting Dan Poulter gave a spiel and I said: “It seems to me you're not allowing us to advocate new legislation if we want it.” ‘He said that was one thing they would not consider. 'I thought at that point that our hands were tied.’ Instead, the Department of Health will introduce new rules in existing NHS contracts to map out acceptable standards. A breach of the new rules will be considered a breach of contract and therefore considered legally binding, say officials. But with the same NHS-governed bodies charged with monitoring and reporting failure to adhere to the rules the situation may never improve, says Mr Jackson. ‘All of these commissions are self-reported and we have decades of evidence to suggest that that doesn’t work. ‘What we need is a similar system to the school meals standards law which is monitored by an independent body. ‘But what they’ve proposed is tinkering with commission contracts and hoping for the best. ‘We’ve been doing that for years and it hasn’t approved at all. There have been hundreds of initiatives that haven’t worked. ‘There is zero connection with patients as well. ‘The government is aware that there is public outcry about hospital food and there’s also public outcry that there's nothing being done. ‘These recommendations have been drawn up by members of the panel in a dark room. I was worried about that from the outset, they’ll not be seen by patients. Mashed potato and meatballs at Lister Hospital in Stevenage was served with a side of fruit in a cup . A plain jacket potato with jelly, an apple and a pot of cheese was served at Leicester Hospital. The hospital apologised for the patient's dissatisfaction and said it was 'always looking for ways to improve' ‘There’s no public consultation. It would be an issue of public ownership putting standards into law. ‘Let’s put it in the hands of elected members of parliament, not officials. ‘What they’ve done is go through a lengthy bureaucratic process of not achieving the goal.’ Mr Jackson added he was concerned over those appointed to the panel, with many members involved in supplying food to hospitals. ‘These guys are suppliers and the public sector is the consumer. In any negotiation, when does the supplier tell the customer what to do?’ Ruthe Isden of Age UK, whose chairman is at the head of the panel, confirmed they were told the report would not result in legislation from the outset. ‘That was the decision we were working to throughout, that there would be an opportunity to deal with it in a different way than having to go through the process of putting a bill through parliament. ‘We really hope people will move forward and take it (the report) seriously but a range of checks and balances are being made.’ Asked when NHS staff will be made aware of any changes, a Department of Health spokesman said the new contracts will not be completed and distributed until April next year. A Department of Health spokesman said: 'Legislation is a red herring – there are other ways that . we can introduce mandatory food standards that will be quicker for the NHS to . act on and more flexible for the future. 'We are determined to see better . hospital food across the country and we’ll say more about our plans for this . tomorrow.' Daniel Poulter has not responded to MailOnline’s requests for comment. As pressure on the government to improve hospital meals grows, a cardiac patient has revealed being fed salty food in hospital, to the concern of a dietitian. Ben Bull was admitted to Brighton Royal Sussex County Hospital in December with atrial fibrillation after collapsing. The 29-year-old learned he had a systemic right heart failure which had previously gone undiagnosed. The 29-year-old was given this plate of fish and chips with peas which was heavily seasoned with salt . But throughout his care he was fed meals heavy in salt and sodium – a ‘concerning’ decision says Catherine Collins of the British Dietetic Association. ‘If that’s what he was given without a choice then I would be concerned. ‘I wouldn't want highly salted (foods for a patient of this condition.) He needs a low salt diet, if it's atrial fibrillation causing right heart failure. ‘Baked beans are high in salt, the portions can be small so it wouldn't be a major issue, but if he had right heart failure we should be reducing his salt intake. ‘Cheese is high in salt as well. It may be he was suffering from a lack of available choice but that isn’t acceptable. ‘The white bread sandwich is not something I would want a patient of that condition to eat’. Mr Bull was admitted to hospital after collapsing suddenly in December. The father-of-one learned he had been suffering a systemic right heart failure since childhood, though he had never known. Throughout his time at the hospital Mr Bull said meals were consistently inadequate and that he eventually relied on his family to bring him food. ‘My family had to bring food in as by the pictures, the food was horrendous. Baked beans are also high in salt. Mr Bull said he resorted to having his family bring him in meals due to lack of choice . Cheese and white bread is not recommended for someone with Mr Bull's condition according to a dietitian, but was served at the hospital . Cheese-topped pasta was another one of the meals he was given despite suffering a condition which requires a low salt intake . ‘I didn't argue as the woman serving spoke little English and the only time I said anything she shrugged it off.’ Among the food he was given was a sponge raspberry pudding, baked potato, and a cheese sandwich made on white bread. A portion of fish and chips, covered in salt, and a bowl of tomato and cheese pasta with ‘uncooked’ meatballs were also served. Mr Bull said he would been more forthright to complain about the quality of his meals if there were stronger regulations in place. ‘If there were food standards in place I definitely would have said something, if you were served that in a restaurant, let alone a greasy spoon, you would say something or even refuse to pay, even my school dinners were better quality. ‘As it stands the servers rush in and out again, most of the time not even mentioning that the plate is as full as when they left it, I think even the people serving the food are aware of the quality.’ Brighton Royal Sussex County Hospital has not responded to MailOnline's request for comment. Mr Bull, pictured with his wife Hannah, said he would have complained if there were stronger regulations in place .","TV chef James Martin took to Twitter to speak out against Jeremy Hunt .

"By . Emily Payne for MailOnline . and Chris Kitching for MailOnline . It's a bank holiday tradition that motorists cannot avoid when they hit the road - even when it's a day early. Travellers who are trying to make their getaways in advance of the big rush have been caught in traffic jams, despite their best efforts to make the most of the final holiday weekend before winter. In Cambridge, motorists faced bumper-to-bumper delays on the A14 - a scene that played out on other motorways - and the situation is expected to get even worse tomorrow when the mass exodus gets into full swing. Motorists are caught in a traffic jam on the A14 in Cambridge as the bank holiday getaway started early . Making an escape: Roads are expected to get even busier as more people go away for the weekend . While those staying at home are contending with busy roads and disrupted rail journeys, more than . two million Britons will head overseas for the bank holiday weekend. Hot . spots for those leaving the country include Spain, Greece, Turkey and . Tunisia while those heading further afield are choosing Florida and . Cancun in Mexico. Anyone . getting the car out in the UK will have to compete for road space with . an estimated nine million other vehicles. The RAC said it expected Saturday and Sunday to be the busiest days on the roads, especially as there are major music festivals at Leeds and Reading in Berkshire - with roadworks in place on the M1, M5 and M25. On the railways, engineering work includes major work at London Bridge station and at Watford in Hertfordshire. VisitEngland said 5.1 million Britons were planning an overnight holiday trip in the UK this weekend, with four million staying in England. This was likely to generate some £1.2bn in tourism spending for the UK economy, £940m of which will be spent in England. Long-haul break: Favourite further afield destinations include Florida and Cancun in Mexico . More than half a million passengers are expected to depart the UK from Heathrow airport over the weekend, as well as 234,000 from Gatwick, 172,000 from Manchester,  150,000 from Scotland's airports and 134,000 from Stansted. In addition, hundreds of thousands will also be leaving the country from other regional airports, ports and the Channel Tunnel. Abta said domestic bookings had been boosted by the recent heatwave, although those holidaying in the UK will be getting cooler temperatures than during the long, hot spell as well as the possibility of some rain. Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: 'This weekend is set to be one of the busiest of the year as we see lots of holidaymakers heading off for the bank holiday weekend. 'While a holiday budget will go further abroad this year thanks to a strong pound, we are also expecting lots of people to enjoy the long weekend at home.' But if you're staying in the UK, be prepared for plenty of travel disruption. Fancy a romantic getaway? Amsterdam is one of Europe's hottest city break destinations . The Highways Agency said around 164 miles of roadworks on England's motorways and major A-roads would be completed before the weekend and 110 miles of works will be suspended between Friday and Tuesday. But for safety reasons a number of roadworks will have to stay in place, including some on the M1, M5 and M25. On the railways, a nine-day part-closure of London Bridge station begins on Saturday, with no First Capital Connect or Southern trains calling at the station until September 1. The changes will allow Network Rail to carry out a huge programme of work as part of the £6.5 billion Thameslink project. A spokesman for rail industry body the Rail Delivery Group said: 'Work goes on every day to deliver thousands of vital but smaller-scale improvements and over the next five years billions of pounds will be reinvested in the railway to meet rising demand for even better, faster and greener services.' National Express said it had seen a surge in coach bookings for the bank holiday, with bank holiday Monday expected to be its busiest day. It added that London was the most popular destination for coach travellers this weekend, followed by Birmingham and then Heathrow airport. Tourism Minister Helen Grant said: 'The bank holiday weekend is set to be a bumper one for domestic tourism, generating over £1 billion in spend for the UK economy. 'From city breaks to days out on the coast, world-class music events to cultural trips, the UK has something for everyone to enjoy.'","Spain, Greece and Turkey are most popular short-haul weekend breaks .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Aviation authorities are trying to calm passengers’ fears over an Icelandic volcano that is at risk of erupting. The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and air traffic control company Nats say Britain is better prepared than in 2010 to deal with a potential ash cloud crisis if the Bardarbunga volcano erupts. The organisations have reassured travellers they will not see a repeat of the chaos when the gigantic ash cloud caused by the Eyjafjallajokull volcano grounded more than 100,000 flights and ruined millions of holidays. No fear: Authorities say they are better prepared to deal with an ash cloud crisis after an eruption in 2010 . The Icelandic Meteorological Office said the area around the Bardarbunga volcano is still being rocked by hundreds of earthquakes each day, but there are no signs of magma moving to the surface. Two intense earthquake swarms were first detected last Saturday at Iceland’s largest volcano, which is located under the country’s largest glacier. As a precaution, police have evacuated an area north of the volcano, about 200 miles northeast of the capital Reykjavik, and closed roads. The country has raised its aviation alert level to orange, the second-highest level on the five-colour scale. Both the CAA and Nats said the UK is much better prepared to deal with any ash cloud crisis based on lessons learned four years ago, and there are now arrangements in place to minimise disruptions and maintain public safety. A Nats spokeswoman said: ‘We are monitoring the situation in Iceland and we don’t know how serious it will get and just where any ash cloud will travel if the volcano erupts.' Stay away: Police have closed roads and evacuated an area near the Bardarbunga volcano in Iceland . The spokeswoman said: ‘Even in a worst-case scenario we are in a much better position to deal with this than we were in 2010.’ In 2010, the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano led to much of Europe’s airspace being shut down for six days, causing widespread cancellations and losses of more than £1.2 billion. Since then, aviation authorities have implemented a number of improvements, including a system that gives airlines access to wider airspace in the event of an eruption, a radar in Iceland that detects ash particles in the atmosphere, and enhanced ash cloud models and forecasts that help them to identify the areas to avoid, the CAA said. In 2010, the situation was aggravated by strong northerly winds and unusually high volumes of fine ash that posed a danger to jet engines.","Authorities are confident travellers will not see a repeat of 2010 .

"By . Chris Kitching for MailOnline . Tour operator Thomas Cook has been ordered to pay more than £17,000 in compensation to a holidaymaker who became violently ill during his dream holiday in the Caribbean. Paul Hughes, from Redditch, Worcestershire, faces ongoing gastric symptoms following his ‘nightmare’ getaway at a resort in Cayo Guillermo, Cuba, his solicitors said. The 52-year-old booked the trip to the four-star Iberostar Daiquiri Hotel through Thomas Cook and he took legal action over ‘appalling’ hygiene conditions that he claims led to his illness. 'Nightmare': Paul Hughes became violently ill during a two-week trip to Cuba in January 2011 . Mr Hughes alleges undercooked food was served to guests, public areas in the hotel were dirty and he witnessed a chef leaving the toilet without washing his hands. He said: ‘Upon falling ill I suffered severe sickness and diarrhoea and extremely painful stomach cramps, it was horrendous. ‘Three months after we came home, my symptoms still hadn’t gone so I saw my GP who provided me with advice as to how to deal with my symptoms. 'My bowel habits still haven’t returned to normal and it feels like I’ve been left with a permanent reminder of the awful trip. It has been very hard to get used to this.’ Thomas Cook admitted liability for Mr Hughes’ illness, but his solicitors from the law firm Irwin Mitchell had to proceed to trial after the tour operator refused to agree a settlement which reflected the severity of his condition, the law firm said. Paradise: Playa Pilar, located in Cayo Guillermo, is considered one of Cuba's best beaches . At the end of a trial at the County Court in Birmingham, a judge agreed Thomas Cook must pay Mr Hughes compensation of more than £17,000. Thomas Cook said in a statement that it is disappointed by the outcome of the court ruling, but it accepts the judge’s verdict and is satisfied that the matter has been resolved. The tour operator said: ‘We feel it is important to note that our own findings with regards to the exact nature of the illness differed greatly from those of Mr Hughes’ representatives.’ Thomas Cook said it closely evaluates the health, safety and hygiene standards of properties, and the Iberostar Daiquiri Hotel scores high in customer satisfaction surveys. ‘Our records show that sickness levels among customers staying at the resort since 2011 have been minimal,’ the company said. ‘Accordingly, we believe Mr Hughes’ illness to be a rare occurrence and are confident that those due to stay at the Iberostar Daiquiri Hotel will enjoy the quality holiday experience they would come to expect from Thomas Cook.’ Compensation: Tour operator Thomas Cook was ordered to pay £17,000 to Paul Hughes for his ordeal . Mr Hughes said he is still scared to eat in restaurants after falling ill during the two-week trip with his wife in January 2011. He said: ‘I used to eat out a lot with my family but tend not to anymore as I’m too worried about suffering anything similar to what I had to go through in Cuba. ‘Nothing can turn back the clock but I am relieved the legal battle is now over. I just hope that my case acts as a reminder to those in the travel industry about the importance of following good hygiene practices so no one else has to go through a similar ordeal.’ Clare Comiskey, an international travel law expert at Irwin Mitchell’s Birmingham office, said: 'Tour operators have a responsibility to ensure that the hotels they send their customers to are safe and comply with health and safety regulations, which are in place to protect guests. ‘It is disappointing that we had to issue court proceedings and then take Paul’s case all the way to trial in order to secure justice for him. ‘This is particularly unfortunate given the ordeal he has already been through, but we hope that the settlement draws a line under this chapter of his life and allows him to begin to move forward.’ MailOnline Travel has contacted Iberostar Daiquiri Hotel for comment.","Paul Hughes became violently ill during a trip to Cayo Guillermo, Cuba .

"By . Rachel O'donoghue For The Daily Mail . Some Britons may feel chronically overworked – but our employers offer more paid holidays than almost anywhere else in the world. Analysis shows that our guaranteed leave of 28 days a year is beaten only by France’s 30. And we are streets ahead of the US – where workers are not actually legally entitled to a single day of paid holiday. Take a break: Brazil, Bolivia, the UK and parts of Europe lead the world in paid leave as this graphic shows . But while it may look like cause for celebration, there is a catch – for when paid public holidays are added to the equation, we slip to tenth, behind the likes of Austria, Spain and Italy. The figures were collated by the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington DC. Its report compared the holiday entitlement in the US with the 20 other richest countries in the world – members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The analysis was based on working an average five-day week; a definitive comparison between nations was not possible because some have different entitlements for different types of worker. On the whole, the UK was found to come second with 28 days of statutory annual leave. Before 2009 there was just a 20-day holiday entitlement, but this was raised to incorporate eight bank holidays to tackle firms’ failure to pay staff for these days. Hot spot: US workers have some of the world's iconic attractions on their doorstep, including the Grand Canyon and Las Vegas, but have to work their socks off to enjoy them . Although the total of 28 is lower than other countries when their respective public holidays are included, the UK figure is still considered favourably because workers can choose to work on public holidays, and take the days off in lieu later on. This means they can ‘bank’ them together and use them to go away on holiday, which workers in several other countries cannot do. Once public holidays are included, France is overtaken by Austria and Portugal, which have 13 public holidays to add to 22 days of statutory annual leave, giving a total of 35 days. Spain is next with 12 public holidays on top of 22 days’ leave. Italy, Belgium, Germany, New Zealand and Ireland also overtake the UK once paid public holidays are included. However, pity the poor Scandinavians. The nations of Denmark, Finland and Sweden have no guaranteed paid public holidays on top of their 25 days of statutory annual leave. The law in the US offers no guarantees of paid leave at all, but workers are given ten days for holidays such as Christmas and Thanksgiving – although there is no guarantee they will be paid on these occasions. Mercifully, most employers do offer their staff paid annual leave – although this is typically limited to just two weeks.","The UK's 28 days of statutory paid leave is the most in the world .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . Trouble: Hunt is thought to have riled up Team England by speaking to the BBC . Andy Hunt, former chief executive and chef de mission of the British Olympic Association, caused meltdown in the Team England camp at the Commonwealth Games by lunchtime on the first day. Hunt, a special advisor to the board of  Commonwealth Games England, had been directed along with the rest of the hierarchy not to do any media interviews unless it was part of a planned communications strategy. But Hunt, so keen on publicity that he was known as the ‘celebrity chef’ during London 2012, nevertheless went ahead with a BBC News interview following Jodie Stimpson winning England’s first gold in the women’s triathlon. And Hunt showed why he shouldn’t have been on air when asked who were now the big hopes for Team England after Mo Farah’s withdrawal. Hunt, embarrassingly for his colleagues, struggled to name anyone before coming up with a couple, including swimmer Michael Jamieson, who happens to be Scottish. Hunt has since been told by angry Team England officials not to make any more media appearances, but may not be able to help himself. How long before RandyShunt, the parody twitter account that poked fun at Hunt’s ‘whoopwhoop’ cheerleading during the Olympics, resurfaces? Concept Sports Management, the agency that represents both Welsh athletes Rhys Williams and Gareth Warburton suspended from the Games for failing drugs tests — understood to possibly be linked to supplements — claims to ‘focus on ensuring all our talent receive the best possible advice’. However, Concept director Steve Griffin would not comment on what specific advice had been given to his two tarnished runners. Ban: Rhys Williams has been provisionally suspended after being charged with an anti-doping violation . The BBC monopoly of the Commonwealth Games stretches to their legion of sports website operatives taking advantage of questions asked by newspaper reporters, who were finally given their chance to talk to Bradley Wiggins and other cyclists after BBC TV and BBC 5 Live had finished their many questions. A Games spokeswoman said on Friday: ‘That is not right,’ and promised to stop the website from invading newspaper territory. Meanwhile a temporary studio has been built to house the BBC breakfast show and main Games programming, despite BBC Scotland having their state-of-the-art HQ nearby featuring the biggest TV recording space ever built in Scotland. But it doesn’t offer the ‘iconic view’ of Glasgow that BBC Sport wanted. The Scottish National Party newpaper, distributed in central Glasgow on Friday, included quotes from former Scotland FA boss David Taylor — described as the current boss of UEFA Events — supporting a Yes vote in the referendum. Taylor sadly died last month. FA probe Roy’s flop . England manager Roy Hodgson’s position may be safe after the World Cup debacle. But at least FA chairman Greg Dyke has reflected in the weeks since the retreat from Rio and listened to his board telling him that not everything about that failed expedition can remain unaffected. So a working party from the executive will  look at whether the massive support network around Hodgson can be improved or offer better value for considerable costs. Yet operationally the FA couldn’t have prepared better or more professionally. It was the manager who couldn’t get the marginal gains from his chosen squad. Probe: The FA will investigate whether Roy Hodgson's support team can be improved . Steven Gerrard’s next Liverpool contract, described by manager Brendan Rodgers as a formality, is sure to reaffirm clauses in the last deal about the talisman captain having a guaranteed five-year ambassador role at the club when his playing career ends. Ambassador positions are increasingly a lucrative option for big names with Alex Ferguson (Man Utd), David Beckham (Sky) and Jose Mourinho (BT) three well-paid examples. The massive publicity campaign for Sky’s new European football channel is led by a David Beckham-fronted big idea TV ad that jokingly included disgarded proposals of drone cams for cricket. The sensitive drone mention has now gone, with Sky insisting the ad has ‘evolved.’ Ambassador: Steven Gerrard should be at Liverpool long after his retirement, if he chooses to be .","Andy Hunt riled Team England by speaking to the BBC after Jodie Stimpson win at the Commonwealth Games on Thursday .

"By . Amanda Williams . Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said police and prosecutors will apply more rigorous tests, after a string of celebrities who faced historic allegations have been cleared . Historic sex abuse allegations will be subject to stricter tests before prosecutions, the country's most senior police officer has said. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said police and prosecutors will apply more rigorous tests after a string of celebrities who faced historic allegations have been cleared. But he said police were duty bound to investigate such allegations in the wake of the scandal caused by disgraced BBC presenter Jimmy Savile. Recent acquittals of celebrities accused of sex crimes include the verdicts in the cases of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache and Michael Le Vell. Last week Conservative MP Nigel Evans was also found not guilty of sex abuse allegations, sparking fierce criticism of the Crown Prosecution Service. Speaking to LBC radio station about how officers would approach cases in the future, he said: 'There is no doubt that both the Crown Prosecution Service and ourselves are going to make a probably more rigorous test of the evidence, given that its such a long time ago. 'I’m sure it’s something that all of us will look at in terms of these historic cases. He added: 'I think we’re trapped in a bit of a fix here. This country does not have, as some countries have, a bar on historic investigations or convictions.' Sir Bernard said that evidence was already reviewed very seriously. Scroll down for video . Acquitted: Michael Le Vell, left, and Bill Roache, right, both actors who appear in Coronation Street, were found not guilty in separate trials . A police whistleblower who resigned after raising concerns about the massaging of crime statistics also confronted the Metropolitan Police Commissioner during the radio phone in. Pc James Patrick asked Sir Bernard during the appearance on LBC whether the force will change the way it deals with whistleblowers after his experience. He told Britain's most senior police officer: 'I feel very, very let down in particular by the senior levels of the Met and I wanted to take the opportunity to say that. 'I sincerely hope that people who want to expose wrongdoing in the Met get a slightly less raw deal in the future.' Speaking to LBC radio station's Nick Ferrari about how officers would approach cases in the future, he said: 'There is no doubt that both the Crown Prosecution Service and ourselves are going to make a probably more rigorous test of the evidence, given that its such a long time ago' Sir Bernard said he would be willing to meet Mr Patrick now that there are no disciplinary proceedings ongoing, and that the force is always willing to look at how it deals with officers who raise concerns. When asked whether Scotland Yard will review procedures, he said: 'We are always prepared to do that. In each case, as you will know sadly in your experience, it's not straightforward. 'Of course we will always be prepared to look at that and if there's anything that comes from it of course we will try and learn. It's a difficult balance to strike.' Mr Patrick gave evidence to an influential committee of MPs claiming that massaging crime figures to hit performance targets had become 'an engrained part of policing culture'. He was separately put under internal investigation by the Met after writing about changes to the police service in a blog, on Twitter and later in a book, The Rest Is Silence. Scotland Yard later downgraded his disciplinary proceedings from gross misconduct to misconduct, meaning he would not have faced the sack. A police whistleblower who resigned after raising concerns about the massaging of crime statistics also confronted the Metropolitan Police Commissioner during the radio phone in . But he then decided to resign, blaming his treatment by the Metropolitan Police in the wake of 'making disclosures in good faith and in the public interest'. Today he told Sir Bernard that there was 'an awful lot' that the force could learn from his case. The commissioner told him: 'I'm sorry about your experience, I'm sure whatever the rights and wrongs it's not something that you have enjoyed, or your family. 'I hope you would be prepared to accept as well although you've got a very firm view about of what you have seen and your experience, I have asked for independent advice to find out whether your allegations are endemic or in fact your experience was a one off.' Mr Patrick's claims about crime statistics, combined with further evidence submitted to Parliament, ultimately led to the UK Statistics Authority stripping police-recorded crime figures of their gold-standard status. (NF: Nick Ferrari BH: Bernard Hogan-Howe) NF: And lastly, Fiona in Clapham, ‘With the collapse of the case against Nigel Evans, is too much money and time being spent on these alleged past offences?’ BH: I think we’re trapped in a bit of a fix here. I think this country doesn’t have, as some countries have, a bar on historical investigations or convictions, just a time limit. NF: A lot of your men and women’s time and money taken up with this, isn’t there, Commissioner? BH: There is, but of course, whichever we do, we’re going to be wrong. We were accused historically of ignoring people who came forward in the Jimmy Savile case, for example, a man who is now dead. NF: And possibly Cyril Smith? BH: And possibly Cyril Smith, so we apparently ignored them at the time. If they come forward now and they say, “Now you’re ignoring me again,” what are we to do? Are we to ignore them twice? I don’t think that’s going to happen. So I think we’ve got to investigate. I think there’s no doubt that both the Crown Prosecution Service and ourselves are going to make probably a more rigorous test of the evidence given it’s such a long time ago. NF: And that’s needed now, isn’t it? BH: Well, I’m sure that it’s something that all of us will look at in terms of these historical cases but I already know that these cases are reviewed very seriously before they are charge contemplated. NF: Alright. BH: What you can never do, none of us can do, is predict the outcome of a jury.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said officers will more rigorously test evidence .

"By . Brendan Carlin for The Mail on Sunday . Home Secretary Theresa May faced a wave of criticism yesterday after proposing anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) to deter British jihadis who cause terror in Iraq and Syria. Mrs May came under fire after saying Asbos could be used to curb extremists’ behaviour and language and could lead to jail if breached. The plan, following the brutal murder of a US journalist by an Islamic State militant thought to be British, won support from No 10 but was condemned by some Tory and Labour MPs. Theresa May, pictured,  wants to introduce Asbos for radicals in a bid to curb the behaviour of extremists . Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the powerful Commons Home Affairs Committee, branded Mrs May’s plan ‘too little, too late’. Muslim Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi warned that the proposals were ‘counter- productive and reactive’. Former Shadow Home Secretary David Davis, writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, said Mrs May’s response lacked focus and urgency. In mocking tones, Mr Davis asked: ‘Asbos for terrorists? It is hard to imagine the ISIS killers quaking in their boots.’ Dismissing the Government’s response so far to the crisis as ‘tentative, uncertain, almost limp,’ he demanded a range of tough measures including stripping British people fighting for IS of their UK citizenship. Lord Carey, former Archbishop of Canterbury, also calls today for Britons pursuing jihad in Iraq and Syria to lose their passports. In an article for The Mail on Sunday, he said: ‘They should not have access to the privilege of travelling under a British passport . . . and they certainly should not be able to travel back with the barbaric and bloodthirsty skills they have gained.’ Meanwhile, the Government last night confirmed for the first time it was supplying body armour and night-vision equipment to help Kurdish forces combat IS terrorists.

"By . Allan Hall . Suing: Dr Daniel Ubani is demanding 2,800 euros after a conference speech was disrupted . A disgraced doctor who killed a British man due to an appalling blunder over his painkillers is suing the dead man's son in Germany because he missed a post-conference dinner. Rory Gray and his brother Stuart disrupted a speech he was giving at a conference on plastic surgery in the German town of Lindau in 2010, calling him a 'charlatan and killer'. Both men were arrested but later released. Dr Daniel Ubani is demanding 2,800 euros - plus legal and court costs - from Rory Gray who lives in Germany. Ubani, who lives in the former western German industrial town of Witten, came to the UK in 2008 as a locum because he wanted extra money. He was working for an out-of-hours medical service  when he gave 70-year-old David Gray a fatal injection in Cambridgeshire. Ubani confused the amount of painkiller he should give renal patient Mr Gray; in the end he gave him ten times the dosage of diamorphine he should have done. Mr Gray died within minutes at his home in Manea, Cambridgeshire, on 16 February 2008. Coroner William Morris later ruled his death 'gross negligence and manslaughter' and issued 11 recommendations to the Department of Health for the improvement of out-of-hours GP services . An arrest warrant was issued in the UK for Ubani to be extradited to stand trial. But he cut a dubious deal with German prosecutors that allowed him to receive a fine - by post - together with a nine month suspended jail sentence for causing death by negligence. Anger: Rory Gray (right) and his brother Stuart (left) disrupted a speech he was giving at a conference on plastic surgery in the German town of Lindau in 2010, calling him a 'charlatan and killer.' Tragedy: David Gray died after being given a massive overdose of painkillers by Dr Ubani . His ability to work in Germany was never questioned despite the fact he was struck off by the GMC in Britain. He refused to attend the inquest into his victim and the medical hearings which barred him from ever working in Britain again. The German Doctors Chamber, the equivalent of the General Medical Council in the UK, still wants Ubani struck off - but they are powerless to force him to go while he still retains the support of the local authority which licenses him. David Gray's sons Dr Stuart Gray, who lives in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, and his brother Rory, who works as a European Space Agency scientist in Darmstadt, have been campaigning to get Ubani struck off in Germany. Now Rory has two weeks to appeal the cash demand from Ubani, who runs a cosmetic clinic as a sideline. He said: 'Ubani is claiming for money to compensate him for missing the function in the evening after the Lindau conference that he had paid to attend. And for compensation for not being paid at Lindau for his talk. 'I find it disgusting that he is still allowed to practice.'

"By . Mark Duell . Landlords in one of Britain's poorest areas are exploiting vulnerable families by building tiny 'sheds with beds' in back gardens to house them in. Newham Council in East London has handed out 42 enforcement notices to slum property owners since September 2011, with the growing problem especially bad in the borough. The wretched backyard and garden sheds, described as ‘little bigger than rabbit hutches’, have been described as dragging London back to the notorious Victorian slum tenements of the 19th century. East End slums: This is the ramshackle inside of a shed on Tower Hamlets Road in Forest Gate, east London . Home: The wretched backyard and garden sheds, described as 'little bigger than rabbit hutches', have been described as dragging London back to Victorian times. This hut is on Tower Hamlets Road in Forest Gate . More and more desperate migrant families have been forced to set up home in cramped wooden sheds crammed into small gardens, which are being rented out by unscrupulous private landlords. They are ruthlessly exploiting a housing crisis and often charging hundreds of pounds a month for the dilapidated huts. Many shed homes have appeared in East Ham, Newham and Forest Gate. Newham Council released pictures last week of a slum on Katharine Road in Forest Gate and another of Tower Hamlets Road in Forest Gate - occupied until recently by a middle-aged man. In some recent cases, enforcement notices were issued ordering the owners to take down the illegal buildings. They complied and dismantled them after being threatened with direct action. The council would have otherwise sent . their own contractors to take down the sheds before sending the bill to . the owner. Each such operation usually costs about £1,000.

'We will never accept private sector tenants being directly exploited by landlords who force them to live in dangerous and unacceptable conditions. One bad house can drag down a whole street.' Dilapidated: A family of four were living in this ramshackle property in Wembley, north-west London . Two years ago MailOnline reported on an Indian father of three who was among thousands of illegal immigrants renting sheds from rogue landlords across London suburbs and the Home Counties. Row after row of terraced Thirties houses in Southall, a predominantly Asian area of west London, had outhouses and garages transformed into makeshift bedsits barely big enough to lie down in. In some, bare electric wires trailed dangerously from extension cables alongside rubber piping carrying cold water from the main house. There were camp beds and inflatable mattresses in others. Some of them also had conversions carried out more professionally - with tiny kitchens and bathrooms complete with running hot water, gas central heating and mini-cookers. Hell on earth: Poverty in a Victorian London slum . The most notorious slum of London's Victorian East End was Old Nichol in Bethnal Green - known for its filthy and narrow streets surrounded by overcrowded tenement buildings and the carcasses of dead animals. The area was dull and grey, blocking out all light, and many houses were prone to flooding because they were below ground level. Broken window panes were often blocked up with newspapers and hats in the winter. In Sarah Wise’s 2008 book The Blackest Streets, she said the area’s 30 or so streets housed around 5,700 people and had a death rate that was almost double that of neighbouring areas. A quarter of all children born in the Nichol died before their first birthday and Old Nichol Street itself was described by the local medical officer, Dr Bate, as being unfit for human habitation. Damp, overcrowding and bad air were all problems. But in 1887, five out of every six infants to die in Bethnal Green homes where the whole family shared a bed had suffocated. Coroners attributed most deaths to 'overlaying', when a sleeping parent or sibling rolled onto the infant, but others suspected that many were intentionally suffocated by desperately poor mothers.","London's Newham Council targeted 42 slum properties since Sep. 2011 .

"By . Reuters Reporter . About 40 per cent of white Americans and about 25 per cent of non-white Americans are surrounded exclusively by friends of their own race, according to an ongoing nationwide poll. The figures highlight how segregated the United States remains in the wake of a debate on race sparked by last month's acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting of unarmed black Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. President Barack Obama weighed in after the verdict, calling for Americans to do some 'soul searching' on whether they harbor racial prejudice. A whopping 40% of white Americans have friends exclusively of the same race (the NBC TV series Friends showed the lives of six white friends living in New York) There are regions and groups where mixing with people of other races is more common, especially in the Hispanic community where only a tenth do not have friends of a different race. About half of Hispanics who have a spouse or partner are in a relationship with non-Hispanics, compared to one tenth of whites and blacks in relationships. Looking at a broader circle of acquaintances to include coworkers as well as friends and relatives, 30 per cent of Americans are not mixing with others of a different race, the poll showed. Respondent Kevin Shaw, 49, has experienced both integration and racial homogeny. He grew up in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, and attended a mixed high school where he was one of only two white teenagers on the mostly black football team. His wife, Bobbi, is Hispanic. They met in high school and have been married for 27 years. WHITE AMERICANS . White Americans: This graph shows almost 40% of white Americans have no friends of another race, and only 10% have just one friend of another race . Eleven years ago, they moved to a predominantly white neighborhood in the suburb of Liberty. 'Soon after we moved in, my mother-in-law came to visit and a neighbor asked if she was my maid. It was just a matter of ignorance,' he said. In the time he has lived there the neighborhood has become less blinkered, helped by the arrival of younger families. He also puts prevailing attitudes down to environment. 'A lot of it comes down to where you grow up,' he said. As a group, Pacific states - including California, the most populous in the nation - are the most diverse when it comes to love and friendship. By contrast, the South has the lowest percentage of people with more than five acquaintances from races that don't reflect their own. BLACK AMERICANS . Black Americans: 37% of Black Americans have no friends of another race, but 33% have five or more friends of another race . Some of this is down to precedent. 'This country has a pretty long history of restriction on inter-racial contact and for whites and blacks, even though it's in the past, there are still echoes of this,' said Ann Morning, an associate professor in the department of sociology at New York University. 'Hispanics and Asian Americans have traditionally had less strict lines about integrating.' In his comments two weeks ago, President Obama expressed optimism about the future, saying his daughters' experiences show younger generations have fewer issues with race. 'It doesn't mean we're in a post-racial society. It doesn't mean that racism is eliminated. But...they're better than we are, they're better than we were, on these issues,' he said. Younger American adults appear to confirm this, according to the poll. About one third of Americans under the age of 30 who have a partner or spouse are in a relationship with someone of a different race, compared to one tenth of Americans over 30. And only one in 10 adults under 30 say no one among their families, friends or coworkers is of a different race, less than half the rate for Americans as a whole. HISPANIC AMERICANS . Hispanic Americans: Only 17% of Hispanic Americans have no friends of another race and 41% have five or more friends from another race . 'My Mom's school, they had ended segregation, but she told me there was still basically one side of the road for whites and one side of the road for blacks,' respondent Carlon Carter, 18, said. A keen athlete and music fan, his racially diverse group of friends in Birmingham, Alabama, comes from these shared interests. 'There's a big difference now. We don't see each other so much like 'you're white and I'm black'. If you like the same thing I like, then that's all that matters,' he said. These results were taken from the ongoing Reuters/Ipsos online poll and include the responses of 4,170 Americans between July 24th and August 6th. The credibility interval, a measure of precision, for these results is plus or minus about 2.7 percentage points for a five-day average on any given day during that period. Smaller subsets of the poll, such as blacks, Hispanics and adults under 30, have a credibility interval for that period ranging from about 3 percentage points to 11 percentage points. The race and ethnicity questions in this story are part a polling project that started in January 2012, surveying about 11,000 people a month since then.","Around 25% of non-white Americans are surrounded exclusively by friends of their own race .

"EXCLUSIVE By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A healthy eating campaign funded by the taxpayer has come under fire for giving free advertising to junk food firms. Shoppers are being offered money off fizzy drinks, tinned vegetables and ready meals with vouchers sent to more than 100,000 people who want to improve their diet. Now the government has been accused of ‘endorsing’ companies like Pepsi and Uncle Ben’s while 'doing nothing' to tackle the nation’s obesity crisis. More than 100,000 people have been sent Smart Swap packs after signing up online . The campaign has been condemned for giving free advertising to firms like Pepsi, Flora and Uncle Ben's while appearing to endorse fizzy drinks, ready meals and tinned vegetables . The Smart Swaps campaign was launched by Change4Life, run by Public Health England, last month. It encourages people to switch from unhealthy food and drink to low fat, low sugar alternatives. People who sign up are sent money off vouchers, fridge magnets and a ‘Smart Swapper’ wheel containing advice on how to eat more healthily. One of the tips on a magnet states: ‘You oughta swap to water.’ But the vouchers enclosed in the same pack include 25p off a 600ml bottle of Pepsi Max and 25p off a 1litre bottle of Robinson Fruit Squash. After being contacted by MailOnline, Change4Life said the inclusion of sugar-free fizzy drinks is now being 'reviewed'. The packs also include 30p off a tub of Flora light, £1 off Cheeky Cow cheese and 30p off Green Giant tinned sweetcorn. There is also a 30p discount on a £1.99 Uncle Ben’s RiceTime, an instant pot snack from the company owned by Mars. The companies paid nothing to be included in the promotions and just had to offer some form of discount to encourage people to reduce the amount of fat, sugar and calories in their diets. The government-backed support for some of the world’s biggest food firms has been condemned by MPs and food experts. Critics claims the campaign should be focussed on fresh, nutritious food not swapping to food which is just less harmful than full fat alternatives. The discounts on fizzy drinks have been criticised on Twitter and Facebook . Free fridge magnets urge people to 'swap' to water, but the vouchers give money off squash and fizzy drinks . The scheme has also been criticised on social media. On Twitter @Herders76 wrote: ‘Our esteemed & illustrious government have sent me a 25p off Pepsi Max voucher in a healthier you, change for life campaign. Just odd.’ Leanne Herdman added: ‘Was expecting fresh veg/fruit/milk vouchers, disappointed to see fizzy drinks promoted.’ Others argued the government should be promoting fresh British products not ‘junk’. Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston condemned the ‘free advertising’ being given to big name brands. She told MailOnline: ‘I agree with the principle of swapping, so you have something which is very similar but actually causes less harm.’ Fizzy drinks are one of the biggest causes of obesity in children, she added. ‘If you cannot persuade some parents to stop giving them to children, you could get them to make a less harmful choice. ‘I share the concern that sending people vouchers starts to look a bit more like advertising. There are other mechanisms that much more powerful.’ The Smart Swapper suggests making drinks using fresh fruits and fizzy water, instead of buying branded pop . Dr Wollaston, a former GP and member . of the health select committees, suggested discounts and offers should . be offered on low-sugar and low-salt products in store to encourage . shoppers to switch. ‘Uncle Ben’s and Pepsi are getting a bit of free advertising. It is a form of product endorsement. ‘Do . I think it’s the best way of reducing harm? No. It is a good way of . ticking a box and getting endorsement from Her Majesty’s government. Is . that really going to address the nation’s obesity crisis?’ Tam . Fry, spokesman for the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘I regard it as . being straightforward advertising which has been foisted on the . Department of Health by an industry which wishes to put itself in a good . light and has convinced DoH it is a brilliant idea. ‘It’s . just another way in which the punter is being persuaded to go off and . buy this, that and the other and the only winners are the stores that . you buy them in.’ Tory MP Dr Sarah Wollaston said the campaign was giving government endorsement to global food brands . Change4Life insists that there are no obesity or dietary related health risks to drinking diet versions of carbonated drinks. The campaign highlighted extensive . consumer research which shows that people need 'swaps' to be as . simple as possible and to not feel like they are having to give-up their . favourite foods and drinks. Professor Kevin Fenton, National Director of Health and Wellbeing, said: 'No company paid to be included within the packs. All organisations that signed up to be Change4Life partners for the campaign were able to support in ways appropriate to the campaigns objectives. 'All partners were asked to supply money off next purchase vouchers to help incentivise families to make healthier swaps and reduce the amount of fat, sugar and calories in their diets.' Change4Life will consider the results of the campaign and review whether no added sugar carbonated soft drinks is permanently included into the retail guidance. Prof Fenton added: 'Smart Swaps is about encouraging families to make some easy like-for-like swaps to their diet in January and beyond to remove calories, fat and sugar. ‘Clearly the ""ideal"" swap would be from sugary drinks to water, hence the fridge magnet fun reminder ‘you oughta swap to water’, but there are still significant benefits to be had in encouraging a nationwide shift from sugary to sugar-free/diet variants. 'Research shows there are no obesity/dietary related health risks to drinking diet versions of carbonated drinks. 'In fact, there are significant health benefits to switching from a sugary drink to a diet or sugar free version.’ Chaneg4Life was criticised for a similar campaign in 2011, when it offered £50 worth of vouchers for losing weight. It . later emerged that many of the 'deals' on offer were available to . anyone, and in some cases the same or similar items could be bought more . cheaply without the vouchers.","More than 100,000 people sign up to Change4Life's Smart Swap campaign .

"By . Ben Spencer . and Tom Kelly . Emergency services were hit by a surge in 999 calls yesterday as the deadly smog tightened its grip on Britain. Complaints about breathing problems rocketed and people were urged to avoid strenuous outdoor activity as the fumes enveloped many parts of the country. David Cameron, who abandoned his regular morning jog, was criticised for dismissing the potent cocktail of toxic particles, factory pollution and dust from the Sahara as a 'naturally occurring weather phenomenon'. Scroll down for video . Hard to see: Tower Bridge and HMS Belfast in Central London today. High air pollution levels of level 7 were measured in the capital yesterday . Scientists said the health crisis was as much to do with his Government's failure to deal with poor air quality. As the pollution reached ten, the maximum on the official scale measuring air quality, for a second day: . London and the South-East were again among areas worst hit, with the London Ambulance Service reporting a 14 per cent rise in 999 calls related to breathing difficulties. Ambulance services in the West Midlands and the East of England experienced a spike in emergency calls, while the smog also affected the North-West, Yorkshire and South Wales. Nearly a third of asthmatics suffered an attack as a result of the pollution, a poll for Asthma UK found, while 84 per cent reported using their blue reliever inhaler more than usual. Asthma UK chief executive Kay Boycott said the smog was having 'a significant impact on the health and quality of life' of asthmatics and they needed to take urgent action to stay safe.

She added: 'Asthma can be very serious, it takes the lives of three people every day so we want to do everything we can to help people minimise their risk of a potentially life threatening attack.' Dr Sotiris Vardoulakis of Public Health England said: 'Some parts of the country have now recorded very high levels of air pollution and PHE is urging people in those areas to reduce physical exertion, particularly outdoors, especially if they experience symptoms such as a cough or sore throat. Adults and children with lung problems, adults with heart problems, and older people, in areas where high levels are recorded should avoid strenuous physical activity.' London Ambulance Service deputy medical director Fenella Wrigley said: 'More people are calling us with breathing difficulties, asthma and heart problems.' She said the young and healthy are unlikely to suffer serious short-term effects from the pollution but anyone with sore eyes, a tickly cough or a dry throat should see their pharmacist or GP if symptoms persist. She warned the smog had made it a busy time for the service and urged people to call only in a genuine emergency.

Walking to work: Commuters cross London Bridge in the smog this morning, with Tower Bridge in the background . Although the smog is forecast to begin to clear today as the wind picks up, experts say the NHS may remain under pressure as people suffer delayed symptoms brought on by inhaling the dust. Mike McKevitt, head of patient services at the British Lung Foundation, said: 'It would be surprising if we didn't see an overall increase in the number of hospital admissions as a result of the pollution, certainly among people with respiratory condition such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is often a slight delay between exposure to pollutants and the onset of breathlessness, coughing and wheezing, so it is also possible that the ill effects of the pollution has yet to take hold in many people.' Although the Saharan dust and fumes blown in from Europe are part of the problem, scientists insist pollution from UK cars and factories is a major factor. Dr Helen Dacre, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, warned: 'Toxic gases, such as nitrogen dioxide and ozone, as well as fine dust particles all contribute to cause problems for people with heart, lung and breathing problems, such as asthma.' The Prime Minister told BBC1's Breakfast: 'It is unpleasant, and you can feel it in the air. 'I didn't go for my morning run this morning. I chose to do some work instead. You can feel it.' However, Mr Cameron insisted: 'But it's a naturally occurring weather phenomenon. It sounds extraordinary, Saharan dust, but that is what it is.' London mayor Boris Johnson, who has been criticised for failing to deal with London's poor air quality, told ITV News: 'I cycled this morning and it seemed perfectly fine to me. 'I think we need to keep a little bit of a sense of proportion.' Critics said Mr Cameron's 'flippant remark' and Mr Johnson's comments demonstrated the Government's failure to get to grips with air pollution, which was linked to the premature deaths of more than 29,000 people in Britain last year, according to official figures. Keith Taylor, Green MEP for South-East England, said Mr Cameron's remark was 'utterly disgraceful'. He said: 'In the last ten years nearly 300,000 people have died because of air pollution in the UK, that's the equivalent of a city the size of Newcastle. 'Yet the Prime Minister has the audacity to lay the entire blame for the smog on Saharan dust.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . They were among the most poignant symbols of the recession, hundreds of unfinished Irish housing estates that had to be abandoned following the credit crunch of the late 2000s. But now demolition has begun on some of the last of the remaining ghost estates, built during the economic boom of 'Celtic Tiger' years but now deemed 'not economically viable'. Between the mid-1990s and 2007, Irish developers flocked to build new homes, spurred on by the easy availability of credit, cheap labour from eastern Europe and a vibrant Dublin property market.

Some unlucky buyers were caught in the middle of the crash and found themselves trapped living in dangerous, unfinished properties next to rows of empty buildings. In 2009, the Irish government announced that it would invest €20m in properties on ghost estates to use for social housing, but the plan was widely criticised because of the lack of basic amenities such as schools on the estates. As a result many were simply neglected and left to fall into disrepair. In February 2012, a two-year-old boy died after drowning in a pool of water on an unfinished ghost estate.

According to figures published in November, since 2010 the number of completed but vacant housing units fell by 72 per cent from 23,250 to 6,350 while the number of unfinished developments fell by 55.8 per cent from 2,846 to 1,258. In October, the Government said it would allocate €10million to resolving the problem of ghost estates and last month Irish Housing Minister Jan O’Sullivan ordered a further 40 of the worst ghost estates should be pulled down at the developers' expense.

Breitbart who published the infamous tweets that brought down former Representative Anthony Weiner, died 'unexpectedly from natural causes' this morning in Los Angeles. His death was confirmed by Breitbart.com editor-in-chief Joel Pollak, who says he was at the hospital, and by the Los Angeles County coroner's office. Sudden: Conservative publisher and author Andrew Breitbart, the former editor of Drudge report has died, aged 43 . Breitbart was walking near his house in the Brentwood neighborhood shortly after midnight Thursday when he collapsed, his father-in-law Orson Bean said. Someone saw him fall and called paramedics, who tried to revive him. They rushed him to the emergency room at UCLA Medical Center, Bean said. Breitbart had suffered heart problems a year earlier, but Bean said he could not pinpoint what happened. 'I don't know what to say. It's devastating,' Bean told The Associated Press. He is survived by his wife Susannah Bean Breitbart, 41, and four children. Tragic death: Breitbart leaves behind a wife and four children .

Andrew lived boldly, so that we more timid souls would dare to live freely and fully, and fight for the fragile liberty he showed us how to love. Andrew recently wrote a new conclusion to his book, Righteous Indignation: . ''I love my job. I love fighting for what I believe in. I love having fun while doing it. I love reporting stories that the Complex refuses to report. I love fighting back, I love finding allies, and—famously—I enjoy making enemies. Three years ago, I was mostly a behind-the-scenes guy who linked to stuff on a very popular website. I always wondered what it would be like to enter the public realm to fight for what I believe in. I’ve lost friends, perhaps dozens. But I’ve gained hundreds, thousands—who knows?—of allies. At the end of the day, I can look at myself in the mirror, and I sleep very well at night.''

Entrepeneur: Andrew Breitbart set up a series of news websites of his own including Breitbart.com, Breitbart.tv, Big Hollywood, Big Government, Big Journalism and Big Peace . She wrote: 'I was asked many times . this morning for my thoughts on what Andrew meant to the political . world, but all I can think of at the moment is what Andrew meant to me . as a friend, starting from when we worked together -- his passion, his . exuberance, his fearlessness. And above all, what I'm thinking of at the . moment is his amazing wife Susie and their four beautiful young . children. My love and thoughts are with them right now.' The provocative publisher was also . the proprietor of his own stable of right-leaning news websites . including Breitbart.com, Breitbart.tv, Big Hollywood, Big Government, . Big Journalism and Big Peace. Big Government is best known for . breaking and reporting the ACORN child sex trafficking scandal and for . exposing last year's 'Weinergate' scandal. Breitbart was an outspoken critic of the mainstream media. His efforts were behind controversial investigations that led to the resignations of former Rep. Anthony Weiner and former Agriculture Department official Shirley Sherrod. He was lionised by his fans for his efforts at exposing government corruption and media bias. Breitbart was at the center of two video controversies in recent years - one that led to the firing of an Agriculture Department employee over an edited video of what appeared to be a racist remark, and another that embarrassed the community group ACORN when workers were shown counseling actors posing as a prostitute and pimp. Breitbart is known for disseminating an edited video that showed an Agriculture Department employee making what appeared to be racist remarks. Sherrod, who is black, was fired from . her job as Georgia state rural development director in July 2010 after . the video surfaced. She is seen telling a local NAACP group that she was . initially reluctant to help a white farmer save his farm more than two . decades ago, long before she worked for USDA. Missing from the clip was the rest of . the speech, which was meant as a lesson in racial healing. Sherrod told . the crowd she eventually realized her mistake and helped the farmer . save his farm. She has since filed a lawsuit against Breitbart. Breitbart's websites also featured a . 2009 hidden-camera sting video that brought embarrassment to the . community group ACORN. The videos show ACORN staffers offering advice on . taxes and other issues to actors posing as a prostitute and pimp. Those videos triggered a firestorm of . criticism, with some ACORN employees appearing willing to support . illegal schemes involving tax advice, misuse of public funds and illegal . trafficking in children. An internal review later concluded . the videos 'feed the impression that ACORN believes it is above the . law.' The internal investigation and a Government Accountability Office . report cleared ACORN of criminal activities. Even so, public pressure led Congress . to block previously approved funds from going to ACORN and to stop . future payments. Roughly 10 percent of ACORN's funds came from federal . grants and the group eventually disbanded. Breitbart also sparked a controversy . that ultimately led to Weiner's resignation. His problems began on May . 28 when Bretibart's biggovernment.com posted a lewd photograph of an . underwear-clad crotch and said it had been sent from Weiner's Twitter . account to a Seattle woman. Strong character: Breitbart also had his own radio show which he used to put forward his opinions . Initially, Weiner lied, saying his account had been hacked. But he pointedly did not report the incident to law enforcement — a step that could have led the way to charges of wrongdoing far more serious than mere sexting. Additionally, his public denials were less than solid — particularly when he told an interviewer that he could not 'say with certitude' that he wasn't the man in the underwear photo. Weiner's spokesman said the photo was just 'a distraction' and that the congressman 'doesn't know the person named by the hacker.' The congressman denied sending the photo and said he had retained an attorney and hired a private security company to figure out how someone could pull off such a prank. But Weiner dropped that story line on June 6, offering a lengthy public confession at a Manhattan news conference, acknowledging to online activity involving at least six women. It was a remarkable turn of events for the brash Weiner, who conceded to a 'hugely regrettable' lapse in judgment. 'I called you a putz cause I thought you were being intentionally disingenuous. If not I apologize' Breitbart seldom showed restraint in his vitriol to his critics and seemed to relish in the negative attention his antics earned him. After Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts died in 2009, Breitbart tweeted 'Rest in Chappaquiddick' and called him 'a special pile of human excrement.' When critics questioned his tone, he tweeted they 'missed my best ones!' Breitbart's final tweet, posted shortly before he died, exemplified the agressive manner he took with fellow commenators. 'I called you a putz cause I thought you were being intentionally disingenuous. If not I apologize,' he wrote in response to a Twitter user he had been disagreeing with. News of the prolific commentator's death resounded in political circles. Rick Santorum told Fox News he was 'crestfallen.' 'What a powerful force,' Santorum said. 'What a huge loss, in my opinion, for our country and certainly for the conservative movement.' 'RIP `O Mighty Warrior!' Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a message on Twitter, Media Matters, the liberal watchdog that was a frequent Breitbart critic, said the organization's 'thoughts and prayers are with his family today.''We've disagreed more than we've found common ground, but there was never any question of Andrew's passion for and commitment to what he believed,' said Media Matters' Ari Rabin-Havt.Mitt Romney posted to Twitter: 'Ann and I are deeply saddened by the passing of (at)AndrewBreitbart: brilliant entrepreneur, fearless conservative, loving husband and father.'Newt Gingrich tweeted: 'Andrew Breitbart was the most innovative pioneer in conservative activist social media in America. He had great courage and creativity.' His newest book 'Righteous Indignation: Excuse Me While I Save the World!' was on the New York Times bestseller list.

"By . Leon Watson . and James Slack . and Ian Drury . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling vowed to take action after a group of Iraqis were accused of conspiring to claim  soldiers had executed prisoners . Lawyers who accuse British troops of abuse in warzones will no longer be able to get millions of pounds in legal aid for their clients, the Justice Secretary said yesterday. Chris Grayling vowed to take action after a group of Iraqis were accused of conspiring to claim  soldiers had executed prisoners. Lawyers embroiled in the case have received a total of £10million in legal aid, MPs heard yesterday. Mr Grayling said that – if it was found claims against the Army had been lodged on a 'false basis' – he would seek to recover some of the money. The Al Sweady Inquiry is examining claims that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and  tortured nine others at a camp near Basra in May 2004. But after a year-long hearing costing taxpayers £27million, the case fell apart when lawyers for the Iraqis admitted there was no evidence that insurgents were murdered. The inquiry also heard that evidence linking the men to a 'terrorist organisation' in Iraq had been suppressed by lawyers. It is claimed they would never have got legal aid to fight the case if the full facts had been known. They are being represented by Phil Shiner's Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day. The Iraqis have no residency rights in Britain and live overseas. In the Commons, Tory MP David Mowat said: 'Two firms of lawyers that specialise in suing active servicemen, Public Interest Lawyers and Leigh Day, have received £10million in legal aid in the last three years, and the MoD has subsequently spent many more millions on defending those cases. 'No other country in the world would pay lawyers to sue its own army. When we will stop doing so?' Mr Grayling replied that he was introducing a residence test that would mean 'such cases were no longer possible'. This will work by banning foreign nationals from receiving legal aid for civil claims until they have lived here for at least a year. Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers outlines his case against the Ministry of Defence as he stands outside the High Court in central London last year. Shiner was representing a number of Iraqi civilians who claim to have been abused and tortured and seen family members killed by members of the British military . Kenyans (left to right) Wambugu Wa Nyingi, Jane Muthoni Mara, Paulo Nzili and Ndiku Mutua, outside the Royal Courts of Justice, in central London. Lawyers Leigh Day & Co claim that the four representative lead cases were victims of grave acts of torture - including castration and severe sexual assault - by British officials in camps during the Mau Mau Uprising between 1952 and 1961 . There are currently no nationality or . residence restrictions on civil legal aid. The Justice Secretary said: . 'I think it important for there to be restraints on our legal aid . system.' Mr Grayling added: . 'If the taxpayer has ended up paying a large amount of money for a case . brought on a false premise, I will want to take the strongest possible . action, including looking at taking financial measures against the firms . involved.' The Al Sweady inquiry was named after one of those who died in 2004. The . Iraqis alleged troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took . bloody revenge for the massacre of six Royal Military policemen a year . earlier. The MoD insisted the men were insurgents killed in battle. A spokesman for Leigh Day defended the firm's work, saying the figures quoted are 'nonsense'. He said: 'We are proud to be a legal aid firm representing people from around this country and beyond when they come up against injustice of many sorts, acting for the vulnerable in cases of clinical negligence, disability discrimination and abuse cases. 'Within that we have acted for injured service personnel as well as injured civilians against the MoD primarily on a no win no fee basis but also occasionally with the benefit of legal aid. 'Legal aid remains essential for the access to justice it provides to all individuals to ensure that not only this Government, but also future Governments, can be held accountable by individuals for their actions, whether here or overseas. 'The sums quoted by Mr Mowat are nonsense. They clearly include all the legal aid work the firm does in providing for individuals to protect their rights and compensate them for injuries against Government and large corporations. 'Any legal aid we have received in terms of claims against the MoD are totally marginal. We received no legal aid for the Al Sweady inquiry.'","MP says no other country would 'pay lawyers to sue our own Army'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Saudi Arabian princess has caused a potential diplomatic row by seeking political asylum in the UK because she fears for her safety in her home country. Princess Sara bint Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, the niece of Saudi Arabia's ruler, is living in London after claiming she is being persecuted by her own family and the Saudi authorities. The mother-of-four has accused senior Saudi officials of plotting to kidnap her and get her back to Riyadh, following 'baseless' claims she has sided with Saudi Arabia's political opponents. Claims: Princess Sara said she wants to stay in the UK as she has been assaulted, threatened and persecuted by her family and members of the Saudi authorities . The 38-year-old also says to have been assaulted and threatened, and that there have been abduction attempts made against her children, all for political reasons. Princess Sara, the pampered granddaughter of the Kingdom's founder, is now seeking political asylum in the UK and is living in a five-star London hotel with her four children and two dogs. UK ministers will have to assess her claims and decide whether to offer her asylum, thereby defying Saudi officials who want her to return to her native country. Princess Sara has already lived in the UK since 2007, after falling out with her 80-year-old father, Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud. She has also been locked in a long-running inheritance battle with her brother, Prince Turki bin Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud, over their dead mother’s £325 million fortune. Family feud: Princess Sara is the niece of Saudi King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz Al Saud . Princess Sara said in a statement she wanted political asylum as her and her children's leave to stay in the UK had expired. She said: 'So, with deep regret, and . as I have been left with no other choice, I have written to the UK Home . Office to indicate that I, and my children, wish to be granted political . asylum. 'My reputation has been besmirched in the media by a baseless and malicious smear campaign. 'For . years I have endured all this in silence, while trying to resolve my . situation with dignity through the normal channels, without fanfare or . publicity. 'But my pleas to . the Saudi authorities in the Kingdom have been obstructed and denied, . and the Saudi embassy in London has turned its back on me.' Princess . Sara went on to say that she has 'nothing but respect for my uncle King . Abdullah bin Abdulaziz, the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, and the . people of Saudi Arabia'. 'All . I have ever sought is my legitimate rights, so that my children and I . can resume our lives with dignity and I can resume my civil society and . development work.' Princess . Sara told the Sunday Telegraph the incident which saw her fall out with . her father 'shook her world', but would not reveal more details about . it. Describing their relationship, she said: 'Everything goes back to a certain aspect that I don’t discuss in public. Something happened with my father and he didn’t take it lightly. 'He retaliated against me and wanted to crush me. I had been his closest; I had been his favourite.' The Sunday Telegraph quoted a Saudi embassy diplomat as saying: 'The embassy has been involved in settling her visa issue and residency issue in the UK. We have tried to settle this issue. 'This matter is of a personal nature so there is only so much the government can do. It’s not a political matter.'","Princess Sara bint Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud staying in UK due to political row with family and Saudi authorities .

"By . Matthew Kalman . and Tim Shipman . Israel is planning a military strike against Iran’s nuclear programme before November, security sources in Israel have claimed. British officials say prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has begun a process of ‘sounding out’ his voters to gauge support for airstrikes and build a case for military action. Alon Ben-David, the well-informed military correspondent for Israel’s Channel 10 News, claimed on Monday that the country was ‘closer than ever’ to a strike against Iran. Iran unveiled upgrades to six weapons today, including the Fateh-110 missile, which boasts a range of about 180 miles . He said Nr Netanyahu was ‘determined’ to attack Iran before the US election on November 6 – just 11 weeks away. Israeli leaders believe that . President Obama, locked in a close election battle with Republican Mitt . Romney, would be forced to back an Israeli strike – even though US . military chiefs are against it – for fear of alienating Jewish voters in . key swing states such as Florida. Tensions grew yesterday when Iranian . leaders displayed a new arsenal of Fateh-110 short-range missiles . designed to destroy targets within 180 miles, including US warships in . the Persian Gulf. Western intelligence agencies are . watching the regime in Tehran closely after senior figures described . Israel as ‘a cancer’ that should be ‘wiped off the map’ at the weekend. The hardware was presented at a ceremony attended by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . Yesterday Iranian president Mahmoud . Ahmadinejad said: ‘I have no doubt that our defensive capabilities can . stand up to bullying and put a halt to their plans.’ Mr Netanyahu has described the . Islamist country’s nuclear ambitions as ‘an existential threat’ that . could be used to destroy the Jewish state. But British and American security chiefs believe military action would spark a lethal Middle East conflict. Last week, US defence secretary Leon . Panetta and the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff,  Martin . Dempsey, held an unprecedented briefing at the Pentagon to warn against . an Israeli strike. ‘They could delay but not destroy . Iran’s nuclear capabilities,’ General Dempsey said. This week he added . that the US and Israel had reached ‘different conclusions’ about the . imminent threat from Iran. British diplomats and intelligence . chiefs believe Mr Netanyahu is preparing the ground for possible . military action but stress they have no foreknowledge of any attack. ‘We would not expect to know anything . about it in advance,’ one official said. ‘It is not even clear whether . they would tell the Americans until very close to the act itself, or . possibly slightly after it.’ Western intelligence agencies doubt . whether an Israeli strike alone would be enough to destroy the Iranian . nuclear programme, but they acknowledge that Israel believes even . delaying it might be a price worth paying. ‘It looks like Netanyahu is having a . very vocal conversation about this to build the case for action or to . test the ground with his own electorate, or possibly both,’ the official . said. Iran has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, the neck of the Gulf through which 40 per cent of the world's sea-borne oil exports pass . President Obama has sent a series of . senior officials to Israel in recent months, including Secretary of . State Hillary Clinton, to try to persuade Mr Netanyahu that the . crippling sanctions regime now in place will force Iran to abandon its . nuclear programme. The UK has also sent the message that . an escalating roster of economic sanctions against Iran should be used . to encourage them to back down. Even senior Israeli defence and . intelligence figures, including the recently-retired head of the Mossad . spy agency, have opposed an Israeli attack. Military analysts have warned that, . without US bunker-busting bombs and other vital armaments, Israel cannot . destroy Iran’s well-defended nuclear installations. But Mr Netanyahu appears determined to strike. ‘From the prime minister’s point of view, the time for action is getting ever closer,’ Ben-David said. Behind the scenes, a shadow . intelligence war appears to be escalating. Key Iranian nuclear . scientists have been assassinated or disappeared and Iran’s computer . networks have been infiltrated by a series of sophisticated viruses . apparently designed to sabotage control systems at its nuclear research . facilities.","Iranian TV announces upgrades to short-range missiles and more powerful naval engine .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans for MailOnline . and Mike Dickson for MailOnline . Tennis star: Andy Murray today revealed he would play for Scotland if it became independent . With only 20 days left until polls open, the campaign for Scottish independence has sparked huge political debate across Britain. And now, tennis star Andy Murray has revealed that he would play for Scotland if it became independent. The 27-year-old, who was born in Glasgow and grew up in Dunblane, said he would represent his country even if it opts to leave the UK in the 2014 referendum. But he added that he does not believe independence is likely to happen. Speaking of the 2016 Olympics, Murray told MailOnline: 'If it happened where, if Scotland became independent, then I imagine I would be playing for Scotland.' But he added: 'I haven't thought much about that yet because I don't think it's looking too likely that it's going to happen. 'Ever since I started travelling to tournaments aged 11, I played under Great Britain. When I travelled to team events or overseas, we were always Great Britain. That's normal to me. 'But if it did happen [if Scotland became independent], then it would be pretty much the first time in my life that I have represented Scotland.' Murray, who has famously refused to endorse either side of the argument in the referendum, said he has followed the debate 'very closely'. He said: 'I watched 45 minutes of the second [television] debate . But I didn't see the first one.  I'm not going into that. I don't want to talk about politics here. I'll worry about my tennis.' Since his rise to fame, Murray's national identity has been widely commented on by the British media. In . 2006, the sportsman provoked a backlash when he joked that he . would support 'anyone but England' in the football World Cup, a remark he said he later regretted. Scroll down for video . Debate: The campaign for Scottish independence has sparked huge political debate across Britain. Above, Alistair Darling's (left) poor act in the second TV debate gave a huge boost to Alex Salmond's (right) campaign . Narrower lead: Following the TV debate, a poll by the Scottish Daily Mail revealed the . No campaign still has a six-point lead over the Yes campaign, but that . is down from a 14-point lead enjoyed just three weeks ago . And during a cameo appearance on comedy show Outnumbered, he was asked whether he considers himself to be British or Scottish. Murray responded: 'It depends if I'm winning.' Yesterday, the . tennis player eased his way into the third round of the US Open by . defeating Germany's Matthias Bachinger 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. It comes as Alistair . Darling’s poor performance in the second television debate on Scottish independence has given a huge boost . to Alex Salmond’s campaign. The debate . on Monday, which was watched by more than two million people, was . a disaster for the No campaign, which saw its lead narrow sharply. Success: Today, Murray eased his way into the third round of the US Open by defeating Germany's Matthias Bachinger 6-3, 6-3, 6-4. Above, the tennis star is pictured returning a shot to Bachinger during the match . A poll by the Scottish Daily Mail revealed the pro-Union Better Together campaign led by Mr Darling still enjoys a six percentage point lead over the independence supporters among decided voters. But this is down from the 14-point lead it had after the first debate three weeks ago. If the shift in support towards the Nationalists continues at the same rate until polling day on September 18, it would see Scotland vote to leave the UK, ending the 300-year-old union. The poll results came as David Cameron warned that one million jobs rely on the Union and urged, ‘Let’s stay together.’ Prime Minister: David Cameron has warned that one million jobs rely on the Union, urging 'Let's stay together' The Prime Minister said: ‘I want to talk about the business case for Scotland in the UK, something which matters to every man, woman and child in our country. ‘Our economy’s first great advantage is opportunity – the opportunity that comes from a domestic market of 60million people and nearly five million businesses. ‘This is one of the oldest and most successful single markets in the world. But if we pull that apart, if we make foreigners of our neighbours, business becomes tougher, trade becomes more costly and complex, and jobs become harder to find.’","Andy Murray claims he would play for Scotland if it became independent .

"By . Mail Online Reporter . Legendary professional wrestler Jake 'The Snake' Roberts is in intensive care at a Las Vegas hospital after being collapsing on a flight as his body struggled against a reported 'double pneumonia' infection. Friend and fellow former pro-wrestler Diamond Dallas Page tweeted that the WWE Hall of Famer was out of a coma but far from stable. 'Jake is now conscious but still fading in and out,' he wrote. 'Please keep the prayers coming.' Former WWE star Jake 'The Snake' Roberts is in intensive care at a Las Vegas hospital after being collapsing on a flight as his body struggled against a reported 'double pneumonia' infection . Roberts had gone from professional ruin and drug abuse to sobriety and elder statesman status in recent years . The Washington Post reports that Jake had recently ignored medical advice to seek treatment for his infection before his flight. While some wrestlers rose to the top with Herculean physiques or outstanding feats of strength, Roberts made his name as a master of ring psychology. In 1999 documentary 'Beyond the Mat,' peers praised his ability to connect with audiences on the microphone, or in the ring with just a simple, well-timed glare. Roberts returned to the WWE this year to be inducted into the Hall of Fame . Fans who may not remember his matches almost certainly remember his python, Damien, who Roberts would carry to the ring with him in a burlap sack before unleashing the snake on a fallen opponent. That same documentary also revealed how far Roberts had fallen, with the man who once entertained as man as 80,000 spectators a night reduced to smoking crack in cheap hotel rooms and performing in small town gymnasiums. At the height of his fame, Roberts was known for his python, Damien, which would accompany him to the ring . But in recent years he seemed to have his life back on track. He had become a devoted follower of Diamond Dallas Page's DDP Yoga program, which was given a lengthy profile this month in The New York Times, saying that the discipline saved him from a life where 'My daily workout was a crack pipe and a six-pack.’ After years in the professional wilderness, he was welcomed back to the WWE for an edition of 'Old School Raw' in January and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame the night before Wrestlemania XXX. 'I went through a lot in my life that scared me pretty good,' Roberts told the WWE's Zach Linder. 'I built a wall around myself to the point where nobody knew what was really going on inside of me, including myself.'","Friend Diamond Dallas Page says Roberts is 'fading in and out'

The 22-year-old Burberry model appears as the face of a range of unisex T-shirts featuring X-rated graphics of naked bodies in compromising positions.

The 22-year-old Burberry model appears as the face of a range of X-rated T-shirts . Suki, who is dating Hollywood actor Bradley Cooper, even art directed and edited the photo shoot. The Londoner wears items - coming in at £25 each - with provocative names such as Serpent B***, Sexy Lips and Lady Finger. The illustrations were all created by Jacob Escott, art director of the London-based magazine. Suki's relationship with the magazine stems from its inception last year.

Suki then approached Lisa and asked to be part of its pilot issue, subsequently becoming the publication's main backer. She has been involved in Prowl's creative projects from the beginning, including performances at events and contributing with a regular photo column featuring her private imagery. Soon after, umbrella company Prowl House, 'a creative network which celebrates the art of being human', decided to launch the True Love T-shirt line.

"By . Snejana Farberov for Mail online . Viral: Thomas Guerra, 29, a landscape architect from California, is facing charges that he intentionally spread HIV to his boyfriend, and possible to two dozen others . A landscaper from California who claimed to be related to a civil rights leader has been accused of intentionally infecting at least two dozen men with HIV. Spokesman Michael Giorgino said San Diego’s attorney's office presented the court a complaint Thursday alleging Thomas Miguel Guerra, 29, intentionally infected a man with the virus that can cause AIDS. According to prosecutors, Guerra was on a mission to spread the potentially deadly virus to as many people as possible. Guerra, who also goes by the name Ashton Chavez on the gay dating site Grindr, has pleaded not guilty to a previous count of violating the city's Health and Safety code. Attorney James M. V. Fitzpatrick said his client maintains his innocence and will enter a not guilty plea again when he is arraigned September 2 for the amended complaint that specifies HIV. Fitzpatrick said the allegations were made by a jilted boyfriend after a bad break-up and are baseless. The misdemeanor carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail, but Guerra could face additional counts as the investigation continues. Some of his alleged victims suggested that Guerra might have infected hundreds of men over the years. Scroll down for videos .

A San Diego City's Attorney office report stated that Guerra would reassure his sexual partners that he was HIV negative. Following a sexual encounter, Guerra allegedly would brag to his friends how he had duped someone into sleeping with him without protection. Investigators have obtained hundreds of emails and text messages in which Guerra reportedly boasted about his conquests and poked fun at his unaware lovers. ‘Yay lol… Someone getting poz that day lol….Already poz. ...Poor Sucka,’ one text message obtained by NBC San Diego read.

"By . Zoe Szathmary . A 5-year-old boy died after a neighbor's pit bull attacked him on Sunday afternoon. John Harvard was playing outside his family's Riverside, Alabama home when the dog attacked him, Mayor Rusty Jessup told MailOnline. The attack took place between 3 and 3:30pm. Older brother Bradley, 9, was on his way home from a nearby friend's house to get John ready for supper at their grandmother's home - only to see the pit bull's attack. Scroll down for video . Deadly attack: A pit bull, like the one seen here, tragically attacked 5-year-old John Harvard on Sunday afternoon . Grieving: Riverside Mayor Rusty Jessup, pictured, said the pit bull that attacked John Harvard used to play with him and his older brother Bradley . Bradley kicked and grabbed at the dog to try and protect his little brother before he ran to their father for help, Jessup said. The boys' father then shot at the dog, reportedly grazing its ears. The pit bull belongs to the family's next-door neighbor and is 8 months old. The dog is believed to weigh between 80 and 100 pounds, Alabama.com reports. A neighbor called 911 but realized John needed assistance immediately. He was taken to St. Vincent's St. Clair Hospital by his father and brother, where he was pronounced dead. Probe: Investigators are seen here looking at the yard where the attack took place. The pit bull, which was not on a leash at the time, is currently being held at an animal shelter . Sadly, Jessup says the neighbor's dog used to play with the boys. 'It goes without saying what a tragedy it is [...] I was close with the boy and his family,' he said. '[The neighbor] is more saddened than anybody is. They feel responsible.' The dog was not leashed at the time of the attack and there is no leash law in Riverside, though Jessup said now may be the time to reconsider. He said two city councilmen have already approached him about the matter. 'We have nuisance laws, we've talked [...] this has come up twice since I've been here,' Jessup said. He said residents have previously opposed the measure when it was brought up at city council meetings. An autopsy is scheduled to be performed on the boy's body on Tuesday, ABC3340 reports. No charges have been filed. The pit bull has been taken to a local animal clinic, the station adds. The District Attorney and the St. Clair Sheriff's Office are expected to determine next steps.

"By . Snejana Farberov . and Lydia Warren . When it comes to artistic inspiration, it appears that former US President-turned-painter George W. Bush has looked no further than the top Google image searches. The art and culture blog Animal New York claimed Tuesday that the two dozen oil paintings of world leaders featured in Mr Bush's much-hyped solo exhibition that opened in Dallas last week are nothing more than reproductions of some of the first results that pop up on Google. For his renditions of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia’s stone-faced President Valdimir Putin, Bush was inspired by photos that appear in his subjects' Wikipedia entries. Scroll down for videos . Carbon copy: George W. Bush apparently sourced all his oil paintings of world leaders from Google image searches, including this painting of Vladimir Putin, which is based on an image that appears in his Wikipedia entry (right) 'Tense relationship': He showed his image of Putin as he said that they had been friendly throughout his time in the White House, but that Putin had always felt as if the U.S. were the enemy . ‘Bush based his paintings on the . literally first-to-surface, easiest-to-find photos of his subjects,’ Critic and artist Greg Allen stated. Copyright conundrum: A canvas depicting former French President Jacques Chirac was lifted from a photograph copyrighted by the Associated Press . Afghan President Hamid Karzai's painting was inspired by a photo that appears in the top 10 Google images, while former Israeli President Ehud Olmert's portrait was based on a 2009 image that in the second most popular search result. Animal . also reported that a canvas depicting former French President Jacques . Chirac was lifted from a photograph copyrighted by the Associated Press. But . according to Allen, the former leader of the free world is not likely . to face a lawsuit because he has clearly transformed the imags, for . better or worse. ‘Copyright infringement is the one thing he’s NOT guilty of,’ Allen said. The new collection by the former president, who picked up the paintbrush after leaving the White House, includes Tony Blair, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai, Germany's Chancellor  Merkel and the Dalai Lama. Most . striking is a stern-looking Russian President Putin, but Bush said his . favorite was the painting of his father, George H. W. Bush. Bush said he was inspired to pick up the paintbrush by Winston Churchill, who discovered his love for painting when he was 40. Likeness: Another of Bush's paintings, left, shows Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai, right, shown in an image taken from Google search results . Memories: He shared his image of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert alongside photos of them together . Exact replica: Above, his image of Israel's former prime minister Ehud Olmert looks exactly the same as a photo of the former leader in 2009 . 'I wanted to make sure that the last chapters of my life were full,' he told his daughter in a Today Show interview last week. 'Painting would occupy not only space but open my mind.' But he added: 'I was a little reluctant to put them out because I'm not a great artist and I don't want people to think I'm a great artist. But... I'm a driven person and I want to get better. A whole new world has opened up.' His wife, Laura, who joined him for part of the interview, said she had encouraged him to paint after he mastered a writing and drawing iPhone application, Penultimate. On show: A photographer portraits of world leaders painted by Bush, including Canada's Stephen Harper, Abu Dhabi's Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, South Korea's Lee Myung-bak and France's Nicolas Sarkozy . Former leader: Italian Silvio Berlusconi is also part of the exhibit 'The Art of Leadership', which opens Friday . Artwork: Among the 24 leaders, he also painted the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel . Comparison: The image of Merkel is part of an exhibition, 'The Art of Leadership', at Bush's Dallas library . Blair . Similar? Bush said that the images, including this one of Tony Blair, were painted 'in the spirit of friendship' 'He started drawing very interesting stick figures to communicate with us,' she said. So Bush got a few pointers from a teacher, telling her: 'There's a Rembrandt trapped in this body. It's your job to unleash him', he told the Today show. He started drawing images of the family's pets, including their late dog Barney. And last year, a hacker leaked some of his . images, including him in the . bath and him looking in a mirror. 'I was annoyed,' Bush said. 'It's an invasion of one's privacy... nor do I want my paintings to get out. 'The truth . of the matter is my paintings are not ready to be released. I mean, I'm . still learning, and I don't know if they ever will be or not.' Friendships: He said none of the leaders, including the Dalai Lama, above, had seen the images . On show: Margaret Spellings (R), president of the George W. Bush Presidential Center speaks alongside Amy Polley, library and museum curator as the exhibition opens on Friday . Featured: A detail, left, shows the portrait of Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, right . Speaking to his daughter, who is a special . correspondent on the Today show, he added that the most important thing he . has learned so far is, 'don't paint your wife,' he said. Of his portrait of her, wife Laura laughed: 'Yeah, it still needs some work.' And his mother, Barbara Bush, also had some critique for her son's art. 'That's my husband?' she joked when she saw the image of George H.W. Bush for the first time on the Today show, before adding: 'I really like it.' When asked if she thought her son captured the essence of her husband, she paused before saying: 'I think maybe he did. I like it very much... He's good.' Bush, who began painting when he left the White House, also painted Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf . Getting better: He has captured Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, pictured right this week . Remembered: He painted Václav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic, who passed away in 2011 . He also painted the late Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel, pictured right in the Oval Office in 2002 . Proud of his work: He shows his daughter his painting of former Japanese president Junichiro Koizumi . Long-time friends: He also painted Japan's former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi . Exhibition: A painting shows the former President of the People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin . On the wall: There is also a portrait of former Mexican President Felipe Calderon, above . But she quipped that she will not allow her son to paint her because 'it might look like me'. As . his paintings of the world leaders were revealed, Bush said he . hopes the leaders will like them. None of them have yet seen . the images, he said. 'I hope . they take it in the spirit in which these were painted in,' he said. 'That was the . spirit of friendship and that I admire them as leaders and was willing . to give it a shot in terms of getting people to see how I felt about . them.' Speaking about the artwork brought back images of his time with the world leaders, especially Putin. He said they had a good relationship, but that he always thought Putin saw the U.S. as an enemy. Budding artist: Bush said he was inspired by Winston Churchill to pick up the paintbrush later in life . He added that the Russian leader once . took it too far when he criticized his beloved Scottish terrier, Barney, . saying, 'You call that a dog?' He . explained that he later visited Putin and met his dog, whom the Russian . leader noted was ‘bigger, stronger and faster than Barney'. 'I didn't react,' he said. 'I just . said, ""Wow. Anybody who thinks ‘my dog is bigger than your dog’ is an . interesting character."" And that painting kind of reflects that.' The . two-term president has led a significantly quieter life since leaving . office - spending much of his time painting and going on mountain bike . rides with groups of veterans like Wounded Warrior. In . an interview with the Dallas Morning News last year, Bush added that . painting gives him an opportunity to 'create.' He also reflected on what . others think of his work. 'Joyous experience': Bush said the painting of his father, George H. W. Bush was his favorite . 'People are surprised,' Bush said. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.' In . March last year, an artist who taught Bush how to paint both animals . and landscapes in a recent month-long course spoke out his skills as a . late-in-life painter. He had spent four weeks in private . lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida . where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic . horizons. 'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood. 'The . Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy' will be held at . the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of . Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Work: Some of his paintings, including images of dogs and self-portraits, have previously been seen . Honing his skills: After painting the family pets, he said he then began painting landscapes . Revealed: Some of the images, including ones of him in the shower and a bathtub, were leaked last year . Invasive: Bush said that he felt that much of his artwork wasn't ready for public viewing . The . museum explained the exhibition 'will explore the relationships that . President George W. Bush forged with world leaders to shape . international policy and advance American interests abroad.' 'The . exhibit will feature more than two dozen never-before-exhibited . portraits painted by President Bush,' it said.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Tanzania in the early 1970s, fracturing the community . Chimpanzees are often photographed huddled in groups grooming each other and relaxing in trees, but they are also capable of usurping dominant males in vicious power struggles and waging wars that last for years. A brutal four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania in the early 1970s, fracturing the community and leaving some members dead. Now scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict, which was recorded by primatologist Jane Goodall to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down. Dame Goodall witnessed the violent and sustained fighting of the apes first hand and called it a war. She had set up a feeding station at Gombe to try and unravel why the conflict escalated from what was a harmonious group. Jospeh Feldblum of Duke University, North Carolina, has examined her field notes to build an in-depth model of the chimpanzee’s social network. Dame Jane made incredibly detailed notes detailing which apes arrived at the feeding station at the same time and from which direction they travelled, New Scientist reported. Previously, scientists had estimated the strength of relationships between the amount of time two chimps spent together, but now Dr Feldblum’s team has entered Dame Jane’s data collected between 1968 and 1972 into a model to track how the group’s relationship changed. Scientists have taken a fresh look at the chimp conflict, which was recorded by primatologist Jane Goodall to reveal similarities in how chimpanzee and human societies break down . It suggests that the group was one happy family until 1971, until they divided into two groups. While they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict, an alpha male known as Leakey died at the close of 1970. Dr Feldblum told a meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Calgary, Canada: ‘As soon as Leakey died they started splitting. He seems to have been a bridge between the northern and southern chimps. A younger chimp called Humphrey stepped into the power vacuum but he was challenged by two apes from the southern group called Hugh and Charlie. The study suggests that the group (stock image used) was one happy family until 1971, until they divided into two groups. While they are not completely sure what sparked the conflict, an alpha male known as Leakey died at the close of 1970 . The apes followed wither Humphrey or the southern brothers and a four year battle began, resulting in the deaths of seven males from the brother’s ‘rebel’ group. While chimpanzees are known for their caring group dynamics, groups of Humphrey’s ‘army’ would sneak behind rebel lines, pick a target and beat him up. Dr Feldblum discovered that it was possible to predict whether the chimp would support Humphrey or become a rebel and that the situation witnessed in the jungle resembles a power struggle in human society. He thinks that groups of chimpanzees might explain how human-like societies evolve. They have long been held as an almost human-like relative. But researchers have discovered chimpanzees have almost the same personality traits as humans. Georgia State University research shows some of those traits have a neurobiological basis, and that those traits vary according to the biological sex of the individual chimpanzee. They found the most fundamental personality trait for chimpanzees is dominance – that is, whether an animal is a generally dominant and undercontrolled 'Alpha,' or a more playful and sociable 'Beta.' But those two categories can be broken down statistically into smaller personality traits in ways that echo the personality structures researchers have found in child and adult human subjects. Alpha personalities, for example, statistically break down into tendencies toward dominance and disinhibition. Beta personalities, on the other hand, show low dominance and positive emotionality.Further analysis shows these lower order traits also can be statistically broken down into their constituent parts.The research team identified five personality factors that combine differently in each individual chimpanzee: conscientiousness, dominance, extraversion, agreeableness and intellect.","Brutal four year war ripped through a group of chimpanzees in Gombe, Tanzania in the early 1970s .

"By . Katie Nicholl . The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are searching for a  new nanny to take on their tour of New Zealand and Australia. Their current nanny, Jessie Webb – who looked after Prince William when he was a child – has reached the end of her contract. According to sources close to the couple, Mrs Webb, 71, came out of retirement to look after Prince George on the condition that she would work only for three months. Extra help: The Duke and Duchess, pictured with Prince George at his baptism, want some additional assistance on their month-long trip . In fact, Mrs Webb is still at Kensington Palace and William and Kate are keen to retain her services, but they are discreetly looking for extra help for the month-long trip this spring. It took a lot of persuading to get Jessie to take the job in the first place, but she loves William and wanted to help out,’ said a source. ‘I can’t imagine that she will want to be travelling around the world at  her age. If she does, she will need an assistant.’ The Duke and Duchess did not hire a maternity nurse after George’s birth last July. Instead  the couple moved into the Middleton family home in Berkshire so that Kate’s mother, Carole, could help out. When they moved to Kensington Palace last September, they persuaded Mrs Webb to join their household. Contract has expired: Michael Middleton (left) and nanny Jessie Webb (right) leave Chapel Royal in St James's Palace after the Christening of Prince George . It had been rumoured that Carole Middleton could join the tour Down Under to help look after George. However, aides insist that will not be the case. The Duke and Duchess will have a punishing schedule, criss-crossing the two countries in less than a month. ‘They need round-the-clock help for George if he joins them,’ said a source. ‘Kate might also want to think about taking a dresser or a lady’s maid. It sounds grand, but it’s actually very practical. Experienced: Mrs Webb also looked after Prince William when he was younger . Helping the family: Mrs Webb with Princess Diana, Prince Harry and Prince William in the Scilly Isles in 1991 . The Queen wouldn’t dream of travelling overseas without a lady-in-waiting.’ In addition to Mrs Webb, William and Kate also have a housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone. Kate’s only luxury is her personal hairdresser, Amanda Cook Tucker, who visits the Palace. She is also expected to join the Royal tour. Carole Middleton has taken a hands-on role in caring for her grandson. According to one family friend, she visits Kensington Palace several times a week. The friend said:  ‘Carole is very involved. She often arrives without warning.’ A spokesman for the Royal couple last night declined to comment.","Mrs Webb, 71, came out of retirement to look after Prince George .

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . Kick back, relax and put those feet up because September is the least stressful month of the year. That is the word from researchers who warn Brits to make the most of it from Monday, before the high-pressure winter months draw in. Researchers said worries about paying for Christmas and the fun of the festive season coming to an end made January the most stressful month. Kick back and relax: September is the least stressful month of the year, according to new research . However, it also seems that while temperatures drop, stress levels rise, with December and February following closely behind. Less than one per cent in a poll of 2,000 adults chose September, which begins on Monday, when asked which month they believe is the most stressful. Researchers also asked which was was the most stressful season and discovered that spring was voted as causing the lowest stress levels, followed by autumn. However, winter is the most stress-inducing season, according to two-thirds of those polled. David Williams, director of group protection at Friends Life, who did the research, said: 'The seasons can affect staff mood levels quite considerably, and it is important that employers are aware of this. 'While January often brings a post-festive season lull, if staff are relaxed when it comes to September it could be a good time to introduce positive changes to the workplace or launch a new project. 'Christmas clearly affects a lot people's anxiety levels. Finding money for presents and working out which relatives to see can all add up. 'Employers need to be tuned in to the turn of mood and if possible look at reducing the workload to improve well-being. 'It's difficult to know exactly why September is viewed as the least stressful month, but perhaps we are more relaxed after some good summer weather, a holiday and knowing the children are going back to school.' The study also revealed that money was the top cause of stress, with 36 per cent of people saying it was their biggest worry. Meanwhile almost one in five people chose work worries as the main cause. The findings also suggested that young adults are the more likely to buckle under stress with almost one in four 18 to 24-year-olds calling in sick due to stress. The winter months, especially Christmas time, are the most stressful time of the year as families stretch the budget to pay for presents and worry about seeing all of their relatives .","The most relaxing month of the year is about to begin, say researchers .
But make the most of it - stressful Christmas time is not far away .

"By . Alasdair Glennie for the Daily Mail . The two bakers at the centre of the Great British Bake Off row will be reunited in the programme’s final episode in October, the BBC confirmed yesterday. Iain Watters and Diana Beard have insisted there are ‘no hard feelings’ between them following the ‘bingate’ row, in which the latter was accused of sabotaging her rival’s baked Alaska. Mr Watters became the losing baker in the episode after yelling in frustration and presenting his melted ice-cream pudding to the judges from a bin. His exit triggered a storm of criticism among viewers, and the BBC has received 800 complaints about the episode which aired this week. Scroll down for video . Magnanimous: Iain Watters shares a slice of sponge with Newsnight's Kirsty Wark this week . Mrs Beard, 69, will also take no further part in the competition after a head injury left her with no sense of smell. But the pair will be seen together in the show’s traditional finale reunion. Yesterday one of last year’s Bake Off finalists Ruby Tandoh waded in to the row, blaming the show’s editors for making Mr Watters’s meltdown look worse than it really was in a bid to boost ratings. The hit BBC1 programme has been embroiled in a furore after it appeared to show Mrs Beard taking her rival’s baked Alaska out of the freezer and leaving it to melt. Show host Sue Perkins insisted there had been ‘no sabotage’. Mrs Beard blamed the BBC for editing the programme to make her look like the culprit, and said the cake had been out of the freezer for no more than 40 seconds. Diana Beard: Blamed the BBC . Miss Tandoh, who was at the heart of her own Bake Off storm last year when viewers accused her of trying to flirt her way to victory, agreed. She said: ‘If there was nastiness in the tent this week, it came in the form of making a humiliated Iain parade the dustbin to the judge’s table. ‘Nastiness was spinning a story that cast an old lady as a pantomime villain.’ Miss Tandoh also criticised viewers for their Twitter ‘hate campaign’ against Mrs Beard, saying: ‘Shame on the online lynch mobs.’ It is the first year Bake Off has been shown on BBC1, and it has seen ratings soar as a result. But an insider said yesterday: ‘The danger is the makers try to turn it into a prime-time reality show like X Factor by exaggerating the drama. ‘It started out as a gentle baking show, but it is building into a juggernaut. The format seems to be getting bigger than the individual contestants.’ Mr Watters, who appeared on Newsnight on Thursday, was magnanimous in defeat and refused to blame Mrs Beard for his exit.","Diana Beard, 69, was accused of sabotaging Iain Watters' baked Alaska .

A case of the deadly virus has been reported in Senegal, making it the first time a new country has been hit by the outbreak since July. It comes a day after the World Health Organisation warned the number of infections was increasing rapidly. Scroll down for videos . The Central Hospital of University of Fann in Dakar, Senegal, where the first case of Ebola in the country was received . Senegalese health minister Awa Marie Coll-Seck confirmed the frist case of Ebola in Senegal, the fifth West African country to be hit by the deadly virus . The Ebola virus has claimed the lives of more than 1,550 people in West Africa since the outbreak started . Senegal's health ministry said the country's first Ebola patient was a young Guinean man who was immediately quarantined at a Dakar hospital, where he was in a 'satisfactory condition'. The man is believed to have been infected in Guinea's capital Conakry, and may have travelled to Senegal before Dakar closed its land border with Guinea on August 21. Authorities are now trying to piece together where he went and who he encountered, in a bid to halt the spread of the deadly virus. Meanwhile, Liberia says it will open up a slum in its capital where thousands of people were barricaded to contain the spread.

Scientists say the first human trials of a potential vaccine would start next week using a product made by pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline and the US government. On Friday, scientists writing in the journal Nature said 18 lab monkeys given high doses of the Ebola virus fully recovered after being given the prototype drug ZMapp, which reversed bleeding in the animals. ZMapp has been given to a handful of frontline health workers who have contracted Ebola, two of whom have recovered, and two of whom have died. Three others are still receiving the treatment. New figures released by WHO this week revealed the massive scale of the crisis, which it said indicated a 'rapid increase still in the intensity of transmission' that could cost at least $490 million  to tackle. The LIberian government says lifting the quarantine will not mean there is no Ebola in the West Point slum . A school classroom lies abandoned in Kenema, Sierra Leone. Many have been shut while whole villages have been quarantined in the country . In a sign that affected countries are struggling to stop its spread, the UN agency said the number of cases could exceed 20,000 before the epidemic is brought under control. As of August 26, 1,552 people had been confirmed dead from Ebola in four countries - Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria. Liberia was the worst affected with 694 deaths; 422 people have died in Sierra Leone; and 430 in Guinea, where the virus emerged at the start of the year. Nigeria has now recorded six deaths. The Democratic Republic of Congo has also confirmed two cases of Ebola, but officials there insist it is unconnected to the current outbreak in West Africa. In Sierra Leone President Ernest Koroma yesterday sacked health minister Miatta Kargbo. In a bid to stop the spread of the virus, many African governments have sought to ringfence Sierra Leone, Guinea and Liberia. But member states of the West African regional bloc ECOWAS have complained that some of the security measures taken by other countries, including travel bans, had unfairly hit the region. A number of airlines, including Air France and British Airways, have suspended their services to Freetown and Monrovia, the capitals of Sierra Leone and Liberia respectively. A number of airlines, including Air France and British Airways, have suspended their services to Freetown and Monrovia, the capitals of Sierra Leone and Liberia respectively . Bruce Aylward, the WHO's head of emergency programmes, said it was 'absolutely vital' that airlines resume flights because bans were hindering the emergency response. The outbreak has also caused sporting chaos, with Sierra Leone having to field all players for the qualifying games for the African Cup of Nations from outside the country over a growing quarantine. Morocco, which will host the tournament next year, said on Friday it was launching a national commission tasked with drawing up a health plan to deal with the risk from Ebola. A presidential statement read on state television said the decision was made 'in order to create a conducive environment for more efficient and effective handling of the Ebola outbreak.' Nigeria's latest death - in the southeastern oil city of Port Harcourt - was the first outside its biggest city, Lagos, and dashed hopes that the country had successfully contained the virus. The victim, a doctor named Ikyke Samuel Enuemo, is believed to have caught the virus from a patient he treated who travelled to the city after coming into contact with an infected Liberian-American man. Some 160 people are now under surveillance in Port Harcourt following the doctor's death, the local government said on Friday. Meanwhile a curfew was imposed in N'Zerekore, Guinea's second-largest city, a day after 20 people were injured during a protest by market stall holders against a team of health workers sent, without notice, to spray their market with disinfectant.","Ebola spreads to fifth nation in West Africa as first case reported in Senegal .

"By . Associated Press . A man imprisoned in New York for killing his son to collect on his life insurance is now charged with murdering his first wife in 1991 for the same reason. The Post-Standard of Syracuse reports that Karl Karlsen was charged in Calaveras County, California, Friday with first-degree murder in the death of Christina Karlsen. Karl Karlsen pleaded guilty in Seneca County in November to a charge of second-degree murder. He admits he allowed a truck to fall off a jack and onto his 23-year-old son, Levi, who was working underneath it in the town of Romulus in 2008. Murder and insurance fraud: Karl Karlsen was found guilty of murdering his son Levi last year and now faces the same charge in the 1991 death of his first wife Christina . Untimely death: Christina Karlsen was 30 when she died in a house fire. Her husband managed to get out with their three kids but she could not escape the bathroom, where just days earlier he had boarded up a window . Karlsen collected $700,000 in insurance after his son's death. He'd received $200,000 after the 1991 fire that killed Christina Karlsen, Levi's mother. Before this latest charge, his daughter Erin Deroche said she has no doubts that he was also responsible for the death of her mother as well. During the house fire that killed Deroche and Levi Karlsen's mother Christina Karlsen, she was screaming to get the children out of the house. Christina was trapped in the bathroom after spilled kerosene was ignited by a faulty electric light. Although Karl Karlsen is credited with getting Levi and their other two children out safely, Christina was unable to escape through the bathroom window because Karlsen had boarded it up from the outside days before, saying it was broken. ‘At the time, I was six years old. I didn't understand that my mother was behind that wall dying,’ Deroche said. A week after the fire, Karlsen left California for upstate New York with his three children to be near his family. In the days before his wife's death, Karlsen had taken out a $200,000 insurance policy on her life . As she got older, Deroche said she was able to process what happened and came to believe that her father didn't do enough to help save her mother. ‘You know, that's not how people are supposed to act when someone they love is trapped and literally burning in front of them,’ Deroche said. It wasn't until Deroche and her brother Levi were 11 or 12 when she said they secretly discussed the possibility that their father wasn't being truthful regarding their mother's death. ‘Between the two of us...we knew, because he didn't try,’ Deroche said. ‘He didn't make an effort to save her. He just stood there,’ she told ABC News. However, when she and Levi confronted their father, Deroche said, ‘his biggest concern was that he wondered what the community would think of his own children accusing him of murdering their mother.’ After she received the news that father-of-two Levi had died in an apparent accident, Deroche said she tried to put her suspicions of Karlsen's involvement in Levi's death at bay, but was relieved when she learned about the investigation into her father. ‘It was never a question for me,’ Deroche said. ‘It was a matter of fact.’ When Karlsen was jailed, Deroche said she went to visit her father and told him that she knew he was involved in her mother's and Levi's deaths. Young father: Both Levi Karlsen (pictured) and his mother were parents to young children when they died . Guilty: Karlsen pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in the death of his own son Levi Karlsen . ‘He won't ever own up to Levi,’ Deroche said. ‘But he did tell me… ""It's been over 20 years, and they still haven't got me yet. What makes you think they're going to get me now?""' Karlsen will be put on trial in two weeks but a judge ruled that testimony about the California fire and Christina Karlsen's death is off limits. While she said she isn't angry with her father, Deroche said she regrets not going to police sooner with her suspicions of her mother's death. ‘What if I had said something earlier?’ Deroche said. ‘Maybe he'd still be here for his girls.’ His attorney wasn't available to comment. Karlsen was arrested and charged with second-degree murder and insurance fraud in 2012 after his second wife Cindy - fearing for her life - agreed to wear a wire while talking to him about his son's death. Levi Karlsen's death was initially ruled an accident, but Karlsen collected a $700,000 life insurance payout after the incident, raising suspicions. A family member tipped off the police about the large insurance policy and opened an investigation into his death last year. Suspicious: Both Christina's daughter Erin (left) and her sister Colette Bousson were convinced Karl Karlsen had something to do with Levi and Christina Karlsen's deaths . Trapped: Erin Deroche believes her mother was trapped in her marriage with Karl Karlsen . Second wife: Cindy Karlsen became fearful for her own life when she discovered that Karlsen had taken out a whopping $1.2 million policy on her life . Authorities in California also opened an investigation into the 1991 California house-fire that killed Karlsen's wife and Deroche's mother Christina Karlsen. Karlsen cashed in on a $200,000 life insurance policy soon after. On the tapes, obtained by ABC's Nightline, the 52-year-old can be heard telling Cindy while they were in a restaurant that he had removed his truck's front tires and raised it on a single jack before Levi volunteered to do the repair. 'I didn't push the truck, I said,' Karlsen said after Cindy asked him for the truth in Levi's death. 'No, I said I had nothing to do - but I said I took advantage of the situation once it happened.' Police arrested Karlsen soon after and interrogated him for ten hours, in which he denied killing his son 75 times. In the police interrogation tapes, also obtained by ABC News, he said: 'I found him dead. I f***ing panicked. I don't know. I don't know. I left him.' Finally he told police he had been there when the truck fell on his son and caused it to fall. 'I opened the truck door because I had to get inside to move the linkage for the truck, and when I did, it tipped, and it just, whoosh, f***ing fell over,' Karlsen said. He maintains it was an accident, but did admit that he left his son to die. 'He did admit that he caused the truck to fall on his son. He did admit that he left his son on the floor dying, but he never admitted that it was a planned, deliberate act,' said Seneca County Lieutenant Investigator John Cleere. 'The officers at the scene didn't see anything out of the ordinary,' he told ABC. 'They saw what appeared to be two grieving parents and what appeared to be an accident.' Knowing about the insurance payout on his son, Cindy Karlsen grew suspicious when she found out her husband took out a $1.2million policy on her. That's what prompted her to work with police, leading to second-degree murder and insurance fraud charges against Karl Karlsen in the death of his 23-year-old son, Levi Karlsen.","Karl Karlsen, 52, has been charged with the 1991 death of his first wife .

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . and Reuters . A Montana college student whose disappearance prompted a search by hundreds of police and volunteers was found dead from injuries sustained in a car accident in the mountains of central Idaho, authorities said late on Thursday. The body of Lucius Robbi, 21, of Orleans, California, was found in his 1997 Subaru near the remote resort town of Stanley, according to Boise County Sheriff Ben Roeber. Robbi vanished after he set off on August 19 for the University of Montana campus in Missoula from Horseshoe Bend, Idaho, where he had worked as a guide for a second summer at a company that offers trips on the Payette River. Scroll down for video . Have you seen him? Lucius Robbi, 21, left Horseshoe Bend in Idaho last Tuesday but never arrived at the University of Montana. A massive search is now underway for the adventurous student . Vehicle: Robbi drove a green 1997 Subaru Legacy, pictured, and had attached two kayaks to the top . A massive search began across the Idaho wilderness for a 21-year-old student after he failed to turn up for his first day of college. After finishing his summer job in Horseshoe Bend, Idaho last Tuesday, Lucius Robbi, packed up his car and set off for the University of Montana to arrive in time for orientation for his junior year. The outdoor enthusiast had tied two orange kayaks to the top of his green 1997 Subaru Legacy and told relatives and friends he would drive for a while before pulling over to explore the area. The skilled kayaker told co-workers he intended to camp out on Tuesday evening and be on hand the following day for orientation at the university. Surveillance footage shows his car carrying kayaks as it passed a gas station in Garden Valley, Idaho about 20 minutes after he left Horseshoe Bend on Tuesday, ABC News reported. The last ping from his cellphone was detected in the nearby town of Lowman on Tuesday afternoon - but no one heard from him after that point. Search efforts aided by an online campaign tied to a Facebook page called 'Finding Lucius' drew hundreds to hunt for Robbi and his Subaru across vast stretches of mountainous terrain in Idaho and Montana. Robbi's family late on Thursday thanked law enforcement and volunteers in a post on the Facebook page, which had gathered thousands of followers from around the United States. Location: A map shows where he was last seen in Idaho compared to his destination in Missoula, Montana . Active: Robbi, pictured, had worked in Idaho as a raft and kayak guide  for the past two summers . Adventurous: Friends and relatives said he planned to camp along the route to university last week . 'You were all amazing, and the overwhelming outpouring of love and the heroic effort you made to find Lucius created a bond between you and all of us that will connect us forever,' the family wrote. The area where Idaho authorities found Robbi's remains borders the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness and is known for whitewater rapids, rock slides, flash floods and deer and elk herds that frequently cross roadways. It has intermittent cellphone service. A call for donations to underwrite search efforts had raised more than $18,000 on a crowd-funding website by Thursday. Spotted: Surveillance footage outside a gas station about 20 minutes into his journey shows his car, with the kayak attached, passing by last Tuesday. His cell phone was also detected shortly afterwards . Concerns: His father Marc told ABC News that he was extremely worried about his 21-year-old son . Robbi, from Orleans, California, had worked as a guide for Cascade Raft and Kayak in Horseshoe Bend for the past two summers and enjoys other extreme sports, including snowboarding. Before his body was found, Robbi's mother Tina Glaessner explained: 'If anyone can survive out there for seven days, he can do it.' Kenneth Long, Robbi's supervisor at Cascade Raft and Kayak, told the Idaho Statesman that he had talked about camping along the way. His coworkers have driven along the route but have seen nothing. 'This is a very troubling and odd situation,' Long said.","Lucius Robbi, 21, has been found dead from injuries he sustained in a car accident .

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . The Only Way is Essex star James Argent has apologised for sparking a  police missing person alert when he reportedly went to the 'wrong airport' and vanished for 24 hours. Fears grew for Arg after he failed to turn up for an early-morning flight to Majorca after leaving his family home at 3.30am yesterday in Woodford Green, east London. Scotland Yard issued a public appeal for his whereabouts this morning, 26 hours after he vanished, as fans began a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #PrayForArg. But just three hours later he phoned his father, who told MailOnline he may have turned up at Stansted Airport in Essex while his worried agent waited at Gatwick. Scroll down for video .

His father Martin Argent, 58, said today: 'He left the house at 3.30am and was due to meet his agent at the airport just after 5am. 'I think the agent was at Gatwick but he told us he was going to Stansted, so we thought he might have gone to the wrong airport. 'His agent kept ringing and saying ""where was he"" and we couldn't make contact with him all day long. 'He's now on his way to his next engagement which is in Blackpool. He was only due to be in Majorca for one afternoon. 'We had to report it because his agent was panicking, we were panicking, because we couldn't account for his whereabouts.

He is now heading to Blackpool . The reality star - nicknamed Arg - was last seen at 3am yesterday as he left for an airport from his home in Woodford Green, east London. Essex Police said they were growing increasingly concerned for the welfare of the 26-year-old, who is often seen in Brentwood and nightclubs in Redbridge but had not made any contact with friends or family since his disappearance. The star is in the process of moving out of his parents' house in Woodford Green to a two-bedroom flat in Chigwell, just three miles away. He was pictured in an emotional hug with his mother Patricia, 53, as he began moving items from where he has lived with her, his 58-year-old father Martin and 24-year-old sister Natasha for more than 20 years. 'I'm moving out into the heart of Chigwell,' he told Reveal magazine. 'It's a two bedroom flat and it's actually in the same block of flats as [co-star Elliott Wright]. I'm really excited; I feel like I've finally made it.'

Last month Arg and co-star Dan Osborne pulled out of appearances at nightspots in Magaluf after the resort was hit by scandal around a now-infamous sex video. A girl performed sex acts on more than 20 men in two minutes as part of a barcrawl run by Carnage Magaluf, whose website had previously claimed Osborne would be appearing for two weeks this month. Arg's last public appearance was believed to have been on Thursday, August 21, when he took part in the Ice Bucket Challenge wearing a full black suit in London's Leicester Square. He pledged his donation to the Greenfingers charity, which creates gardens for children's hospices, and tweeted: 'I nominate the following for the Ice Bucket Challenge @LydiaRoseBright @debbietowie & @JamesBennewith .U have 24hrs! http://www.justgiving.com/nowgreenfingers.' Arg shot to fame when he joined the Towie cast along with his best friend Mark Wright when the series first aired in 2010. He collected the show's Bafta Audience Award in 2011, amassing 1.4million Twitter followers  and appearing on a host of chat shows. In 2012 he ran the London Marathon in just over six hours in aid of Cancer Research. And he is expected to appear in the next season of Towie, due to be aired on new channel ITVBe in October. Good cause: The reality star took part in the Ice Bucket Challenge in London's Leicester Square . Soaking: A crowd gathered as he completed the stunt in aid of the Greenfingers charity . Meme: Within minutes, images had begun linking Arg to  serious world events (albeit in fairly poor taste) The reality star, who is best friends with co-star Mark Wright, appeared in series one with his ex-girlfriend Lydia Bright, with whom his romance recently reignited. The couple split two years ago after 26-year-old Arg was accused of cheating on her, and he spent the last series of the show trying to woo her back. Earlier this month Lydia admitted she still had feelings for her former lover. He also  bought Lydia a micro pig called Mr Darcy for Christmas in 2011 and took her on a date to visit him in July this year. The 26-year-old dated co-star Gemma Collins in June 2012 but they soon split. Argent began acting and singing in 2002 after winning the coveted Kenny Award at Kenneth More Theatre in Ilford, East London. He also works as a Frank Sinatra-inspired singer. In late 2013 he took part in the first series of the Channel 5 reality series Celebrity Super Spa, along with Helen Flanagan, Rustie Lee, John Burton-Race, Jody Latham and Yvette Fielding. Popular: Arg has 1.4million Twitter followers and his last Tweet on Thursday appealed to co-star Lydia Bright . Ex: Arg previously dated Towie co-star Lydia Bright and they were pictured in recent embrace on the show . Drama: Argent has been a favourite on the Essex-based reality show since its inception in 2010 . A Metropolitan Police spokesman said before he was found: 'His family and friends knew him to be at his home address at the time. 'Obviously he has left home but it is not known where to. It is unusual according to his family and his agent.' Police had described him as white and 'of large build', about 6ft tall with dark hair. At the time of his disappearance he was wearing a blue tracksuit, believed to be a Nike, and was carrying a blue sports bag. Unusual: Most police appeals involve children, the elderly or the mentally ill. James Argent is 26 . Yesterday it emerged the Metropolitan Police has classed four rape cases as 'no crime' - so why did it pour such resources by comparison into finding the reality star? Police have to follow a strict set of guidelines laid down by the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) before they issue a public appeal and a photo. Forces receive a huge number of calls - the vast majority of which later turn out to be false alarms. That means some cases have to be 'bumped up' the priority list, especially if they include a fear for someone's welfare, as was the case with the press release regarding James Argent. But officers have been criticised for using the category too readily because fewer checks are needed before making an appeal. The Acpo guidelines say: 'There have been several cases where the Police Service has been criticised for misuse of this category when the correct one should have been missing person. 'It is poor practice to use such a category to avoid the rigours of a full missing person investigation.' Most of the missing person appeals made by the Metropolitan Police recently involved people who were obviously vulnerable in some way. Of the 15 appeals the force has made in the last ten days, just three involved apparently healthy adults. Eight involved children or teenagers and four involved the elderly, or people with autism or dementia. However, police are also duty-bound under the Human Rights Act to 'take reasonable action, within their powers, to safeguard the rights of individuals who may be at risk.' The guidelines add: 'Failure to properly investigate a report of a missing person may leave an individual at risk and the Police Service vulnerable to a legal challenge under either the Human Rights Act or the law relating to negligence. Officers are advised to imagine the worst in every situation. The motto is: 'If in doubt, think murder'.","Arg left east London home at 3am on Friday to catch a flight to Majorca .

"By . Caroline Mcguire for MailOnline . An ex-gang member who was expelled from school for attempting to kill a fellow pupil has spoken out about the dangers of teen violence and warned that parents need to start taking more responsibility for their children's behaviour. Tracey Miller, 36, spent much of her teens  living a life of crime on the streets of south London, where she grew up and still lives. But several years ago, the mother-of-two got her life back on track and started to work as a mentor for other troubled youths. She went on to co-write a play about the issue and has now released a memoir going into detail about her life of crime in an attempt to deters others from following suit, appearing on This Morning today to tell her story and explaining how easy it is to end up in a gang. Tracey Miller talking about her time in a gang on This Morning . Tracey's destructive attitude started early on, when she was expelled from her senior school after attempting to stab another girl in her class. She was 13 years old and living with her manic-depressive mother three siblings in West Norwood, while her father was facing life in prison. She said: 'The first time I picked up a knife there was a character at home and he was a paedophile. 'I was too scared to tell my mum as she's a manic depressive and she might have killed him. 'Seeing as my dad was incarcerated, there would have been no one else to look after me if I had told her and she had tried to kill him. 'One day I overheard that this man had touched another family member, so I took a knife and put it under my pillow at night.' So the knife was already in her possession when an incident happened with a friend at school that caused tempers to flare. She said: 'People don't understand that when you have a parent who's a manic depressive, it can be quite embarrassing. 'I had taken a friend home and my mum went through a manic episode while she was there. 'This girl went back to school and told everyone and I thought, 'I want to kill her.' 'So I took the knife to school with me and tried to stab her, but the people in my class stopped me, they all jumped on me. 'After that I was expelled.' 'The next school I was sent to was a tough school - it has closed down now. 'They'd already heard of me there because of the knife incident, so I thought I'd carry on with with this reputation. I never intentionally set out to be that character but once I had people at school that took my lead I carried on with it - I got an adrenaline rush from it.' 'It goes to show that children are a by-product of their environment and parents need to be aware of that and take it seriously.' Tracey's behaviour went downhill fast at her new school, she became involved in a gang that would regularly rob local businesses like off licences and even ice cream vans. The situation got so unsafe that she ended up sleeping next to a hand gun every night for protection. But as dangerous as their crimes were, Tracey maintains that gang life nowadays is far more out-of-control. A scene during the Brixton riots in 1995 showing looted shops in Brixton Road . She said: 'The guys I got together with, we targeted businesses. 'A situation like a lady going home from work, doing something like putting a knife against her through and mugging her - hell no, we had morals. 'My generation of gangs set the trend for 'licking it.' 'We'd go into a business, try and get the cash and then get out as quick as we could with no violence. 'Now kids have taken it to a whole new level - with initiations.' The final straw came when she was shot with a sawn-off shotgun during the Brixton Riots in 1995. She said: 'It was the Brixton riots, they were looting the area I was standing in and as we were running, a guy turned and opened fire. 'He had a sawn-off shotgun and it was like the sky just lit up. 'I rolled under a car but it was too late - I'd been shot. Tracey revisits the place where she was shot during the Brixton Riots in 1981 . 'When the crowd dispersed I got up and started to walk away and that's when the pain hit me - it felt like my leg had been torn off and I just collapsed. 'I've still till got ball-bearings lodged in my body. 'The effects of that combined with me getting into a relationship with a man led to me eventually taking an overdose and just losing the momentum for being naughty, that was the change.' Tracey also fell pregnant, prompting her to turn her life around completely. She has spent several years now mentoring troubled young people in various areas of London and also visits Young Offenders Unit in her role. This week she has brought out a her memoirs, called Sour, in a an effort to try and use her story to prevent other people following a similar path. She said: 'There's two ways of looking at it - if I hadn't done that then I couldn't mentor the people that I do now, but equally I could have done something better with my life like be a brain surgeon maybe. 'I'd rather I hadn't done what I did, but it is what it is. 'I don't want sympathy, this is just a story that I felt needed to be told. 'This is to convince other youngsters to come out and tell their story, or to convince them to change their paths. 'People need to be told that there are no grey areas in life, it's black or white - you know what's right or wrong. 'As for parents - they are your children. So if your kids are coming back with stuff that you know you haven't given them, inspect their rooms, look through their phones, connect with them.'","Tracey Miller, 36, first owned a knife at the age of 13 .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius today turned in her resignation to President Barack Obama in a stunning shift in the continuing Obamacare saga. Sylvia Mathews Burwell, who heads the White House Office of Management and Budget, will be nominated to take her place, according to multiple White House sources. The White House press office announced Thursday night that he would announce the nomination at 11:00 a.m. Friday, a few hours before he departs for fundraisers, and a speech to Al Sharpton's National Action Network, in New York City. Sebelius was not expected to remain in the Obama administration through the end of the president's second term, and several news outlets reported late Thursday that a White House official said she told Obama in March that she would be ready to leave 'once open enrollment ended.' She said in an interview with The Huffington Post on March 31, however – the last day of that six-month period – that she would stay at the top of the HHS organizational chart until Obamacare's second open enrollment period arrived in November. 'I'm in,' Sebelius said then. But now she's out. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Teammates: Sebelius was by the president's side on October 1 as Obamacare's tumultuous public introduction got underway . What a difference six months make: When Obama took his April 1 victory lap, Sebelius sat in the audience and didn't earn a mention from the podium, even as he singled out members of Congress for praise . The timing of her departure is designed to allow her to leave with a scrap of honor, coming just a week after Obama announced that his administration had exceeded its target of 7 million enrollees after months of fiasco. The White House aims for her resignation to soften the constant barrage of controversies connected with the president's flagship policy. Republicans were quick to pounce Thursday, confounding those hopes. 'Kathleen Sebelius had a supremely difficult job implementing a law as unpopular and unwieldy as Obamacare,' House Oversight Committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa said in a statement. 'Her tenure as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services may be at an end, but Americans will be dealing with the repercussions of the president's health law for a very long time.' On the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol, minority leader Mitch McConnell called it 'fitting that nearly one year after the primary legislative architect of Obamacare predicted it would be a train wreck that the government official most responsible for overseeing it reportedly is resigning.' 'Regardless of the administration’s public explanation for the Secretary’s exit, Obamacare has been a rolling disaster and her resignation is cold comfort to the millions of Americans who were deceived about what it would mean for them and their families.' The train-wreck reference was a nod to former Montana Democratic Sen. Max Baucus, now Obama's ambassador to China, who warned Sebelius on April 17, 2013 that the Affordable Care Act was headed for the rocks. 'I just see a huge train wreck coming down,"" he said then. 'You and I have discussed this many times, and I don't see any results yet.' Other Senate Republicans echoed McConnell's stern tone. 'This is the right decision,' according to Tennessee Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander. 'The challenge for Ms. Burwell, or any other successor, is to help Congress find the right way to repair the damage Obamacare has done to American families.' Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley said in a statement that '[a]nybody put in charge of Obamacare would be set up to fail. Secretary Sebelius was asked to promote something unready, poorly structured, and unpopular.' The Affordable Care Act has indeed been fraught . with disaster since its official rollout in October. Its website . crashed, cost estimates quickly rose, and public dissatisfaction has . dogged the initiative for more than two years. The October 1 online launch was nothing short of disastrous, with even liberal commentators and Democrats in Congress conceding that the government's effort was not ready for prime time. Contractors' efforts were incompatible, data servers were inadequate, and payment systems linked to the website were yet to be built on launch day. Sebelius presided over all of it, producing misgivings across the U.S. capital that she was up to the task. She has, however, been the administration's designated spear-catcher, attracting slings and arrows from both houses of Congress and the public at every turn. Kiss off: Sebelius had served in Obama's Cabinet for five years and was favored by the president. But after months of defending her she's on her way out . The . president raised eyebrows nationwide on April 1 when he failed to . acknowledge her contribution to the program's recent . momentum during a high-profile Rose Garden victory speech. Sebelius, who has served in Obama's cabinet for five years, was not there alongside him but sat, unnoticed, in the front row. As the White House shifted from shame to fist-pumping, Sebelius continued to attract scorn. Kathleen Sebelius joined the Obama administration in April 2009 as a figure unknown to Americans in 49 states. She had been  governor of Kansas from 2003 to 2009, and that state;s insurance commissioner for eight years before that. Her only national platform prior to Obama's election came in 2008 when, as a former chair of the Democratic Governors Association, she was tapped to deliver her party's response to President George W. Bush's final State of the Union address. She wasn't expected to play a role in the new administration until former Sen. Tom Daschle, a South Dakota politician who had once been Senate Majority Leader, withdrew his candidacy for the top HHS job following a tax scandal. He had failed to pay taxes on more than $83,000 in earnings in 2007, and claimed tax deductions for nearly $15,000 of donations to charities that didn't meet the IRS's tax-deductibility standards. Sebelius hasn't said where she will go after she leaves the president's cabinet. Her three immediate predecessors have found life after government as a law partner (Tommy Thompson), a university professor (Donna Shalala) and a think-tank chief (Mike Leavitt). None of them, however, presided over a program that, like Obamacare, was controversial, partisan and fraught with failure from the beginning. She said during a Senate Finance Committee hearing on Thursday that more . than 7.5 million Americans had chosen health insurance plans through the . Obamacare system. She could not, however, answer a question from Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch about how many subscribers were . uninsured before the law took effect. Additionally, . she hasn't provided Congress with answers about how many Obamacare enrollees have paid premiums, a . necessary step to become formally enrolled in insurance plans. A recent McKinsey and Company study estimated that no more than 1 million Americans both lacked insurance before the rollout and have paid money into the system. The . White House has not announced the date of Sibelius' departure, but a . senior aid to a Republican senator told MailOnline that a quicker . resolution to the HHS vacancy would benefit both sides of the aisle more . than a long, drawn-out process. Her resignation will also leave Senate Republicans with an unusually irresistible opening to drag more details of the Affordable Care Act's implementation into public view. Although Democrats will likely have more than enough votes to confirm Obama's nominee, more than a half-dozen liberals facing difficulties re-election fights will likely be forced to moderate their enthusiasm for Sibelius's replacement. Public hearings could become a spectacle of Republicans demanding internal documents and the White House claiming executive privilege. At the least, the confirmation process will bring to the surface once again conservatives' objections to Obama's new insurance model. 'The president doesn't need more Obamacare controversy so close to November,' a senior aide to a Senate Republican told MailOnline shortly after the announcement of Sebelius' departure. 'And if Republicans object too much to Burwell, the Democrats will trot out the ""war on women"" narrative even more. We don't need that in an election year.' White House sources were at pains to point out on Thursday that Sebelius wasn't forced to leave, but she told HuffPo on March 31 that she planned to stay through November . The administration was insistent that that Sebelius was not forced out. White . House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough told The New York Times that Sebelius had approached Obama months ago with the idea that . a less maligned figure could better serve in her position as the public face of Obamacare. 'She's made it clear in other comments publicly that she recognizes that she takes a lot of the incoming [criticism],' he told the Times. Sebelius said she hoped her resignation would be the start of an era of . cooperation in Washington to help make healthcare better. But, she said, she did not expect it to be the case. 'If . I could take something along with me,' she told the Times on Thursday. '[It would be] all . the animosity. If that could just leave with me, and we could get to a . new chapter, that would be terrific.' Sebelius accepted a Herculean task when Obama tapped her to quarterback the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Tom Daschle, a former Democratic Senate Majority Leader, withdrew his nomination in 2009 after scandal erupted over his past income taxes. She was seen as a consensus second-choice within the Democratic Party, a relative unknown despite her terms as governor of Kansas and a stint as the state's insurance commissioner. But her legacy, like the president's, is intertwined with Obamacare – a policy initiative that is increasingly unpopular. An April 3-6 poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center and USA Today found that more than half of Americans disapprove of the new system. And more than 80 per cent say their views on Obamacare will strongly influence their Election Day decisions seven months from now. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democratic former House speaker, insisted that Sebelius has discharged her duties with honor. 'From day one, Secretary Kathleen Sebelius has remained laser-focused on a single purpose: to make health care a right, not a privilege, for all Americans,' Pelosi said. 'Her leadership has been forceful, effective, and essential.'","Obamacare quarterback leaves after informing Obama in March that she was ready to resign .

"By . Madlen Davies For Mailonline . A mother who dismissed a cat scratch as nothing to worry about ended up battling a life-threatening blood infection. Lesley Pleasant, 57, was forced to stay in hospital for a week hooked up to an IV drip - and almost missed her daughter’s wedding. The incident occurred last month when the PE teacher and sports coach decided to de-flea her daughter’s cat Oscar, and put him in the bath to wash away the treatment. Lesley Pleasant claims she had bathed Oscar many times before, but this time he had become scared and scratched her elbow, digging his claws into an artery . The scratch from ten-month-old Persian cat Oscar caused a blood infection which meant Ms Pleasant's arm throbbed and ballooned to twice its normal size (pictured right) Alarmed, he dug his claws into the crook of her elbow, piercing an artery, and it was 30 seconds before Ms Pleasant’s daughter, Alisha, could get the claw out. ‘It did hurt,’ said Ms Pleasant, ‘but I carried on and didn't think too much of it. 'Then that night I woke up around 2am with a temperature and my arm throbbing - it was really painful and had ballooned in size. ‘I was very worried - I could barely move my arm so took some painkillers.’ At 8am, she asked a friend to drive her to the local hospital at Shepton Mallot, where she was told she needed to go to the larger hospital at Bath. It is important to pay attention to scratches, no matter how small, advises Dr Suranjith Seneviratne, an immunologist at the Royal Free Hospital, London. An infected scratch will usually start to look red and infected, and the lymph node will start to swell near the wound after ten days. This will be followed by fever, fatigue, headaches and, in some cases, a loss of appetite, enlarged spleen and sore throat. Worryingly, Dr Seneviratne adds: ‘A scratch can look like it’s healing, but the bacteria could have travelled to another site. Symptoms can often be seen away from the scratch, because of the incubation period — usually a few days — as the bacteria multiply and divide.’ The bacteria can settle on the heart, liver, brain, kidney and lungs, with those with a low immune system — such as the elderly, babies or someone with an existing illness such as cancer or diabetes — being most at risk. Upon arrival, she was rushed straight through to A&E for emergency treatment - and immediately put on to a drip. Doctors put her on morphine for the pain but she also developed an allergic reaction to the penicillin she was given to fight the infection. ‘I came out in a rash and felt lousy. It was awful - I'm an active person - I teach PE and am a gymnastics coach so lying in bed like that was terrible.’ To make matters worse, the divorced mother-of-four said had also been preparing for her 28-year-old daughter Jessica's wedding. ‘The wedding was the start of August and I was very worried I was going to miss it, which would have been dreadful.' She was eventually discharged after six days - giving her enough time to recover in time for the big day. Looking back, she described her relief at deciding to go to hospital rather ignoring her swollen arm. ‘The scratch was just one of those freak things. 'Oscar had been bathed before, but that time he was just so scared. 'Thank goodness I had the sense to get to the hospital.’ Alarmed by being bathed, Oscar dug his claws into the crook of Ms Pleasant's elbow, piercing an artery, and it was 30 seconds before her daughter Alisha (right)  could get the claw out .","Lesley Pleasant was bathing Oscar when he sunk his claws into her skin .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . More rules are being put into place to try and limit mischief during the Black Friday shopping hordes. The Mall of America is implementing their parental guidance rule all day on the big shopping day, banning anyone under the age of 16-years-old has to be accompanied by someone who is over 21. The Bloomington, Minnesota mall is one of the most crowded places to be on the busiest shopping day of the year, and though they normally just use the rule on Friday and Saturday evenings, they are extending those hours this year to stem off trouble. To be filled: The Mall of America gets more than 40million visitors each year and they expect more than 200,000 people on Black Friday so they're trying to cut down on unattended minors . On December 27 last year, the chaos of the crowds was coupled with a fight the involved a chair-throwing melee, so this year mall administrators are looking to lessen any damage. 'We had never opened at midnight on Black Friday prior to last year,' the mall's vice president Dan Jasper told NBC's Today. 'We had 217,000 people that day, including some unaccompanied kids who are 14, 15. Just for the safety of everyone, we expanded the policy.' Crazed bargain hunters started lining up Black Friday deals at commercial stores throughout the country as early as Monday evening. Adding to the mayhem: American Idol winner Phillip Phillips will be performing at the Mall on Friday . Best Buy shoppers in California have started pitching tents outside several store locations, more than 100 hours before the company’s big holiday sale begins. Shoppers in Arizona are also getting an early start in line, equipped with soda, water, snacks, laptops and air mattresses. According to CBS San Francisco, more and more retailers across the country will require big buyers to hand over their driver's licenses so that the store can keep a record to place alongside your purchase history. In doing so, they will be able to keep tabs on who makes multiple returns after the busy shopping day. If an individual abuses the system, they may have their right to return unwanted goods taken away for future purchases. The flood of bargain hunters could mean an even bigger headache for holiday workers this year. Retail employees recently began . protesting the earlier shifts they were given this Black Friday as . several chain stores have decided to open earlier than previous years. Target, Walmart, Sears and Toys ‘R’ Us . are all opening their doors between 8 and 9pm this Thanksgiving, two to . four hours earlier than last year. They're here: Shoppers flood a Best Buy store in Mesquite, Texas that opened at midnight on November 25 2011 . Crazed consumers: Shoppers vie for copies of video games at a Black Friday sale at a Walmart store in Mentor, Ohio in 2011 . That news led to the organization of a national Black Friday walkout among Walmart workers and more than 40 petitions on Change.org protesting this year's Thanksgiving shifts at several big chain retailers. Adding to the mayhem of hundreds of thousands of people expected at the Mall of America, they are following in the footsteps of other retailers who are doing what they can to draw the ready-to-spend crowds on Friday. The Star Tribune reports that American . Idol winner Phillip Phillips will be performing inside the Mall, which . is the second-largest in the country in terms of space throughout the . entire United States. Part of the problem was that the Mall, . which typically welcomes more than 40 million people per year, became a . hotspot for teenagers to see and be seen, as opposed to simply going . through their Christmas shopping list. Early shoppers: Shoppers camp outside of a Best Buy store in Miami, Florida . 'Last year we experienced a large influx of youth, more than we had anticipated,' spokesman Bridget Jewell told the Pioneer Press. 'We don't want it to turn into a place for people to come and hang out.' Administrators are hoping that the adult guidance policy is good on all fronts. 'Retailers love the policy. When we first implemented it, there were concerns that sales would drop. But sales increased following the implementation and remain strong. It encourages more families to come out with their kids and sales went up,' Jasper said. 'Every single tenant was thrilled because they know it’s a policy that keeps everyone safe and leads to increased sales.'","Busiest mall in the country cracking down on unattended teens .

The experiment could reveal how gravity affects how alcohol matures and tastes in space.

Drink up! The Ardbeg Distillery on the Scottish island of Islay, sent compounds of unmatured malt to the International Space Station (ISS) in an unmanned cargo spacecraft in October 2011, along with particles of charred oak. The sample is held aloft before launch by Dr Bill Lumsden (left) and a bottle is pictured, right . Scientists hope to understand how they interact at close-to-zero gravity. The vial of specially-designed whisky has been orbiting the Earth's atmosphere at 17,227mph, 15 times a day for 1,045 days. During which time, an identical bottle has sat untouched at the distillery to act as a control sample. The single malt is expected to land back on solid ground in Kazakhstan aboard a rocket on September 12. The two samples will then be reunited at a laboratory in Houston, Texas, where scientists will compare them to examine the interaction of the molecules with charred oak, to see what differences occur between Earth whisky and space whisky. Space booze: The vial of specially-designed whisky has been orbiting the Earth's atmosphere at 17,227mph, 15 times a day for 1,045 days aboard the ISS (pictured) ‘Ardbeg is known for taking risks in its development of some of the most coveted whiskies in the world, so it is fitting that it is the first distillery ever in space, said Dr Bill Lumsden, Ardbeg's director of distilling and whisky creation. ‘We are now close to the end, close to finding answers to something previously unknown which is truly exciting. ‘This is one small step for man but one giant leap for whisky, and the team hope to uncover how flavours develop in different gravitational conditions - findings which could revolutionise the whisky-making process. ‘We hope to shine new light on the effect of gravity on the maturation process but who knows where it will lead us? It could be to infinity and beyond.’ Astronauts and cosmonauts have consumed alcohol in space from Buzz Aldrin’s famous ‘communion on the moon’ to blurry footage of Russian cosmonauts knocking back some cognac on Mir. Before Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin boarded the lunar module on July 20 1969, Aldrin unstowed a small piece of bread and a tiny container of wine from Webster Presbyterian church near Houston and took communion, which was hushed up at the time. He reportedly remarked that the liquid swirled and ran up the side of the small chalice. Mir cosmonaut Alexander Lazuthin told NBC that cognac was provided among the medical kit and was prescribed to cosmonauts ‘to stimulate our immune system and on the whole keep our organisms in tone.’ In the early 1970s, Nasa, together with experts from the University of California, Davis, sought to develop wine that could be consumed on the US’s first space station, SkyLab. Having tested numerous ideas, they settled upon sherry as the perfect spacey alcoholic beverage because if its stability and strong taste. Barley has been grown on the ISS and used to produce limited edition ‘space beer’ which was sold in Japan for around $19 a bottle and a lavish PR stunt saw one vodka manufacturer board a vomit comet to mix a cocktail by spinning his whole body around to shake the drink up.

Police and . embassy officials are concerned for the well-being of Annie and Alina, . along with their three-year-old half-brother, Marvin, who is also . missing.. Interpol is said to be aware of the situation and appeals have been made across Thailand for the children's safe return. The girls' father, 48-year-old Robert Day, is still believed to be in Thailand helping the search for his missing daughters. The girls' school confirmed they had not been in lessons since before the start of the May half term. They are pupils at Sundridge and Brasted Church of England Primary School, in Sundridge, Kent. An arrest warrant has been issued for the girls' mother Onwarat Gamlem on suspicion of abducting her daughters . Friends took to Facebook to express their shock about the kidnapping with some speculating that the breakup of Robert's marriage to Gamlem four years ago may have broken down after she tried to sell  their daughters to him. Friend Sharon Saunders, from Sheffield, wrote: 'Rob is an amazing dad. 'Since his ex-wife walked out on him leaving the girls behind, he has loved and raised them. 'His mum and dad even moved in to help to bring up the girls. They have been living in a close and loving family and will be traumatised and frightened at not having seen or heard from their dad. 'They have never been away from him before since the day they were born. Rob is heartbroken and so are their grandma and grandpa.'","Interpol searching for two girls missing while visiting mother in Thailand .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 18:44 GMT, 24 September 2011 . Dozens of young British men are being trafficked abroad by Irish slave gangs who force them to work on multimillion-pound paving and tarmac scams, it emerged today. They are recruited in pubs or on the streets by mafia-style travellers who promise free accommodation and good money. But they often end up working from 7am to 11pm for under £10, with the threat of violence hanging over them if they do not toe the line. Scam: Gangs within the Irish traveller community have been recruiting British men on the false promise of good money and free accommodation . The disturbing picture has emerged in a leaked report by authorities in Sweden, where many of the captives find themselves, according to the Times. It reveals how the men are set to work on projects to pave or surface driveways in a dodgy trade worth £11million a year in Norway and £3million in Sweden. The Project Troy report said: 'Many homeowners around Sweden report the same thing: the knock on the door and a well-dressed English-speaking man offering to pave the driveway.' But the work is often left incomplete or shoddily done, leaving them to be dubbed the 'tarmac cowboys'. In Sweden alone, there have been at least 72 reports of trafficking and forced labour by members of the traveller community since 2007. The report, by the intelligence section of Sweden's national Criminal Investigation Department, highlights the case of Oliver Hayre. Forced labour: Oliver Hayre (left) died in a caravan fire in Sweden while working for Irish travellers in 2005. His parents, Lyn and Martin Hayre, claim he was treated like a 'slave' The 22-year-old died in 2005 when a fire started in his caravan while he had been living and working for Irish travellers on Lomma campsite, in Skane, Sweden. Swedish police said there was no evidence of foul play, but the report called the fire arson and says that people living there were found to be 'impeding rescue efforts'. Mr Hayre, from Stamford, Lincolnshire, had been offered work that would apparently earn him £900 a week, but his family said he was treated like a 'slave'. Killed? Swedish police say there was no foul play involved in the death of Mr Hayre (pictured on the left at a friend's wedding). But the Project Troy report has described it as arson . His father, Martin, 55, said: 'They sent one of the family's grandfathers to the house to meet Oliver's mother, my wife. If he didn't do what they wished when they wished, ill would fall on his mother.' Project Troy was triggered by intelligence suggesting a 'widespread occurrence of trafficking of members of the public by Irish and British tarmac and paving-layers'. The UK Human Trafficking Centre, which is now part of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, and the Association of Chief Police Officers has been involved in a Europe-wide investigation into the practice since 2008, but has not made the extent of its findings public. A source from within the centre disclosed that there is evidence of 213 people being trafficked into, out of and within the UK by gangs between 2007 and early 2010, according to The Times. More than half were British. The source said: 'This is an issue which has been on the radar for a while and these figures are by no means exhaustive. 'The figure may well exceed this.' British police have raided seven travellers' camps across six counties this year. One of those included Green Acres caravan site, near Leighton Buzzard, where six members of the same family have been charged with slavery and forced-labour offences over the past two weeks. In a separate operation, a police raid on Green Acres caravan site near Leighton Buzzard has led to six members of the same family being charged over alleged slavery and forced-labour practices .",Many captives are taken to Sweden and Norway .
"'It’s shocking, we just want the girls back' grandmother Betty Day, 70, said . By . Rebecca Camber . A British father was frantically searching for his two young daughters last night after they vanished in Thailand following a suspected abduction by their mother. Annie and Alina Day, aged  ten and six, disappeared  after they flew out to see their Thai mother Onwarat  Gamlem for a half-term holiday. The girls, who have lived in Sevenoaks, Kent, with their father Robert since their parents’ divorce in 2010, had been due to return from Pattaya on June 1. Anguish: Mr Day and a friend pictured with Annie, ten, right, and Alina, six - who have vanished during a trip to Thailand to see their mother Onwarat Gamlem . But Miss Gamlem vanished along with her two girls and three-year-old son from another relationship after apparently removing the SIM cards from their phones to avoid any possibility of tracing them. Last night the grandparents of the missing girls told of their despair, saying they only saw their mother once a year as she did not want much to do with them. Gordon and Betty Day said  Robert, 38, who works as an auctioneer and a stone mason, was hunting for his children in Thailand. Speaking from the £350,000 home they share with  their son and granddaughters, 70-year-old Mrs Day pleaded with Gamlem, whom they called ‘Wig’, to return the girls. Annie and Alina Day were due to return home from Thailand following a visit to their mother on June 1. An arrest warrant has now be issued for the parent - who divorced Mr Day in 2010 . Mrs Day said: ‘Robert went out on Sunday May 25 with both girls.They all do it once a year for two and a half weeks during half-term. ‘When they were married, Wig went and left ... and got a divorce and Robert got full custody. ‘We don’t know if she has taken the children out of spite. ‘It’s shocking, we can’t think or sleep and just want the girls back with us – this is their home. Miss Gamlem, pictured, vanished along with her two girls and three-year-old son from another relationship after apparently removing the SIM cards from their phones to avoid any possibility of tracing them . ‘The girls were born in Thailand but they go to school here. Their whole life is in England and their mum didn’t even want anything to do with them. We’re desperate to get them back where they belong.’ The couple said Gamlem was meant to return the children to Pattaya airport so they could fly home with their father. But a visit to her home revealed she had fled and removed the SIM cards  to avoid detection. Mrs Day said:  ‘They’re such amazing little girls and very, very bright. ‘Annie is into absolutely everything – especially cross country and swimming – and just puts her hand up to volunteer for everything. Alina is always going to after-school clubs and is very clever.’ Last night Thai police were working with Interpol to try to locate the girls amid growing concerns for  their welfare. They have issued an arrest warrant for 33-year-old Gamlem. Friends expressed their shock about the apparent kidnapping on Facebook  yesterday. Family friend Sharon Saunders, from Sheffield, said: ‘Rob is an amazing dad. Since his ex-wife walked out on him, leaving the girls behind, he has loved and raised them. ‘They have never been away from him since the day that they  were born.’ A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of reports of two missing British nationals in Thailand and are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.’","Annie and Alina Day, aged ten and six, disappeared during half-term holiday .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . For today's schoolchildren, the First World War can seem like such an impossibly distant piece of history that it is difficult for them to relate to. But thousands of youngsters as young as four and five have written deeply moving letters, full of hope and fear and hugs, to an Unknown Soldier fighting on the frontline to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War. They include drawings, poems and flashes of deeply personal reflection on what life was like both in the trenches and for the sons and daughters left at home. Thousands of schoolchildren have written letters to an Unknown Soldier as part of a project inspired by a statue on platform one at Paddington Station of an Unknown Soldier reading a letter . The tributes have been inspired by a statue on platform one at Paddington Station of an Unknown Soldier reading a letter. The project aims to connect today’s generation with the sacrifice of those sent into battle a century ago. Organisers say 'it's a striking way to make a personal and permanent mark on this centenary'. More than 6million British men were mobilised during the war, and more than 700,000 were killed. At least 14,000 people have already submitted letters, including celebrities like Stephen Fry, Andrew Motion, Sheila Hancock, Andy McNab and Dawn French. In his letter, David Cameron tells the young soldier how ‘our world would have been far darker if you had declined the call to act’. But the letters from children stand out for the things they focus on, and the obvious impact of studying the war during lessons. Organisers hope it will connect today's generation with the sacrifice of those sent into battle a century ago . The letters reflect on both the horror of life in trenches, and the fears of those left behind at home . Many reflect on photos, medals and mementoes of lives they never knew, passed down through generations. They refer to the horrendous injuries suffered by so many, and to how different life is now, how 'technology and fashion is completely new'. Some are deeply personal, addressed to great-grandfathers who gave them middle names, while others are purely fictional. Here we present a selection of letters from schoolchildren across the country.

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . The Queen might spend her holidays at Balmoral but the rest of the world's royals have considerably more exotic tastes, with beautiful beaches and stunning scenery high on their checklist. Caribbean islands Mustique and St Barts are hugely popular with the Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Beatrice among regular visitors, while the island of Ibiza played host to the Wessexes earlier this summer. The French Riviera is another popular spot with royal holidaymakers, among them Sweden's Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland, while Prince Albert and Princess Charlene of Monaco like to holiday in rustic Norway or venture south to Portofino. Scroll down for video . And relax: Princess Beatrice and her boyfriend Dave Clarke love to holiday on the Caribbean island of St Barts and have managed two trips so far this year . More still, among them Spain's King Felipe and Queen Letizia and the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, plump for staycations in pretty parts of their home country. But you don't have to be blue-blooded to snap up a sun lounger with the royal seal of approval. Whether you're in the UK or further afield, FEMAIL reveals where to spot a prince (or princess) this summer. COOL CARIBBEAN . With its sugar-sand beaches and gently swaying palms, it's no surprise that the Caribbean has proved a hit with holidaying royalty. A particular favourite is St Barts, which earlier this year saw Princess Beatrice arrive on its shores for a break. Part of the Leeward Islands, the island is one of four that make up the French West Indies, and is home to popular celebrity haunts such as Maya's, a beachside restaurant just outside the capital Gustavia. ‘The Caribbean island of St Barts is synonymous with the rich and famous, from Beyonce and Jay-Z to Roman Abramovich,' says MailOnline acting travel editor, Sarah Gordon. On their way: The Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George arrive in Mustique for his first holiday while Princess Margaret (right) was a big fan of the island . Paradise: The tiny island of Mustique has long been popular with royal holidaymakers such as the Duchess of Cambridge and also has scores of celebrity fans . ‘While celebrities are certainly seen here, it is the ultra-wealthy media moguls and steel magnates who really love to splash out on holidays in this exclusive spot. ‘All of that makes it perfect for the royals, who can enjoy the island’s relative privacy and lack of “riff raff” – the island can be difficult and pricy to reach, ensuring most holidaymakers head elsewhere.' Almost as popular with the royal set is the exclusive island of Mustique, which in January this year, was the scene of Prince George's first ever trip abroad. While the little prince stayed in a rented villa with his Middleton relatives, his great aunt Princess Margaret, another royal fond of a Mustique break, sunned in style in the garden of the villa she owned on the island. SUNNY SPAIN . From the Prince of Wales to Princes William and Harry, nearly all of the senior British royals have enjoyed Spanish holidays at one point or another, although the most recent visitors were the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The couple were photographed enjoying a relaxing break in July aboard a luxury yacht moored off the tiny uninhabited island of Espalmador, close to Ibiza, which is famous for its naturist beaches and mud baths. Also fond of an Ibiza getaway are the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who in 2010 stayed at a villa on the Spanish island belonging to Kate’s colourful uncle Gary Goldsmith – the infamous Maison de Bang Bang. Home from home: King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain are currently enjoying a family break with their two daughters, Princess Leonor and Princess Sofia . Beautiful: During their most recent trip to Mallorca, the Spanish royal family toured the heritage centre set up to mark the UNESCO listing of the Tramuntana mountains . Almost as infamous is the Spanish resort of Magaluf on nearby Mallorca - a favourite summer spot of the Spanish royal family who own two palaces on the island. King Felipe and Queen Letizia are currently staying at the Marvient Palace with their two daughters and spend most of the time relaxing on the beach or enjoying days out in and around the capital Palma. Past visitors to the Spanish royals at the Marvient have included the Prince of Wales and the late Princess Diana, who joined them for a holiday in Mallorca in 1988 and again in 1990. Along with their children - a three-year-old Prince Harry and a five-year-old William - the royal couple spent time on the family yacht Fortuna, sold off in 2010, with Prince Charles photographed teaching Harry how to swim under the watchful gaze of fellow guest, King Constantine of Greece.

A-listers such as Kate Moss also flock to the island come the summer months . FANS OF FRANCE . From Monaco to St Tropez, Toulouse and Marseilles, France has no shortage of glamorous places to stay and both celebrities and royals have taken note. Although Princess Charlene and Prince Albert of Monaco are regularly spotted in their principality, other royals, among them Sweden's Prince Carl Philipe, are more infrequent visitors. Last month, the Swedish prince was spotted . holidaying on a yacht off the French coast and appeared to enjoy the . experience, beaming broadly as he scrambled back on board to join his fiancee, former glamour model Sofia Hellqvist.

Other vistors include Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, both of whom are fond of holidaying in St Tropez - often with their mother Sarah Ferguson and respective boyfriends. More unusual locations for a French break include the Île d'Yeu, a pretty island just of the Vendée coast of western France, which last year played host to King Phillippe and Queen Mathilde of the Belgians and their children, Elisabeth, Emmanuele, Gabriel and Eléonore. ITALIAN GETAWAYS . Italy has long been a popular holiday destination for the A-list but the country has also proved a hit with royal holidaymakers among them the Wessexes and Princess Charlene of Monaco. Although the Earl and Countess of Wessex chose Ibiza this year, last year the couple and their two children Lady Louise Windsor and James, Viscount Severn, were photographed enjoying a break in beautiful Tuscany. Equally popular with royal visitors are . the upmarket resorts of Portofino and Capri, with Monaco's Princess . Charlene enjoying a pre-baby break with friends in Portofino. Sunshine break: Last summer, Princess Charlene of Monaco enjoyed pre-pregnancy holidays with friends in Portofino and on a luxury yacht off the Sardinian coast . Italy fans: Prince Harry visited Rome earlier this year and will travel to Puglia next month. After her Italy break, Charlene joined Prince Albert in Norway's Telemark . Top spot: The beautiful little town of Portofino is one of the most popular royal destinations in Italy with visitors that include Princess Charlene of Monaco . Afterwards, Charlene went on to spend a couple of days on a yacht off the coast of Sardinia, close to the spectacularly pretty little town of Olbia, before joining Prince Albert for a holiday at the Kragerø Resort and Spa near Telemark in southern Norway. Other royals to visit include Prince Harry who earlier this year visited Rome for an official engagement to honour British and Commonwealth troops who fought and died at the battle of Monte Cassino. Along with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, he is expected to return to the country in September for the wedding of close friends, nightclub owner Charlie Gilkes and his fiancee Anneke von Trotha Taylor, in Puglia. ROYAL STAYCATIONS . The Queen is famous for her summers at Balmoral but the Prince of Wales is just as fond as spending his time off in Scotland, albeit at his own summer home, Birkhall. Joined by the Duchess of Cornwall and their grandchildren, the heir to the throne has spent the summer walking, fishing and watching the Highland Games while enjoying a dram or two of whisky along the way. Cheers! The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall clink glasses as they enjoy a dram of whisky during a visit to the Highland Games in Ballater this month . Family affair: The royal couple were joined by their grandchildren Eliza, Gus and Louis during their stay at Birkhall which is part of the Balmoral Estate in Aberdeenshire . And it seems that the prince has passed his fondness for staycations on to his sons, both of whom have remained in the UK during August, with the Duke of Cambridge splitting his time between London and Berkshire and Prince Harry confining himself to the capital. Not that Prince Harry has lacked entertainment: Along with a foray to the Secret Garden Party in the pretty village of Abbots Ripton in Cambridgeshire, the prince was also photographed enjoying a pint at the Great British Beer Festival in London. Other royals who prefer to spend their summers at home include Denmark's Queen Margrethe, who is a regular visitor to the North Sea resort of Skagen in northern Denmark. Her son, Crown Prince Frederik, and his Australian wife Mary also chose a patriotic destination in the shape of Greenland, where they were photographed meeting locals while wrapped up warm against the chilly temperatures. The Swedish royals are also fans of a staycation, with glamorous Princess Madeliene among regular visitors to the beautiful seaside town of Marstrand on the West Sweden coast.

"By . Corey Charlton . A final letter home from an exhausted First World War soldier that his grieving widow carried in her handbag for the rest of her life has come to light. The poignant note was sent by a war-weary Frederick Swannell, originally from Bethnal Green, London, who wrote how the hellish conditions in the trenches were beating him and how he longed to be returned to his wife and five young children. The letter makes for heart-rending reading and highlights the terrible toll the conflict had on the men’s mental and physical health.

Within weeks of penning the letter to wife Nell, the dejected Lance Corporal was killed during the Battle of Arras in April 1917. Unbeknown to her family, his widow kept the touching letter by her side in her handbag for the next 64 years. It was only after her death that her daughters Elizabeth and Charlotte opened the bag and found their father’s fragile six page letter which they read for the first time. They were so moved by it that they placed it alongside Nell in her coffin at her funeral. The family kept a copy of the note and have recently uploaded it to military genealogy website Forces War Records. L/Cpl's daughters were amazed to discover their father's heartfelt love letter to their mother after her death. In full, the letter reads: 'My foot is progressing very slowly but lately I have been very bad in health for the conditions I have had to go through out here is gradually telling upon my constitution for I reckon I have stood it well up till now but I feel as I am getting beaten. 'How I wish . that this terrible anxiety and suspense was over for I do long to be . with you and our dear little ones who are continually in my mind.

Experts for . the site were able to provide them with details of L/Cpl Swannell’s . service record and have now revealed the letter to mark the 100th . anniversary of the start of the First World War. Tom Bennington, of Forces War Records, said: 'This letter is beautifully scripted and speaks volumes about the personal cost of the war and the terrible physical and mental toll of trench warfare. 'It was a war the soldiers had grown sick of, not just because of the terrifying bombardments but the stench, mud and disease in the trenches. 'That comes across in Frederick Swannell’s letter. He felt almost beaten by it all and desperately wished for it to end so he could be back home with his family. 'He was clearly most fearful that he would never return home to them. L/Cpl writes he hopes for a 'peaceable time for us both' if he is lucky enough to survive the war . The final pages of the heart-wrenching letter, which ends with 'kisses for you love and my little ones' The letter is undated but it is likely to have been his last as Nell treasured it so much. On April 28, 1917, L/Cpl Swannell, who served in the Essex Regiment, and his comrades were defending Oppy Wood during the Battle of Arleux which was part of the British offensive on the city of Arras. On that day he was declared missing, presumed killed. He was aged 35. His body was never recovered and his name was added to the Arras memorial along with 34,785 British and Commonwealth soldiers with no known grave. L/Cpl Swannell’s grandson Roger Potts, from Chester, who has been researching his grandfather’s war, said: 'Every time I read the letter it brings a lump to my throat. 'It vividly illustrates the horror of his life at the front and of his desperate wish to be home with his young family. 'With the WWI centenary approaching it is something we want to share so people are aware of the terrible times these brave young men lived through.' L/Cpl Swannell, from Bethnal Green, East London, was a French polisher before the outbreak of war. He joined the 13th Battalion of the Essex Regiment in November 1915 and was sent to France. He fought through many major battles of the war including The Somme in 1916 and then Arras in 1917.","The final letter sent home by a First World War soldier has surfaced, detailing his frustration at trench war conditions and his love for his family .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . A benefits cheat who claimed thousands of pounds after claiming he could hardly walk was caught out - when he was spotted hiking, cycling and jet skiing. Mark Haugh, 57, told officials he could only walk a few steps without discomfort and would be left bed-bound for up to five days a week due to mobility issues. But when he was spotted strolling through Bristol Airport, investigators became suspicious. Scroll down for video . Caught: This is one of Mark Haugh's holiday photos that emerged after he claimed he can only walk a few steps . Eventually, they discovered an action-filled holiday photo album, with pictures of him on the back of a jet ski and balancing on a perilous rope bridge at Giant's Causeway in Ireland. Handing him a community order, Judge Mark Horton said: 'One of the huge difficulties about people who abuse the benefit system is it attracts huge public attention, huge public disapproval and enormous bitterness. 'People who pay their taxes, when they discover that someone who has a disability is known to go on foreign holidays, on jet skis and cycling, they come to the conclusion that their position in society is being abused by people like you. 'That is the reason you are here. It is not acceptable in society. 'It was also appalling not to disclose it.' Action-filled: The 57-year-old, who received more than £7,000 in benefits, was seen jet-skiing in Ireland . Tricky: Another photo showed him balancing on a rope bridge at Giant's Causeway in Ireland . Bristol Crown Court heard Haugh claimed £7,032 Disability Living Allowance between January 2012 and April last year. Nicholas Fridd, prosecuting, said it was only stopped when the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) seized some of his holiday snaps and spotted him strolling through Bristol Airport. Tabitha Macfarlane, defending, told the judge her client legitimately claimed for benefit initially but had failed to inform the authorities of an improvement in his condition. He added that the DWP was reclaiming over-payment and there was no suggestion he squandered his ill-gotten gains on a luxury lifestyle. Sentenced: Judge Mark Horton handed Haugh a six-month community sentence for fraud . Haugh, of Speedwell, Bristol, told investigators he was waiting on advice before notifying the DWP of his change of circumstances. He pleaded guilty to receiving the over-payment by failing to notify a change in circumstances. Haugh was given a community order with six months' supervision to help him with employment and training, problem solving and debt advice.","Mark Haugh, 57, claimed he could only walk a few steps without pain .

The 22-year-old dental nurse was walking home after a night out in Marrakesh, Morocco when a street robber tried to steal her bag which contained just 13p.

The robber tried to stab her in the chest before slashing open her left leg, leaving her with a gaping wound in her thigh . The razor-sharp blade sliced through Ms Greenslade's skin, opening up a gash two inches wide and at least 12 inches long. A young British charity worker was left with an horrific stab wound when she was attacked by a Moroccan street robber for just 13p. Naomie Greenslade, 22, was attacked by the knife-wielding mugger when she refused to hand over her bag while walking home after going out for a meal with friends in Marrakesh. The robber tried to stab her in the chest before slashing open her left leg, leaving her with a gaping wound in her thigh. The 22-year-old dental nurse suffered a 12-inch long gash from her hip down along her left thigh, pictured . The dental nurse, who has been volunteering at orphanages in the Moroccan city, was taken to hospital where she received more than 20 metal stitches to her left hip and upper leg. Ms Greenslade has now told how she was attacked in the walled city, which has become a popular tourist destination. She said: 'A group of ten of us had gone out to get some dinner and we were walking back to our accommodation around midnight. 'We were walking at normal speed and chatting. We were not intoxicated and there were three guys with us so you'd think you are safe but these guys out here don't care.' Ms Greenslade said the group heard shouting before she was grabbed. She said: 'I turned around and a guy had a big butcher's knife with a blue handle that he pointed to my chest and started screaming in Arabic. Ms Greenslade was taken to hospital where she received more than 20 metal stitches (left) to her left hip and upper leg following the attack. The knife wound left a second scar, right, on her left hip area . 'I knew he wanted my bum bag which I had around my waist. I refused to give it to him. He tried to plunge the knife into my chest but I managed to jump back. But he slashed me. 'I didn't realise I had been hurt. I looked down and my bag was ripped off me. Everything fell on the floor - make-up, my phone, my purse which had the equivalent of about 13p in it.' Ms Greenslade, who volunteers with the Welsh Ambulance Service in her spare time, said she thought she was going to die when she saw the wound in her leg.

"By . Sean Poulter . Lidl is removing all sweets, chocolates and crisps from checkouts in its 600 stores in favour of healthier alternatives in a move against obesity. The decision follows evidence that parents’ attempts to encourage children to eat healthily are being sabotaged because of the easy available of junk food snacks. Yesterday, the National Obesity Forum warned that the obesity epidemic, with all the associated ill-health, could be far worse than previously predicted. Tackling obesity: The decision by the supermarket chain follows evidence that parents's attempts to encourage children to eat healthy are being sabotaged because of the availability of snacks . A shock report said predictions that half of Britons would be obese by 2050 were an ‘underestimate’ - because experts did not factor in how much fatter we’re getting as we age. While last week, a coalition of doctors and academics called on stores and manufacturers to slash sugar levels in processed food and drink by up to a third over five years to combat weight gain. A survey by Lidl - the first supermarket to implement a total ban like this - found that more than half of parents found it hard to get their children to eat healthily when there were snacks everywhere. The managing director of Lidl UK, Ronny Gottschlich, said the chain is the first to implement a total ban. ‘We’re committed not only to raising awareness of the importance of balanced diets and healthy lifestyles, but also to making it easier for our customers to follow them,’ he said. ‘We know how difficult it can be to say no to pester power, so by removing sweets and chocolates from our tills we can make it easier for parents to reward children in healthier ways. ‘Parents are in favour of healthier checkouts and with six in 10 households visiting Lidl at least once in the last year and five million customers a week coming through our doors, it’s important for us to meet their needs and concerns.’ Completely removed: There will be a total ban on sweets and chocolate next to the check out following a 10-week trial period (file picture) The decision to ban junk food from tills follows a 10-week trial at some stores where ‘treat’ items were replaced with more nutritious alternatives, such as nuts and fruit, at one checkout in every store. These checkouts received 20per cent higher footfall and research found that seven out of 10 customers would pick a sweet-free checkout over a traditional one. Former public health minister, Anna Soubry, made efforts to get rid of what she called ‘guilt aisles’ while in post. David Cameron has also been critical of chains like WHSmith for offering chocolate oranges at checkouts. The Department of Health is currently drawing up new voluntary guidelines for the marketing of foods high in fat, salt and sugar. Others could follow Lidl under this regime – however it is voluntary. Research published by the ‘Junk Free Checkouts’ campaign last year found eight in ten parents were unhappy that stores continue to fuel obesity and pester power by putting sweets at the tills. It was set up by the Children’s Food Campaign, whose co-ordinator, Malcolm Clark, said: ‘We congratulate Lidl for making this move and leading the way on removing unhealthy snacks from checkouts. ‘The onus is now on other supermarkets and retailers to follow suit.’","Parents’ trying to promote healthy eating ruined by easily available snacks .

"By . Sean Poulter . Tesco has agreed to ban displays of chocolate and other sweets next to checkouts in 1,800 of its smaller Express and Metro stores . Sweets and chocolate are to be banned from all Tesco store checkouts in a bid to combat pester power and rising obesity among children. The high sugar and fat confectionary will be phased out from so-called ‘guilt aisles’ in response to demands from parents and health campaigners. The chain removed confectionary from the checkouts at its large stores 20 years ago, however it is now extending it to some 1,800 smaller Express and Metro outlets. The decision will heap pressure on other retailers to follow suit amid claims from some health campaigners that sugar is the ‘new tobacco’ because of the damage over-consumption can cause in terms of weight and health. Lidl announced it was removing junk food from checkouts in January, however the move by Tesco is particularly significant because it is the UK’s biggest retailer. Tesco said its own research found two thirds of shoppers – 65per cent - said removing confectionery from checkouts would help them make healthier choices. Similarly, some 67per cent of parents said that having no confectionery near the checkout would help them make healthier choices for their children. Tesco chief executive, Philip Clarke, said: ‘We all know how easy it is to be tempted by sugary snacks at the checkout, and we want to help our customers lead healthier lives. ‘We’ve already removed billions of calories from our soft drinks, sandwiches and ready meal ranges by changing the recipes to reduce their sugar, salt and fat content. And we will continue to look for opportunities to take out more.’ The decision by Tesco to go it alone follows the breakdown of talks between retailers and the Government earlier this year which would have introduced a voluntary blanket ban on the sale of junk food at all checkouts. Easy access to high calorie sweets and chocolates at checkouts has concerned health expects and politicians for many years. A recent study by the University of Sheffield found nine in ten items at the checkouts of supermarket convenience stores would be considered ‘very unhealthy’, according to Food Standards Agency guidelines. The vast majority of these were chocolate treats and stacked on shelves at one metre and below, which is directly in the eye-line of children aged 3-5. Tesco removed chocolates from checkouts of large stores 20 years ago but has agreed to extend the ban . Dr Jason Horsley, who was involved in the research, said: ‘The checkout is an area which all shoppers must pass through, so displays of highly desirable calorie-dense foodstuffs are an unavoidable exposure. ‘Children are a significant market for retailers of processed foodstuffs and budgets dedicated to advertising to children have grown exponentially in the last three decades. ‘Youngsters are often naïve to sophisticated marketing techniques and they influence parents’ purchases through pester power. ‘We know from other research that children have pester power to change their parents purchasing. They will see something, want it and have a tantrum if they don’t get. It depends how brave the parent is as to whether they buy it or not.’ The Prime Minister has previously lambasted stores for using this tactic, famously attacking WH Smith for putting boxes of chocolate oranges at checkouts. As far back as 2006, the then Opposition complained in a speech about ‘irresponsible’ marketing techniques by shops. He said: ‘Try and buy a newspaper at the train station and, as you queue to pay, you’re surrounded, you’re inundated by cut-price offers for giant chocolate bars. ‘As Britain faces an obesity crisis, why does WH Smith promote half-price chocolate oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges?’ David Cameron has previously lambasted shops for using the tactic, singling out WH Smiths . The removal of the sweets is a major victory for the ‘Junk Free Checkouts’ campaign, which was launched last year on the back of research which found eight in ten parents were unhappy that stores continue to fuel obesity and pester power by putting sweets at the tills. The initiative was backed by both the food and health charity Sustain and the British Dietetic Association, who both welcomed the decision by Tesco and called on others to follow suit. Ben Reynolds of Sustain said: ‘Parents will be delighted to hear that they will no longer be pestered for fatty, salty and sugary snacks whilst queuing at the checkout in their local Tesco. ‘Both Tesco and Lidl have chucked junk off the checkouts following surveys with their customer surveys showing that this move would be popular and not affect their profits. 'We hope that other supermarkets will now realise that taking action to improve children’s health is not something to fear.’ Katie O’Donovan from Mumsnet said: ‘Popping into a shop with a small child in tow can sometimes feel like navigating an assault course. 'If you’ve made it to the checkout in one piece it can be really frustrating to then be faced with an unhealthy array of sweets designed to tempt your child. 'It’s really positive to see a supermarket responding to the views of their customers and trying to make life that little bit easier.’","Tesco agrees to remove chocolates from small store checkouts .

"By . Chris Spargo For Mailonline . Julia Tapper lost her fiancée, Marine Lance Corporal Matthew R. Rodriguez, when he was killed in Afghanistan last year, and so she was always sure to hold on tight to the personal poem she wrote for him as a way of remembering her fallen solider, which was found in his helmet when he lost his life in the line of duty. Now, tragedy has struck again for Miss Tapper, as a thief broke into her truck in broad daylight this weekend, stealing a purse that contained not only her treasured poem, but also LCpl Rodriguez's iPhone, which was filled with personal photos and videos of the couple, including their engagement video. LCpl Rodriguez was just 19-years-old when he died. Scroll down for video . Julia Tapper and her fiancé Lance Corporal Matthew R. Rodriguez, who was killed in the line of duty in Afghanistan last December . The truck, which had belonged to LCpl Rodriguez, was parked in the lot behind the restaurant Miss Tapper works at in New Bedford, Massachusetts on Sunday afternoon when somebody broke the driver's side window and took her purse. The break-in happened sometime between 11am and 4pm. She is not looking for her purse back and does not care if the thief is caught or charged, she just wants back those few things she has to remember the man she loved. 'I would do anything to have it back - just that stuff. Keep the purse. It wasn't even that nice,' Miss Tapper told MyFoxBoston.com. Miss Tapper (pictured here with LCpl Rodriguez) says she doesn't want her stolen purse back, just the poem and phone . 'If ever there is a tomorrow . When we are not together . There is something you must remember...' This is how the poem began that Julia Tapper wrote for her fiancé, Lance Corporal Matthew R. Rodriguez, before he was deployed to Afghanistan last fall. He carried it with him everywhere, and it was found in his helmet when he was killed while serving his country, less than three months after he arrived overseas. 'We had a huge future ahead of us. We wanted to do so much, and travel. He couldn't wait to start a family and I couldn't wait to start a family.' 'I just hope somebody could just drop it off if they still have it, or write a note where they threw it.' Both the phone and poem are priceless to Miss Tapper, a way of always keeping part of LCpl Rodriguez, who was killed by an improvised explosive device on December 11, 2013, with her. His death came just two and a half months after he was first deployed. 'It was with him on his person when he was killed in action. You can replicate the poem but not the one he had on him when he was killed serving his country,' said Lisa Rodriguez, Matthew's mother. '[Julia] lost the love of her life, and all the plans she had for her life revolved around my son,' she added. 'He loved her very much, and our family was better with her in it.'

LCpl Rodriguez, an accomplished baseball and hockey player, enlisted in the Marine Corps on August 20, 2012, shortly after graduating from Greater New Bedford Regional Vocational Technical High School. His father, Rod, had also served in the Corps. “I just remember him always saying he wanted to do what his dad did — to be a Marine,” high school classmate Ian Soares told The Boston Globe.

"By . David Mccormack . and Snejana Farberov for Mail online . It is little wonder that the record-breaking alligator killed last weekend in Alabama tipped the scales at over 1,000lbs. When the behemoth reptile snagged Saturday by Mandy Stokes and her extended family was sliced open, taxidermist Ken Owens discovered inside the animal's stomach a fully intact adult female deer and a smattering of other animal bones. The doe, which had been swallowed whole by the monster gator, was likely 3 years old and weighing more than 100lbs, according to the Autaugaville taxidermist. The 15-foot-long, 1,015-pound alligator was hooked in a creek about 80 miles west of Montgomery August 16, possibly setting a new world record. Hulking beast: An alligator weighing 1011.5 pounds and measuring 15 feet long is being stored at Ken's Wildlife Images Taxidermy on August 19 in Autagaville, Alabama . Big lunch: Taxidermist Ken Owens discovered inside the gator's belly a fully intact carcass of a deer . Bottomless pit: The massive animal killed by Mandy Stokes and her family last weekend had swallowed the doe whole a week earlier, along with two squirrels . The critter was bagged by Mandy and John Stokes, brother-in-law Kevin Jenkins and his children, 16-year-old Savannah and 14-year-old Parker. The clan have brought their scaly catch to Mr Owens to skin and stuff it so it could ultimately be put on public display. The taxidermist laid out the gargantuan gator measuring 70.5 inches around the stomach on the floor of a large work shed and cut open its midsection, which turned out to contain the badly deteriorated deer corpse. Owens told Al.com the dead doe had no hair, owing to alligators’ powerful stomach acid, but much of the cartilage and all four hooves were intact. The taxidermist, who performed the so-called necropsy on the gator at the request of biologists, estimated that the reptile must have wolfed down the doe about a week before its fateful encounter with the Stokes-Jenkins family. The alligator's belly yielded a few additional surprises, including two complete squirrel carcass still covered in patches of fur. Ravenous: The hulking animal also wolfed down a small cow, water birds, rocks and greenery before its death . Feast: The massive reptile has yielded a couple hundred pounds of meat, some of which will go to charity . Trophy: The gator's will go to a tannery, and it will be fully mounted by next spring . Dr. Kent Vliet, a reptilian biologist with the University of Florida, told Al.com it remains a mystery to him how exactly the 1,000-pound gator went about capturing the small woodland critters. ‘I've looked at the stomach contents of a lot of alligators and have never seen a squirrel in any of them,’ he told the newspaper. Vliet speculated that the animals may have fallen into the river during a storm and ended up in the gator’s maw. Other items that Ken Owens discovered while rummaging through the contents of the slain gator's belly included bones from a water bird; skull plates from other deer; big rocks; molars from a small cow, and a heaping portion of greenery. In all, the taxidermist spent more than 2 hours skinning the hulking beast and sawing off its head. The gator likely will not be mounted until next spring. The massive carcass of the gator also yielded several hundred pounds of edible meat, some of which will go to charity. The  beast was captured by five members of the Stokes family near Thomaston early Saturday. It took the family, consisting of Mandy Stokes, husband John Stokes, brother-in-law Kevin Jenkins and his children Savannah, 16, and Parker, 14, ten hours to capture the monster. Mandy Stokes, husband John Stokes, brother-in-law Kevin Jenkins and his children Savannah, 16, and Parker, 14, pose alongside the 15-feet long and 1,011.5 pound alligator they captured on the weekend . The mammoth beast, which measured 15-feet long and weighed 1,011.5 pounds, was captured near Thomaston, Alabama . The hunt started on Friday night and lasted well into Saturday morning. Mandy Stokes said her crew went through the full range of emotions as they first staked the animal,  before battling it, then killing it and finally struggling to take it back to shore. And the fierce gator didn't go down without a fight. After the family got some large hooks into the gator, Mandy Stokes aimed her 20-gauge shotgun at the ‘sweet spot’ behind the alligator's eyes. That's where she was told to aim during a mandatory training class for Alabama gator hunters. She pulled the trigger, but the gator's head was too far beneath the water's surface. ‘All it did was make this gator mad,’ Mandy Stokes told Al.com. ‘Fear had taken hold at this point."" The gator surged forward and towed the 17-foot boat and its five passengers across the creek at a startling speed, the hunters said. The towing continued until the boat crashed into a tree stump in the creek, sending the crew spilling on top of each other. Eventually, Mandy Stokes got another shot. ‘He came up just as calm as he could,’ Mandy Stokes told AL.com. ‘When I pulled the trigger this time, water just exploded on all of us.’ They tied the gator to one side of the boat and hugged the opposite side so it wouldn't tip over as they made an hour-long trek back to their truck. When they finally got the beast back to dry land, he was so big that he crushed the winch system normally used by Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries biologists. Alligators are the only dangerous-game species that can legally be hunted in Alabama . The Stokes' gator measured 70.5 inches around the stomach, 46 inches around the base of the tail and had a 16-inch snout measurement . Alligators are the only dangerous-game species that can legally be hunted in the state. In the end, a backhoe had to be brought in to lift the animal and officially weigh it. The mammoth gator has now been officially named as the largest ever legally harvested in Alabama and it could even be a new world record. In June, Safari Club International declared a 14-foot, 8-inch, 880-pound alligator killed in Chalk Creek near Lufkin, Texas by Justin Wells of Bossier City, La., in 2007 as the new world record. It isn't clear which metric - length, weight or a combination of both - SCI used to come to its decision. The Stokes' gator measured 70.5 inches around the stomach, 46 inches around the base of the tail and had a 16-inch snout measurement. Following his capture and being weighed, his next stop was scheduled to be Ken Owens' Autaugaville taxidermy shop.

The celebrity chef bought the Pear Tree Inn in Whitley, Wiltshire in 2011, but quickly came under fire from locals for charging high prices and apparently converting it into a posh London-style eaterie. Earlier this month, it was also claimed that just a single manager was left at the gastro-pub after a 'mass walkout' by 'frustrated' staff who were fed up with White's allegedly 'bossy' management style. Scroll down for video . Marco Pierre White, pictured left, has sold his gastropub The Pear Tree in Whitley, Wiltshire, after an alleged mass walk out by staff and an ongoing boycott by angry locals . A spokesman for the venue had claimed the restaurant was only shut for a . quick refurbishment, despite customers who had booked rooms previously being unexpectedly sent to a nearby hotel. But the pub has now been sold to new owners, while removal vans have been seen emptying the site. A spokeswoman for White told The Telegraph the pub had been sold on Thursday with the new owners due to take over on Friday. Local councillor Terry Chivers, who has been drinking at the pub for more than 20 years, said: 'What I've been told by a good source is that the lease has been sold. 'Over the last week everything has been removed and the whole place has been gutted. 'All . the staff have gone and there has been no attempts made to replace . them. I don't think Marco will be missed in the slightest around here. Earlier this month, it was claimed just a single manager was left at the gastropub after a mass walkout by 'frustrated' staff. The hotel and restaurant is currently closed for refurbishment . 'He came in and made a big deal about supporting the locals but he didn't even have the decency to tell them the Pear Tree was closing. 'He was pig-headed about the whole thing, from the start, he took off all the beers that the locals drank. 'There was such a massive turnover of staff and when you went into the pub you'd never find anyone at the bar to serve you. 'Marco was there all the time in the beginning but when things started to go wrong, he started to walk away. It was probably something of an embarrassment for him.' A spokesman for the celebrated chef said the pub had been sold on Thursday and that new owners were due to take over on Friday . The chef bought The Pear Tree in March 2011 with business partner Paul Clark as one of six pubs from The Maypole Group which went into administration. He was quickly criticised for removing all draught lagers from the bar and stocking just one bottled lager costing £4.20 a bottle. Cider drinkers had to make do with a super strong 7.3 per cent drink, but the menu had more than 40 red wines, with the top bottle costing £139.

Customers are also still being referred to one of White's other hotels - the nearby Rudloe Arms in Corsham, Wiltshire. Mr Chivers added: 'I've heard the place is losing £2,000 a week - that's just the rumours though. 'The place should be a goldmine but people aren't going in any more. 'The locals are sick of it.

"By . Stephen Johns . NHS patients will soon be treated by science graduates who have completed just two years of training. Under plans to relieve pressure on the Health Service, the ‘physician associates’ will work in local surgeries and casualty wards. While it can take doctors seven years to qualify, the associates will have just two years of intensive training and will not be registered with the General Medical Council or any other body. NHS patients will soon be treated by science graduates who have completed just two years of training. Under plans to relieve pressure on the Health Service, the 'physician associates' will work in local surgeries and casualty wards . They will carry out many of the same tasks as junior doctors, including examining patients, ordering and interpreting tests, admitting and discharging people to hospital and deciding on treatment. They will not be able to prescribe drugs but will prepare prescriptions for qualified doctors to sign off. Their employers may demand that they enrol on a voluntary register. The Government hopes that establishing a new profession – between nurses and doctors – will be a cheaper way of helping the NHS cope with rising demand from an ageing population. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said last night: ‘The NHS is treating record numbers of people. ‘That’s why we are growing the workforce further with a new class of medic so busy doctors have more time to care for patients. ‘I hope this will give a generation of talented graduates a gateway into medicine so they can contribute to our world-leading NHS.’ Two hundred associates are already working in the UK after the post was launched in 2003. Three training courses – in Aberdeen, Birmingham and London – together offer 105 places. This is set to double to around 225 between September and January as new courses open in Plymouth, Wolverhampton and Worcester. Birmingham’s course will expand. Four more courses are planned by autumn 2015 to increase the numbers further. The Department of Health says associates have been a ‘huge success’ in the United States where there are more than 80,000. They will carry out many of the same tasks as junior doctors, including examining patients, ordering and interpreting tests, admitting and discharging people to hospital and deciding on treatment . But there are some concerns that NHS managers might be tempted to cut costs by hiring physician associates who earn a salary of around £30,000 to £40,000 instead of regular doctors who are paid more than double that. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, told The Times: ‘We are concerned that, as physician assistants are cheaper to recruit and pay, hospitals managers may become reliant upon them to bring up staff numbers on their wards. ‘We have previously expressed our concern about the use of healthcare assistants in place of registered nurses, and it would appear that the medical profession is now heading down a similar path.’ Roger Goss of Patient Concern said: ‘We can be certain that some people in management will introduce the system as intended but you can guarantee that others will see this as a glorious opportunity to cut costs.’ Around 50 per cent of the associates will be on the frontline. As well as science graduates some will have previously trained as nurses,  physiotherapists or paramedics. The Department of Health says physician associates have very high rates of staying in the job, and have the support of a doctor at all times. Around 95 per cent of those who qualified as physician associates in the UK are still working here.","'Physician associates’ will work in local surgeries and casualty wards .

A batboat, built ahead of the 1966 Batman film, is going up for sale  later this month for around £40,000 . The boat was made for the 1966 Batman film, featuring Adam West and Burt Ward as Batman and Robin . Boat manufacturers Glastron Industries built two of the brightly coloured crafts and, while one was used for filming, another boat, which is now up for sale, toured the US promoting the film and TV series. Designers Mel Whitley and Robert Hammond based the boat on a Glastron V-174 but added a red flashing beacon, seats for both Batman and Robin at the front and a deck cover with a glowing Bat sign on the tail fin. The 17ft 10inch boat has a beam of 74 inches, a top speed of 40mph and seats two - ideal for Batman and his crime-fighting sidekick Robin. And although the boat is powered by a standard Mer-Cruiser L-6 stern drive, TV executives added a water squirter and a jet nozzle to make it look ‘nuclear-powered’. Size: Length - 17ft 10in.  Beam - 74in . Speed - 40pmh. Seats - Two . Power - L-6 stern drive. 'Nuclear power' effect made by jet water nozzle . Features - Bazooka hatches, twin wind screens, center console and glowing Bat-Signal on the tail fin . Based on - Glastron V-174 powerboat . Time taken to build - 31 days . Owner Mark Perkins bought it from the US three years ago and had it restored before shipping it over to the UK where he also owns a replica Batmobile. He said: 'Although I'm sad to see it go I think it will do really well at auction. It's been a pleasure to have it. 'We recently towed it through London for the Gumball Rally and the looks we get are hilarious. People can't believe what they're seeing.' Scores of comic and film fans are expected when the boat goes up for sale at the auction house, Historics, on August 30 at Brooklands near Weybridge in Surrey. The batboat idea first appeared in Detective Comics in April 1946, when it was provided by Scotland Yard to help Batman track down bad-guy Professor Moriarty. After appearing in the 1966 film and then the TV series, the boat also appeared in the animated series before a more high-tech version was brought in for Batman Returns, starring Michael Keaton. A further-developed craft was used in Batman Forever, starring Val Kilmer. Auctioneers are expecting huge interest from comic and film fans at the sale in Surrey on August 30 . The boat took 31 days to build and was converted by speedboat manufacturers Glastron Industries . Batman's most famous machine is the Batmobile, which first featured in the Detective Comics in May 1939. Originally a simple red sedan, it later started featuring a prominent bat motif. After a sleek, open-top red and black Lincoln Futura car (below) was used in the 1966 film and TV series, the car has become much more heavily-armoured in the recent films. The 'tumbler' version of the car (bottom) featured in the Dark Knight trilogy features automatic cannons, a rocket launcher, a jet engine and converts into a 'Bat-pod' motorbike when damaged. The 1966 film also featured the Batcopter, which was only slightly modified version of a normal helicopter as it was leased to movie-makers Fox for £500 a day. One of the aircraft's few features was rope ladder, which Batman climbed down to kick an exploding shark in one scene of the film. Many forms of Batman have also had a Batcycle, a heavily-armed, high-tech motorbike. In the comic book universe, the motorcyle is a modified street-bike with a 786cc liquid-cooled V-4 engine. It contains a computer-controlled carburettor and bulletproof wind-guard. The films have also featured the Batwing, an updated version of the original Batplane, seen in the comics. It is a custom-built air combat vehicle armed with miniguns and missiles.","Boat built for 1966 film and TV show with Adam West is going up for sale .

"By . Associated Press . and Snejana Farberov for Mail online . President Barack Obama has a lot on his plate this Labor Day weekend, beginning with a trio of Democratic Party fundraisers and culminating with the assistant White House chef's wedding. The commander-in-chief and the first family are attending Saturday the nuptials of Sam Kass, their longtime family chef and a close friend. Kass is being married to MSNBC host Alex Wagner at a farm-to-table restaurant in Westchester County, north of New York City. Scroll down for video . Guests of honor: President Barack Obama (L) and First Lady Michelle Obama (2nd R) with daughters Malia (C-R) and Sasha make their way to board Air Force One before departing from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland Saturday on their way to the wedding of his personal chef Sam Kass . First couple: After the taupe suit debacle a few days earlier, Mr Obama opted for a sober black two-piece number to match his wife's elegant dress . Back in black: The first family, including Sasha and Malia, all opted for black outfits for the wedding . Off to the party: Obama waves as he and Michelle Obama, left, and daughters Sasha, second from right, and Malia walk out of the White House in Washington and head to Marine One . Right on time: Air Force One carrying the first family seen at Westchester Countyl Airport in New York . The first family got off Air Force One and were ushered into the president's black limousine . Mode of transport: The limousine transporting the Obamas arrives at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills . Obama and Kass, who also serves as food policy counselor and regular presidential golfing partner, have a strong friendship. That bond was highlighted earlier this month when Obama went to Kass' Washington apartment for dinner amid the headlines from Iraq, Ukraine and Ferguson, Missouri. It's long been said that a president's most valuable commodity is his time. The fact that Obama spent five hours at Kass' apartment on one of the 30-something aide's final evenings as a bachelor attests to their rapport. Obama's rounds of golf are often his only other outings that last as long — and those games often include Kass. The first couple and daughters Malia and Sasha were attending the ceremony at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York. The presidential clan opted for an all-black attire, with elegant summer dresses for the Obama ladies and a conservative dark suit and tie for the commander-in-chief, who caused an uproar earlier this week by donning a tan two-piece number to a press conference. Happy couple: Sam Kass, 34 (left), the White House assistant chef, is marrying MSNBC host Alex Wagner, 36 (right) Top chef: Kass began cooking for the Obamas when the family lived in Chicago, and in 2009 they persuaded him to come to the White House . Fore-midable friend: The president often invites Kass to join him for a round of golf . It is shaping out to be a busy Labor Day weekend for Mr Obama, who attended three private fundraisers in Westchester and Newport, Rhode Island, on Friday, before returning to Washington DC for the night. On Monday, Obama will travel to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to attend Laborfest 2014 hosted by the labor union AFL-CIO. The union of Kass, 34, and Wagner, 36, also highlighted what some contend is too much togetherness between the media and the people they cover. Naturally, the guest list is expected to include staff from both the White House and the liberal-leaning cable news outlet, with people from both sides breaking bread at the same dinner table. Kass began preparing meals for the Obamas when the family lived in Chicago. They then persuaded him to come to the White House in 2009. Now he's one of their longest-serving aides. Besides preparing meals most weeknights, Kass is also a senior nutrition policy adviser and executive director of the first lady's anti-childhood obesity initiative. It's not unusual for presidents to attend or participate in weddings. Recent presidents, including Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, mostly attended weddings for family members. The weddings Obama has witnessed as president were all for top aides, not family. His sister and brother-in-law where married before Obama took office; his daughters are still in middle and high school. In sync: The Obama girls picked out black frocks embellished with silver and gold details to compliment their parents' evening attire .

Last October, Obama hosted a Rose Garden wedding for Pete Souza, the president's chief official photographer. In June 2012, Obama and his family attended the backyard wedding of the daughter of White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. The ceremony was held a block from the Obamas' home in Chicago and the Obama family walked over. In May 2008, George W. Bush was in office when his daughter, Jenna, married at the family ranch in Crawford, Texas. Bill Clinton was president in May 1994 when his brother-in-law, Tony Rodham, married Nicole Boxer, the daughter of Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. That union ended in divorce years later. Clinton also was best man when his brother, Roger, married in Dallas in March 1994. Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, attended the August 1984 wedding of their daughter Patti Davis to yoga instructor Paul Grilley in a 17-minute ceremony at the posh Bel-Air Hotel. Reagan spoke one line in the ceremony, responding ""Her mother and I do"" when asked who would give away the bride. The couple divorced years later.","Dressed in all black, the Obamas jetted off to Westchester, New York, to celebrate the wedding of chef Sam Kass and MSNBC host Alex Wagner .

"By . Alex Greg for MailOnline . A central Florida man has been charged with murder in the death of his baby daughter, who authorities say was left in the man's truck for at least four hours. Brevard County prosecutors officially charged 31-year-old Steven Darnell Lillie on Friday with third-degree felony murder, manslaughter and leaving a child under the age of six unsupervised in a motor vehicle. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Murder charge: Florida man Steven Lillie, 31, has been charged with third-degree murder following an investigation by Rockledge police . Tragic discovery: Father Steven Lillie discovered the body of his baby girl in his car after leaving her behind in this parking lot while he went to work . Florida Today reports that Lillie was initially charged with aggravated manslaughter. Steven Lillie opened his truck around 4:45pm Monday and discovered his baby daughter unresponsive in the back of the vehicle. The infant had been left strapped in her car seat inside the closed vehicle in the sun for almost five hours. Witnesses told Channel 9 Eyewitness News that Lillie was supposed to have dropped his daughter off at her grandmother's house on his way to work but apparently forgot. Lillie arrived at the Fraternal Order of Police telemarketing office at 566 Barton Boulevard just after midday, as temperatures rose to the high 80s. The car was a black Dodge pickup, reports Florida Today. The parking lot outside a strip mall has no shade. Inside the truck, the heat would have risen to 100 degrees, reports Eyewitness News. 'The temperature would have been brutal,' Rockledge police Lieutenant Donna Seyferth said. Lillie discovered his daughter almost five hours later and his screams alerted his coworkers that something was terribly wrong. In a 911 call, Lillie told a dispatcher, 'She's been in the car for hours, and I absolutely forgot about her. She's not alive.' Fatal error: Police say a disruption in Lillie's usual routine caused him to forget that he hadn't dropped his daughter off with her caregiver before driving to work . Dangerous heat: The temperature rose to the high 80s Monday afternoon, and inside the sealed car would have reached up to 100 degrees . 'The child was unresponsive when the officers arrived. They took as many life-saving measures as they could. Ambulance and rescue did the same, but the child did not survive,' Lieutenant Donna Seyferth told Channel 9. According to WKMG, some disruption in Lillie's usual routine caused him to forget he had not dropped the baby off with her caregiver. About four hours later, a family member asked him about the girl, prompting him to rush outside where he made the awful discovery. Witnesses told WKMG that Lillie was so distraught by the discovery that he collapsed. The baby was rushed to Wuesthoff Hospital but doctors were unable to revive her. Lillie's attorney, Jennifer Mostert, issued a statement on behalf of Lillie, which read, . 'Mr. Lillie and his family are disappointed that the State has elected to file formal charges against him for the accidental death of his daughter Anna on June 16th, 2014. This family has suffered an inconceivable loss, compounded by his almost immediate arrest and now by the filing of formal charges.'","Steven Lillie has been charged with third-degree felony murder in the death of his nine-month-old daughter .

Shocking new footage has captured the careless actions of motorists and pedestrians who are gambling with their lives by ignoring the road rules and warning signs and interfering with the new light rail network. One of the videos obtained by Daily Mail Australia shows a taxi driver turning at an intersection before slamming on the brakes to avoid colliding with the tram at Broadbeach on the Gold Coast. In another piece of footage from Tuesday, a man is seen walking beside a tram across a bridge in the suburb of Southport, completely ignoring the 'no walking' signs. Scroll down for videos .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . A hospital trust has lost the personal data of tens of thousands of patients who were treated by paramedics. Around 42,000 electronic copies of handwritten patient notes have gone missing at the East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) NHS Trust headquarters in Beechdale, Nottingham. It is believed the data contained patient report forms of those treated by EMAS paramedics from September 2012 and November 2012. Date of tens of thousands of patients who were treated by paramedics from the East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust have gone missing . Chief Executive Sue Noyes has apologised for the 'extremely unfortunate' incident and said there is a possibility that the data cartridge could still be in the building. She believes the data can only be read using specific hardware at the site, which is no longer being made. She added that the incident had been referred to the Information Commissioner's Office, an independent body which monitors data safety. She said: 'We take our responsibility for the security and confidentiality of the information we record and store very seriously, and express sincere apologies for a patient data loss incident which we have reported to the Information Commissioner this week. 'We are certain the data can only be read via specific hardware which we have in our premises, and which is no longer in production i.e. it is obsolete. 'Therefore it is unlikely that the information stored on the missing cartridge can be viewed by anyone outside of the organisation.' It is believed the data, stored at the trust's headquarters in Beechdale, Nottingham, contained patient report forms of those treated by EMAS paramedics from September 2012 to November 2012 . EMAS said it has already launched its own internal investigation into how the data went missing. The ambulance service was criticised last month after its latest response figures showed ambulances failed to reach some of the most seriously ill patients on time. Paramedics should strive to get to at least three quarters of the most critical cases within eight minutes, but EMAS only reached 71.3 per cent of these patients on time in 2013/14.

"By . Emily Crane for Daily Mail Australia . In the dead of the night 70 years ago, more than 1,000 Japanese men stormed the barbed wire perimeter fences of Cowra prisoner of war camp in central NSW. Armed with improvised weapons including baseball bats and sharpened kitchen knives, hundreds of Japanese prisoners overcame machine gun posts in what would become the biggest POW escape of World War II. The mass breakout at the detention camp on August 5, 1944 resulted in a 10-day manhunt as Australian soldiers and police searched for hundreds of armed escapees roaming the Cowra countryside, 300km west of Sydney. This Japanese prisoner of war was one of hundreds who were injured or killed when they tried to escape from the Cowra camp in central NSW in August 1944 - it was to become the biggest breakout of World War II . Japanese prisoners who overcame the machine gun fire of Australian soldiers threw hundreds blankets and clothes over the camp's barbed wire surroundings in a bid to escape . The mass breakout on August 5, 1944 resulted in a 10-day manhunt as Australian soldiers and police searched for hundreds of armed escapees roaming the Cowra countryside, 300km west of Sydney . A total of 359 Japanese prisoners escaped and the death toll reached 231 in the days following, including 31 suicides and 12 who perished in huts they had set on fire themselves. Four Australian soldiers were killed in the breakout, including Privates Benjamin Gower Hardy, Ralph Jones and Charles Henry Shepherd. Lieutenant Harry Doncaster was killed when he was ambushed during the rounding up of passengers. Japanese man Teruo Murakami, who took part in the infamous Cowra breakout, returned to NSW for the 70th anniversary earlier this month as survivors and descendants gathered in Cowra for a memorial service. Soldiers watched on as Japanese prisoners who lost their lives were buried. A total of 359 Japanese prisoners escaped Cowra and the death toll reached 231 in the days following . This Japanese prisoner ended his own life during the Cowra breakout to avoid being captured. The kitchen knife he used was still clutched in his hand . He was among the 2,200 Japanese held captive in the prison, alongside nearly 20,000 other prisoners that Allied forces had captured in countries across the world. Mr Marakami's translator and historian Mami Yamada said despite being the biggest breakout of World War II, many Japanese didn't know about it. 'In Japan, maybe more than 95 per cent of people do not know even the name of this event,' she told the ABC. A number of knives and improvised weapons were found in the compound immediately after the mass escape . Baseball bats, iron piping and axe handles were among the weapons used by prisoners . Prisoners used baseball gloves as protection for when they climbed the barbed wire fences surrounding the camp. These gloves were found scattered in and around the camp . Blankets were thrown over the camp's fences as extra precaution against the barbed wire . Gloves handmade out of leather were found around the barbed wire surroundings of the camp . Some prisoners were killed trying to climb over the barbed wire as the escaped in the early hours of the morning . A number of huts were destroyed by fire as Japanese prisoners set them alight. Twelve people perished in these huts . 'I have been trying in the last 21 years to let the Japanese people know that it was happening like this.' Japanese prisoners chose to strike at 2am on August 5 - the day many were due to be transferred to different camps. Screaming prisoners stormed the camp's  fences and historical photos show how they used blankets and clothing to protect themselves from the barbed wire. Four Australian soldiers were killed during the breakout including Privates Benjamin Gower Hardy, Ralph Jones and Charles Henry Shepherd and Lieutenant Harry Doncaster.

The buildings at the bottom are the camp headquarters and include recreation huts, mess huts and sleeping huts . New Australian recruits were issued rifles and equipments at the Cowra POW camp . Private O Treacy pictured standing guard in a tower at the Cowra camp . 'Many escapees chose to take their own lives rather than be recaptured,' historical writer David Hobson said. 'Two threw themselves under an oncoming train, while many hanged themselves. On their recapture, some pleaded to be shot. Others surrendered peacefully. At least two prisoners were shot by local civilians and several by military personnel.' A Military Court of Inquiry investigated the incident and the Prime Minister at the time, John Curtin, read the findings in September 1944. Various media reported the escape of prisoners from Cowra and the widespread manhunt it required to track them down . This press cutting from the Sydney Daily Mirror reported that all Japanese prisoners who escaped had been captured . The investigation found conditions at the camp were in accordance with the International Geneva Convention and there had been no complaints from prisoners regarding their treatment in the lead up to the breakout. Mr Curtin’s statement also suggested that the attack was characterised by 'a suicidal disregard of life'. For 50 years following World War II, the most famous prison escape was out of Nazi Germany’s Stalag III camp in March 1944. Allied prisoners spent months digging tunnels out of the camp and the attempt was immortalised in the 1963 movie The Great Escape.

"By . Frank Coletta For Daily Mail Australia . Deputy Liberal Leader Julie Bishop has flagged a possible end to the Budget impasse by declaring the Coalition Government should be prepared to compromise on key measures which are blocking its move through a hostile Senate. The Abbott administration has struggled to win the necessary support since it was delivered by Joe Hockey back in May and senior ministers have begun sending strong signals that 'adjustments' will be made. However, Julie Bishop would not go as far as detailing what those changes could be. Scroll down for video . Deputy Liberal Leader and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop believes compromising with all the other parties can get the contentious Budget through the Senate . 'In negotiations with the Senate, including Labor, the Greens and the cross-benchers, if they've got constructive suggestions, we should consider them,' she told ABC radio. Among the biggest stumbling blocks have been the proposed $7 GP co-payment, family benefit changes and university reforms. 'That's what negotiations should be; finding constructive ways to work together to achieve the over-riding necessity of fixing the budget line,' Ms Bishop added. A tough sell. Prime Minister Tony Abbott (left) and his Treasurer Joe Hockey (right) have been urged by Coalition colleagues to water down the Budget to try and convince a hostile Senate . The Budget proved so unpopular that Tony Abbott's standing as preferred prime minister dropped to historic low levels immediately after it was unveiled, along with a battering to the Coalition's primary and two-party preferred support. Finance Minister Mathias Cormann, who was the other man spotted by cameras enjoying cigars with Joe Hockey after the budget was delivered, agrees with a growing number of disgruntled Coalition colleagues. Where there's smoke there's ire. Back in May, Treasurer Joe Hockey and Finance Minister rejoiced in the Budget delivery with cigars but a hostile Senate has cut short those celebrations . 'We are realists. We do know that the Liberal National parties only have 33 senators in the Australian Senate,' he told the ABC. 'We need six cross-bench senators or others to join with us to pass legislation in the Senate. 'It was always obvious there would have to be an adjustment here, an adjustment there, if we wanted to get some of those budget measures through the Parliament.' Health Minister Peter Dutton has indicated one of the most contentious reforms, to establish a $7 GP co-payment, could be altered. He believes talks with the cross-benchers have been 'productive'. 'I'm hopeful that the Government can do a deal in relation to the GP co-payment, because there's certainly a lot of optimism from the senators - that's my assessment,' he told ABC NewsRadio. Independent South Australian Senator Nick Xenophon (right) has all but dashed the hopes of senior government ministers like Peter Dutton (Minister for Health) that there's reason for optimism the Budget will get through with 'amendments' only. The Senator says only 'major change' will win his support . For all the optimism from Coalition ranks that adjustments could win the necessary support, a few words of warning have been delivered by key Independent Senator Nick Xenophon. In fact, he has made it clear that only major changes will win his backing. 'When the government talks about an adjustment here, an adjustment there, it reminds me of going to the chiropractor - whereas, in fact, I think this budget needs some general anaesthetic and some radical surgery,' he told AM.","The Deputy Liberal Leader flags compromises with all other parties .

"The CSIRO, the government science research organisation, is shutting down its bowel cancer and neurological research programs, due to budget cuts to the organisation. CSIRO announced the closure of the research programs, which investigate treatment and early detection strategies for colo-rectal and bowel cancers, as well as neurological illnesses such as dementia and Alzheimer's. The program closures result from cuts to CSIRO funding announced in the most recent federal budget, which stripped $115 million of funding from CSIRO, forcing a a 20 percent reduction of staff between June 2013 and June 2015. CSIRO research scientist Dr Glenn Marsh is working with live Ebola samples at a high containment laboratory in Geelong. His department will suffer eight redundancies . 'It's not a throwaway line about making CSIRO more efficient, these budget cuts directly result in shutting down areas of research, and we want our elected representatives to be more transparent about that,' CSIRO Staff Association Secretary Sam Popovski told Daily Mail Australia. 'You're essentially down to the bare bones, there's not a lot left to cut. We want to make people making these decisions accountable as to what happens as a result.' Due to funding cuts last year, there were 513 redundancies at CSIRO, reducing their total workforce from 6,500 by eight percent, to 5,964 in June 2013. It is estimated that another 750 jobs will be cut across the organisation in the next financial year, meaning CSIRO will suffer a 20 percent reduction of staff in two years. Overall CSIRO will lose 20 percent of its staff in two years, necessitating the closure of the bowel cancer and neurological illness research programs . Bowel Cancer Australia CEO Julien Wiggins said the closure of CSIRO's bowel and rectal cancer research program was 'a step backwards', especially given that bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in Australia. 'Any cuts to bowel cancer are of serious concern. 15,000 people are diagnosed each year, and funding to bowel cancer research currently doesn't reflect the burden of disease accurately in this country,' he told Daily Mail Australia. He stated that while bowel cancer accounts for around 13 percent of all cancer diagnosis, research funding has typically not reflected the burden of disease, receiving between 7 and 10 percent of NHMRC funding for cancer research and treatment. While there are other government, not-for-profit and commercial groups engaged in bowel cancer research, Mr Wiggins pointed to CSIRO's involvement in developing a blood test for bowel cancer that is currently being piloted in the Blue Mountains for people who cannot or will not carry out screening with the recommended stool test. 'It's really a sad day for bowel cancer.' The areas of CSIRO that will suffer job cuts have not been fully announced, but are set to include 40 jobs across both the colorectal cancer and neurosciences research areas, and eight full-time researchers from Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong who investigate bio-security threats to humans that can be transmitted from animals.

Mr Popovski said the morale at CSIRO is 'very despondent'. 'These latest cuts to CSIRO are particularly illogical and short-sighted,' he said. 'We want to make people making these decisions accountable.'","CSIRO forced to close down research programs into bowel cancer and neurological diseases .

When the circus  was contacted by local media about the incident, management claimed it was the girl's own fault because she had got too near to the snake despite being warned to take care. But video footage shows  that far from approaching the snake, she had actually tried to squirm back into her seat to get away from it a second before it lashed out and fastened its teeth onto her arm. Instead of taking time to see if she was okay, the snake charmer ignored the injury and carried on moving along the front row of the audience showing the snake to other young children and risking more children being bitten. Before the attack, performers showed the audience the snakes, which were taken out of a wooden box on stage. They even dangled the reptiles over their heads from the stage . After the girl was bitten the circus performer whisks the snake away, showing the snake to other children . Management claimed it was the girl's fault because she had got too near despite being warned to take care . Terrified: The girl bursts into tears as her grandmother comforts her following her ordeal . The young girl meanwhile was rushed out by her grandmother Adela, 63, and taken to the local hospital because they feared she might have been poisoned. Hospital staff that contacted the circus were told it was just a python and therefore non-venomous. She was given a tetanus injection and the wound was disinfected and bandaged, according to Constantin Damian, spokesperson of Satu Mare Emergency Hospital. The grandparents, who are furious that the circus blamed their granddaughter, have filed a complaint to police, who are investigating. Hospital staff that contacted the circus were told it was just a python and therefore non-venomous. File picture .","Loredana Diaconescu, 12, was sat in front row for circus during attack .

"By . Sarah Hartley For The Mail On Sunday . He is unflinching in describing autopsies in his bestselling crime novels.  So it’s a surprise that Peter James is squeamish. But the creator of the Detective Superintendent Roy Grace series – who has attended real-life dissections for research – says his own operation for carpal tunnel syndrome was ‘stomach-churning’. The ten-minute surgery, carried out under local anaesthetic, was, however, life-changing for the 65-year-old, who had struggled in agony through book signings on international publicity tours. Hand horror: Author Peter James couldn't bear to watch his carpal tunnel operation - but is typing at full speed again . When diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years ago, Peter had upped his fitness regime, running two to five miles every day. But that stopped last May when his other passion, racing cars, resulted in a nasty accident which doctors believe may have triggered carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a common condition that causes pain, numbness, tingling and a dull ache in the hand, fingers and arm. ‘I rolled my race car at Brands Hatch and bust three ribs,’ he says. ‘Initially my left leg was in pain and then my right leg, with pain running down my fingertips into the right hand where I’d wrenched at the steering wheel. I didn’t know then but I had popped some discs in my back too. ‘It was only two days later when friends began to say “we’re glad we’re not reading your obituary” that I realised how serious it had been. I felt a wreck and very strange for two weeks afterwards.’ With 14 million books sold worldwide in 36 languages, it was little wonder that Peter decided to press on with his tours. ‘I . was in agony in Barcelona and painkillers weren’t doing anything for . the pain in my legs and arm, so I couldn’t sleep. When I got home, I . visited acupuncturist Mark Andrews in Brighton and within an hour of . leaving his clinic, 90 per cent of the pain had gone.’ But the relief was short-lived and a book tour of Ireland saw Peter with a ‘constant burning agony in both legs’ which left him ‘hobbling round like an old git’. He adds: ‘Then I had to go on tour in New York and I was in such pain after the flight that I was wheeled through immigration. The hotel concierge recommended an osteopath, who was brilliant and again got rid of most of my pain.’ Back home in Sussex, Peter persevered with his fitness regime – swimming, biking and running. The author of 25 novels also continued with his strict daily writing, working on Want You Dead, his tenth Roy Grace novel. But typing was increasingly tricky as numbness crept into his right hand. Now the medical profession did some detective work. He saw neurosurgeon Dan Plev at The London Clinic, who referred Peter for a nerve conductivity test. It sent electric shocks from the shoulder to both right and left hand. If the nerves conducted equally in both hands, the pain was not due to the slipped discs but to the median nerve travelling through the carpal tunnel. ‘The neurologist said I had carpal tunnel syndrome as badly as he had ever seen it. Left as it was, I would experience numb fingertips which would increasingly impact on my writing. I already couldn’t feel the space bar on the keyboard and had no feeling in my thumb.’ Carpal tunnel syndrome is caused by . compression of the nerve that controls feeling and movement in the . hands. The carpal tunnel is a narrow passage in the wrist comprising a . band of tissue and small bones which act as a pulley system for tendons, . enabling the fingers to bend. CTS occurs in about 50 per cent of . pregnant women and is more prevalent in those who use their hands . repetitively such as musicians, hairdressers and typists. It can also be . hereditary. Surgery is recommended for severe cases if symptoms last . more than six months or other treatments such as wearing a splint or . taking anti-inflammatories are ineffective. The carpal ligament is cut . to ease pressure on the nerve. Peter . was treated by consultant orthopaedic, hand and upper limb surgeon . Elliot Sorene of St John and St Elizabeth Hospital, North London. But as he began to cut, Peter became visibly unwell. ‘Mr Sorene asked me, “Don’t you go to lots of autopsies?” I replied yes, but not my own. A screen was put up so I couldn’t see, but I could feel tiny electric currents as he was moving the nerves around and I heard crunching. Angela Rippon told me she had the same procedure and watched it from a mirror above the bed. I couldn’t have managed that. ‘It took ten minutes – I went in at 7am and by 8.45 I was being driven home, typing emails all the way. I was determined to not let it stop  me writing.’ Wasn’t that ill-advised? ‘No – my surgeon said just don’t do anything that hurts – and it didn’t.’ One month later, Peter is back to full speed on the writing front, although fastening shirt buttons and winding a watch are tricky. ‘I still have numbness in the thumb and forefinger but it is improving and it may take up to a year to return to normal,’ he says. ‘Touch wood, I have no symptoms in my left hand. Opening a bottle of wine is difficult as you need strength in both hands. But maybe the answer is champagne.’ peterjames.com .","Author Peter James was diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome .

"By . Louise Cheer . A serial rapist broke into a celebratory dance after he was released from a West Australian prison, despite a judge saying he was at high risk of re-offending. Patrick Alfred Dennis Comeagain is now a free man and could not contain his joy while pushing a trolley of his belongings through the automatic doors of Casuarina Prison with a smile plastered across his face. On Thursday, Justice Ralph Simmons approved the 41-year-old's released into the community, but imposed a strict 10-year supervision order on the man - requiring him to wear a GPS tracker, comply to a strict curfew and not to have contact with a child under the age of 16. Scroll down for video . Patrick Alfred Dennis Comeagain has spent 14 years in prison, including time for raping a nine-year-old girl and two women . Comeagain has spent 14 years - most of his adult life - in prison and claims to have sexually assaulted 41 people, including men, women and children. He spent six of those years as a declared sex offender after the introduction of the Western Australia's tough sex offender laws. Nine News reported he was convicted of sexually assaulting a nine-year-old girl in 1994. He raped a woman five weeks after being released on parole and 37 days after that he raped another woman in her home. Justice Simmons imposed 43 conditions on Comeagain and said although there was a risk of re-offending, he wished the 41-year-old well. Comeagain thanked Justice Simmons and said he would make the most of the opportunity. He walked free through the automatic doors at Casuarina Prison with a smile on his face . His release was ordered on Thursday with 43 conditions under a strict 10-year supervision order . Western Australia Police Minister Liza Harvey said she strongly disagreed with Comeagain's release. 'The court has decided to do this, but the DDP [Director of Public Prosecutions] opposed it, police oppose it,' she told Nine News. 'We are bound by the decision of the court. 'I can only imagine [his victims'] horror in seeing this person released. I share it.' Justice Simmons let him walk free despite there being a high risk of him re-offending . Comeagain was raised in the Mullewa and Geraldton regions of Western Australia. Comeagain has had five episodes of serious sexual offending, starting in 1987 when he was 15. He has also committed offences of a non-sexual nature. Previous annual reviews of his dangerous sex offender status, it has been noted there had been very few occasions following his release from prison when Comeagain had not re-offended shortly after.

"By . Nick Constable for The Mail on Sunday . A mother booking her desperately ill son on a dream Disney trip was told it would cost £30,000 to provide a fridge for his medicines. Justine Sharples, whose three-year-old son Matthew needs 24-hour care, was given an initial price of £4,563 by Disneyland Paris for her family’s four-day holiday. But when she asked for a room fridge – vital for helping to keep Matthew alive – the price rocketed to £34,026. Scroll down for video . Holiday: Justine and John Sharples with their three-year-old son Matthew, second left, and his brothers . Mrs Sharples says Disney insisted the cost was high because the only accommodation at the resort with a fridge was their Sleeping Beauty suite, ‘used by celebrities’. She says she was offered the use of a fridge in the Disneyland Hotel’s reception but explained this was impractical as she has to get up three times nightly to administer drugs and catheterise Matthew. And when she asked to bring her own fridge, or pay extra for one in a standard room, she says her request was refused because it was ‘against hotel policy’. Mrs Sharples said: ‘Disney is everything Matthew loves. He so wants to see Buzz Lightyear and the other characters. We don’t know how long we’ve got him for because his condition, called PUV, is life-threatening. Attraction: Justine Sharples, whose three-year-old son Matthew needs 24-hour care, was given an initial price of £4,563 by Disneyland Paris (pictured). But when she asked for a room fridgem the price rocketed to £34,026 . ‘The fridge is essential because we have to store two litres of special feed and three litres of cooled boiled water every day. That’s in addition to all his drugs.’ Mrs Sharples, 42, husband John, a 40-year-old cycling coach, and children Luke, 15, Zak, eight, Joshua, six, and Matthew, planned to stay at Disneyland Paris in November. The family, from Punnetts Town, East Sussex, have been given a £500 grant by the charity Family Fund, which helps provide holidays for seriously ill children. Matthew’s illness is a congenital anomaly causing a blockage in the urethra leading to further complications, including, in Matthew’s case, acute renal failure and a damaged bladder and colon. He is unable to eat normally and survives on baby milk pumped through a tube directly into his stomach. Family: Mrs Sharples (pictured with her family) says Disney insisted the cost was high because the only accommodation at the resort with a fridge was their Sleeping Beauty suite, ‘used by celebrities’ His life depends on a 12-times-daily cocktail of drugs – all of which must be refrigerated – and his mother has to catheterise him every two hours. When The Mail on Sunday contacted Disney, a spokeswoman said there had been a ‘misunderstanding’ with hotel booking staff. Within hours, the Sharples were assured a fridge would be provided – along with complimentary VIP tickets. The spokeswoman said: ‘Mrs Sharples has booked two rooms with Disneyland Paris. One will come with a portable fridge to accommodate medicine for her son Matthew. ‘We sincerely regret any misunderstanding that occurred. Disneyland Paris works with around 80 different wish-giving associations across Europe and we warmly welcome children who require special care.’","Justine Sharples given initial price of £4,563 for holiday at Disneyland Paris .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . A family of four fell ‘horrifically’ ill during a Spanish summer holiday which left two young daughters in hospital, one in critical condition. The Smith family, from Bishop Auckland in County Durham, travelled to the 3* Azuline, Coral Beach resort in Ibiza in June, but say the trip turned into every family’s ‘worst nightmare’ when all of them fell ill and two-year-old daughters Olivia and Hannah were hospitalised for days as they battled E.coli. Dad, Stuart, who was made redundant on his return to work, was also diagnosed with having contracted the bacteria. Nightmare: A holiday to Ibiza turned into disaster for the Smith family when they contracted E.Coli . Critical: Hannah spent 21 days in Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle and needed dialysis . The toddlers have now been diagnosed with haemolytic uraemia syndrome – a condition related to E.Coli which can cause kidney failure due to a breakdown of red blood cells – and distraught parents Stuart and Nicola have instructed expert international illness lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate what caused them to fall ill and to help secure their daughters funds for on-going treatment. Worry: Nicola checks in on her daughter Hannah in hospital, pictured holding Olivia who also fell ill on the Ibiza holiday . To make matters worse, Stuart was made redundant on his return from his job as a production worker in manufacturing, as he took time off to care for his daughters, which affected his redundancy score negatively. The family . arrived at the 3* Azuline resort, in the Playa Las Cana area of Ibiza on June 1 for an 11 day break, . but within days all of them began suffering from symptoms of sickness, . diarrhoea and stomach cramps. Stuart, . Olivia and Hannah were all diagnosed as suffering with E.coli 0157 on . their return and the girls symptoms were so severe that they were . admitted to the Royal Victoria Hospital in Newcastle. Olivia, . who was two in July, was discharged after six days but Hannah, who . turns three at the end of the month, spent 21 days in hospital and . needed dialysis to help her kidneys function properly. Stuart, . 38, said: 'The last few weeks have been like our worst nightmare coming . to life as we have had to watch our little girls fight for their lives . in hospital. 'The . last thing we imagined was that we would all fall so horrifically ill. We did notice that some of the food that should have been chilled was . left at room temperature and some of it was undercooked, but we tried to . be as careful as possible. 'The . worst thing now is not knowing whether the girls have been left with . permanent kidney problems as a result. We just cannot believe how going . on holiday has turned all of our lives upside down. 'I . lost my job and Nicola is a housewife so on top of our worries about . the girls, we are also concerned about what the future will hold for us . financially. It is a combination of anemia caused by the destruction of red blood cells, kidney failure and a low platelet count. Acquired from contaminated food or water, the disease predominately affects children. Has a 5%-10% mortality rate, with most recovering without major consequences. However in the most serious of cases, dialysis and life-long renal replacement therapy may be needed to treat kidney disease. 'We . just want answers about what caused the illness and to know that if . hygiene failings are found, steps are taken to rectify them and prevent . anyone else suffering in the same horrible way as we have.' Clare . Pearson, a specialist International Personal injury lawyer at Irwin . Mitchell who has now contacted Jet2.com to notify the tour operator that . legal action is being considered said: 'The Smith family suffered a . horrible ordeal on their holiday which became so serious for Olivia and .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . Mexico launched a special 5,000-strong police force Friday to combat industrial, farm and business crime that has extended throughout the country's economy, strangling commerce in some regions. Drug gangs have long penetrated some Mexican mining and agricultural sectors, but officials now reveal that everyone from fishermen to tourist resorts to banana growers have been hit by the wave of extortion, kidnapping and thefts by the gangs. In some cases, like the western state of Michoacan, the cartels and gangs cut down trade so much that 'even the barbershops weren't serving customers. The whole social fabric broke down,' said National Security Commissioner Monte Alejandro Rubido. Scroll down for video . The Gendarmerie is made of 5,000 members who have never served with Mexico's existing police force which is regarded as highly suspect and very corrupt . The heavily armed officers have been trained by the Mexican army while its senior officers have been instructed by police forces in the US, Colombia, Chile and Spain . The Gendarmerie will be deployed in areas blighted by organised crime where ordinary people live in fear . The new force, known as the gendarmerie, is made up of fresh recruits whose average age is 28 and who have never served on another police force. Its officers were trained by the Mexican army and its commanding officers got training from police forces from Colombia, Chile, Spain, France and the US . Gendarmerie members will be a division of the federal police and will be sent to areas where there is an organised crime presence and there is no economic activity because production is being restricted by the criminals. 'The officers of the new gendarme force ... are trained to serve the population on foot, and on horseback, in rural, urban, tourist and border zones,' President Enrique Pena Nieto said. Most Mexicans had long been aware that parts of the country had such problems, such as Michoacan, where the Knights Templar cartel told farmers when to plant and took a cut on every product and even ran the iron ore industry. In the northern border state of Tamaulipas, demands for businesses to pay protection money have been common. Such is the level of control exercised by the drug cartels that the godfathers order farmers what they should plant and fixing the price they are willing to pay . Fruit harvesters have been kidnapped by the cartels who have demanded bribes and payoffs, but this year the military have been deployed to great effect . One cartel has been forcing fishermen to hand over their catches for a fraction of their value before selling them on at full price at the fish markets, keeping the profit . The government has even hired 2,000 former vigilantes, providing them with guns and uniforms, describing them as a new 'Rural Force' Mexico's national statistics institute estimated that in 2012, the latest figures available, that crime cost the country about $16.5 billion, or 1.3 percent of GDP. But the breadth of problems that authorities have now acknowledged is staggering. Luis Montoya Morelia, the head of federal police in Tamaulipas, said the hyper-violent Zetas cartel had threatened fishermen on the Gulf coast, forcing them to sell their catch to the cartel for just 7 cents per kilogram (3 cents per pound). The gang would then apparently take the fish to market and sell it for full price. Rubido said cattle ranchers in southern Mexico were buying sorghum abroad because nobody would rent harvesting machines to sorghum growers in Tamaulipas, apparently fearing the cartels would burn or steal the equipment. This year, under police and military protection for every stage from harvest and packing to distribution, Tamaulipas was able to bring in a bumper crop. Banana growers in the steamy southern Gulf state of Tabasco also have come under gang pressure. When the banana harvesting season comes around, extortion and kidnappings rise to some of the highest rates in Mexico, Rubido said. On the southern Pacific coast, gangs threaten the resorts of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, though Rubido did not offer specifics on the threat there. Michoacan offers the most extreme example of the cartels' Mafia-style control, especially with the region's main crop, limes. 'The planters, pickers, packing houses and distributors all had to pay a cut for the right to operate or ship to the criminals,' Rubido said. It wasn't immediately clear how the small gendarmerie force will be used to attack such widespread problems. The task to date has largely fallen to soldiers and marines, whose tactics have spawned continuing complaints. But it doesn't appear the new gendarmes will be numerous enough to replace military units in a broad range of law enforcement roles. 'It is naive to think that just by creating a new force with people who haven't been in the police before ... things are going to change,' said Miguel Moguel, a researcher at Mexico's Fundar think tank. 'We have been creating new police forces for decades- armored police, ""incorruptible, super-trained police,"" but with disappointing results,' he said. This year, the government even took the unprecedented step of providing guns, uniforms and salaries for former vigilantes in Michoacan, recruiting about 2,000 of them into the newly created 'Rural Force.' But critics say that force has little oversight and training. Mexico hopes the gendarmerie will help break the cartels' economic stranglehold, but Rubido said it won't be easy. 'Many times they have attacked with grenades,' he said of the cartels. One of the major new jobs of the new police force will be to protect farmers from the drug cartels allowing them to cultivate their crops without being molested . In the past, Mexico has created several 'incorruptible super police forces' although the results of the previous experiments have been incredibly disappointing . The new Gendarmerie will assume some of the roles currently carried out by the Mexican army and marines although with just 5,000 officers, they will still require help . Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said: 'They are trained to serve the population on foot, and on horseback, in rural, urban, tourist and border zones.' Miguel Moguel, said: ''It is naive to think that just by creating a new force with people who haven't been in the police before ... things are going to change,'","The new federal force is made of officers who have never served with Mexico's discredited law enforcement agencies .

"By . Gemma Mullin for MailOnline . The rusty Falklands frigate HMS Plymouth on which Argentinians surrendered has set sail for the last time after it was consigned to the scrapyard. The Royal Navy ship set sail from Birkenhead docks in Liverpool at around 7.30am this morning and is thought to be heading to a port in Turkey to be turned into scrap. Campaigners have battled to save the Type-12 frigate, which served in the Far East before its role in the Falklands War in 1982, for 25 years since it was decommissioned in 1988. Scroll down for video . Royal Navy ship, HMS Plymouth, pictured leaving Birkenhead docks in Liverpool where it has been moored for over a decade, served in the Far East before its role in the Falklands War in 1982. It set sail at 7.30am this morning for its final journey and is thought to be heading to a port in Turkey where it will be scrapped . In . its glory days, HMS Plymouth, which was launched at Devonport Dockyard . in Plymouth on July 20, 1959, sailed to South Georgia with the Royal Marines . and SAS aboard where she provided naval gunfire support in the . Falklands War. Argentine forces also surrendered - signing the . document in the HMS Plymouth wardroom . Members of the HMS Plymouth Trust, set up in 2012, had raised money to launch a legal action to have the ship ‘arrested’ and prevent it from leaving Vittoria Dock, where she has been left to rust for years. Peel Ports, which owns the docks, said it had no ‘practical choice’ but to scrap the vessel and said it would not confirm its final destination. The firm has issued a statement which said it is ‘very sympathetic to the historical significance of the vessel’ but that no public or private body has come forward with a feasible plan to maintain, restore or remove her during the past seven years. It added: ‘We have no expertise in the preservation and restoration of historic ships and given the fact that she is deteriorating further at berth, the group feels, reluctantly, we have no practical choice but to dispose of her responsibly.’ The 2,150 ton vessel, the last Rothesay class type 12 Frigate afloat, was launched on July 20,1959 at Devonport Dockyard in Plymouth by Viscountess Astor and after sea trials and fitting out, commissioned into the Royal Navy on May 11, 1961. She sailed to South Georgia with Royal Marines and SAS aboard in 1982 where she took part in the Falklands War. After engaging the enemy, the ship provided naval gunfire support, and the Argentinian garrison at Grytviken then surrendered with Lieutenant Commander Alfredo Astiz signing the surrender document in the wardroom of HMS Plymouth. Members of the HMS Plymouth Trust, set up in 2012, had raised money to launch a legal action to have the ship ‘arrested’ and prevent it from leaving Vittoria Dock at Birkenhead in Liverpool (pictured), where she has been left to rust for several years . Peel Ports, which owns the docks, said it had no 'practical choice' but to scrap the type-12 vessel and said it would not confirm what its final destination would be . The ship went on to provide cover for the aircraft carriers and amphibious vessels and was the first vessel to enter San Carlos Water where she was attacked and damaged herself by five Mirage fighter jets. After returning to Rosyth for repairs in July 1982, she had steamed 34,000 miles, fired over nine hundred 4.5 inch shells and destroyed five enemy aircraft. Peel Ports said the Historic Warships Preservation Trust rented a berth for HMS Plymouth in 1990 within the East Float, Birkenhead from the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company but when the Trust went into liquidation in 2006, HMS Plymouth became, by default, their legal responsibility. Peel said they understood Plymouth City Council attempted to acquire the vessel and display her in the city's docks in 2007 but this was abandoned when no suitable berth could be found. Freelance photographer David Billinge, 57, captured images of the warship while it was docked prior to its departure from the River Mersey this morning. He said: ‘It’s a very sad sight to see such an iconic ship in such a state. It has been very badly neglected in recent years and is covered from top to bottom in rust. There’s so much history behind the ship which is why campaigners have fought so hard to preserve her. A statue from Another Place by Anthony Gormley is seen in the foreground as HMS Plymouth (centre) is towed away and believed to be heading to Turkey to be scrapped . Peel Ports said the Historic Warships Preservation Trust rented a berth for HMS Plymouth in 1990 within the East Float, Birkenhead from the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company but when the Trust went into liquidation in 2006, HMS Plymouth became their legal responsibility by default . Arriving home in Plymouth (above) where the city's council would later attempt to acquire HMS Plymouth to display in their own docks in 2007 however this notion was abandoned when a suitable berth could not be found . ‘It’s a real shame to see the vessel being consigned to the history books like this.’ Social media users described the scrapping of the warship as a ‘sad’ event. Stuart Miller said: ‘A lot of history in that ship, sad that she is going to be scrapped.’ Phil Owen wrote on Twitter: “#HMSPlymouth on way for scrapping, a sad end for any vessel #F126 #RoyalNavy.’ More than 50 seamen who served on board the historic vessel paid their last respects in a moving ceremony held in May 2012 – to mark the 30th anniversary of the end of the Falklands War. Speaking at the ceremony, Captain David Pentreath, the ship’s Commanding Officer during the Falklands War, said: ‘Her spirit will survive and the friendships forged over her long life will continue to flourish. Sadly the ship is now showing her age, but her reputation as a happy and successful ship is as strong as ever. This day is tinged with sadness as you make your fond farewells.’ He has previously condemned the decision to scrap HMS Plymouth, saying it was ‘an indication our country doesn’t seem to have much interest in the preservation of maritime heritage.’ The historic vessel has served in a variety of locations in its lifetime. In its early years HMS Plymouth sailed to Australia to take part in the Cook Bicentennial celebrations at Sydney Harbour in 1970. It also stopped at various ports including Albany, Port Adelaide and Port Kembla. On its return she sailed across the Indian Ocean before heading for a six-week tint on Beira Patrol. The crew had few distractions and the local ferry was a chance to show off the ship turning in tight circles to make her presence known. She had bow equipment damaged in a strong storm as she headed into Simonstown in South Africa at the end of her duty – on the same stay two members brought drugs on board which were confiscated on the ship’s arrival in Plymouth. Another tour saw the frigate travel around the UK stopping at ports including Stornoway and Middlesborough. In 1982 HMS Plymouth was one of the first Royal Navy ships to arrive in the South Atlantic after Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. Her Westland Wasp helicopter was badly damaged during Operation Paraquet on April 28 and she rejoined troops on the ground by bombarding Argentine troop positions with her 4.5inch guns. Five men were injured in an attack on June 8 when the ship was attacked by Dagger fighter bombers of the Argentine Air Force. Her wardroom was where the surrender was signed by Lieutenant commander Alfredo Astiz and the ship returned to Rosyth Dockyard after the war for a full repair and refit. A year later she served as the West Indies guard ship and in April 1984 was involved in a collision with another ship and in 1986 suffered a boiler room fire, which killed two sailors. She was decommissioned on April 28, 1988 and was the last type-12 in service. In 1990 she was towed to Glasgow and went on display at a berth on the River Clyde before being relocated to Birkenhead’s Great Float. On 6 February 2006 the Warship Preservation Trust closed after going into liquidation and six years later it was announced that she has been sold for scrapping.","The Royal Navy ship set sail from Vittoria Docks in Birkenhead, Liverpool, at about 7.30am this morning .

"By . Meghan Keneally . As first reported by MailOnline, five of the guides who died after the early morning avalanche on Mount Everest have been revealed as art of the team employed by NBC for an upcoming live jump special. A member of the surviving NBC News crew confirmed what a government list obtained by MailOnline first revealed as the local crew were a part of the prep team hired ahead of an live jump that NBC's Peacock Productions is shooting for Discovery Channel which will air in May. Two of the fatalities were explicitly listed as being a part of the NBC Everest Expedition and three others were hired by Adventurist Expeditions, an Everest climbing company that the wingsuit jumper at the heart of the NBC special had previously worked with. Scroll down for video . Grieving: Ed Wardle, a Scottish filmmaker working on the Peacock Productions' live jump crew, said Friday night that they lost five members of their team in the avalanche . Highest peak on Earth: A group of more than a dozen sherpas had gone up on the mountain early Friday morning to fix some ropes that would be used by trekkers later in the day, but one survivor recalled feeling that the route was unstable . Documentation: A Nepal government report names the victims of the tragedy and reveals they were on an 'NBC Everest Expedition' NBC and Discovery officials would not specifically state which sherpas or what tour companies the networks employed at Everest when MailOnline made repeated inquiries, but a part of the Peacock Productions crew currently at Everest Base Camp did confirm that five members of their larger crew were among the fatalities. 'Some of the sherpas were working for us. We lost five members of our team this morning,' Ed Wardle told Channel 4. 'It's absolutely devastating. The atmosphere here at base camp is one of shock and now of grieving. 'I believe it’s the worst disaster in Everest history if not all mountaineering.' He went on to say that he believed the number of dead had now risen to 16 but that has not been formally confirmed. Mr Wardle's statements come hours after he told The Today Show's Savannah Guthrie that he did not know any of the victims. 'No I couldn't tell you the name of . any of the sherpas that were up there,' Mr Wardle said when asked if he . knew any of the deceased. Earlier on Friday morning, Wardle (right), standing alongside fellow NBC News employee Jonathan Fierro (left), told The Today Show that he did not know the names of any of the sherpas who had died but that later changed . 'First . thing this morning, just before 7:00, we heard an avalanche in the ice . fall. It's a pretty regular occurrence- nobody was shocked by that but . then radio reports started coming off the mountain that people were . stuck in the avalanche. Everybody came out and started getting organized . for the rescue.' NBC News spokeswoman Amy Lynn said that the NBC News crews were safe but did not elaborate on any of the sherpas that they employed. 'NBC News Peacock Productions' crews were on Mt. Everest preparing for Discovery's Everest Jump Live when the avalanche struck. We are grateful and relieved that the 7 NBC News staffers on site are all accounted for and unharmed,' she told MailOnline. 'Tragically, 13 Nepalese sherpas from a . number of expedition companies who prepare the mountain each year for . climbing season lost their lives, and the rescue mission continues. We . are working closely with the team on the ground to assist however we . can, and our thoughts and prayers are with the affected families. 'The future of the production will be assessed at the appropriate time.' When the Nepalese government released this list, only 12 were dead and four were missing. The latest reports have the number of fatalities up to 13 but they have not disclosed who is the new fatality. Name of expedition . NBC Everest Expedition . Adventurist Everest Expedition .

Waiting to help: Staffers at Grandy Hospital in Katmandu were ready on the helipad Friday but communication isn't clear between who hired which guide groups who were on the mountain in the avalanche . Discovery's executive vice president of communications did tell MailOnline exclusively that Ogwyn is there and helping with the recovery effort. 'The avalanche last night on Mt Everest is a terrible tragedy, and our thoughts and prayers are with those who are lost and with their families. The immediate priority for Joby and the team is to assist the search and rescue efforts in anyway possible,' Laurie Goldberg said. Willie Geist from the Today Show was set to host the special. Both climbers listed as being a part . of the NBC expedition- Mingma Nuru Sherpa from the region of Namche and . Derji Sherpa also from Namche were declared dead by the Ministry of . Tourism and Civil Aviation. Three . others, who worked for Adventurist Everest Expedition- Dorjee Khatri . from Lelep, Then Dorjee Sherpa from Khumjung and Phur Temba Sherpa from . Yaphu- were all killed in the avalanche. Sherpas had gone up to the mountain much earlier than normal in hopes of fixing ropes for other climbers. One . of the injured survivors has said that he told a family member that the . path was unstable just moments before the avalanche hit. Star of the show: The Discovery Channel live jump was going to be done by Joby Ogwyn, an experienced wingsuiter, and the special was announced in February . Expectations: Joby Ogywn is the wingsuit jumper that is scheduled to make the live jump in May on the Discovery Channel and he posted on Thursday about his upcoming trek . Busy season: Avalanches like the one that occurred Friday morning are common in the area but in addition to the 13 who died this morning, it may cause further problems because this is the 'high season' in the area when many tours go through (pictured in May 2013) Four of the survivors were airlifted to Grandy Hospital in Katmandu while other survivors were being treated at base camp for less serious injuries. The Discovery Channel has not put out any statements about the future of the special, and Mr Wardle hinted that he is just one of the adventurers at Base Camp who are not looking to stay. 'I'd think that many of the expeditions here will pack up and go home. For this number of people to die at the very beginning of the season is completely unacceptable,' he told Channel 4. 'We came here looking for adventure, to celebrate Everest, but for something like this to happen makes the whole thing seem pointless to me and I believe that will be the same for many people here. 'People come here partly to take the risk of climbing a mountain like this at high altitude and they understand those risks, but still, when something this large happens, I think we all have to question what we're doing here.'

"By . Sam Peters . Luther Burrell is no one’s idea of a soft touch. Weighing 17st and with the physical attributes of a world-class athlete, the Huddersfield-born son of a chemical processor is a tough man earning a hard living in a sometimes brutal sport. But Burrell, just like every professional sportsman, is also a human being. Last season, at the end of a breakthrough Six Nations which saw the 26-year-old centre lay down a significant marker for next year’s World Cup, the physical and emotional demands of an eight-week campaign away from his family caught up with him. Roar: Luther Burrell was driven to tears and broke down after physical and emotional demands last year . Charge: The eight-week campaign away from his family caught up with Burrell towards the bitter end . Bags of potential: The 26-year-old England centre laid down a significant marker for next year’s World Cup . ‘I generally keep things close to my chest and don’t tend to share my feelings with other people,’ Burrell told The Mail on Sunday. ‘But the week after the Six Nations was really tough. Things caught up with me and I had to speak to [Northampton director of rugby] Jim Mallinder. ‘It was a pretty emotional conversation. I was a bit embarrassed because I’d never done that [broken down] before. But speaking openly about how I was feeling lifted a huge weight off my shoulders. The tournament had taken a lot out of us emotionally.’ Burrell’s emotional fragility was understandable following an intense tournament which began with bitter-sweet news for the former Leeds Tykes and Sale star. His joy at being handed a first England cap, against France in February, had been tempered by learning his mum, Joyce, had only just been given the all-clear following a major cancer scare. ‘Mum had a lump and she and the doctors thought it was breast cancer,’ he said. ‘They had to send off a sample for tests and it was a long time before she got the all clear. It was a huge time for my family. They were obviously overjoyed when they heard I’d been picked and there were plenty of tears. ‘But I was disappointed how the news came out about mum. ‘Mum and dad hadn’t really kept me in the loop because they didn’t want me to worry. It was a huge time for our family.’ Tough: Burrell's first England cap took a backseat after his mum, Joyce, got the all-clear from a  cancer scare . As is the lot of professional sportspeople, Burrell had to suppress his personal worries and focus on winning matches. He scored a superb debut try as England lost a pulsating game to France before crossing twice more in the tournament as Stuart Lancaster’s men came agonisingly close to winning the Six Nations. The subsequent meeting with Mallinder saw Burrell reset his sights and he went on to help his club lift the Amlin Cup and Aviva Premiership title with victory over Saracens in the final. The next day he proposed to his childhood sweetheart Millie — after nearly doing so on the Twickenham pitch — before flying halfway around the world to play in England’s last two Test defeats against the All Blacks in New Zealand. ‘It was a funny tour because it had been a big season for the Saracens and Northampton boys,’ he said. ‘Saracens had also been in the European final against Toulon and then played against us in the Premiership final. Then we flew to New Zealand and played the first Test with a lot of emotional things going on. ‘We felt a bit of pressure to deliver, flying out two days after the final to start in the second Test. That pressure of trying to back up what was a successful Six Nations but with less time spent together made it a tricky period. I think everyone involved learned a lot from that tour.’ With another huge season, beginning with the Aviva Premiership opener this Friday night against Gloucester at Franklin’s Gardens, and hopefully finishing with a home World Cup on home soil next October, Burrell has taken up the saxophone in an attempt to keep an even keel. 'I didn’t want to learn the guitar because that is what everyone wants to play so I decided to buy a saxophone,’ he said. ‘I listen to the Blues and a bit of Northern Soul for inspiration. I absolutely love it. I’d like to play at our wedding. I had a chat with Ben Foden the other day and he’s going to play the guitar. We just need to find a singer. Pressure: Burrell admits he felt he needed to do well for his country and 'deliver' what was expected . Gearing up: Burrell has taken up the saxophone and listens to 'Blues and a bit of Northern Soul for inspiration' ‘I said “Between you and your missus [Saturdays popstar Una Healy] you can find a singer”.’ Injuries notwithstanding, Burrell — whose footballing abilities surprised many last season — is set to be a key figure in Lancaster’s squad despite fierce competition from other centres Manu Tuilagi, Billy Twelvetrees, Brad Barritt, Kyle Eastmond and soon-to-arrive rugby-league convert Sam Burgess. ‘Ideally I’d like to be in the midfield with Manu but you just have to respect whatever pairings the coaches come up with,’ Burrell said. ‘I saw Mike Ford at Bath say originally that Sam was going to play back row so I’m happy with that! ‘It’s an incredibly exciting time to be involved with England. A home World Cup is going to be absolutely huge and I’m desperate to be part of it. Just look at the Olympics and Commonwealth Games. ‘I’ve said to the coaches that this year is about making small sacrifices for what could be a life changing opportunity at the end of it.’ But while Burrell has the world at his feet today, it could all have been very different had mum Joyce not emailed Lancaster — in his former role as Academy director at Leeds Tykes — to express her displeasure at her teenage son being overlooked in favour of a rival. ‘One of my team-mates at Huddersfield got invited to Leeds Academy and I was really unhappy about it,’ Burrell said. ‘It really got under my skin and I went home and sulked. Eager: Burrell says a home World Cup will be 'absolutely huge' and the centre is 'desperate to be part of it' ‘I told Mum this lad had been picked and she fired off an email. The secretary replied saying Stuart was happy for me to come along if I was confident I could cut it.’ A dual contract with Leeds Tykes and the Rhinos followed and Burrell spent a precarious four years living on £200 a month in student digs in Headingley alongside five other aspiring professionals. Only Burrell has gone on to make it into the top-flight. ‘I had nothing else to fall back on,’ he said. ‘I’d done my GSCEs and sports science A-levels but after that it was all rugby. I had to make it work. It didn’t bare thinking about if I didn’t make it. ‘When me and Millie talk about it now we always say how fortunate we are that I can do this and that it’s given us such a comfortable life. I’ve seen the other side when it doesn’t work out and I’ve seen people drop off the edge. It’s keeps me humble and motivated to keep getting better because once you get into a hole as a professional sportsman it’s hard to claw your way out.’ A frustrating spell at Sale following Leeds’ relegation in 2011 led to Burrell signing a two-year deal with Saints in 2012. Last season, after touring Argentina with England, he extended that deal by three years. ‘I’ve managed to turn my career around,’ he said. ‘I really did think Northampton was my last shot and I knew I couldn’t afford to not make it work. Thankfully it’s paid off and I’m loving my time here. ‘Stuart Lancaster always said I’d be a late developer and he was right.’ On the up: Burrell acknowledges he has 'managed to turn (his) career around' and is glad his efforts paid off .

"By . Reuters . and Associated Press . A tentative agreement has been reached by the chairmen of the U.S. Senate and House veterans committees on legislation aimed at resolving the Veterans Affairs healthcare crisis, their spokesmen said on Sunday. Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who heads the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, and his House counterpart, Republican Representative Jeff Miller, will outline the agreement at a news conference at 1:30 p.m. on Monday, their spokesmen said. 'Miller and Sanders continued negotiations on a VA reform package this weekend and made significant progress toward an agreement on legislation to make VA more accountable and to help the department recruit more doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals,' their offices said in a statement. Healthcare reform: The U.S. Senate and House veterans committees reached a tentative agreement to improve veterans hospitals . Too long: Wounded US Army veterans have faced long wait times for medical care and some of them never even lived till their appointment . The VA has been rocked by a scandal over cover-ups of months-long waiting times for medical appointments at its clinics and hospitals across the country. In Phoenix, doctors have alleged that some 40 veterans died as their names languished on secret waiting lists while officials misrepresented wait-time data to meet targets for bonus compensation. The controversy led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki in late May. A veteran who collapsed in an Albuquerque Veteran Affairs hospital cafeteria, 500 yards from the emergency room, died after waiting 30 minutes for an ambulance in early July. Officials at the hospital said it took a half an hour for the ambulance to be dispatched and take the man from one building to the other, which is about a five minute walk. VA spokeswoman Sonja Brown said Kirtland Air Force Medical Group personnel performed CPR until the ambulance arrived. With time winding down before Congress begins a five-week recess on Friday, pressure has been building to reach a deal on a measure aimed at eliminating long waiting lists at VA hospitals and clinics. Negotiations on the measure had broken down last week as Sanders and Miller rolled out competing proposals with a $15 billion gap between them. The proposal introduced by Sanders on Thursday would provide less than $25 billion in new funds for VA healthcare, with $3.3 billion offset by other savings in the department's budget. Miller came back with a plan for $10 billion in emergency funds, with other budget needs to be settled in the fiscal 2015 VA spending bill later this year.

"By . Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . A former magazine journalist has penned a book about her double life as a high-class escort and a mother. It is believed Samantha X, who will appear on Channel Seven's Sunday Night to talk candidly about her profession to spruik her novel, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, is Amanda Goff. Ms Goff has worked at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines. The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two by day and a sex worker by night. High-class escort Samantha X was identified as former magazine journalist Amanda Goff . Ms Goff (pictured here three years ago) used to work at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines but is now a private escort . 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff tells Sunday Night reporter James Thomas. Despite the stigma surrounding the profession, the escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012. A former colleague of Ms Goff told Daily Mail Australia they were not surprised to learn of the woman's double life. 'I'm not shocked at all - she's always been a bit close to the edge. She follows her own rules. 'And I'm not surprised she's going on TV and saying it's her - I think she's always secretly wanted to be famous,' the colleague said. 'I think she's always wanted a life that's bigger than what she had. To be famous and rich. And using something to catapult her into the limelight. 'She's always been very bold and goes for what she wants. She's very single-minded. I always thought she used her looks and her boldness to get what she wants.' The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two and started escorting in 2012, two days after she visited a brothel . Ms Goff (left and pictured right in the front row, far right) said most of the parents at her children's school know what she does for a living and are supportive . She will appear on the Channel Seven program in an exclusive interview on Sunday night . Ms Goff told the program she volunteered at the tuckshop of her children's school and most of the parents there knew what she did for a living. 'Do you think your profession defines you as a parent?' she said. 'I don’t think that because you’re a neurosurgeon you’re necessarily a good parent. 'I don’t think that if you are a criminal, you’re a bad parent.' Ms Goff started her career at an exclusive brothel in Sydney  and 18 months later she moved into private escorting as Samantha X. 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff tells Sunday Night reporter James Thomas (pictured) Goff charges $800 an hour or $5,000 a night for her services, and said she can teach married couples a thing or two . The mother has penned a book about her double life called Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort . She charges $800 an hour for her services or $5,000 for an entire night. But Ms Goff reassures people that it is not as glamorous as it seems: 'You'd think for 12 hours we'd be having sex all night, but that is so far from the truth.' After her time sleeping with married men who pay her more than three times the average weekly salary, she thinks she knows the secret to a happy marriage. Ms Goff said listening was key as many men complained they were not being heard to by their spouse.","Samantha X has been named as Sydney-based mother Amanda Goff .

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has approved a bill which paves the way for legalising medical marijuana . The President of Colombia has endorsed new legislation which paves the way for legalising medical cannabis. Juan Manuel Santos made the announcement yesterday at a drug policy forum in the capital Bogota. Mr Santos called the bill 'a practical, compassionate measure to reduce the pain (and) anxiety of patients with terminal illnesses' while adding that it would help combat crime. Colombia has been wracked by decades of conflict with left-wing rebels inside the country, who are largely funded with drug money. The nation is only the latest in a string of countries in South America to legalise cannabis. Uruguay has already approved sales of the drug, while Jamaica is set to decriminalise it for religious and medicinal purposes, allowing people to carry up to two ounces. Colombia already allows people to legally carry half that amount, but the new bill would remove that cap completely. The medicinal-use bill was introduced by Sen. Juan Manuel Galan, whose father was assassinated in 1989 by cocaine traffickers. He said other countries such as Argentina, Brazil and Chile were considering similar pieces of legislation. Galan said his hope is that his bill, which would put the distribution of medical marijuana under government control, gain final approval next June. Ethan Nadelmann, director of the New York-based Drug Policy Alliance, said some U.S. states as well as countries including Israel and Canada are already offering  legal medical marijuana, and that a bill was introduced last week in the Central American nation of Costa Rica. In Colombia the govenrment has been fighting left-wing rebels for years, who largely fund themselves through the sale of drugs such as cocaine and marijuana. The commander of Colombia's anti-drug police, Gen. Ricardo Restrepo, said the country currently has about 1.5 square miles (390 hectares) of marijuana fields producing the drug for $230 per lb. Scroll down for video . The country, which is currently thought to have 390 hectares worth of cannabis fields, has been wracked by decades of conflict with left-wing rebels largely funded with money from selling drugs such as cannabis . Colombia is the world's No. 2 cocaine-producing country after Peru, according to the United Nations and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. It was the global leader until 2012. A two-decade U.S.-backed crackdown on Colombia's drug cartels and extensive aerial eradication of coca crops has hampered the trade, but failed to eradicate it. Critics say the campaign has simply shifted trafficking to countries with less effective law enforcement and legal systems. The human cost of the fight against illegal drugs has been terrible for Colombia and other supply and transit countries, Santos told the forum. 'We have spent billions of dollars on an ineffective war that has claimed more than 60,000 lives in Mexico alone in the last six years,' he said.","Juan Manuel Santos approves bill allowing sales of medicinal cannabis .

"By . Michael Zennie for MailOnline . When is a $100 bill not worth $100? When it's in Mississippi, where it's worth $116. Or in Hawaii, where the value shrinks to just $85. A new map by the non-partisan Tax Foundation reveals that the cost of living difference between states means the value of the cash in your pocket varies wildly. The Tax Foundation used federal data on regional price variations to calculate just how far a Ben Franklin goes in all 50 states. And the differences are striking. A dollar is worth 30percent more in Mississippi than it is in Washington, D.C - which has the highest prices in the country. The Tax Foundation used new federal data to show that $100 goes a lot farther in some states than others - and it varies by up to 30percent, based on prices differences between regions . The Tax Foundation showed how residents of Kansas are actually richer than New York residents after factoring in the price of goods . The states $100 goes the farthest are: Mississippi ($115.74), Arkansas ($114.16), Missouri ($113.51), Alabama (113.51), and South Dakota ($113.38). The states where $100 is worth the least are: District of Columbia ($84.60), Hawaii ($85.32), New York ($86.66), New Jersey ($87.64), and California ($88.57). In some states, $100 is still just $100. In Illinois a C-note is worth $99.40. In Florida and Oregon, it's worth $101.21. Tax Foundation says the regional cost differences, which were recently released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis for the first time ever, could help Americans rethink the places that they live. For instance, Oklahoma has a significantly lower average income compared to New York ($37,000 vs $45,000). Adjusted for cost of living differences, however, Oklahoma jumps several places in the rankings and New York falls several places - making the real average income in Oklahoma $41,000 and just $39,000 in New York. All this means that $50,000 after taxes in a high cost of living state like New York is really worth just $43,000. That same $50,00 in Oklahoma actually feels more like $56,000. The public policy implications are also immense; $100 in food assistance to a poor family in Washington, D.C., would buy less than $85 worth of food, while it will buy nearly $116 in Mississippi. The Bureau of Economic Analysis introduced the federal government's first-ever statistics on regional price differences in April. The data to calculate the cost of living variation across the country is culled from Consumer Price Index information. The CPI continually measures the cost of a 'basket of goods' in cities across the nation to keep track of inflation. The data, however, also provides insight into price differences in communities across the country. The CPI testers keep track of prices of things like: .","Map by the Tax Foundation compares price differences between states - which can vary by more than 30percent .

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A young mother who gave birth at the age of 14 has proved having a baby is no barrier to education - after passing eight GCSEs two years later. Elle Randall, now 16, vowed to finish her studies after having baby Ava two years ago - and soon found herself juggling nappy changing with school work. But the determined teenager gained eight GCSEs at grades A-C, including maths, in which she scored 98 per cent after gaining an early entry. Scroll down for video . Elle Randall, pictured with daughter Ava, gave birth at the age of 14 but vowed to continue her studies . Elle fell pregnant when she was in Year 9, but continued going to Trinity Catholic College, Middlesbrough until a month before she gave birth and returned to classes two months later. 'Of course it was a massive shock when I found out I was pregnant,' said Elle, from Thornaby, North Yorkshire. 'I always did well in class, but I was a rebellious pupil and I was always getting in to trouble; I never took school seriously.' The single mother said she was 'looked down on' while she was pregnant - and is now delighted she has been able to prove people wrong. She said: 'I got my head down because I knew I could do it. 'And a big part of it was not only to make Ava proud, but to prove people wrong. 'I was constantly looked down on and so by working hard and getting my grades I've been able to prove a lot of people wrong.' Her mother Kath, a community worker with Middlesbrough Council, said she was 'numb' when her child told her she was having a baby but said the youngster was a 'complete natural.' Proud: 16-year-old Elle Randall, pictured with her mother Kath and daughter Ava, has passed eight degrees two years after giving birth . Elle Randall, pictured planting a kiss on her daughter Ava, now plans to go on and take A-Levels and gain a degree before becoming a teacher . 'The transformation from a rebellious school pupil to a responsible mother is lovely to see,' said the 46-year-old, also mother to Jake, 23, and Kurtis, 19. 'She's done a fantastic job and she is a credit to Ava. 'It is every parent's dream for their children to do well and I am so proud of her for accomplishing so much.' Elle plans to go to college in September to get her A-levels and hopes for a place at Leeds University to complete a joint degree in English and RE. She added: 'I want to become a teacher eventually. 'It's going to be tough but if I have come this far I think why not?' 'I'm in a good routine now and if it wasn't for me having Ava I know I wouldn't have done so well. I don't even think I would have stayed in school much longer. 'It just shows that everything happens for a reason and young mums shouldn't be afraid to reach for their dreams.'","Elle Randall, of Thornaby, North Yorkshire fell pregnant while in Year 9 .

"By . Annabel Fenwick Elliott for MailOnline . A determined soon-to-be bride finally fulfilled her lifelong dream of meeting her birth mother before walking down the aisle; after a woman - the sister she never knew - reunited them on Facebook. Carrie Ruegsegger, 22, now based in New Philadelphia, Ohio, was born in the nearby town of Lima and was given up for adoption by her mother Kelly at birth. Kelly already had two children and was single, broke, unemployed and homeless at the time. Carrie, who appears to hold no grudge, tells Today of the moment they were reunited: 'It's more than I could have ever dreamed it would be... I don't even think we said ""Hi"". We just said ""I love you. I've waited so long to meet you"".' Reunited: Carrie Ruegsegger (left) always dreamed she'd meet her birth mother, Kelly Brown Gallant (right) before she got married. Her wish finally came true (pictured) when they were matched on Facebook . Success: Carrie posted this photo (left) to Facebook, which was shared by hundreds of people and eventually seen by a woman who turned out to be her sister, and who sent the post to their mother (right) 'When, in middle school, Carrie started looking for her birth mother, her only resource was the name of the hospital she was born in, which had no records of Carrie even being there. So more recently, when a work colleague suggested posting a photo of herself on Facebook holding a letter appealing for information - despite initially thinking it was 'dumb' - she went ahead. Within two days, she had a hit. A young woman called Aleshia Brown Speicher had been searching for the sister she knew her mother had given up for adoption. She saw the post, recognized how similar the pair looked, and sent Carrie a photo of herself and a message theorizing that they could be sisters. Long lost sisters: Aleshia Brown Speicher (right) knew her mother had given her sister (left) up for adoption at birth, and when she saw Carrie's post, she noticed how similar they were and contacted her . Tearjerker: Carrie (front) said of her first meeting with Kelly (back), 'It's more than I could have ever dreamed it would be... I don't even think we said ""Hi"". We just said ""I love you. I've waited so long to meet you""' Attempts: Kelly sent Carrie (pictured as a child) loving letters (left) every year through the adoption agency, but when it closed down, the only tie she had to Carrie was severed . Old times: Kelly (pictured as a younger woman) was already a single mother-of-two. She was broke, unemployed and homeless at the time, and felt she couldn't give Carrie (pictured at birth) the life she deserved . Carrie recalls her instant response to seeing the photo of her sister: 'It was unbelievable! She's got my nose. She's got my eyes. She's got my features! She's definitely my sister.' 'She's got my eyes. She's got my features! She's definitely my sister' In turn, Aleshia sent her mother Kelly a photo of Carrie, and Kelly immediately knew 'it had to be her.' A few weeks later, just before Carrie's wedding to now-husband Bill Ruegsegger, the mother and daughter met in person; a memory Carrie says 'will last a lifetime.' Baby joy: Carrie (left) pictured with her now-husband Bill Ruegsegger (right), became a mother herself in February when she gave birth to baby Bill (center), now six months old . Emotional: Having her son made Carrie (right) look at Kelly's (left) decision in a different light. 'I could never give him up like that,' she says of Bill . Kelly claims she didn't know what else she could have done with her baby Carrie in her situation at the time, but insists that she changed her mind about giving her up when she was born. She says she was told it was 'too late' and a nurse took Carrie away. Carrie grew up with two adoptive brothers and was a keen sports player in school. She says that although she had a 'great' childhood, she always felt there was 'something' missing. This became all the more poignant for Carrie when in February, 22 years later, she gave birth to her own child; a now six-month-old son called Bill. The motherly love she felt made her look at Kelly's decision to give her up for adoption in a different light. 'I could never give him up like that,' she says of Bill. 'For her to do that, that's something she's really strong to do.' Her own family: Carrie (left) pictured at her wedding to Bill (right) with son Bill Jr. (center), says that although she had a 'great' childhood, she always felt there was 'something' missing . Happy ending: Kelly, pictured with Carrie (right) attended the wedding and she now lives a three hour drive from Carrie. The pair text with each other almost every day . Kelly was one the one to hand-pick Carrie's adoptive family. She says she never forgot about the daughter she gave away, and 'prayed' for her constantly. She also sent Carrie a birthday card every year through the adoption agency, as well as letters telling her how much she loved her. It is unclear whether any of the letters ever reached Carrie, but the agency closed down and the only tie she had to Carrie was severed. After finally being reunited all these years later, Kelly attended the wedding and she now lives a three hour drive from Carrie. The pair text with each other almost every day.","Carrie Ruegsegger, 22, posted a photo and a letter to Facebook to try and track down her birth mother .

"By . Jeff Powell . There is a dimension to the harnessing of Glenn Hoddle to Harry Redknapp which stretches far beyond Queens Park Rangers, higher even than the utmost reaches of the Premier League to which this middling club merrily aspires. Here is the next England management team in waiting. If the wheels on Roy Hodgson’s bandwagon fall off a second time, come in ‘Arry Boy and Godly Glenn. Perfect partnership: Harry Redknapp has appointed Glenn Hoddle to his staff at Queens Park Rangers . Tricky period: Roy Hodgson needs to hit the ground running to stave off any talk over his future as boss . Redknapp was the people’s alternative the last time the FA went fishing for a national team boss. Hoddle might still have been in the job had he not given public airing to his unorthodox religious opinions. The FA plumped for the coaching intelligence which has always been Hodgson’s stock in trade and has been enriched by a wealth of experience abroad. That was preferred to the quick-witted, inspirational man-management style of Redknapp. Hoddle, however, is a thoughtful tactician and if he and Redknapp hit it off in Shepherd’s Bush the temptation will arise, sooner or later, for England to see in that partnership the best of both worlds. The bad cop and the God cop, the tongue-lasher and the quiet talker, the backside-kicker and the gentle persuader. More and more in the world of football it takes two to tango and this pair are each other’s alter-egos. Most importantly, Redknapp and Hoddle each bring something to the party which is different from the other. Dismal: England were eliminated from the World Cup in Brazil this summer after just two group games . New era: The Three Lions needs leadership after the international retirement of captain Steven Gerrard . Redknapp has no problem admitting as much. He is talking openly about Hoddle revolutionising the tactics of a QPR team which his own street-wise instincts dragged to the Premier League by its bootlaces last season. Where Redknapp was born and bred to 4-4-2, Hoddle was an early convert to the 3-5-2 system which has been finding favour in the foreign leagues for some years, becoming more prevalent during this Brazilian World Cup summer and is preferred by new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal. Hoddle flirted with that conversion during his spell as England manager which was brought to an abrupt end after he made known his apparent belief that the disabled are being punished from on high for misbehaviour in previous lives. No amount of dissembling could get him off that hook but he has found out for himself now that time not only heals but makes men wiser. Wrong decisions: While manager of England, Hoddle handled Paul Gascoigne poorly . Redknapp, by contrast, would have handled the maverick Paul Gascoigne more cleverly. Hoddle, in the heat of an unseemly ruckus, expelled Gazza from England’s World Cup squad for France 98, not realising how sensible it would have been to keep that genius on hand in case the day came when he was needed. Inevitably it did, as Redknapp would have known. Just as he can see the attraction in a pairing of opposites with Hoddle. Hodgson, having survived after World Cup 2014 elimination inside two matches, has the acumen to turn his and England’s fortunes around for Euro 2016, for which the qualifying fixtures are about to commence. But there are no certainties at international level and, by a neat twist of the draw, that campaign opens with an away match against the Swiss, who he turned into awkward tournament rivals during a spell as their national manager. VIDEO Staying in the Premier League is the main aim - Redknapp . Talking tactics: QPR are set to change their formation under the guidance of Hoddle this season . The FA are pleading patience for a decent man and that is not unreasonable. But unless England’s results improve in the immediate post-Steven Gerrard era, Hodgson knows how fierce the public backlash will be. Whenever that clamour becomes irresistible the most difficult question to answer is always who should get the job next. By the time England’s fate in the Euros unfolds, Redknapp and Hoddle could well be the most popular answer. This Wednesday has marked the tenth anniversary of the opening ceremony for the Athens Olympics. The days and weeks prior to this landmark have been notable for damning photographs and reports of the state of neglect into which the venues have fallen. Many have also sought to blame the cost of the Games for Greece’s dire economic crisis. Dossier: Gianna Angelopoulos - the Lord Coe of Athens 2004 – has commissioned a study into the real costs . Now the remarkable woman who drove through the completion of construction and a of myriad other preparations in time to deliver a highly acclaimed Games – to the chagrin of all the doomsayers who predicted Athens would never be ready – is fighting back. Gianna Angelopoulos – the first lady of Olympia and as such the Lord Coe of Athens – has commissioned a forensic study into the real costs as well as the full extent of the benefits to the city. Her critics should beware. Angelopoulos, who almost killed herself working 20 hours a day to get Athens built in less days than seemed humanly possible when she took over a failing operation, is a formidable foe. She also has influential friends. President Bill Clinton is just one global powerbroker who has endorsed her new book - about the struggle to save the 2004 Games - as inspirational. Angelopoulos has instructed the highly respected Foundation for Economic and Industrial Research ‘to conduct a detailed and scientific investigation into the overall impact of the Games’. While there can be no disputing the dramatic pictorial evidence of venues such as the Olympic pool, the rowing centre, the stadium itself and the canoeing facility being in sorry disrepair, Angelopoulos denies that is the full story. Where's the legacy? Reports of the state of neglect into which the venues have fallen have been damning . That, she and her allies insist, is to be found in the transformation of Athens into a modern European capital by the Games. Against every rundown venue she can cite the bustling shopping mall which used to be the International Broadcast Centre, the badminton hall which is now a regularly-packed theatre and a majority of other sites which have been sold off. When it comes down to the hard cash, Angelopoulos is confident that a significant percentage of the reported £6.8billion spent on the Olympics and Paralympics will be found to have been invested in roads, tramways, hospitals, hotels and the long overdue restoration of fabled archaeological sites. No backing down now: Angelopoulos is insistent that the Games were a success and helped Greece . Even by the most extravagant estimates the Games cannot be held accountable for more than one per cent of the Greek national debt. In return for that, this ancient capital has been rejuvenated as a contemporary showcase for its historic past. Legacy is the Olympic buzz-word but in the narrow terms of the stadia it is arguable that Athens is no worse off than Sydney, while the infrastructure of that city hardly benefited. And whither London, it is being asked, eight years from now? The Athens study is due for publication ‘before the end of this year.’ Then, let the fun and games begin.

"By . Ashley Collman . A 24-year-old single mother in Mt Clemens, Michigan has become America's newest millionaire after turning in her winning $66million lottery ticket. On Thursday, Kelsey Zachow spoke about her win at a press conference, and later posed with her check and 7-month-old baby boy Benjamin. At the press conference, Zachow talked about how she plans to spend her winnings and how she went more than a week without knowing about the valuable Mega Millions lottery ticket tucked in her purse. Scroll down for video . Winner, winner: 24-year-old Kelsey Zachow has won $66million in the Mega Millions lottery. Pictured above with her 7-month-old son Benjamin . Payday: Zachow bought her winning ticket on the way to work on Friday the 13th, but didn't know she won until 11 days later . Zachow says she has been buying lottery tickets two times a week for the past five years, spending an estimated $10,000 on tickets. So as part of her usual habit, she stopped by the Sonny's Market in Mt Clemens on her way to work on June 13 and picked up four tickets with her regular numbers, and one easy pick. . 'Friday the 13th has always been a really lucky day for me,' she said. 'I went home that night and I’m like nothing really good happened. (I thought) that’s weird.' Happily unemployed: Zachow has since quit her two part-time jobs as a bartender and medical assistant since learning about her winnings . It wasn't until 11 days later, on June 24, that she realized she won. She stopped back at the market and checked her numbers at the stand, but she was prompted to take the tickets to the teller. The cashier then broke the news that Zachow 'won big'. She couldn't believe it, so she ran back to her car, locked the door and checked her numbers on the phone. 'I couldn't breathe,' she said. When she realized that she indeed had the winning ticket, won with the easy pick numbers, she rushed home to tell her boyfriend of the three years, Billy Bartlett. He says she came speeding home at 100mph and kept screaming though he didn't know what the news was about. When he double checked her tickets, Bartlett says his jaw 'dropped to the floor'. Since it was a Sunday, Zachow couldn't turn her ticket in until the next day, so she kept it in a relatives safe for security. Then, after consulting with a lawyer and financial consultant, she went to the Michigan Lottery office to claim her winnings. Zachow has decided to accept her jackpot in a lump sum, which amounts to about $27million after taxes. 'I wanted to be smart with it. I’ve been playing for five years so I kinda had a plan if I ever did win,” she said. “You watch those (TV) shows. People go bankrupt and lose it all. So, financial adviser, lawyer, taxes -- just getting everything straight beforehand. We have our ducks in a row and now we can have fun.' She has since quit her two jobs as a bartender and medical assistant, which she previously worked to support her son and also her boyfriend and his 5-year-old daughter Evelyn. Spender: Zachow plans to spend her money on a new house and college tuition for some of her younger family members, including her 7-month-old son . Sharing: Zachow also wants to pay the college tuition for her boyfriend's daughter. Zachow and her boyfriend of three years Billy Bartlett pictured above . Barlett, has been laid off from his job in construction for about a year. Zachow says she first plans to spend her money buying a new SUV, perhaps a Jeep, and then a electric blue Mustang GTR convertible with dual exhaust and leather seats. She also wants to but the house of her dreams in the St. Clair area. Some place with acreage where she might one day be able to open a no-kill animal shelter. From there, she plans to treat herself to vacations in Europe, the Caribbean and Ireland - where most of her boyfriend's family are from. The money will also go to pay the college tuition for her son, boyfriend's daughter, and her 2-year-old little brother Gus Schmidlin. Zachow's winnings were the largest ever won by a Michigan lottery player on a Friday the 13th.","Kelsey Zachow, 24, bought her winning ticket on Friday the 13th .

It was extremely lucky because they spotted it as they were on the way to another fire. They were remarkable, they wouldn't leave until they were sure the fire was completely out.

Arrested: Golden Dawn party leader Nikos Michaloliakos, right, speaks with the party spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris, left - pictured in June last year - face charges of forming a criminal organisation . The arrests mark the first time since 1974 that sitting members of Parliament have been arrested - then marking the fall of the military Junta and the restoration of democracy in the country. Golden Dawn has vehemently denied any role in the killing on September 17 of the rapper - who went by the stage name of Killah P. It has warned it may pull its 18 lawmakers from parliament in the government crackdown does not stop. But the incident seems to have damaged its appeal among Greek, and sparked violent anti-fascist protests in the streets of Athens on September 18.

"By . Katy Winter . Men everywhere will likely be taking aim at director of the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film Sam Taylor-Wood, when they discover that she turned down one of the desired glamour models around for the role of Anastasia in the steamy adaptation. After a modelling career spanning eight years and almost as many covers Keeley Hazell is back for this month’s FHM magazine, and opening up about her raunchy role ambitions. The 27-year-old, who relocated to LA to focus her energies on an acting and writing career  revealed: 'I auditioned twice for Fifty Shades Of Grey – that was a pretty, erm, “interesting” experience.' 'The truth is that women want to be viewed as sexy. Shooting a cover like this is so empowering' says Keeley . However Keeley confesses that she was not as devastated as on might imagine at losing out to Dakota Mayi Johnson for the movie role, as her real interest lies elsewhere. 'I’ve done some acting stuff – a couple of films and other projects. But the thing I’ve been most passionate about is my writing,' she confesses. 'I’m currently collaborating with a talented young female director – we wrote a series that has been taken on by a production company. It’s in the super-early stages, but it’s really exciting. Keeley, who relocated to LA to focus her energies on an acting and writing career, admits she auditioned for the Fifty Shades of Grey movie twice . 'In a nutshell it’s about a girl from London, who moves to LA and attempts to reinvent herself as the creator of a fashion-focused lifestyle website. It’s loosely based on my life, but it’s also heavily influenced by internet celebrities, fashion bloggers and some “it” girls,' Keely gushes. Keeley graces the cover of this month's FHM Magazine, which is on sale now . This career change has left many of her fans disappointed as Keeley has largely left her successful glamour modelling days behind her. In the sexy shoot it is easy to see why she might be missed by adoring men. With a pair of blue jeans and wedged sandals enhancing her impossibly long legs and wearing a black satin pushup bra to boost her cleavage, Keeley certainly hasn't forgotten how to raise pulses in her modelling hiatus. Defending her return to men’s magazines after a 13-month long break Keeley says: 'I suppose I came to a realisation that being a serious actress and being on the cover of FHM don’t need to be mutually exclusive. 'There’s this perception that you can’t be more than one thing. That if you’re dubbed ‘sexy’ you can no longer be anything else. That you become intellectually uncomplicated, incapable of accomplishing anything other than appearing to be an object for men. And it’s rubbish. 'Society tells you that you can’t be smart and sexy, and that’s totally wrong.' The fiesty model continues: 'The thing about sexiness is that it’s been painted as evil. 'But the truth is that women want to be viewed as sexy. Shooting a cover like this is so empowering. It brings out a different side of you, which is incredibly liberating.'This month’s FHM Magazine is on sale now (Thursday).

"By . Dominic King for MailOnline . Chelsea showed their strength by overpowering Everton to record a 6-3 victory at Goodison Park on Saturday and move top of the Premier League table. In an enthralling clash between Jose Mourinho's men and Roberto Martinez's side, the teams shared nine goals and there were several controversial refereeing decisions to add to a dramatic game. Find out how the players fared in the Barclays Premier League contest. VIDEO Scroll down to watch contrasting views on Diego Costa from Mourinho and Martinez . EVERTON (4-2-3-1) TIM HOWARD - 5 . Couldn’t be faulted for any of the goals he conceded but became embroiled in a squabble with Diego Costa and could have been sent-off if the officials had been more eagle-eyed. SEAMUS COLEMAN - 6 . Provided a brilliant cross for Everton’s first goal and was his usual energetic self but his own goal proved decisive in the ebb and flow of the contest. PHIL JAGIELKA - 4.5 . Not a performance he will look back on with any fondness whatsoever. Costa’s physicality and movement caused him numerous problems and he left the field distraught. Nightmare: Phil Jagielka (right) and Sylvain Distin were bullied by Diego Costa and struggled all game . SYLVAIN DISTIN - 4.5 . Had a goal correctly ruled out in the first half when he was offside but, like Jagielka, he will be glad to consign this game to history. Too slow to close Matic down for Chelsea’s fourth goal. LEIGHTON BAINES - 5.5 . Pinpoint delivery provided Samuel Eto’o with a debut goal. He kept ploughing a furrow up the left flank but struggled to get much change out of Ivanovic. GARETH BARRY - 6 . What you see is what you get from Barry. Never gives up and uses the ball well but this wasn’t an easy contest against the hulking Nemanja Matic. Decent: Gareth Barry (left) did an OK job for Everton but he was simply out-fought by powerful Nemanja Matic . JAMES MCCARTHY - 6 . He was excellent against Arsenal but didn’t reach the same levels here. Fought hard to try and wrestle the initative off Matic but had to admit defeat in the end. AIDAN MCGEADY - 6 . Bright in the second half and played a smart ball into Naismith for Everton’s third goal but substituted shortly after and his Everton career is yet to take off. STEVEN NAISMITH - 7 . Continued his bright start to the campaign with a third goal in as many games. Never stopped trying and his runs from deep kept Terry and Cahill on their toes. Form: Steven Naismith scored his third goal in as many games for Everton and impressed once more . KEVIN MIRALLAS - 7 . Magnificent header just before half-time changed the atmosphere and lit the fuse for a wonderful second half. Continues to fulfil an important role with his use of the ball and speed. ROMELU LUKAKU - 5 . Didn’t enjoy any kind of fond reunion with his former employers. His run opened the space for Naismith to score Everton’s third goal but, other than that, there wasn’t much for him to cheer. SUBS . SAMUEL ETO'O - 7 . Took his goal well off the bench against his former side. MUHAMED BESIC . UNUSED . Robles (GK), Gibson, Osman, Stones, Alcaraz . Familar face: Everton striker Samuel Eto'o scored a header on his debut against former club Chelsea . CHELSEA . THIBAUT COURTOIS - 6.5 . Beaten three times but not at fault for any of them. Commands his area well and is never afraid to charge from his line to try and claim aerial balls. BRANISLAV IVANOVIC - 7 . Doesn’t command headlines but his importance for this Chelsea team cannot be underestimated. His standards rarely dip and he always pops up with a goal, as he did here. GARY CAHILL - 8 . Will be furious that he has come off the pitch having conceded three goals. Some of his tackling and intercepting was of the highest class and kept Lukaku under lock and key. Dominant: Despite conceding three goals, Chelsea defender Gary Cahill was brilliant and commanding at back . JOHN TERRY - 7.5 . Again, like Cahill, the goals Chelsea shipped will colour his view of the win. But when Everton tried to get a foothold in the game he was not found wanting. CESAR AZPILICUETA - 6.5 . Needs to up his game with Filipe Luis breathing down his neck. Steady and reliable, stuck to his guns in the second half when Everton tried to turn up the pressure. NEMANJA MATIC - 8.5 . An absolute monster. Gets better every time you see him and by the end of the season he will be saluted as the finest defensive midfielder in the country. Scored the decisive fourth, too. Powerhouse: Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic (centre) bagged a goal and dominated the midfield play . RAMIRES - 7.5 . Another to get on the scoresheet and provided an assist too. Linked well with Matic and covered every blade of grass, . WILLIAN - 6.5 . Industrious but not the flashiest performance. Kept the ball, charged forward when the chance allowed. Fulfils a crucial role in this team. CESC FABREGAS - 7.5 . Easy to see why Mourinho wanted to sign him and his effortless passing is making Chelsea a much more attractive side to watch; delightful weight on his ball to Costa for the opener. Poise: Cesc Fabregas (left) makes Chelsea far more attractive on the eye with some beautiful passing . EDEN HAZARD - 7.5 . Some flashes of brilliance, like when he created the third goal. Even when he isn’t in the game for long periods, you always get the sense he is capable of bursting into life. DIEGO COSTA - 9 . He is a match winner, plain and simple. If he carries on at this rate, he will get close to 30 goals this season. Needs to eliminate the unnecessary squabbling with opponents though. Clinical: Chelsea striker Diego Costa (right) nets the first of his two goals against Everton at Goodison Park . SUBS . JOHN OBI MIKEL . FILIPE LUIS . DIDIER DROGBA . UNUSED .

Mourinho, though, says he recognises no problem with the France forward ahead of a potential medical with Chelsea to replace Fernando Torres, who joined AC Milan on a two-year loan.

"By . Ashley Clements . Barcelona forward Neymar is the latest star to take on the Ice Bucket challenge after being dared to do so by Real Madrid defender Marcelo. The 22-year-old was sure to challenge some friends of his own before pouring the freezing bucket of water over his head. The global challenge looks set to continue after Neymar nominated his 'idol' Robinho, One Direction's Niall Horan and Juan Camilo Zuniga, the Colombian defender that ruled Neymar out of the latter stages of the World Cup with a horror challenge. Chilly: Neymar takes on the Ice Bucket Challenge after being nominate by Marcelo . What a friend: Real Madrid team-mate Fabio Coentrao soaks Cristiano Ronaldo for Ice Bucket Challenge . Freezing: The 22-year-old certainly didn't seem to enjoy being covered in cold water . The Ice Bucket Challenge craze originated in the United States with the intention of raising money for the Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) Association. ALS, also known as  Motor Neurone Disease, attacks the spinal cord and can lead to speech difficulties, muscle spasms and paralysis. It affects around 30,000 people in the US and 5,000 in the UK. Ex-Boston College baseball player Pete Frates came up with the idea, after his promisng career was cut short by ALS. He challenged friends and fellow Boston athletes, including some Boston Red Sox Players. Since it began, celebrities around the world have joined in, and the craze has now spread to football. Dare: Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge takes on the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge . Cristiano Ronaldo stripped down to his boxers to accept former Manchester United team-mate Darren Fletcher's Ice Bucket Challenge nomination - and then called on musicians Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and Lil Wayne to join in. The Real Madrid forward was soaked by his Portugal compatriot Fabio Coentrao while sat on a chair wearing just a pair of purple boxer shorts at the club's training ground at Valdebebas. On Friday, Fletcher challenged Ronaldo to take part, and the Portugal captain posted proof he had braved the ice cold water on social media platforms on Sunday. Keeping his composure: In a pair of purple boxer shorts, Ronaldo braves the ice cold water and puts thumbs up . In action: Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring for Real Madrid against Fiorentina on Saturday evening . Cold as ice: Ronaldo got his own back by soaking Real Madrid's Brazil international Marcelo . Pointing the finger: Darren Fletcher was understandably shivering after the challenge . Giving: The James McCarthy Foundation visited the Manchester United training ground on Thursday . Soaked: Paul Scholes receives a soaking from former team-mate Gary Neville after the Class of '92 match . Fletcher pledged his support to the Ice Bucket Challenge in aid of the James McCarthy Foundation, before nominating Ronaldo and another former United team-mate Wes Brown, now of Sunderland. The Manchester United midfielder was only too happy to receive two buckets of ice cold water over his head, dedicating it to James McCarthy, a young man from Manchester who has suffered with illness ever since a car crash in 2009. United legends Paul Scholes and Gary Neville had already undertaken the challenge after the Class of '92 match which took place last week.","Neymar and Daniel Sturridge latest stars to take on Ice Bucket Challenge .

"By . Simon Jones for MailOnline . Arsenal are watching with interest as Alessio Cerci has again been left out of Torino’s squad, this time to face Inter Milan. Arsenal have enquired about the Italy international but the stronger interest is coming from Atletico Madrid. Arsenal have been contacted again by Sporting Lisbon about a deal for William Carvalho and that may prove timely after Roma made Adrien Rabiot of Paris St Germain a tempting offer on Friday. Wenger is a big fan of Rabiot who is 19 and provides cover for various midfield positions. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manuel Pellegrini cagey about Radamel Falcao transfer rumour . Wing man: Arsenal are monitoring Italy international Alessio Cerci's situation at Torino . Carvalho has been pushed to Manchester United also but they do not wish to pursue a deal for a player they believe is overpriced. Sporting are willing to accept around £24m and would like a player on loan. The complication is third-party ownership and as Manchester United have found out that can delay proceedings. Not ideal with 48 hours to go. Benfica holding out for Campbell loan deal . Benfica, meanwhile, are holding out hope that Arsenal will allow Joel Campbell out on loan or even sell but that is extremely unlikely. Wenger has stipulated several times he wants the player to stay and may consider a late loan only if successful in signing a striker. Portugeezer? Benfica are interested in taking Arsenal reserve striker Joel Campbell (L) on loan . Manchester City not interested in Falcao . Manchester City say they are not in for Radamel Falcao despite the increasing fervour. City would have done a deal for the Colombia international a year ago but his injury and the division it would create in their squad means they are to abstain this time around. Monaco will listen to offers of a season loan for £12million or a permanent deal for £50million. Real Madrid have been widely expected to make the deal happen - that was certainly Liverpool’s understanding when they made enquiries earlier this month and the same was relayed to Arsenal last week. No deal: Manchester City have distanced themslves from a move for Monaco striker Radamel Falcao (L) Juventus and Arsenal have not ruled themselves out of Falcao but at the moment a deal is too rich. Juventus have also made an offer for Manchester United’s Javier Hernandez of a £1.5m loan with view to a permanent £12m deal and Valencia are keen on a similar price. Real Madrid tempted by Alvaro Negredo . Real Madrid however are now looking more closely at a deal for Alvaro Negredo at City. City have yet to decide whether he will be part of their Champions League squad and will listen to offers of around £25m. That is giving Falcao’s representatives reason to believe though that City could yet come back into play for Falcao. Negredo has a broken metatarsal and will be out until September but City are in no rush to deal unless a bid hits the mark. Valencia have an interest also but would struggle to pay the £25m. Spanish super fly: Real Madrid are considering a move for Manchester City 'Beast' Alvaro Negredo . QPR line up Sigthorsson to replace Remy . Harry Redknapp will now look to Ajax striker Kolbeinn Sigthorsson as a replacement for Loic Remy who has completed a £8.5 million move to Chelsea. Armand Traore has been left out of QPR’s team as he discusses a move to Crystal Palace. At least Redknapp can look forward to the signing of Lassana Diarra. The former Portsmouth midfielder has had a medical and is expected to sign tomorrow once he gains international clearance. Blues brother: Loic Remy has completed a transfer to Chelsea after club met his £8.5m release clause . Kagawa set for warm welcome at Dortmund . Borussia Dortmund midfielder Sebastian Kehl says Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa will be welcomed back to the German club with open arms. Yet Kehl has warned that the Japan international Kagawa who is returning to the Westphalians for £6.3m will not be the player they remember. The former Dortmund captain said: ‘Of course we’ve heard the latest speculation - we don’t live on the moon - but we were focusing on the game (against Augsburg). Homecoming? Shinji Kagawa is set for a return to his former club Borussia Dortmund . ‘Shinji was a very important factor in our side’s successes in 2011 and 2012. He delivered some fantastic performances in Dortmund, but unfortunately he’s not had such an easy time in Manchester. ‘He’s not been playing much and in particular his self-confidence is not going to be bubbling. ‘If he were to join us, then he would need to be built back up again, and he would find the surroundings here where he would be welcomed wholeheartedly, both from the fans and from the team. ‘He would get all the support he would need to be able to deliver his best performances again.’ Saints and Sunderland enter chase for Van Dijk . Southampton and Sunderland are among the clubs to have made phone calls to Celtic in the past few days. Hoop dreams: Defender Virgil Van Dijk is set to leave Celtic after elimination from Champions League . Centre-back Virgil Van Dijk has made it clear he wants to leave and Celtic will expect bids over the weekend. They want at least £6million plus add ons for the 23-year-old and believe they can push the price up with Premier League sides desperate for defenders. Leeds agree Adryan sale to Cagliari . LEEDS have an agreement in place with Cagliari for Brazilian playmaker Adryan. The move was agreed last night and should be formally announced during Saturday’s game with Bolton. Leeds are still working on a deal for Paraguay striker Brian Montenegro. One deal that Leeds are also hoping to push is for their next manager. Although Rolando Maran is the early favourite, Sportsmail understands that Swindon boss Mark Cooper is also a name in the frame. Malouda eyes Premier League return . Florent Malouda is looking for a return to England. The ex-Chelsea midfielder has terminated his agreement with Trabzonspor and believes he is fit to return to the Premier League despite being 34. He is now a free agent. A Bridge too far? Former Chelsea winger wants to return to the Premier League as a free agent . Another Frenchman  Morgan Amalfitano looks like being left on the shelf despite initial interest . Amalfitano has fallen out with Marseille coach Marcelo Bielsa and will be allowed to leave on a free but despite Crystal Palace, Hull and West Ham showing an initial interest the move has not materialised. Inter enquire about Borini loan . Sunderland, Everton and Marseille are among clubs asking about Porto defender Rolando. The powerful centre-back was on loan at Inter Milan last season and they are also interested in another loan deal. Inter have also asked about taking Liverpool striker Fabio Borini on loan which would ruin any hopes chance Sunderland hold of signing him before Monday. Italian job: Inter Milan have enquired about out of favour Liverpool striker Fabio Borini . Brentford left waiting on Forshaw . Brentford have concerns that a fee has yet to be finalised with Wigan for midfielder Adam Forshaw. It is understood the midfielder left the club on Monday and has not been back to the training ground as he expected his move to be finalised after the clubs seemingly reached an agreement. However, they have yet to confirm a £4million deal. Brentford will pay £2m of that to Everton as part of a 50percent sell-on agreement. Any minute now: Brentford are waiting to finalise a £4m deal from Wigan for midfielder Adam Forshaw .

"By . Leon Watson . A hero postman calmly carried on with his deliveries after breaking down the door of a blazing home to save a family inside. Phil Turner, 35, together with neighbours made sure the family, including two young children, were safely out of their house in Golborne, Greater Manchester. Mr Turner used his feet and shoulders to force open a door before leading a woman to safety. He had been delivering letters in the area just before 9am on Thursday, July 24. Postman Phil Turner, 35, saved a family, including two young children, from a burning home in Golborne, Greater Manchester, before continuing with his round . He said: 'When I turned into the avenue there was a bit of commotion outside the house. I carried on delivering letters but as I got closer I realised what was going on. 'One of the neighbours had already organised a rescue effort and there was a lad climbing up and down the ladder helping the kids out. 'It was just instinct - I thought I’ve got to help get them out so I gave the front door a boot. 'I made sure everyone was out safely and then just carried on with my round. You come across all kinds of things as a postman but this is definitely the most shocking situation that I’ve come across in my 17 years.' The family all suffered from smoke inhalation as did one of the rescuers, while another suffered cuts to his hands and legs as he tried to enter the house. 'First and foremost, I want to make it clear that it was the first person on the scene who organised the rescue effort and did the most,' said Mr Turner, who lives in Newton. Mr Turner and neighbours made sure the family, including two young children, were safely out of their house in Golborne, Greater Manchester . 'One lad actually went inside the house. If I had arrived a bit earlier maybe I would have played a bigger role.' Crews from Leigh and Wigan Fire arrived after the family had been rescued and extinguished the fire. Fire station manager Steve Sheridan said: 'The house is on a cul-de-sac and all the neighbours can see each other’s homes. 'After seeing the house was on fire one of the neighbours pitched a ladder and rescued two young children, then the postman turned up, shouldered the door in and got their mum out through the front door. 'Another neighbour went round the back and smashed the back door in to try to get them out too. 'They have all done a fantastic job to rescue this family - their actions have potentially saved their lives. 'We think the fire has started in the living room. The firefighters quickly extinguished the fire, which involved a settee in the living room of the house.'","Phil Turner, together with neighbours, made sure the family were safe .

"By . Jack Gaughan . Follow @@Jack_Gaughan . Manchester City’s attempts to sign Monaco striker Radamel Falcao looked in tatters on Saturday night when the player all but confirmed his move to Real Madrid. Manuel Pellegrini saw City’s vast array of attacking talent - including Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic - comfortably stifled by a resolute Stoke on an afternoon that will have him worried. Falcao is available on loan from Monaco, but both City and Arsenal baulked at the asking price of £20million for the season. Scroll down for videos... Matter of time: Radamel Falcao was sat out of Monaco's game with agent Jorge Mendes (L) Done deal? Colombian international tweeted about his move to the Bernabeu before the message was deleted . Farewell? Radamel Falcao gives a thumbs up on what could be his final appearance at the Louis II stadium . Pellegrini, however, would not rule out a move for Falcao when asked after the defeat. ‘We have another 48 hours,’ he said. ‘We will see what happens. We have a very important restriction about the amount of money we can spend and the amount of players we can use. It’s not easy.’ Difficulties arise with the Financial Fair Play restrictions slapped upon City; they were fined £49m in June for breaching UEFA rules and have to be mindful of the regulations this season. Falcao’s wages of around £200,000-a-week would see the overall package Monaco are asking for reach £30m. Pellegrini was ready to sanction a deal for Falcao, but the striker yesterday tweeted news of his move to the Champions League holders — including the words ‘It’s a dream come true’ — before deleting his post shortly after.

"By . Becky Barrow . and Rob Davies . A postman on his bicycle delivering letters is one of our most familiar sights. But not for much longer, Royal Mail said yesterday. The chairman, Donald Brydon, said: ‘I’m afraid bicycles are going to be a thing of the past’, a decision which he described as ‘sad’. Speaking in Birmingham at Royal Mail's annual general meeting, company chairman Donald Brydon said 'bicycles are going to be a thing of the past', a decision which he described as 'sad' (file picture) As a boy growing up in Edinburgh, he said it was ‘one of the thrills’ of his childhood to be allowed to ride on his local postman’s bicycle. Speaking in Birmingham at the company’s first annual general meeting since its controversial privatisation in October, he said: ‘I remember as a boy in Edinburgh – when the postman came, he came on an old, black bicycle. ‘One of the thrills for me as a five or six-year old was to be allowed to sit on his bike and he pulled the bike along the road and he had his bag of letters slung over his shoulder at that time. ‘It is sad I think that bicycles are no longer the most effective way of transporting mail.’ While the numbers of letters being sent drops year by year, a postman’s bag is now filled with more and more parcels. The Royal Mail chairman said bicycles were no longer the most effective way of transporting mail (file picture) Mr Brydon said it can be ‘very unstable’ to use a bicycle to deliver parcels so they are being replaced either by trolleys, typically in urban areas, or vans, mostly used in rural areas. Some rounds are still done by bicycle, such as those in David Cameron’s constituency of Witney, Oxfordshire. The decision to use bicycles is taken by the local delivery office. Royal Mail’s fleet of redundant bicycles are sent out to Africa to help local people, such as children to get to school or nurses to do their rounds.","Royal Mail chairman confirmed 'bicycles are going to be a thing of the past'

At the end of a week in which Garry Monk questioned Roy Hodgson’s continued absence from the Liberty Stadium, two Englishmen gave Swansea City their third win in three and another proved his sublime traits don’t always come saddled with the ridiculous. For this was not just about West Brom’s numerous mistakes and three well-taken goals from Nathan Dyer and Wayne Routledge, the first of which came inside two minutes and the second was quite brilliant. This was also about Jonjo Shelvey, so dynamic in his bursts from deep positions, but all too often a victim of his seemingly insatiable desire to over-complicate things.Last weekend, against Burnley, he followed a 50-yard pass with a simpler one straight into touch. Here, he got the balance right. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Jack to a King: Official trailer for Swansea City film is released .

Brilliant, composed and faultless – on his game he is an attacking force that deserves higher consideration. If that caveat leaves too much room for doubt, Hodgson could at least justify the mileage by watching the two English wingers who tore West Brom apart. Leon Britton, the best of the lot, is injured for the next three weeks. A modicum of perspective ought to be given to how poor West Brom played. Winless in three with two draws, this was often poor, occasionally inept. For each goal, they could have done so much better. The first can be chalked to bad luck, such was the calamity of timing that led Jonas Olsson to slip at precisely the wrong moment. Wilfried Bony and Dyer had exchanged passes before the latter played in Gylfi Sigurdsson, who backheeled the ball ahead of Dyer. Olsson had a decent headstart and was shepherding the ball towards Ben Foster but then he slipped. Dyer went through, rounded Foster and scored his second goal in successive Premier League games. Dyer is one of the players Monk is known to think should have drawn attention from England’s manager. As is Routledge. His goal 22 minutes later owed more to technical brilliance than good fortune, but once more West Brom did little to help themselves. They were placed under far too much pressure by a careless pass from Chris Brunt, who was stationed in his own area and rolled the ball straight to Sigurdsson. Sigurdsson’s cross was met by Craig Dawson but his weak header went straight to Routledge on the edge of the area. The ball bounced high but the execution of Routledge’s half volley was perfect, the goal stunning. Enough mistakes? Evidently not. Bang: Wayne Routledge unleashes a vicious shot that finds its way towards the top-right corner of the goal and cements Swansea City's lead over West Brom .

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . Olsson headed against his own crossbar after 31 minutes and it was a further nine before they had a meaningful chance, Saido Berahino shotting straight at Lukasz Fabianski. Even without the problems of a weak defence, the touches were sloppy, the attacks predictable. Had Routledge’s next half volley, arguably an even better strike than the first, gone into the top corner after 43 minutes, it would have been game over. He looked annoyed to have missed but he need not have been. West Brom had nothing to offer. When Berahino shot in the 69th minute, it went out for a throw-in. By then West Brom were lucky to have avoided a penalty when Andre Wisdom handled a shot from Bony on the line. It was only a temporary escape. With 19 minutes still to play, Dyer put the boot in. Angel Rangel found Sigurdsson and he created his third of the afternoon with a perfect pass for Dyer. The winger went through, no marker close enough, and slid a low shot past Foster. The M4 is a long road and Swansea sits near the end of it. It’s surely worth a trip for Hodgson at some point.

Fiery: West Brom's Craig Gardner and Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson square up during the intense clash between the two Premier League sides . Strike:  Dyer bags his brace against West Brom in the home tie with a shot in the 71st minute to make it 3-0 to Swansea .

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . The Ice Bucket Challenge phenomenon continues to thrive with  Luis Suarez the latest sportsperson to take the plunge in aid of the charitable cause. Despite making a move away from Liverpool earlier this summer, the Uruguayan has been far from forgotten with his former team-mate Lucas Leiva nominating him to undertake the challenge. And Suarez had no hesitations in participating, shortly after challenging another of his former team-mates Martin Skrtel, as well as Nicolás Lodeiro and Martín Cauterucci to step up to the plate next. Uh oh: Suarez gets ready to undertake the Ice Bucket Challenge . Freezing: Suarez accepted the challenge from former Liverpool team-mate Lucas Leiva .

Battler: Suarez will wear his heart on his sleeve whenever he turns out for the Catalan giants . So far over £13million has been raised worldwide with the challenge going viral over the past week - all in support of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Elsewhere, Suarez is currently serving a four month domestic ban as well as a nine-match international suspension for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup. However, he was able to make his debut for the Catalan giants as a late substitute in a 6-0 friendly victory over Mexican side Club Leon on Monday, after the terms of his ban were reduced. He is expected to make his competitive debut in a mouthwatering clash against arch-rivals Real Madrid in El Clasico when his ban ends at the end of October. 69010 . 30070 . 29443 . 56680 . 56077 . 60233 . 60094 . 59908 . 57029 . 58329 . 55937 . 58631 . 62555 . 53685 . 59722 . 55427 . 60094 . 60094 . 34691 . 43770 . 32694 . 32973 . 41611 . 66201 . 76998 . 56402 . 31278 . 63925 . 60094 . 58004 . 52872 . 67280 . 39846 . 15080 . 60419 . 58631 . 55078 . 38383 . 10194 . 47880 . 60233 . 45697 . 60094 . 57040 . 60814 . 56040 . 29443 . 51800 . 49600 . 60233 . 70891 . 43120 . 52687 . 60094 . 60256 . 60094 . 54637 . 48995 . 55264 .","The Barcelona striker was nominated by former Liverpool team-mate Lucas Leiva .

"By . Mike Dickson for The Mail on Sunday . Andy Murray has not only reached the second week of the US Open, he is also likely to have seen the back of the Louis Armstrong Stadium, where he rarely fails to flirt with danger. The 2012 champion will hope to be back on the main Arthur Ashe Stadium for the rest of the event after nearly allowing a mini crisis to become another drama on Flushing Meadows' more disheveled secondary arena. Having started beautifully he suddenly had all the positive energy drain from him in the third set before beating the free hitting Russian Andrey Kuznetsov 6-1, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2 in two hours and 36 minutes. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Andy Murray practice with Novak Djokovic ahead of US Open . Fist pump: Andy Murray reached the fourth round of the US Open with victory over Andrey Kuznetsov . Who's next? Andy Murray will play Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the next round . Quick off the mark: The British No 1 raced through the opening set despite blustery conditions in New York . To Russia with love: Andy Murray shakes hands with his opponent Andrey Kuznetsov after thematch . It may continue to be this way until he gains the confidence from beating top ten players again, and he has that chance on Monday against Frenchman Jo Wilfried Tsonga, who meets him in the fourth round. These seems little point in looking beyond that to a possible quarter final with Novak Djokovic, who is looking ominously good after faltering badly in his two post-Wimbledon tournaments, and has reached the last sixteen for the loss of just eighteen games. The Scot's performance was a football-style game of two halves that saw him unexpectedly lapse into some bad pre-Ivan Lendl habits in the third set marked by poor body language and outbursts against himself. His new coach Amelie Mauresmo will try and cajole him out of that, and her influence may have been behind his high count of well-judged forays to the net. Yet it was his traditionally outstanding returning skills that decided a match against a frustrating opponent who enjoyed several hot streaks. Murray managed to break serve eight times in all, ruthlessly exploiting the relatively weak Kuznetsov serve. There are unlikely to be such pickings on offer in the next round. Ultimately he survived another visit to an arena he finds tricky, where early in the fourth set he complained about the dangerous proximity of a television camera at the back of the tight arena. 'I wasn't cross, just making the point that I nearly ran straight into the camera with my knee,' he said. 'Obviously I've had a couple of bad experiences there. Last Monday was not a great experience. That's hard to put out of your mind. 'On this court the wind swirls around a lot. Sometimes you can play four games in a row into the wind because it changes so often. That's tricky. Also it's a very tight There's not much runback compared with Ashe. 'Today the match could have been a bit quicker if I got that breakpoint at 4-All in the third set. But each time I had a slip, I did a decent job of getting myself back into the sets, getting a break straightaway.' Love game: Andy Murray was watched by his girlfriend Kim Sears (left) from the stands . Different class: World No 96 Andrey Kuznetsov could not keep pace with the former US Open champion . Support act: Andy Murray was cheered on throughout the match by four fans wearing his name on their vests . From the off the 27 year-old Scot looked a lot sharper than he did in the first round, as he tries to gain the full momentum that has been elusive this year, with the run at the French Open into the semi-finals the nearest he has come to finding it. A second break made it a comfortable first set and all his vital signs were in good working order, with impressive movement and the backhand being manoeuvred with its old metronomic efficiency. He was also getting plenty of free points in his last two meetings with the swinging serve into the deuce court. The close to ideal mix of defence and attack that he constantly seeks continued with an early break in the second, which was wiped out by a sudden streak of winners from the Russian which brought him back level. Only at 5-5 did Murray reassert his superiority, again crunching away the short second serves of Kuznetsov to break handsomely and then serve it out minus any dramas, concluding with a loud 'Come On!' Clash of the titans: The Scotsman remains on course to face No 1 seed Novak Djokovic in the quarter finals . Loss of concentration: Andy Murray grimaces after losing a closely contested fourth set . That should really have sealed matters, only for the number eight seed to lapse as he is wont to do in a way you rarely see from the likes of Djokovic or Rafael Nadal when they are really firing. The positive energy suddenly seeped from Murray as Kuznetsov upped his level and, letting out a tirade of abuse at himself and allowing his body language to sag, he played a poor game against the highly mobile Russian to be broken for 3-1, capping with a double fault. Fortunately he was again able to pull level thanks largely to his ability to punish anything short on the second serve, but it is one of his mysteries how he sometimes manage to tune out of a match without any warning and get so frustrated. Having restored order and missed two break points at 4-4, one of them lost to flukey net cord, he threw in another poor game to lose the set with a double fault. After taking the dreaded toilet break to compose himself he came out and trampled all over the Russian's serve to get over the line. He and Tsonga have a long rivalry with Murray normally coming out on top when it matters. Monday represents an opportunity, albeit a challenging one, to set himself up for the hardest task of all, the rejuvenated Djokovic.

"By . James Tozer for the Daily Mail . Victoria Smith was attacked as she left a house party in Hull . A teenage model fears she has been left blind in one eye after a girl threw bleach in her face in a horrifying attack. Victoria Smith, 17, was leaving a house party near her home when she was allegedly ‘ambushed’ by a group of youths and subjected to the terrifying ordeal. Yesterday Miss Smith – who claims not to have gone to school for more than a year after suffering a seven-year bullying campaign – described how the ‘excruciating’ attack has left her too scared to leave the house. Writing on Facebook as Toria Melody, the name she uses in her budding modelling career, she said: ‘One of my eyes is now physically impaired and I am blind in it, I will most likely never receive my vision in my right eye again. ‘The outer layer of my eyes are permanently damaged and my hair has turned green from the bleach and has fallen out at the front.’ She says the acid has left her with burns on her body and ‘excruciating pain in my eyes’. ‘They are red raw, it went in my mouth, up my nose and I couldn’t breathe,’ she added. The teenager, a student at Wilberforce Sixth Form College in her home city of Hull, said she had only recently plucked up the courage to start leaving the house again after what she claimed was a campaign of bullying at her former school, Malet Lambert. ‘It took me a year to finally start leaving my house and going to college after not going to school for more than a year and being so terrified of people after being bullied for over seven years,’ she added. ‘This has 100 per cent set me back and I honestly cannot see myself coming out again for a long time.’ She added that if it hadn’t been for one of her friends, Bethany Wilkinson, ‘I would be completely blind and most probably dead’. Another friend, Beth Ridley, posted on Facebook that ‘some sick b*****d set her up [and] got us to come to a gathering then threw bleach in Toria’s face and eyes’. She added: ‘Don’t understand how ya can do that to another person but thankfully she’s gonna be okay.’ Miss Smith told police she was attacked at the junction of Albert Avenue and Cobden Street in Hull at 9.20pm on Wednesday as she left a house party with friends. She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary. Hundreds of wellwishers commented on her Facebook post after reading details of the attack. The 17-year-old model said she may never regain sight in her right eye after the attack which has left her scared to go out again . Victoria said she had suffered at the hands of bullies for years before the attack and has now lost all her confidence .

Morgan Schneiderlin could not muster the mental strength to play for Southampton a few weeks ago, such was his desire to leave the club. But he committed himself to the task at hand, scoring twice to secure victory for his team. The Frenchman is now ‘99 per cent certain’ still to be at the club after the transfer window closes, according to boss Ronald Koeman. If Southampton are to repeat the success of last season, when they finished eighth, they need him to stay. Koeman said he is confident the group of players he has can dispel the gloom and doom that descended since the departure of Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, among others. The manner in which they came from behind to beat West Ham at home did nothing to contradict that belief.

I told them at half- time to play as winners and they kept that spirit.’ The afternoon began with an almost full Upton Park brimming with optimism to greet the unveiling of former Arsenal star Alex Song, brought in on loan from Barcelona. The new recruit watched from the stands but may have been longing for Catalonia after his team-mates let their lead slip in dire fashion. Boos rang out from the hardy souls who remained until the final whistle. The players trudged off the pitch looking downtrodden and Sam Allardyce did little to improve their mood in the changing room. ‘There was nothing to be pleased about,’ he said. ‘It was an under-par performance across the board and perhaps some of the players need a reality check.’ West Ham claimed they had ‘fought off interest’ from Europe’s biggest clubs to seal the Song deal. Allardyce laid a big task at his feet. ‘I hope as well as his quality he will bring experience and leadership,’ he said. ‘I hope he will kick a few backsides on the pitch. It doesn’t appear like anybody is taking responsibility.’ West Ham went ahead in the 26th minute. Upton Park new boy Mauro Zarate exploited a rare hiccup by Schneiderlin, catching him in possession and passing to Mark Noble, whose shot from outside the area deflected off Maya Yoshida and to the left of Fraser Forster. Serbia midfielder Dusan Tadic was identified as a danger before the match by Allardyce and he lived up to his billing. Tadic’s free-kick just before half-time reached Schneiderlin, whose right-footed shot was blocked but he finished with his left foot into the top corner. West Ham’s defence was exposed again after 68 minutes when Tadic played a short corner to Ward-Prowse, who crossed for Scheiderlin to volley in. ‘I was pleased with his attitude,’ said Koeman, ‘It’s been difficult for him. I understand his situation with offers from other clubs but he is happy now.’ A first Premier League goal for Italian striker Graziano Pelle’s sealed victory for Southampton.

"By . Chris Waugh for MailOnline . Follow @@ChrisDHWaugh . Diego Costa once more highlighted how deadly he can be as the Chelsea striker bagged a brace against Everton - but he also showed the darker side of his game at Goodison Park. The £32million summer signing continued his remarkable run of form by netting twice - the first after 34 seconds and the second in the 90th minute - to make it four goals in just three Premier League appearances. Yet Costa was also involved in a series of heated incidents on the pitch during Chelsea's 6-3 victory. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Roberto Martinez: Diego Costa needs to learn some respect .

The 25-year-old squared up to both Seamus Coleman and Tim Howard, as well as Everton defender Sylvain Distin. He was also booked during the high-scoring encounter. Costa and Coleman were warned by the referee for pushing and shoving, but the Spanish international continued even after the talking-to and was cautioned for it. But that just riled Costa even more. After Coleman had put into his own goal, Costa picked the ball out of the net and ran past Coleman, screaming and gloating in the Irishman's face. The striker was then confronted by Everton 'keeper Howard, who squared up to him and was cautioned for the incident. And Everton manager Roberto Martinez revealed that some of his players had complained about Costa's behaviour during the game.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho defended the actions of his player, however. He said: 'To be chasing cards to a player who once more had good behaviour and was just here to play football is disappointing. 'At the end of the story Diego is maybe the best player in the Premier League in the first three matches and he has two yellow cards; one against Burnley where he didn't simulate it was a penalty and today when everyone was chasing him to get him in trouble.

"By . Chris Waugh . Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas looked like a child who had been sent to the naughty step after appearing to be snubbed by team-mate Alvaro Arbeloa in the tunnel ahead of the Spanish Super Cup first-leg tie with rivals Atletico Madrid. Substitute Arbeloa was filmed walking past his team-mates who were starting the game, hugging and tapping stars including Gareth Bale, Marcelo and Pepe. When the defender reached Casillas, however, he appeared to completely blank the goalkeeper and walked on without acknowledging him.

Kicking off: Iker Casillas and Alvaro Arbeloa, here in 2010, have had a difficult relationship as of late . SPANISH SUPER CUP SNUB . Despite acknowledging and embracing his other team-mates in the tunnel, Arbeloa appeared to blank and ignore his captain before Real met rivals Atletico. SPLIT OVER THE SPECIAL ONE . Arbeloa was a fervent supporter of the Portuguese during his reign at Real. Casillas did not like Mourinho's methods and was dropped during his time in the Spanish capital. The pair fell out as a result of their difference of opinion. SOCIAL MEDIA WAR . Madrid captain Casillas liked an Instagram post earlier this month criticising fellow stopper Diego Lopez and calling Arbeloa a 'cone'  -referring to the defender's lack of mobility. Arbeloa responded by retweeting a link a book which referred to Casillas as a 'tumour on Real Madrid'. Casillas appeared a little sheepish after the incident and stared into the camera tentatively. This appears to be just the latest incident in a long feud that has developed between the pair. While Casillas was a well-known and out-spoken critic of Jose Mourinho during his time in charge of Madrid, Arbeloa was a fervent supporter of the Portuguese. Casillas even found himself dropped to the bench by Mourinho, and subsequently current boss Carlo Ancelotti, while Arbeloa proved a crucial figure during the self-proclaimed Special One's reign. Their difference in opinion over Mourinho reportedly led to a breakdown in their relationship, despite them being both Spain and Real Madrid team-mates. Earlier this month tensions grew even further between the pair when Arbeloa retweeted a link to a book which referred to Casillas as a 'tumour on Real Madrid'. The Spanish World Cup-winning goalkeeper, meanwhile, had earlier liked an Instagram post from a fan which criticised fellow stopper Diego Lopez and called Arbeloa a 'cone' - referring to the defender's lack of mobility.

Tormented Molly Glen, 12, often came home from primary school in floods of tears after being tripped up, punched and verbally abused by bullies simply because of her hair colour. But even outside the classroom Molly, from Bathgate, West Lothian, could not escape from the torrent of abuse. Scroll down for video . Molly has finally found confidence in her looks after joining Ashley Brown self-esteem model school . Despite the horrendous bullying and tragic loss of her father when she was just six-months-old, mother Mandy (left) said Molly had shown 'bravery beyond her years' Like many girls her age she used social media sites but while chatting with friends she was trolled by cyber-bullies. Fed-up with being the butt of jokes about having ginger hair, Molly joined Ashley Brown self-esteem model school and her life began to change for the better. The 12-year-old said: 'The classes really helped my confidence. I met a lot of new friends who I still stay in touch with.' Defiant Molly impressed leaders so much she was offered the chance to compete in the Junior Teen UK competition, and won a runner-up prize. She is now gearing up to compete at Junior Teen Great Britain later this month. Molly said: 'I'm really looking forward to competing in Blackpool and having my mum watching me in the crowd. Proud mother Mandy, who raised her daughter on her own since her husband Ian died in 2002, said: 'Molly would come home from school and she'd barely say a word to me.

"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . With its clear azure sea and lush palm trees, the town of Rabaul on East New Britain Island in Papua New Guinea should be a gorgeous slice of tropical paradise. But as these incredible photos reveal, that couldn't be further from the truth. Once a thriving holiday destination, Rabaul was left virtually empty when, 20 years ago, Tavurvur, Vulcan and Rabalankaia, three volcanoes on the edge of town, erupted - smothering the town in layers of volcanic ash and scalding lava. But despite the risk of further eruptions and the grim landscape, described by photographer Eric Lafforgue as 'Hell on Earth', some families, too poor to move, have been left to scratch a living in the rubble, while their children play in the scarred, otherworldly landscape left behind. Bleak: A little boy sits on a hillock covered in grey ash and stunted grass just outside the ruined town of Rabaul in Papua New Guinea's East New Britain Island . Dangerous: Soft clouds of falling ash are a daily hazard for families living in the area, many of whom go on to develop respiratory diseases as well as lung cancer . Abandoned: For 10-year-old Ben, the abandoned town is the perfect playground while, right, many of the apartment blocks are now derelict and visited only by animals . Beautiful: With its azure waters and golden beaches, Rabaul ought to be a tropical paradise but as this photo reveals, its three volcanoes have covered it in ash . 'Over 30,000 people left the town itself and a further 50,000 ran from the surrounding area,' explains Lafforgue. 'Only four people lost their lives in the eruption, although one other was killed by a lighting strike on the southern flank of Vulcan.' Those who remain spend their days hunting for eggs laid two metres below the top layer of ash by the megapode bird or eking out a living by sweeping up ash or guarding the derelict remains of the town's hotels. Many lost their homes during the 1994 eruption and have moved into other, less damaged, properties although like everyone else who lives near the volcanoes, they run the risk of developing respiratory diseases and lung cancer as a result of the ash cloud. One man who knows only too well what the volcano can do is former deputy mayor, Mr Jewakauckesa. His wife was one of those killed during the explosion and his son has moved to another town, so now he lives alone in his tiny house in the shadows of Tavurvur. Devastating: Former deputy mayor of Rabaul, Mr Jewakauckes, lives alone in front of Tavurvur, which he has done ever since his wife was killed in the 1994 eruption . Scratching a living: Although Ben loves living in the volcanic wasteland, his father has to eke out a living as a security guard protecting abandoned hotels from looters . Dangerous job: Megapode birds lay their eggs two metres below the surface of the volcanic sands and the locals make money by digging them up and selling them . Dirty job: Getting to the megapode eggs requires hours of digging but once collected, the eggs can sell for up to 60p ($1) each at market . Risky: Like others working close to the three volcanoes, egg collectors risk a close encounter with scalding ash and also respiratory diseases and lung cancer . Tradition: Locals who remain in the area have clung on to their traditions, among them the Tubuan Dance which is performed wearing huge Duk Duk masks . Dowry: To marry, locals pay a dowry in the form of shell money - 400 of these huge hoops are usually required, which involves collecting thousands of shells . Strange world: Most of the people living in the area have homes in villages outside Rabaul and away from the volcanoes and the ash cloud, like this father and son . Fire dance: The Baining fire dance is performed by tribespeople living around the volcanoes and includes dancing over live coals to mimic the look of an eruption . 'He has stopped buying cars because they stop working after two years thanks to the ash,' adds Lafforgue. Others still living in the ruins include 10-year-old Ben, whose father works as a security guard for one of the ruined hotels. 'He enjoys the place,' says Lafforgue. 'It's like a giant playground for a child because there's no cars to worry about and plenty of sand and dust to roll about in.' Other children play on the wrecks of World War Two era Japanese, British and US tanks, which lie encased in ash among the rubble and date from the Japanese occupation that began in January 1942. Not long before that, the town had been rocked by yet another eruption that killed more than 500 people, although later planners chose to ignore the ominous rumblings from the volcanoes, even building an airport at the base of Vulcan. 'The airport was directly in the path of ash and lava from the nearby vents,' explains Lafforgue of the airfield, which now lies buried under tonnes of molten lava. 'Nobody knows why they built it at the foot of the volcano - it was a very strange thing to do, given the previous eruptions.' Hidden: . Although the Karavia Tunnels were relatively untouched by the eruption, . the catacombs, and the Japanese landing craft within, have been . abandoned . Barren: . Following the explosion in 1994, ash and lava rained down on the town . and surrounding area leaving a pock marked blasted wasteland behind . Bad . idea: This pool of molten lava and volcanic ash is all that remains of . Rabaul's airport which was built at the foot of Tavurvur and was . completely destroyed in 1994 . Explosive: . Since the 1994 eruption, the volcanoes have continued to emit huge . clouds of ash which can be seen all over East New Britain Island . Barren: . This area was once known as Mango Avenue but thanks to the 1994 . eruption, all the fruit trees have been burned and nothing now grows . Also destroyed in the 1994 eruption were the townsfolk's fruit trees, with one plantation - formerly known as Mango Avenue - now a wasteland of charred branches and solidified ash. Nevertheless, some of the traditions do remain, among them the Baining dancers from the local Tolai tribe, who wear giant masks that are never seen during the day and jump into the fire, kicking the ashes as they go. The Tolai also retain their custom of charging a bride price payable in 'shell money', which is made from hundreds of delicately polished pieces of mother of pearl, and are the only remaining Papua New Guineans to perform the 'Tubuan dance' which they do wearing enormous Duk Duk masks. But while the locals do their best to cling on to their traditions, few are still around to enjoy them and with another eruption expected in 2050, that small number could soon be reduced to none. Filthy . job: The best paying job in Rabaul is that of street cleaner with . regular sweeping required to keep the ash spewing from the volcanoes . from smothering the town . Smothered: So thick is the ashy layer on homes, . fields and businesses, it has caused 80 per cent of the buildings in the . area to collapse under its weight . Buried: . Thanks to the 1942 Japanese occupation, Rabaul is home to scores of old . tanks, in this case an American one, which now lie buried beneath heaps . of ash . Blighted: The only remaining hotel in Rabaul . specialises in volcano views (left) while even the opposite side of the . bay from Rabaul is blighted by the ash cloud (right) Deadly: .

Lynsey Sharp is determined to be a part of a new golden age of British athletics after targeting medal success at the World Championships and Olympics over the next two years. The 24-year-old Scot won 800 metres silver at the European Championships in Zurich, just missing out on defending her title from Helsinki two years ago despite setting a personal best and a new Scottish record. The Euros were a huge success for the British contingent, with the team finishing top of the medals table with 12 golds, five silver and six bronze. Back on the track: Lynsey Sharp smiles as she puts radio presenter Greg James (back) through his paces . Sharp, who also won Commonwealth Games silver at Glasgow 2014, is now determined to build on that and has set her sights on podium finishes at the next two major events in the athletics calendar. The Loughbrough-based athlete has also targeted Dame Kelly Holmes’ British record. ‘Now that the Commonwealth Games and Europeans are out the way, the World Championships (in 2015) and the 2016 Olympics come into focus,’ said Sharp, who will be helping Radio 1 DJ Greg James prepare for the Bupa Great North Run next month. Flying the flag: Sharp celebrates after winning silver in the women's 800m at the European Championships . Home success: Sharp reacts after winning silver in the 800m at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . ‘If I can medal at all four major championships, that would be a great achievement. ‘I’d love to win a gold at the World Championships next year to add to my European gold - and then I’d like to try and medal at the Olympics in Rio. Then another target is to break the British Record. But it’s all going to take a lot of hard work.’ As part of Bupa’s Your First Step Campaign, elite athlete Lynsey Sharp put Greg James through his paces to prove that even with limited time, busy Brits can still achieve their goals.

"By . Helen Pow . A San Diego woman has been charged with soliciting forcible rape and sodomy on a rival who, with her husband, bought a house she had her eye on. Kathy Rowe was so furious after she missed out on purchasing the Carmel Valley home, she decided to make the new owners' lives a living hell. According to a criminal complaint, she unleashed her fury by impersonating the woman in a sexually-explicit online advertisement that requested stranger men force their way into her house and 'take me while I say no.' Scroll down for video . Hell: Kathy Rowe was so furious after she missed out on purchasing the home in Carmel Valley, California, pictured, that she decided to make the new owners' lives a living hell . Rowe's ad for the 'Carmel Valley Freak Show' was graphic and encouraged interested men to contact the woman for sexual favors of all kinds while her husband was at work, NBC 7 reported. She told at least one man, who responded with a naked picture of himself, to 'just stop by any Monday-Friday 9am-3pm,' and sent him an image of the victim, which she took from a social media website. 'I love to be surprised and have a man just show up at the door and force his way in the door and on me, totally taking me while I say no,' she wrote, before explaining that she loves anal sex and threesomes. Another man responded to the notice and ended up going round to the victim's home but no one answered the door. The husband answered the door on a subsequent visit. Prosecutors claim Rowe also harassed the couple by listing their home for sale, putting a hold on the couple's mail, sending Valentine;s Day cards from the husband to married women in the neighborhood and having members of religious groups visit the home. She also allegedly posted an online announcement for a high school New Year's Eve party at the victim's home and a free Mexican fireworks giveaway on Independence Day. Rowe was charged with soliciting forcible rape and forcible sodomy, and other crimes. However, a Superior Court judge dismissed the most serious of those charges before trial because she didn't believe Rowe actually intended for the woman to be raped. The district attorney's office disagreed, and appealed the judge’s ruling and the Forth District Court of Appeal reinstated the criminal charges. Rowe's lawyer Brad Patto told NBC 7 his client deeply regrets her behavior, which she initially denied. However he said the actions were nothing more than 'prankish behavior.' He added that the woman had sent written apologies to the husband and wife. It's not known when the case will go to trial.","San Diego woman Kathy Rowe was so angry after she missed out on the home, she allegedly decided to make the new owners' lives a living hell .

"By . Jill Reilly . Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg's first attempt into the world of politics has left him looking boastful and arrogant. The 28-year-old is planning to launch a new . political advocacy group made up of Silicon Valley figures which will initially . concentrate on immigration and education reform. But a leaked  prospectus for the Political Action Committee has revealed boasts that figures in the . information technology industry will be able to project spectacular . political power due to their bank balance and social standing. Red-faced: Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg's first attempt into the world of politics has left him looking boastful and arrogant . The claims come in an e-mail document . drawn up by Joe Green who has . been tipped to run the new advocacy group, reported political newspaper Politico. Joe Green is the former college roommate of Mr Zuckerberg who, unlike his famous friend, decided to stay enrolled in Harvard instead of dropping out to make Facebook. Under a section titled 'our tactical assets,' the prospectus lists three reasons why 'people in tech' can be organized into 'one of the most powerful political forces.' The claims come in an e-mail document drawn up by Joe Green, Mr Zuckerberg's former Harvard roommate, who has been tipped to run the new advocacy group . '1: We control massive distribution channels, both as companies and individuals. We saw the tip of the iceberg with SOPA/PIPA. '2: 'Our voice carries a lot of weight because we are broadly popular with Americans. '3. We have individuals with a lot of . money. If deployed properly this can have huge influence in the current . campaign finance environment.' Pledge: The prospectus also states that Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a founding member of the group . The prospectus also states that . Microsoft founder Bill Gates is founding member of the group named 'Human Capital.' Source suggests that Mr Gates has not yet signed up and the group will not go by that name. After discovering it had been leaked Mr Green issued a statement saying: . 'Some of the information contained in . this email is outdated and not representative of the kind of work this . organization will perform. Moreover, I regret some of the language in . the email was poorly-chosen and could give a misimpression of the views . and aspirations of this organization and those associated with it.' The Facebook founder has slowly been merging into the political scene with a few scattered donations in the past, but now he will have a formal avenue where he can direct funding towards projects- and candidates- close to his heart. Though he remained relatively neutral politically in previous years, his allegiances have become more and more public of late. In February the California-based, New York native held a fundraiser in Silicon Valley for New Jersey governor Chris Christie. Fast friends: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, center, and Newark Mayor Cory Booker, right, spoke at an educational summit earlier this year . Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla become close with the governor since he donated $100million in 2011 to help improve public schools in one of the state's toughest cities. A fan with that kind of money could undoubtedly be helpful for Mr Christie as he evaluates his presidential prospects for 2016. 'They admire his leadership on education reform and other issues and look forward to continuing their important work together on behalf of Newark's school children. Mark and Priscilla are happy to host him at their home to support his re-election,' Facebook spokesman Sarah Feinberg told Buzzfeed. Prior to the Christie fundraiser, Zuckerberg had kept his political leanings close to the vest. He predictably posted in January about the proposed laws relating to internet privacy, but it also comes as the Facebook office in DC has bulked up their public policy presence. Host and hostess: Zuckerberg's wife, Priscilla Chan, helped entertain Gov. Christie at their home for the fundraiser . Just last week, they released a picture of Republican Congressman Bill Johnson signing a wall at the DC office when he came in for a visit with their policy team about an unspecified topic. Aside from his 2010 donation to Newark public schools and the fundraiser for Christie last month, Zuckerberg’s only publicly-recorded donations have been to the Political Action Committee run by his company. From there, the Facebook PAC has donated to a spread of both Democratic and Republican politicians. Radio silence: Until now, Zuckerberg has been fairly reserved in his political spending, only donating $5,000 twice to Facebook's political action committee . His spending hasn’t been limited to political campaigns, as he and his pediatrician wife donated a total of $498.8million to charitable causes in 2012, putting them in line after billionaire Warren Buffett. The Chronicle of Philanthropy reported that he donated 18 million shares of Facebook stock to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation in 2012. The shares are valued at about $498.8million and he directed it towards the local group. Education and health programs are two of the many ways that the non-profit directs their funds. 'Together, we will look for areas in education and health to focus on next. I'm hopeful we'll be able to have as positive an impact in our next set of projects,' Mr Zuckerberg posted on his Facebook page at the time of his December donation.","The 28-year-old is planning to launch a new political advocacy group .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss for MailOnline . Hopes of a breakthrough in the fight against Ebola have been raised by the 100 per cent successful treatment of monkeys with the deadly disease. The experimental drug ZMapp cured the animals even when administered five days after infection, while they were displaying severe symptoms. All 18 rhesus macaques made a complete recovery, in contrast to three other untreated monkeys that quickly fell seriously ill and died. Scroll down for video . Nicotiana benthamiana, the plant from which ZMapp is derived. New research shows the experimental drug ZMapp cured the monkeys even when administered five days after infection . ZMapp is a blend of three laboratory-made antibodies designed to neutralise the virus. Two U.S. doctors given the drug after they were infected with Ebola while working in Liberia subsequently recovered. But it is not known whether they were saved by the drug or just lucky. About 45 per cent of those infected in the current outbreak have survived without treatment. At least two other patients treated with ZMapp have died, possibly because help got to them too late. The new research, published in a special report on Nature journal's website, provides hard evidence that the drug works and can be highly effective. A team of scientists led by Dr Gary Kobinger, from the Public Health Agency of Canada, wrote: 'ZMapp exceeds the efficacy of any other therapeutics described so far, and results warrant further development of this cocktail for clinical use ... 'We hope that initial safety testing in humans will be undertaken soon, preferably within the next few months, to enable the compassionate use of ZMapp as soon as possible.' The news follows a warning from the World Health Organisation (WHO) that the Ebola outbreak in West Africa could eventually claim more than 20,000 victims. Latest figures show 1,552 deaths from the 3,069 cases reported so far. A Liberian health worker spraying disinfectant outside a house before entering and removing the body of a man believed to have died from the Ebola virus in Monrovia. Latest figures show 1,552 deaths from the 3,069 cases reported so far . ZMapp is being used to treat William Pooley (left) the first Briton to contract the virus while working as a nurse at a remote health centre in Sierra Leone and (right) Dr Abraham Borbor, was being treated with ZMapp but lost his battle with Ebola this week. He was the deputy chief medical doctor at the country's largest hospital . Ebola, belonging to the family of 'filoviruses', ranks alongside Marburg virus as one of the world's deadliest infections. Fatality rates in previous outbreaks have been as high as 90 per cent. It kills by overwhelming the immune system and sending the body into shock as blood pressure drops to dangerous levels. Currently there are is no approved vaccine or post-exposure treatment. Management of the Ebola outbreak in Africa has been confined to palliative care and physical attempts to prevent transmission. The development of ZMapp and its success in treating advanced stages of Ebola infection was described as a 'monumental achievement' by Professor Thomas Geisbert, from the University of Texas, writing in Nature. He added: 'The next crucial step will be to formally assess its safety and effectiveness. Testing the latter is clearly difficult, because intentional infection of human subjects in clinical trials is not possible.' Researchers claim the Ebola virus disease (EVD) is rapidly and continually mutating, making it harder to diagnose and treat. A study of the initial patients diagnosed with the virus in Sierra Leone revealed almost 400 genetic modifications. And it could be detrimental not only to current treatments, but also to future vaccines that are in the works. The team of researchers, led by the Broad Institute in Massachusetts and Harvard University, analysed more than 99 Ebola virus genomes. These were collected from 78 patients diagnosed with Ebola in Sierra Leona in the first 24 days of the outbreak. Their findings, reported in the journal Science, could have important implications for rapid field diagnostic tests. The team found more than 300 genetic changes that make the 2014 Ebola virus genomes distinct from the viral genomes tied to previous Ebola outbreaks. They also found variations in the genome sequence indicating that, from the samples analysed, the outbreak started from a single introduction into humans, subsequently spreading from person to person over many months. The treated monkeys were exposed to a lethal level of Ebola virus before receiving three doses of ZMapp starting three, four and five days after infection. The treatment reversed Ebola symptoms including excessive bleeding, rashes, and liver damage. Three weeks after they were infected, no trace of the virus could be detected in the animals' blood. Untreated monkeys all succumbed to the virus by day eight after infection. One drawback of the research was that it used a version of the virus different from the Guinea strain responsible for the current outbreak, which was not available at the time. But the scientists went on to show that ZMapp blocks replication of the Guinea strain in laboratory tests. Dr Alain Kohl, from the Medical Research Council/University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, said: 'What needs to be done next is assess against how many strains and species of the virus it can act. Clinical trials in humans are not possible so some questions will go unanswered. At present too few people have received the drug to allow conclusions about efficacy and treatment timings, though in emergency situations it is at least one potentially useful option.' David Evans, Professor of Virology at the University of Warwick, said: 'All animals survived and had undetectable viral loads 21 days post-infection. This is an extremely encouraging result for a virus which has an incubation period of two to 21 days in humans and for which no vaccine exists. 'These results do not prove that the healthcare workers who received ZMapp and recovered did so due to the therapy. Others who also received ZMapp succumbed to the virus. 'Distinguishing between correlation and causation will require analysis of the clinical data on viral loads before and after therapy was administered. Nevertheless, the results are encouraging.' Professor Martin Hibberd, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: 'This looks to be a very well designed study with better than expected results, which give great hope for future clinical trials. 'I hope the team can receive sufficient funding to undertake these clinical trials straight away as this is by far the most advanced potential treatment option available to my knowledge.' What is Ebola virus disease? Ebola is a severe, often fatal illness, with a death rate of up to 90 per cent.The illness affects humans as well as primates, including monkeys, gorillas and chimpanzees. How do people become infected with the virus? Ebola is transmitted through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals. In Africa infection in humans has happened as a result of contact with chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead in the rainforest. Once a person becomes infected, the virus can spread through contact with a sufferer's blood, urine, saliva, stools and semen. A person can also become infected if broken skin comes into contact with a victim's soiled clothing, bed linen or used needles. Men who have recovered from the disease, can still spread the virus to their partner through their semen for seven weeks after recovery. Who is most at risk? Those at risk during an outbreak include: . What are the typical signs and symptoms? Sudden onset of fever, intense weakness, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. That is followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, impaired kidney and liver function and internal and external bleeding. The incubation period is between two and 21 days. A person will become contagious once they start to show symptoms. When should you seek medical care? If a person is in an area affected by the outbreak, or has been in contact with a person known or suspected to have Ebola, they should seek medical help immediately.","All 18 rhesus macaques treated with the drug made 'complete recovery'

The boy carried on as normal at the Queensland Whitsunday islands resort where his parents worked. But hours later Lincoln was frothing at the mouth, writhing with seizures and tearing out the IV lines doctors had inserted into him as a rabies-like disease tore through his body. Eight-year-old Lincoln Boucher spent two months in hospital fighting the rabies-like disease lyssavirus before doctors found out what his illness was . Lincoln's parents Michelle Flynn and Colin Boucher told Australia's 60 Minutes that their son could have survived if he'd told them about getting scratched by a bat . Michelle Flynn and Colin Boucher worked at the Queensland Whitsundays resort where their son was bitten . Lincoln had become the third-known Australian victim of lyssavirus, which spread through his body and attacked his brain, claiming his life on February 2. Now his parents Michelle Flynn and Colin Boucher say their son would be alive if only he had told them about the scratch from the bat. Miss Flynn told 60 Minutes that she realised something was wrong when Lincoln developed a temperature. Overnight he developed seizures. At hospital, tests could not identify what was wrong with him. 'He was scared…and that's when he knelt . up on the bed and ripped out the IV lines and nurses and doctors came . running,' Miss Flynn told the programme. Lincoln was put into an induced coma but the virus was so powerful that the boy repeatedly returned to consciousness. Stricken with delirium and convulsions, he struggled with the virus for two months before his sister Lauren told doctors about the bat scratch he'd received. Lincoln's illness turned him violent as the lyssavirus worked its way towards his brain . Doctors put Lincoln into a medically-induced coma but the virus was so powerful that he kept regaining consciousness . By the time his older sister Lauren remembered the bat scratch, it was too late for Lincoln to be vaccinated . Scans showed the lyssavirus spreading through Lincoln's body to attack his brain . By then, it was too late to administer a vaccine as the symptoms of the virus had taken hold. 'He was a pretty tough little boy,' said his mother. 'He just wouldn't have known to tell us [about the scratch].' As his condition worsened, Lincoln was successfully put into a coma. Doctors brough him back to consciousness so his parents could speak to him one last time before his death. A bite or a scratch resulting in victims of lyssavirus turning violent and frothing at the mouth as it makes its way towards the brain, where it replicates and causes irreparable damage. The two earlier lyssavirus deaths in Australia also occurred in Queensland. In 1996 an animal carer died following a scratch from a yellow-bellied sheath-tailed bat. Lincoln and his sister Lauren lived with their parents at the Long Island resort . Lincoln's parents told 60 Minutes their son loved the outdoors and was a 'tough little boy' Lincoln's parents shared family photographs with 60 Minutes, showing a happy smiling boy . In that same year, a woman was bitten on a finger by a bat while attempting to remove it from a child it had landed on. It was 27 months before the virus manifested itself and she died in hospital. Almost all human deaths from rabies occur in Asia and Africa. Although there are no rabid animals in Australia, bats carrying the virus have been found throughout the country. The lyssavirus was identified in bats in 2003 and while extremely rare world-wide, death is certain to follow unless a victim is treated quickly.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Four plants in China that produce treats for American-based companies refused to let FDA investigators take samples for analysis, a new report claims. The Food and Drug Administration has received thousands of complaints from pet owners saying the tainted treats led to the deaths of their beloved animals. But Chinese government officials would only let FDA workers take samples if they allowed the treats to be tested by Chinese laboratories, sending the investigators back empty-handed. Tainted treats: Waggin' Train, left, owned by Nestle Purina but manufactured in China, as well as Canyon Creek Ranch Chicken Tenders, have been accused of causing more than 2,000 pet illnesses and deaths in the U.S. No testing: According to the FDA, investigators were not allowed to sample products from four pet treat factories in China (stock photo) NBC News obtained a copy of the records, citing FDA official Dennis Doupnik, who confirmed that no samples were collected during the visit in April. The four plants in China - Gambol Pet Products Co. Ltd.; Shandong Honva Food Co. Ltd.; and Shandong Petswell Food Co. Ltd, as well as and Jinan Uniwell Pet Food Co. Ltd., all produce treats for Nestle Purina PetCare Co. Among the treats made are the popular Waggin’ Train jerky. NBC News, citing the FDA report, said that none of the factories performed any routine tests on the raw materials. More than 2,000 reports have been sent to the FDA of dog treats made in China that have resulted in illness or death of a pet, the news outlet said. However, spokesperson for Nestle Purina assured NBC News that the FDA’s evidence is unfounded. ‘There was no attempt by Nestle Purina for the Chinese facilities to restrict sample collection,’ Keith Schopp said. He added that the treats remain safe for pets' consumption. Indeed, in the past five years, the FDA has been unable to find significant contamination levels in dog treats made in China and sold in the States. Fatality: Bella, a 2-year-old pug, died after her owner said she ate the Waggin' Train chicken jerky treat . Kidney failure: Ginger, a 14-year-old dog, died from the disease though it is unclear whether that was a direct result of the chicken jerky treats . Earlier this year, the FDA cited Waggin' Train, Canyon Creek Ranch jerky treats and Milo's Kitchen Home-style Dog Treats in several cases of illness. But FDA officials warn that repeated tests have not shown a definitive tie to the three dog treat brands. 'No specific products have been recalled because a definitive cause has not been determined,' FDA officials said in a statement. Nestle Purina and Del Monte, makers of the three cited dog treats, insist that their products are safe. A series of complaints from dog owners and veterinarians suggest jerky treats made in China are responsible for a series of dog illnesses, including kidney failure, liver disease and Fanconi syndrome, which can lead to death in severe cases. Recent complaints have been filed by dog owners across the United States. 'We still invite owners and veterinarians to submit complaints and samples,' Siobhan DeLancey, an FDA spokeswoman, told MSNBC. 'The more information we have, the more likely we can find a link.' Bella, a 2-year-old pug, is one of the fatalities thought to have been caused by the Waggin' Train chicken jerky treats. Another, 14-year-old Ginger, died from kidney failure and her owners filed a complaint against one of the dog treat companies.","FDA has been investigating four plants in China that produce treats for U.S. brand Nestle Purina .

"By . Ollie Gillman . Boris Becker was spotted having a knock-about at the US Open with an enormous growth protruding from his elbow. In what appeared to be a severe case of tennis elbow, the former world No 1 had a lump almost the size of a tennis ball sticking out of the back of his arm. The 46-year-old, who won the Slam himself in 1989, is at the tournament as current world No 1 Novak Djokovic's coach. Lump: The large bump did not stop the former world number one from going for a knock-up on a practice court . Ouch: The lump looks sore but Becker, who is Wimbledon champion Novak Djokovic's coach, carries on . But it seems the former German star, who won Wimbledon three times in the 1980s, as well as three French Opens and one Australian Open, needs to put his racket down and give his arm a rest. Becker was only named as the Serbian's coach last year but the huge lump on his elbow may be a sign he needs a rest. Surprisingly the lump is on his left arm, suggesting the injury may not be tennis-related as he is a right-handed player. Grimace: Becker's injury may not be tennis-related as it is on his left hand and he is a right-hander . Ball: The lump on Becker's elbow is similarly sized to the balls used at the US Open in New York . VIDEO Djokovic cruises through in New York . Tennis elbow is a condition that causes pain and inflammation around the outside of the elbow. It is caused by the overuse of the muscles of the forearm, often through activities that place repeated stress on the elbow joint, such as playing tennis or decorating.Paracetemol and anti-inflammatory drugs can ease the pain, while severe cases can require physiotherapy or even surgery. However, in Boris Becker's case, the mystery lump on his left arm may not be the result of tennis elbow; particularly because he is right-handed.Instead, it could have resulted from a sudden injury - such as a blow to the elbow, causing bleeding or fluid build-up - or infection. Tennis elbow lasts between six months and two years. However, in about nine out of 10 cases, a full recovery is made within a year. However Becker will have to go careful on the double-handed backhands for the time being, especially when facing this year's Wimbledon champion, Djokovic. Fans spotted the lump on Becker's left elbow was he watched the Serbian breeze past Argentine player Diego Schwartzman 6-1, 6-2, 6-4 today. But more pictures of the uncomfortable-looking bump appeared later on as photographers watched Becker having a knock-up at the Arthur Ashe stadium court at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York. Djokovic, who said he enjoyed playing in the late evening slot at the Open, next plays Paul-Henri Mathieu. Djokovic and Murray are on course to face each other in the quarter finals should they both reach that stage. Murray laboured to beat Dutchman Robin Haase yesterday over four sets. It is not all work for Becker, however. He was seen relaxing in the Flushing district of Queens, New York yesterday with his wife Lilly. The couple were seen laughing and kissing as Mrs Becker sipped on a glass of wine. Tennis elbow is a condition that causes pain and inflammation around the outside of the elbow.

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Two satellites being used in a £4.4bn European project to develop a satellite navigation system which rivals the American GPS network have gone into the wrong orbit. Arianespace, the company responsible for . the launch, said the satellites 'had been placed on a lower orbit than . expected', after being fired into space yesterday on a Russian-made Soyuz rocket from French Guiana. The European Space Agency said space officials are now . investigating whether the mistake will . complicate their efforts to develop the publicly-funded Galileo satellite navigation . system. Two satellites being used in a European project which aims to rival the American GPS satellite navigation system, which were launched from French Guiana on Friday, pictured left and right, have gone into the wrong orbit, according to the European Space Agency . It is not clear whether the satellites will be able to work properly in the different orbit, nor whether the orbits are now able to be corrected. The satellites, Doresa and Milena, were fired into space after a 24-hour delay caused by bad weather. They are the fifth and sixth satellites to be launched for the ESA’s geo-positioning network. The first two were launched in 2011, followed by another pair in 2012. The latest two satellites were already more than one year behind schedule. The £4.4bn project, funded and owned by the European Union, is intended to provide Europe with an . independent alternative in case of signal failure on the existing U.S. global positioning system or on Russia’s Glonass system. The project . will apparently create 15,000 to 20,000 jobs within the EU, according to the ESA. In total, the Galileo network aims to have 30 operating satellites by 2017. Arianespace recently announced it would launch a further 12 satellites from the start of next year. The statement did not explain the difference between the satellites' intended orbits and the one in which it was placed.  Space officials are now investigating whether the inaccurate deployment will complicate efforts to create the new £4.4bn Galileo satellite navigation system . The satellites, Doresa and Milena, were the fifth and sixth to be . launched for the ESA's geo-positioning network, being funded and run by the European Union. The first two were . launched in 2011 while another was launched in 2012 . Jean-Yves Le Gall, president of the French space agency CNES, said the investigation still needed to determine precisely how far off course the satellites were. He said European Space Agency experts in Toulouse, France, and Darmstadt, Germany, were calculating whether small motors inside the satellites would be strong enough to push them into the correct orbit. Mr Le Gall said the investigation would take 'several days to understand what has happened'. He said only then would they be able to see the possible consequences on the launch calendar. He called the Galileo navigation network 'a very complex programme' and said failures were 'unfortunately part of the life of operations'. If the two satellites cannot be pushed to the correct altitude above the earth, he said, subsequent satellites launched would have to take up the slack. The programme has faced other delays and operational hiccups. European Space Agency officials said on Wednesday they had to reduce the strength of another Galileo satellite's signal because of unspecified problems. Galileo is a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) currently being built by the European Space Agency on behalf of the European Union (EU). The project, expected to cost the EU £4.4bn, aims to create a system which will work with GPS and Glonass, the US and Russian global satellite navigation systems. According to the EU, Galileo - which is named after the Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei - will aim to provide an 'alternative high-precision positioning system' under civilian control. It has been designed so European nations can rely on the system in case either of the existing systems fail, or are disabled by their operators. The ESA says the system, which will be used to guide cars, run trains and land aircraft, carries more precise atomic clocks than GPS and will work at higher latitudes than other positioning systems. In theory, the data transmitted by Galileo should therefore be significantly better than GPS. Whereas a position fixed by that signal might have an error of about 10m, Galileo's designers are aiming for a one metre margin of error once there is full deployment. For its operation, Galileo will use two ground operations centres, near Munich in Germany and in Fucino in Italy. In December 2010, EU ministers in Brussels voted that Prague should be the headquarters of the Galileo project. On 21 October 2011, the first two of four operational satellites, designed to validate the Galileo concept in both space and on Earth, were fired into space. Two more followed on 12 October 2012. The fully deployed Galileo system is due to consists of 30 satellites (27 of which will operational and three of which are spares), positioned in three circular Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) planes at 23,222 km altitude above the Earth. The latest launch was about one year behind schedule. Ongoing running costs, including the renewal of worn out spacecraft, are estimated to be about 800 million euros a year. But the EU maintains this expenditure will be outweighed by the economic returns of having improved sat-nav. It expects Galileo to bring significant returns to European nations through new businesses that use precise location data. Galileo was famously called the 'Common . Agricultural Policy in the sky' by one British politician who was . infuriated by the price of the project.","Arianespace, the company responsible for the launch, said satellites had been placed 'on a lower orbit than expected'

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A toddler who had the most misshapen head doctors had ever seen has undergone pioneering surgery to prevent her brain from being squashed. Three-year-old Kaydence Theriault  and her fellow triplets Taylor and Kaylin were all born with Crouzon Syndrome, which causes the baby's head to become misshapen. Kaydence had the most severe form doctors had ever seen because her skull was shaped like a cloverleaf. Rare: Kaydence Theriault had the most severely misshapen head doctors had ever seen. She and her fellow triplets Taylor and Kaylin were all born with Crouzon Syndrome, which causes the baby's head to become misshapen. Because of the severity of her case, Kaydence's skull was shaped like a cloverleaf . She needed life-saving surgery to ensure her brain didn't become damaged. A team of expert cranio-facial surgeons came together to save her, and now Kaydence and her siblings are like any playful toddlers who will celebrate their fourth birthday in December. They are suffering no health issues or learning problems and are catching up in height with other youngsters. Their mother Bobbie Jo, 38, of Indianapolis, said: 'The doctors have been amazing. 'When Kaydence was born no-one knew if she would survive. But thanks to their incredible talent we have a normal healthy daughter and we can't thank them enough.' Crouzon Syndrome is a genetic condition that causes the plates of a baby's skull to lock in position too early, before the brain has had chance to grow. Genetic: The triplets, who are now three, their older brother Jayden and parents Bobbi Jo and Jason. Both Mrs Theriault and her son also suffer from milder forms of Crouzon Syndrome, which causes the plates of a baby's skull to lock in position too early, distorting the shape of their head . Most children born with the condition have surgery before they are 18 months old to separate the skull before it fuses. But . Kaydence's condition was so severe the bones were already joining . together, pushing her head into an odd shape at the top and sides, like a . three-leaved clover. Mrs Theriault had no idea there was a problem until her 20-week scan showed one of the triplets had a deformity. She said: 'When the doctors told me about Kaydence having a cloverleaf shaped head, I couldn't picture that. I have never seen it before so I had no idea what to expect.' She and her eldest son Jayden, eight, also have Crouzon Syndrome, which Mrs Theriault inherited from her father. But each of them has a milder form and underwent small operations just before they were one. Emergency: Kaydence needed surgery to open up her skull at two months old so her brain would have room to grow. Then, three months later, a team of expert surgeons came together at to perform a delicate operation to reshape her head . Her husband Jason said: 'The shape of . Jayden's head started changing and that's when we and the doctors . realised he needed surgery. He was in hospital two or three days and . then he was home and that was the end of it and he was completely fine. 'That's one of the main reasons why we had decided to have another child. I didn't want Jayden to grow up without a sibling.' Crouzon . syndrome is a rare genetic condition that causes the early fusing of . the bones of the skull and the abnormal development of the face. It . occurs when some of the bones fuse too early, . meaning the they cannot grow normally and the face becomes misshapen. In babies with the condition, the bones normally fuse prior to birth. Some . are born with an abnormal head shape - a tall and narrow skull with . wide-set eyes - while others develop problems later. Other . abnormalities associated with the syndrome include having a prominent . lower jaw, hearing and spinal problems. The syndrome affects 1.6 people in every 100,000 and is caused by a genetic mutation. Only . one parent needs to be a carrier for a child to inherit the condition - . a person with Crouzon syndrome has a 50 per cent chance of passing it . on to each of their children. About 97 per cent of children with the condition have normal levels of intelligence. The main treatment is surgery to expand and reshape the skull. Source: Seattle Children's Hospital . The . Theriaults were overjoyed when they discovered they were expecting . triplets and say they had 'no idea' that their babies would be in danger . of having a life-threatening form of Crouzon. Mrs Theriault said: 'Jayden had been fine so I thought it would all be okay.' Her husband added: 'But when Kaydence came out I knew she would be the one who would have the most problems. I was just absolutely astounded at the severity of it.' Kaydence needed emergency surgery to open up her skull at two months old, as soon as she was strong enough, so her brain would have room to grow. Then, three months later, a team of expert surgeons came together at Peyton Manning Children's Hospital in Indianapolis to perform a delicate operation to reshape her head. World famous cranio-facial surgery Dr Kenneth Salyer, from Texas, was brought in to help with the surgery, which took place in May 2010 and lasted eight-and-a half hours. Neurosurgeon Dr Ronald Young said: 'The only way to reshape the head is to take that bone apart and put it back together in a different shape and that's what we did.' Mrs Theriault, a health admin worker, said: 'I was scared, I was worried, I was sad. I wanted it to be over, I just wanted to see her. I didn't know how such a small baby could cope with being under anaesthesia for so long.' Dr Young added: 'Our main worry was bleeding. This was a very small child and we were working over a very large blood vessel. After that it was exposing the brain to possible infection or damage during the surgery.' To their relief, everything went well and Kaydence made an incredible recovery and was out of hospital and back with her siblings in a matter of days. Misshapen: An MRI scan of Kaydence's skull soon after she was born, showing the severity of her case . Her cloverleaf shaped head was transformed, and with the help of smaller follow-up surgeries, she is now virtually unrecognisable from how her appearance as a newborn. Taylor and Kaylin, who had a milder form of Crouzon, underwent their surgeries at seven months old and are also doing well. Each child underwent physical and speech therapy to help them catch up with other three-year-olds because of their time spent in hospital. But the girls are expected to start nursery soon and will have no lasting effects. When the triplets are older they will be able to have plastic surgery to help make their face and eye shape more normal if necessary. As a child, Mrs Theriault admits she was teased by schoolmates because of her mildly protruding eyes, but she believes it made her a stronger person and better able to help her own children. Doing well: The girls are expected to start nursery soon and will have no lasting effects. When they are older they will be able to have plastic surgery to help make their face and eye shape more normal if necessary . Her husband said: 'I've know Bobbie Jo since she was 14 and she has always stood up for herself and never backed down from anybody. Mrs Theriault added: 'Children are going to be children. Bullying is everywhere no matter who are. All three of the triplets will probably come across somebody who is going to bother them. But if they do get called names they will have me to help them. 'When Jayden started school he said some of the kids made fun of his eyes. But now he has learned about Crouzon Syndrome and tells people about it. That has helped him stand up for himself. 'We're so happy they can have a normal life,"" said Bobbie. Jo. ""I love those doctors for what they have done for my family.'

"By . Lydia Warren . Richard Linklater, who directed the film 'Bernie' about a convicted murderer played by Jack Black, has opened up about living with the killer at the heart of the movie. Bernie Tiede, who served 17 years for shooting his 81-year-old companion Marjorie Nugent and stashing her body in a freezer, was ordered to live with Linklater when he was released early in May. For the past two months, 55-year-old Tiede, who worked as a mortician in Carthage, Texas before his arrest, has been living in Linklater's garage at his Austin home while working as a paralegal. 'I picked him up getting released, and he started work the next week,' Linklater told Page Six. 'He says, ""It's a miracle,"" but I was like, ""Yeah, but life wasn't always the best to you"".' Roommates: Director Richard Linklater, pictured at a screening of his latest film on Monday, spoke about his ongoing friendship with killer Bernie Tiede, who is living in his garage after being released in May, right . 'There's so many people in our world behind bars who, given a bit of attention, and legal support, they would have much different results not just guilt or innocence, but sentencing.' Tiede also has a bicycle, which was a gift from his new neighbors, but is keeping a low profile. He has still not seen the movie that ultimately helped lead to his release. Linklater, whose film came out in 2012 to rave reviews, fought for two years with others for an early release for Tiede after it emerged that he had endured years of sexual abuse as a child. He had been joined in his fight by Danny Buck Davidson, the district . attorney who prosecuted Tiede for the 1996 murder and who was played by Matthew McConaughey in the movie. Victim: Tiede is pictured with his 81-year-old companion Marjorie Nugent, whom he shot dead in 1996 . On screen: Linklater directed the film version of the story starring Jack Black and Shirley MacLaine . They aimed to reduce Tiede's sentence after a local attorney, Jodi Cole, investigated the case after watching the movie and learned from a psychiatrist's report that he had been abused. It said that the experience made him vulnerable to unhealthy relationships - notes that changed Davidson's view about the case. The convicted murderer was freed on May 6. 'My whole point in the movie was this: . Can the nicest guy in the world actually be capable (of murder)?' Linklater previously told Variety. 'The answer . is yes. So anybody who's too sure of their own behavior… given the . wrong relationship, who knows what anyone's capable of?' He also applauded Davidson for his courage to change his mind when faced with the full facts. 'This is Texas justice,' Linklater says. 'He didn’t have to do that, but I always sensed he was a good guy.' Support: Linklater, pictured in court in May, became friends with Tiede and fought for his early release . Marjorie Nugent, who was portrayed by Shirley MacLaine in the movie, disappeared in 1996 and was found dead in a freezer in Carthage nine months later. She had a reputation among townspeople as a crotchety cheapskate. The case was exceptional because, even though Tiede confessed to his guilt, many members of his community supported him. The trial was moved to a nearby town. The movie depicted Tiede as a sympathetic . figure who gave money to charitable causes and helped local businesses, . while Nugent was seen as a crotchety cheapskate. Nugent's relatives . have protested that portrayal. Linklater spoke to Page Six as he promoted his movie 'Boyhood,' which stars Ellar Coltrane over 12 years, starting when he was 7.","Bernie Tiede, 55, was ordered to live in Linklater's garage in Austin, Texas when he was released early from prison in May .

"By . Snejana Farberov . A former Texas mortician whose killing of a rich widow inspired Richard Linklater’s movie Bernie was released from prison tonight – and promptly moved in with the renowned director. A judge set a $10,000 bond for real-life Bernie Tiede after recommending that his life sentenced be reduced. A state criminal appeals court must sign off on the sentence reduction while Tiede is out on bond. The now-55-year-old Tiede, who was well liked in the close-knit community of Carthage, was convicted in the death of his longtime companion, Marjorie Nugent. Free man: Bernie Tiede is led into the Panola County court house by law enforcement officials in Carthage, Texas, May 6 . Mercy: A judge released Tiede on $10,000 bond and recommended that his life sentenced be reduced after a psychiatrist determined that the crime he committed was a 'brief dissociative episode' Benefactor: Director Richard Linklater walks to his vehicle after the Bernie Tiede hearing at the Panola County Courthouse, in Carthage . The 81-year-old widow had a reputation among townspeople as a crotchety cheapskate. The case inspired the 2011 dark comedy Bernie starring Jack Black in the title role and Shirley MacLaine as Nugent. The judge has agreed to let Tiede live in an apartment above Richard Linklater's garage under strict bond conditions. Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson, who was played by Matthew McConaughey in the film, agreed with Tiede's appeals attorney, Jodi Cole, who said he deserved a lighter sentence because he was sexually assaulted as a child and also had an abusive relationship with Nugent before her death. Psychiatrist Edward Gripon, who examined Tiede in January, testified Tuesday that Tiede and Nugent had a complex and abusive relationship. He said that combined with Tiede having been abused when he was younger pushed him to kill Nugent in a ‘brief dissociative episode.’ Doppelgangers: Bernie Tiede (left) is the inspiration for Jack Black's (right) character in the movie Bernie . Killer: Tiede (left) was convicted in the shooting death of his longtime companion, Marjorie Nugent (right) On-screen romance: In Linklater's dark comedy, Shirley MacLaine (right) portrayed the 81-year-old widow . ‘He doesn't come across in examination at all as a person prone to violence,’ he said. ‘That set of circumstances ... is not going to recreate itself.’ Davidson, who said he believes residents' opinion of Tiede has changed ‘180 degrees,’ called Tiede's release ‘bittersweet.’ He said he had a duty, however, to act once it was clear other factors had led Tiede to kill. ‘I'm not telling you I like it, but there's not much I can do about it now,’ the plainspoken prosecutor said. Tiede still faces a theft charge for spending Nugent's money after her death, but Davidson said nothing will move forward on that until the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals approves the sentence reduction in the slaying case. No timetable has been set for when the court might act. Nugent disappeared in 1996. Her corpse was found nine months later at her Carthage home about 150 miles east of Dallas, wrapped in a sheet lying among packages of frozen corn, pecans and meat. She had been shot in the back four times with a .22-caliber rifle. Roommates: As a condition of his release, Tiede, pictured left on Tuesday, moved into the home of Bernie director Richard Linklater (right), who has agreed to let him live above his garage . Panola County District Attorney Danny 'Buck' Davidson gives a thumbs up before a court hearing for Bernie Tiede in Carthage, Texas . Art imitating life: Linklater attended Tiede's murder trial and co-wrote the screenplay for his 2011 dark comedy Bernie starring Jack Black with a Texas reporter . Tiede had met Nugent in 1990 at the funeral of her husband R.L. ‘Rod’ Nugent, who had made his fortune in oil and banking. Soon after, Tiede left his job as an assistant funeral director to become business manager for Nugent, who had become a close companion. Tiede's lawyers said Nugent had a reputation in the town of Carthage for being ‘a bully and unkind.’ 'We had a ball,' Mr Tiede told The New . York Times. 'I think I probably saw her happier than anyone in her . family ever did. Including her husband. She kind of opened up to me. She . became a different person.'But over time, Mrs Nugent became . increasingly demanding, he told the News Journal, requiring Mr Tiede to . clip her toenails, pluck the hairs off her chin and never leave her . side. 'She . was very possessive of my life — so much of my life — for the last few . years. And it got worse,' Mr Tiede said to the paper. 'I guess that’s . what made me just snap.' The two would grow close, taking trips around the world, and Nugent signed a will leaving her estimated $10million fortune to Tiede. Shocking crime: Tiede, pictured left and right, was found guilty of shooting Nugent in the back four times and stuffing her body in a freezer, where it was found only nine months later . Living the good life: Linklater's film portrayed Tiede, played by Jack Black, traveling around the world with his rich benefactor and living well on her dime . Upstanding citizen: Residents of Carthage, Texas, remembered Bernie Tiede as a generous man who started scholarships and showered his neighbors with gifts . Tiede became known around town for his generosity. Townspeople have said he started scholarships, pledged money to a church building campaign and ran a fundraising drive for Boy Scouts. He also gave away large gifts, including several cars. After Tiede was charged in Nugent's killing, pretrial publicity led to the case being moved to San Augustine, about 50 miles southeast of Carthage. A jury there convicted him in 1999 and sentenced him to life in prison. Ryan Gravatt, a spokesman for the Nugent family, told the Texas Tribune Tiede should stay in prison and serve out his sentence. ‘He confessed to her murder and his confession was admitted in his trial,’ Gravatt said. ‘A jury found him guilty and sentenced him to life in prison, where he should remain.’ Linklater, an Academy Award nominated director renowned for his Before Sunset trilogy, attended Tiede’s murder trial and co-wrote the screenplay for his 2011 film with a journalist who covered the case for Texas Monthly. The 53-year-old filmmaker, who lives in Austin with his wife, Christina Harrison, has agreed to let Tiede live in an apartment about his garage after his release from prison. Staunch supporter: Linklater (right) has called Tiede (right) 'a sweetheart of a guy' and said that there is no need for him to remain behind bars . Linklater has gone on the record as a supporter of the former mortician, calling Tiede ‘a sweetheart of a guy’ who did not belong in prison after all these years. ‘Bernie's been in 12 years now.’ The director told the Houston Chronicle in 2012. ‘He has to do time, but I think he [got] an extremely harsh sentence. Bernie's not a psychopath or sociopath. ‘I think this was a heightened one-time event. He really is the nicest guy.’ During . his trial, Mr Tiede said that he arrived at Mrs Nugent's home at 7am . the morning of her death to make her breakfast.He noticed a .22-caliber . rifle she kept around for shooting armadillos and scaring squirrels from . her bird feeder and put it near the garage. The two prepared to leave the house around 10am to head over to the dry cleaners when Mrs Nugent stopped to pet her dog. Mr . Tiede shot her four times in the back and stuffed her in the freezer, . between flounder and chicken pot pie, where she lay for nine months as . he spent her fortune. 'Bernie’s . not the first one who thought about killing her,' said writer Joe . Rhodes, who also happens to be Mrs Nugent's nephew. 'He’s just the first . one who went through with it.' Mitigating circumstances: Tiede's appeals attorney had said he deserved a lighter sentence because he was sexually assaulted as a child . Mr Rhodes recounted his relationship with his aunt as difficult, to say the least, as well as the trial for her murderer. He . visited the set of the film in Carthage, where the town welcomed the . film with open arms and several residents even served as extras. 'There . are little things in Bernie that aren’t exactly true, bits of dialogue, . a changed name here and there,' Mr Rhodes said. 'But the big things, . the weirdest things, the things you’d assume would have to be made up, . happened exactly as the movie says they did.' Many thought Mrs Nugent was the meanest woman in East Texas, he said, and her killer was one of the nicest folks around. 'There . was something about Aunt Marge’s ending up in a freezer that seemed . appropriate,' wrote Mr Rhodes.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Attorneys for a former mortician serving a life sentence for the death of a rich East Texas widow are seeking a lighter sentence. Bernie Tiede  is in prison for the 1997 death of 81-year-old Marjorie Nugent in a case that inspired Richard Linklater's 2011 movie 'Bernie.' Panola County Court documents unsealed Wednesday show Tiede's attorneys want to introduce new evidence of a history of severe sexual abuse of Tiede and an abusive relationship between him and Nugent. Bernie Tiede (left) makes his way to the defense table as appointed Judge Diane DeVasto presides over the his hearing at the Panola County Courthouse . Tiede's attorney, Jodi Cole, writes that the abuse finally pushed Tiede over the edge and he shot his elderly companion. Tiede, now 55, was convicted in February 1999 of killing Nugent and keeping her body in a freezer for nine months. In Richard Linklater's latest film, Jack Black plays Bernie, the gay mortician that befriends a wealthy widow at her husband's funeral, shoots her in the back and spends her millions while desperately trying to hide the fact that she's packed in a freezer alongside chicken pot pies. Mr Tiede met Mrs Nugent at her husband's funeral and through a series of events, became her trusted companion and only friend. The two of them traveled the world together, spending her fortune on lavish getaways, airplanes and even scholarships for the poor. 'We had a ball,' Mr Tiede told The New . York Times. 'I think I probably saw her happier than anyone in her . family ever did. Including her husband. She kind of opened up to me. She . became a different person.'But over time, Mrs Nugent became . increasingly demanding, he told the News Journal, requiring Mr Tiede to . clip her toenails, pluck the hairs off her chin and never leave her . side. Bernie Tiede (left) is the inspiration for Jack Black's (right) character in the movie, 'Bernie' 'She was very possessive of my life — so much of my life — for the last few years. And it got worse,' Mr Tiede said to the paper. 'I guess that’s what made me just snap.' During his trial, Mr Tiede said that he arrived at Mrs Nugent's home at 7 a.m. the morning of her death to make her breakfast.He noticed a .22-caliber rifle she kept around for shooting armadillos and scaring squirrels from her bird feeder and put it near the garage.

Many thought Mrs Nugent was the meanest woman in East Texas, he said, and her killer was one of the nicest folks around. 'This town is split up,' District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson, who prosecuted Mr Tiede, told the News Journal at the time. 'People remember him as being real nice and doing nice things, and they'd like my office to go real easy on him. And then, there's a group that wants no mercy.' Mr Tiede was sentenced to life in prison and thanks to Mr Linklater, an eternity on the big screen.

"By . Lydia Warren for MailOnline . A luxurious mansion built for the boss of beer company PBR has sold for $4.8 million - just a fraction of the $14 million price tag on previous listings. The eight-bedroom, 10-bathroom Georgian mansion in Glencoe, Illinois, which was originally built in 1936 for the late Pabst Brewing Co. executive Harris Perlstein, was most recently sold on August 1. Insurance CEO Jeffrey Lange is the new owner of the 14,364-square-foot home, which sits on 2.19 acres of landscaped gardens in suburban Chicago's North Shore. Inside, there is a commercial-grade kitchen, a restored walnut library, a playroom, a home theater, an elevator, a curved staircase, four fireplaces and beamed ceilings, the Chicago Tribune reported. Stunning: This Georgian mansion in Glencoe, Illinois, which was originally built for Pabst Brewing Co. exec Harris Perlstein in the 1930s, has sold for $4.8 million - a fraction of its highest listing price . Inside: The spacious Illinois mansion has 26 rooms, including eight bedrooms and 10 bedrooms . Stunning: The property was bought by a trader in 1997, who gave it a complete makeover . Spacious: The home was then listed in 1999 for $11 million - but ended up selling for just $7.05 million . Details: At one point - in 2003 - the home was even listed for $14 million, but sold in that case for $5 million . Unsurprisingly, there is also a bar - complete with a decorative PBR bottle on its top. Outside is a swimming pool with a water slide and a basketball court, while the property borders a ravine. Despite the opulence of the home, it has struggled to sell for listing prices over the years. The 26-room home was originally built for Perlstein - the Chicago-based head of the Pabst Brewery - in 1936. Perlstein, who passed away in 1986, had merged his company, Premier Malt, with Milwaukee's Pabst the year before Prohibition was repealed. Raising the bar: The home also has a bar complete with PBR on tap and a large, decorative bottle of the beer . Ready to entertain: PBR was established in Milwaukee but a Chicago-based exec lived in this home . Luxury: The home, which is close to Lake Michicagn, features a new, commerical grade kitchen . Comfortable: There is also a playroom and a home entertainment room inside the 14,000-sq-ft home . Home: The house, which has eight bedrooms, has now been bought by insurance boss Jeffrey Lange . Colorful: The home is being sold because its previous owners, a venture capitalist and his wife, are divorcing . Having fun: A spacious games room features a personal gym as well as large windows overlooking the lawn . It was then sold to Eurodollar trader Steven Mendes and his wife in 1997 for $2.15 million, the Chicago Tribune reported. The couple gave the house and grounds a complete makeover and listed it for $11 million with the furnishings - although ended up selling it for just $7.05 million in 1999 without the furnishings. That buyer, Red Hat Software cofounder Marc Ewing, then listed the home for a massive $14 million in 2003 but the property would not budge for six years. He finally sold it in 2009 for $5.2 million to venture capitalist Adam Brass and his wife Robyn, who put it on the market for $6.95 last year, before dropping the cost incrementally to $4.95 million. Beautiful: A summer room overlooks the swimming pool area and the 2.15 acres of landscaped gardens . Quiet: The home, in Glencoe, Illinois, is protected by walls and a security system . At night: The property will now be shared with an insurance CEO and his wife - who nabbed it for $4.8 million . The Brasses put the home up for sale because they are divorcing, Crain's Chicago Business reported. It added that the new owner, Jeffrey Lange, is CEO of EquiTrust Life Insurance Co. He previously said he would bring 200 jobs to Illinois after the company's primary shareholder, Magic Johnson, moved the company to Chicago from Iowa. The home was listed with @properties.","Georgian mansion in Glencoe, Illinois was built for Pabst Brewing Co. exec Harris Perstein in 1936 .
