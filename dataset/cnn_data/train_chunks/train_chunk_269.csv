"(CNN) -- What's the best thing you could stumble upon when transiting through a major international airport? A Cinnabon passing out free samples? A security checkpoint with no line? Not bad choices, but for unexpected pleasure they hardly measure up to a dress made entirely of Hello Kitty dolls or a Kamen Rider escorting your humdrum slog to the departure gate. Those last two items are part of Japanese Toys! From Kokeshi to Kaiju, the current exhibition at the SFO Museum inside Terminal 3 at San Francisco International Airport. Debuting in November 2013, the exhibit has become such a success -- the most popular exhibit ever for the museum -- that its run has recently been extended through mid-May. ""Travelers love it. Many people have really been caught by surprise as they walk through the terminal and see the colorful kaleidoscope of Japanese toys,"" says Nicole Mullen, curator of exhibitions at SFO Museum. Atomic dragon meets world-conquering cat . With dozens of colorful items, the exhibit presents the evolution of Japanese toys, from kokeshi (wooden dolls dating at least to the 1800s) to Godzilla to everyone's favorite mouthless cat. Popular items also include vinyl kaiju (monster) figures and novelties from the futuristic TV series ""Ultraman,"" which premiered in 1966. ""For a show such as this one, some people will have a memory of a particular character from their childhood, such as Hello Kitty or Godzilla, that they get particularly excited about,"" says Mullen. The toys supply a window into Japanese customs, legends and history. Early Japanese folk toys were made by local craftsmen. After Japan opened to the West, however, toys that emulated their German and American counterparts began to emerge, such as classic wind-up and battery-operated toys. The thriving Japanese movie, television and manga industries that followed World War II spawned a legion of iconic characters. According to Megan Callan, assistant curator of museum affairs for SFO Museum, more than 4.6 million passengers have walked through SFO Terminal 3 since the exhibit premiered. ""Seen through the lens of social media, this exhibit is our most popular to date, with daily references through sites like Twitter and Instagram,"" says Callan. The museum has created the hashtag #JapaneseToys. Airport museums thriving . Exhibits of art and cultural pieces are becoming the norm at many U.S. airports, with some 20 or more airports regularly hosting exhibits. San Diego International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport and Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport are noteworthy among airport exhibit aficionados. But SFO Museum is the only one accredited by the American Alliance of Museums. Since opening in 1980, SFO Museum has grown from one gallery space to more than 20 galleries hosting 40 exhibits each year. Dewey Blanton of the American Alliance of Museums calls SFO Museum the ""most ambitious one"" among all airports with exhibition programs. ""The great works of art the San Francisco Airport museum showcases send the message to visitors and travelers that San Francisco is a center of culture, they value culture and art,"" says Blanton. ""This is a very educated and sophisticated city you are coming to."" For non-travelers, one chance to see it . For those not traveling through SFO before the Japanese toys exhibit closes in mid-May, the Japan Society of Northern California is organizing a panel discussion and guided tour on April 22. Registration is open to anyone -- for non-travelers, the tour is the only chance see the toys in person. Among other speakers, toy collector Mark Nagata will talk about the history of Japanese toys and their influence on contemporary culture. Japanese Toys!

"(CNN) -- Two coal miners lost their lives inside a mine in Boone County, West Virginia, a U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration spokeswoman told CNN on Tuesday. A coal or rock outburst occurred Monday night at the Brody Mine No. 1, owned by Brody Mining LLC, MSHA spokeswoman Amy Louviere said. The two miners -- a continuous mining machine operator and a roof bolting machine operator -- were fatally injured, she said. The West Virginia Department of Commerce identified the victims as Eric D. Legg, 48, and Gary P. Hensley, 46. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin expressed his condolences and asked for ""all West Virginians to continue praying for them during this very difficult time for our mining community."" The root cause of the accident was not immediately known and is under investigation. Brody Mine No. 1 has been cited in the past for safety violations. Last year, MSHA issued 514 citations, orders and safeguards to Brody Mine, Louviere said. There was a ""pattern of violations"" and repeated failure to meet mandatory safety standards at the mine, according to an October 2013 letter from the MSHA to the mining company. ""These groups of violations, taken alone or together, constitute a pattern of violations of mandatory health and safety standards in the coal or other mine which are of such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of coal or other mine health or safety hazards,"" the MSHA report stated. Brody Mine was placed on what's known as POV, or pattern of violations, status. Under that program, each time the mine received a significant and substantial violation of MSHA's mandatory standards, MSHA issued a withdrawal order and evacuated the part of the mine affected by the violation, according to Louviere. The spokeswoman said that Brody Mine received 69 withdrawal orders under the POV provision, among other closure orders. West Virginia was the site of one of the worst mining disasters in recent memory. In 2010, 29 miners were killed in an explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine in Naoma.

"(CNN) -- Even though he's being held in California, retired NFL star Darren Sharper was denied bail Thursday by a judge in Phoenix, Arizona, a spokesman for the Maricopa County Attorney's office said. Sharper, a five-time Pro Bowl player, faces five counts of drugging and raping three women in Scottsdale, Arizona, in November. Sharper has been in jail in Los Angeles since February 27 facing similar charges. Thursday's ruling in Arizona makes it more likely that Sharper will be denied bail in the California case as well. Sharper, 38, was being held on $1 million bail connected with charges of drugging and raping two women in the Los Angeles area, but Judge Renee Korn removed the bail and ordered him to remain in jail in March when an Arizona grand jury indicted him. The alleged rapes in California occurred in January and last October, authorities said. Sharper is due in a Los Angeles courtroom on Friday. Authorities have said Sharper is under investigation in three other states -- Louisiana, Nevada and Florida -- in cases of alleged sexual assault. So far, he has been charged only in California and Arizona, and he maintains his innocence in those cases. New Orleans police have issued an arrest warrant for Sharper but he has not been extradited to Louisiana to face charges. The application for the arrest warrant says New Orleans detectives interviewed two women who said they were raped on September 23. The two accusers told police they were so impaired they don't recall ""the entirety of the sexual intercourse,"" and that they never agreed to have sex. Shaper's attorneys have said that he had consensual sex with the women. Sharper played for the Green Bay Packers, Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints from 1997 through the 2010 season. The five-time Pro Bowl player intercepted 63 passes in his career, tying for seventh all-time. He is tied for second all-time in interceptions returned for touchdowns with 11, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. He was recently fired as an NFL Network analyst. Police: Sharper, friend told others of raping two women . CNN's Chuck Conder contributed to this report.","Darren Sharper is under supicision in five states, but charged in two .

"(CNN) -- Fewer people are expected to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday this year. Some 43.4 million Americans are predicted to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday next week, a 1.5% decrease from the 44 million people who traveled last year, according to AAA projections. The number of people traveling at least 50 miles from home during the Thanksgiving holiday travel period fell short of last year's four-year high. Travel company AAA describes the Thanksgiving holiday travel period as Wednesday, November 27 to Sunday, December 1. Some 90% of travelers drive rather than fly during the holiday, but fewer are also driving this year: Some 38.9 million travelers will drive, a decrease of 1.6%. The number of people flying is also expected to drop 3.7% from 3.26 million last year to 3.14 million this year, according to AAA. ""While the economy continues to improve, the sluggish pace of the recovery is creating uncertainty in the minds of some consumers and therefore AAA is projecting a slight decline in the number of Thanksgiving travelers this year,"" said AAA Chief Operating Officer Marshall L. Doney, in a Wednesday press statement. ""For those traveling the good news is motorists will receive a holiday bonus in the form of lower gas prices which are at their lowest levels for the holiday since 2010."" ATL24: A day in the life of the world's busiest airport . The Wednesday before the Thanksgiving holiday will be the holiday's busiest overall travel day, according to AAA. Thirty-seven percent of travelers expect to travel on Wednesday and the second busiest day will be Sunday, with 33% planning to return home that day. For fliers, the busiest travel day is expected to be Sunday, December 1, with an estimated 2.56 million travelers, according to Airlines for America, an airline industry group. The second busiest is the Wednesday before Thanksgiving (November 27) with 2.42 million fliers. Those numbers compare to the estimated 1.87 million travelers on Saturday, November 23. Impact of gasoline prices on travel plans . Drivers may find some relief at the gas pump, with AAA predicting prices of lower than $3 per gallon at gas stations in most states -- the cheapest gas prices for the Thanksgiving holiday in three years. The national average price of gas is at its cheapest level of the year and is expected to continue dropping for weeks. Car travelers are expected to drive an average of 601 miles this year compared to 588 miles last year. They are also spending less on travel, with median spending expected to drop from $498 last year to $465 this year. Help for the infrequent traveler . If you are flying this holiday season and rarely fly, here's a bit of helpful holiday advice from the Transportation Security Administration: . What about my shampoo and conditioner? Follow the TSA's 3-1-1 rule. If you want to travel with liquids in your carry-on bags, you can most likely bring them in bottles that hold 3.4 ounces or less, placed in one quart-sized, clear, plastic, zipped bag. (One bag per passenger, please.) Frequent business travelers: Just because you carried more bottles on your weekly trips doesn't mean you will be allowed during the holidays. These flights will likely be full, and you don't want to be the one slowing down your TSA security line. Travelers with medication, disabilities or medical conditions. People can travel with their medication, but make sure to tell the TSA officers at the start of the screening. And there are rules to follow. Travelers who need extra assistance because of disabilities or medical conditions can call the TSA Cares line at 855-787-2227 before your trip for guidance. Don't wrap your presents (yet). While there's no absolute rule against wrapped gifts, TSA officers may need to unwrap your gifts to inspect them. Why not wait until you land to wrap them? Don't carry a knife. Knives are still prohibited in carry-on luggage, but they can be placed in checked luggage. (Yes, there was a debate earlier in the year about knives, but the knives didn't win the right to fly in the passenger cabins.) Don't carry a gun. Passengers carrying guns up to a TSA security checkpoint can be subject to arrest and prosecution, even if bringing your weapon was an accident. Check TSA and airline regulations before trying to transport firearms and ammunition. Knitting needles are dandy. Knitting needles and other needlepoint items -- including scissors under 4 inches -- can be packed in your carry-on bags. But any cutter with a blade, including circular thread cutters, must be packed in your checked baggage. Use those e-devices. The Federal Aviation Administration has eased up rules on the use of portable electronics devices aboard airlines flying within the United States, so you may be able to watch a downloaded movie or read an e-book below 10,000 feet. But check your airline's website first to make sure it's gotten approval from the FAA. Talking on cell phones is still not allowed in-flight and no connecting to the Internet unless the flight attendants say so. Airlines quick to ease electronics rules . Still have questions? Call the TSA. Really. Call the TSA Contact Center at 866-289-9673 about your upcoming travel, TSA rules and any feedback about your travel. It's open Monday -- Friday, 8 a.m. -- 11 p.m. ET.

"Oso, Washington (CNN) -- The rain-soaked ground in Washington's Cascade Mountains offered little warning before it gave way, dumping a wall of mud onto the towns of Oso and Darrington, an hour's drive north of Seattle. With the official death toll at 16, eight more bodies located but not recovered, and as many as 176 other people unaccounted for in the landslide that struck Saturday, crews were digging through debris up to 20-feet deep to find survivors. As the search goes on, stories of those who escaped and those who are searching have begun to emerge: . 'I can hear them tapping underneath' It was a 911 call at about 10:45 a.m. Saturday that alerted authorities to a problem on State Route 530, a two-lane road that connects rural mountain communities. ""It is really flooding bad,"" the caller said. ""There's a roof of a house on the road."" Then came another call. And another. Michael Landon told a 911 dispatcher that his neighbor's house and a house on the other side of it were gone, and he was trying to find survivors. ""I am standing in the area now, and I can hear them tapping underneath and yelling at us,"" he told the dispatcher. Asked how many people he could hear, Landon said two. ""There should be three people in this house,"" he said. ""We are trying to find the other."" Other callers appeared to be struggling to understand what had happened. ""Everything is gone, the houses are gone!"" a woman screamed into the telephone. ""What happened? Can you tell me what happened?"" The dispatcher's answer: ""Landslide."" See before and after photos . 'Nobody else was able to get out' Four-year-old Jacob Spillers was in an upstairs room in his Oso house when the mudslide turned it into wreckage. He got out. His mother was at work when the wall of earth shifted. The mountain of debris it left behind blocked her from reaching her family. Jacob's father and three half-siblings apparently had not made it out of the house. ""Jacob told me he got out when nobody else was able to get out,"" said Jose Mangual, father of one of the children who hadn't escaped. Family was planning to turn property into cemetery . Nichole Rivera last heard from her daughter, Delaney Webb, on Saturday morning through a Facebook posting. Her daughter and her daughter's fiance were staying at the home of Rivera's parents. The couple had planned to wed there in August. When she couldn't reach them by telephone, Rivera flew from her home in suburban Houston to Washington state to find answers. But proximity didn't help. As the hours ticked by, Rivera said she had little reason to believe they were still alive. ""If you've seen the maps, and you've seen the extent of the devastation, and the consistency of the mud, I can tell you with great soundness they're not going to find my parents, or daughter, or her fiance,"" she told CNN. ""I really feel that they're gone."" Rivera's aunt, Debbie Satterlee, was still coming to terms with the possibility that her brother, sister-in-law and niece might never be found amid the mud and wreckage -- all that was left of the property where Rivera's parents had once planned to put a family cemetery plot. ""It would be great to have a body,"" Rivera said ""But if we can't we can't, they're in the right spot."" Mother of four praying husband found air pocket . At first, La Rae deQuilettes didn't worry when her husband, an electrician, didn't return home Saturday. Ron was just working late, she told herself. He had sent his wife of 31 years a text message that morning, saying he had arrived at the job. But by early Sunday, when he still hadn't returned to their home in suburban Seattle, she realized her husband had been working where the landslide had struck. ""It's a living nightmare,"" she said. She was trying to keep it together for their four children, praying that her husband had found an air pocket or was somewhere waiting for rescuers. ""He's a fighter,"" she said. ""He's tall and strong. He has a heart in him like there's no tomorrow."" Police, she said, had told her that the couple who hired her husband were also among the missing. Body of Navy officer found, his wife is still missing . The waiting ended Tuesday for the family of U.S. Navy Cmdr. John Regelbrugge, 49, whose body and that of his dog were found by his brothers. His wife, Kris, was still missing. ""They were both home when the slide hit, but they haven't found her yet,"" said his sister-in-law, Jackie Leighton. Regelbrugge's three sons serve in the U.S. military. Two are involved in the search, and the third was making his way home from abroad to join them. Vietnam vet's son holds out hope . Barbara Welsh last saw her husband, Bill, early Saturday as he was leaving to help someone in Oso install a water tank. ""My husband is a survivor, and I believe in him,"" Welsh said of the Vietnam veteran to whom she has been married for 43 years. ""And that's all you can do -- is keep believing."" Welsh's firefighter son, Wayne, was basing his hopes that his father had survived on what he has learned on the job. ""It's the knowledge you get from the structure,"" he said. ""People can last a long time out there."" He was touched by the number of people helping in the search. ""I've just been down here at the fire station and seen all the volunteers come out of the woodwork,"" he said. It has given his family hope, he said. They need that right now. CNN's George Howell reported from Oso. Chelsea J. Carter and Ben Brumfield reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Bayern Munich's 10-match winning run came to a halt on Saturday with a 0-0 draw at Hoffenheim that saw goalkeeper Manuel Neuer go past 1,000 minutes without conceding a goal. The Germany international, who signed from Schalke in pre-season, kept his 11th consecutive clean sheet as Bayern maintained a three-point lead after eight league rounds. Second-placed Werder Bremen can join the 22-time Bundesliga champions on 19 points with a victory at Hanover on Sunday, but Bayern have a far superior goal difference ahead of the international break. Bayern coach Jupp Heynckes was happy with the result following the midweek Champions League win at home to Manchester City. ""We started well and had the match under control for the first 20 minutes, but Hoffenheim ran hard, showed lots of fighting spirit and seized the initiative,"" he said. ""The draw's the right result, in my opinion. We were magnificent last Tuesday, and we've expended a lot of physical effort in recent weeks. One or two of my players simply weren't sharp this afternoon, but that's normal. We gave a battling display, we were very smart, and we've kept another clean sheet."" Third-placed Borussia Monchengladbach also have 16 points after a 1-0 defeat at lowly Freiburg. Johannes Flum scored the only goal from long range in the 19th minute to lift Freiburg out of the bottom three. Defending champions Borussia Dortmund moved up to fourth, above Stuttgart, Hoffeheim and Bayer Leverkusen on goal difference, after a 4-0 home win that dropped promoted Augsburg to rock bottom. Poland striker Robert Lewandowski scored a hat-trick and playmaker Mario Gotze added the other as Dortmund bounced back from the midweek Champions League defeat by Marseille. Bayer Leverkusen followed up the midweek European win over Genk with another home victory, beating Wolfsburg 3-1. Gonzalo Castro opened the scoring in the 14th minute before Mario Mandzukic leveled for the Wolves just before the hour mark. Erin Derdiyok restored Leverkusen's lead six minutes later and Stefan Kiessling sealed Bayer's fourth win in the league near the end. Hertha Berlin moved up to mid-table with a 3-0 home win over Cologne as 19-year-old striker Pierre-Michel Lasogga scored twice and Brazilian midfielder Raffael added the third before halftime. Nuremberg and Mainz shared the points in a six-goal thriller that ended with Tomas Pekhart equalizing for the home side with eight minutes to play. Visiting Mainz had trailed to early goals from Markus Feulner and Robert Mak, but led seven minutes after the break through Nico Bungert, Maxim Choupo-Moting and Andreas Ivanschnitz. On Friday, Stuttgart joined Hanover and Schalke on 12 points with a 2-0 win at struggling Kaiserslautern, who dropped into the bottom three after Saturday's results.","German league leaders Bayern Munich held 0-0 by Hoffenheim on Saturday .

"(CNN) -- Syrian rebels bombed a hotel used as a base for government forces, the latest massive attack in the seesaw battle for the country's largest city. The Islamic Front, Syria's most powerful rebel alliance, claimed responsibility for the blast on Twitter. The group said it targeted the Carlton Citadel Hotel and several other buildings in the old city of Aleppo. According to the opposition Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least 14 people were killed and dozens were injured. The blast took place near historical ruins in Aleppo. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency described an ""enormous attack on Aleppo old city antiquities launched by terrorists ... blowing up tunnels they dug under archeological buildings."" Syrian state-run TV said the army confronted ""terrorist mercenaries as they tried to clash with the army after they dug a tunnel and detonated their bomb."" A military source said the Syrian army managed to control the area and ""killed scores of these terrorists,"" the network said. State-run TV reporter Chadi Hilwe said Thursday is also the third day Aleppo is facing a water shortage because terrorists targeted a water treatment plant. Government forces and rebels have been battling for control of Aleppo throughout Syria's 3-year-old civil war. The uprising against President Bashar al-Assad's regime began in 2011, with dissidents seeking democratic reforms and greater freedoms. Al-Assad's family has ruled Syria for 43 years. After a fierce government crackdown, the peaceful protests spiraled into an armed rebellion, with rebels demanding al-Assad's ouster. The Syrian regime has consistently said it is battling ""terrorists."" As the battles rage on, foreign fighters -- including radical militants -- have joined both sides of the civil war.

"Centennial, Colorado (CNN) -- A judge on Tuesday entered a standard plea of not guilty for James Holmes, the man suspected in a mass shooting at a Colorado movie theater, after he and his attorneys said they were not ready to enter a plea. In court documents, Holmes' attorneys had suggested that they might enter a plea of not guilty by reason of insanity for the shooting rampage at the theater that left 12 people dead and 58 injured on July 20, 2012. Holmes' sanity was expected to be a major issue at Tuesday's arraignment; his attorneys still may enter an insanity plea but it would be subject to the judge's approval. Holmes' parents sat holding hands during the hearing but didn't react to the judge's decision. They were seated directly across the aisle from wheelchair-bound shooting victim Caleb Medley and his wife, Katie, who delivered their baby shortly after the shooting. The hearing was delayed about 30 minutes because Holmes' attorney Daniel King was late. He attributed it to traffic caused by unexpected snowfall -- a weather system that surprised many journalists in the courtroom, as well. When King asked Judge William Blair Sylvester for a delay of the arraignment, there were audible sighs from the side of the courtroom where shooting survivors and victim families sit. When the judge declared that he would move forward with the arraignment, one man held his hands in the air in a ""hallelujah"" gesture. Prosecutors say they will make a decision on whether it not to seek the death penalty against the 25-year-old Holmes at a hearing April 1. But an insanity plea could make such a move harder, said David Beller, an attorney who is not connected to the case. ""There are a few reasons they wouldn't go for the death penalty; the most important one being his mental state,"" Beller said. ""The Supreme Court, and really society, has been very clear: We don't execute people who are mentally ill."" Details of shooting emerge in hearing . The reaction . Family members of some of those who died in the shooting say they would be unhappy with an insanity defense. Jessica Watts, whose cousin was killed, said she does not believe Holmes is insane. ""Absolutely not. This was months and months of planning and thousands of dollars spent on his part in order to pull this horrific night off,"" she said. Federal agents have said Holmes began buying guns in May 2012, two months before the attack. He allegedly built an arsenal of two Glock handguns, an AR-15 rifle, a shotgun and 6,295 rounds of ammunition. In addition, authorities contend, the former University of Colorado doctoral student dyed his hair fiery orange and apparently visited the movie theater, taking photographs of hallways and doors, two weeks before the shooting. Remembering the victims . The defense . According to the Colorado Bar Association, an insanity defense refers to ""a person who is so diseased or defective in mind at the time of the commission of the act as to be incapable of distinguishing right from wrong with respect to that act is not accountable."" If Holmes' enters such a plea, he would waive all medical confidentiality and will have to turn over the name of any doctor or psychologist who may have treated him, according to Colorado law. ""If he enters the not guilty by reason of insanity plea, he's going to be examined by state doctors and any statement he makes to those state doctors are given to the prosecution for potential use later,"" Beller said. On Monday, a judge ruled that Holmes will also have to agree to be drugged by doctors to assess his condition if he enters an insanity plea. Earlier this month, Holmes' lawyers tried to have Colorado's insanity defense laws changed. The attorneys asked the judge to rule parts of the state's insanity defense laws unconstitutional. Among other issues, they cited the requirement that a defendant ""cooperate"" with examining psychiatrists as a violation of the defendant's privilege against compelled self-incrimination. Widow of Colorado theater shooting victim sues psychiatrist . The charges . Holmes is charged with a total of 166 counts of murder, attempted murder and other charges. Authorities say he booby-trapped his apartment with explosives, then traveled to the movie theater armed with four weapons, tear gas and body armor planning to kill audience members during a screening of ""Batman: The Dark Knight Rises."" Witnesses who have spoken to CNN about the shooting have said the gunman roamed the theater, shooting randomly as people tried to scramble away or cowered between seats. Among the 41 calls to 911, one stands out. In the 27-second call, at least 30 shots can be heard amid the chaos. At his preliminary hearing in January, police who responded described hellish scenes inside the theater and described finding Holmes, dressed in body armor, standing outside, seeming ""detached from it all,"" according to Officer Jason Oviatt. At the conclusion of the brief hearing, the father of one of the victim's shouted out, ""Rot in hell, Holmes."" Holmes' trial date has been set for August 5. Read the latest news on CNN.com .

And speaking of season 1: The first of those highly anticipated 10 episodes, which was originally slated to debut in November, has been pushed back a few months and will now premiere in early 2015, according to AMC. The 13-episode season 2 is scheduled to hit the air in early 2016. ""Breaking Bad"" creator Vince Gilligan, who is serving as co-showrunner and executive producer of Saul, will direct the first episode of the series, which will serve as a prequel and chronicle the adventures of underhanded attorney Saul Goodman before he teamed up with meth kingpin Walter White (Bryan Cranston). The network also released the first official photo from the set, which features Odenkirk, Gilligan, and Peter Gould, the ""Bad"" co-executive producer who created the Goodman character and is serving as Saul's other co-showrunner/executive producer. ""Production on Better Call Saul is underway and we could not be more proud of nor more excited about the work to date. We join the fans in eager anticipation for this series and today we happily confirm that our initial Saul order is for two seasons and a total of 23 episodes,"" said AMC president Charlie Collier in a statement. ""When introducing any series, especially one with the DNA of Breaking Bad, there are countless factors to consider in making sure the show gets the launch it deserves. We have a strong history with Vince, Peter, Bob, the studio and so many involved with this production; we are enjoying the process on 'Saul' and all share a focus on making it a true television event. No half measures."" The project reunites many members of the ""Breaking Bad"" team besides Gilligan, Gould, and Odenkirk. Jonathan Banks, who played fixer Mike Ehrmantraut on the original series, is a member of the cast, and Bad writer-producers Thomas Schnauz and Gennifer Hutchison are among Saul's scribes.

"JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- The international group Human Rights Watch is accusing Israel of firing weapons containing white phosphorus into Gaza. The group demands that the alleged practice cease. Israel is declining to say whether bursts like this over Gaza involve white phosphorus. The group's  researchers in Israel ""observed multiple air-bursts of artillery-fired white phosphorus over what appeared to be the Gaza City/Jabaliya area"" on Friday and Saturday, the organization said on its Web site. ""Israel appeared to be using white phosphorus as an 'obscurant' [a chemical used to hide military operations], a permissible use in principle"" under the laws of war, the HRW posting said. ""However, white phosphorus has a significant, incidental, incendiary effect that can severely burn people and set structures, fields, and other civilian objects in the vicinity on fire,"" the posting said. ""The potential for harm to civilians is magnified by Gaza's high population density, among the highest in the world."" HRW said the use of white phosphorus in Gaza would violate ""the requirement under international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian injury and loss of life."" Last week, an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN: ""I can tell you with certainty that white phosphorus is absolutely not being used."" Now, however, Israeli officials have a different response to questions about the possible use of phosphorus: ""Any munitions that Israel is using are in accordance with international law. Israel does not specify the types of munitions or the types of operations it is conducting."" Still, a doctor familiar with the material said it is not possible to tell, based on pictures of burns, whether white phosphorus was responsible. ""Dead tissue pretty much looks the same,"" said Dr. Peter Grossman, president of the Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks, California. The chemical ""can burn down houses and cause horrific burns when it touches the skin,"" said Marc Garlasco, senior military analyst at Human Rights Watch. Since January 3, when Israel began its ground offensive in Gaza, news reports have circulated about the possible use of white phosphorus by the IDF. HRW's assertion was supported by munitions experts and some Palestinian doctors, including Nafiz Abu Sha'aban, who said the burns it caused were unlike anything he has seen in 27 years of practice. Watch footage of burn patients in Gaza . Though most severely burned patients have been sent to Egypt, the ongoing fighting has made it impossible to evacuate all of them, including one man with deep burns over 47 percent of his body, the doctor said. White phosphorus is known to burn flesh down to the bone. It's intended to provide illumination or to create a smokescreen in battle. Under an international protocol ratified by Israel in 1995, the use of such incendiary weapons is allowed when ""not specifically designed to cause burn injury to persons."" There is no prohibition per se against white phosphorus in conflict. But the timing and location of its use are restricted. For example, it is illegal under the protocol to use white phosphorus against any personnel, civilian or military. It can be directed only against military targets. International law says incendiary weapons cannot be used where civilians are concentrated. A house north of Gaza City was hit Sunday by something that observers contend may have been white phosphorus. ""It's been burning since one o'clock in the morning,"" Munir Hammada told CNN 11 hours later. ""If you move it with your feet, it reignites. You can't put it out with water, only sand."" Those characteristics match the properties of white phosphorus, which ignites on contact with air.","Researchers in Israel saw bursts of white phosphorus over Gaza, group says .

"(CNN) -- Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho, the only coach to win European football's top three leagues, has told CNN in an exclusive interview that his remarkable track record of success and very public profile has had a devastating impact on his personal life. After winning league titles with Chelsea, Inter, Real as well as Porto in his homeland, Mourinho says it has got to the stage where even his 12-year-old son is taunted when he plays a football match. ""I hate my social life,"" Mourinho told CNN. ""I hate not to be a normal father who goes with his son to the son's football match and being there with the other 20 fathers there watching the game. ""I'm at a football match of kids and I have to be there. The people have to come for photos; the people have to come for autographs; the people have to come to insult me; the people have to go behind the goal of my kid and insult my kid of 12."" As well as his uncanny ability to guide teams to trophy after trophy, Mourinho's very public profile has also been accompanied by an ability to attract headlines -- sometimes unwanted -- where his media conference theatrics have journalists drooling over his every utterance. At times the Portuguese coach, who is courted by numerous sponsors, has also tarnished his reputation -- no more so than in last season's altercation with the now Barcelona manager Tito Vilanova, when Mourinho poked his opponent in the eye. ""I think it's quite normal because people think they know me, but they don't,"" added Mourinho, who is bidding to become the first coach to win the Champions League with three different clubs following his triumphs with Porto in 2004 and Inter Milan in 2010. ""People know the manager, especially the manager during 90 minutes. And during 90 minutes, I'm not there to have fun. ""Fun is a consequence. I'm there to do my job, I'm there to win. I'm there with my team to try to win. I'm there and I live the game, I live the match as if it was the last match of my career. ""So people look at me and they see what they see. After that, in press conferences, it's the other place where people know me. ""In press conferences, there is still a match to play. Before the match, press conference is pre-match and after the match, press conference is post-match, but it's a match."" But Mourinho insisted he was a very different person one from the portrayed by the media. ""People don't know me as a friend, as a family man, as a manager inside of my group, the relationship I have with the people that work in the club. ""So I don't complain and say people are wrong, people are looking at me with the wrong eye. No, these people see what they see."" And despite the cost to his personal life, Mourinho insisted he wanted to be a coach for at least another two decades. ""So, you know, I would love to be with my family in the street as a normal person and I can't, so I am a completely different person in my private life,"" added Mourinho, who will turn 50 in January. ""I keep to myself, I keep to the people that are close to me and one day when my career finishes, I hope that I will still have a few years to be a normal person because I want to finish my career at 70 or 75."" After guiding Porto to the European Cup in 2004, Mourinho moved to England and managed Chelsea, who won two English Premier League titles in 2005 and 2006 under the Portuguese coach and he has often spoken of his desire to return to England. There has plenty of speculation he will replace Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United as the 70-year-old Scotsman approaches the twilight of his managerial career. The two men enjoy a close relationship away from football -- they both share a love of fine wine -- with Mourinho affectionately referring to the United manager as 'The Boss'. ""I call him the boss because he's the boss of the coaches and I hope that when I go back to English football he still manages Manchester United. ""I don't think about that, especially as I have a four-year contract with Real, I sign it and when I sign it, I sign it because I wanted to be in Real Madrid at this period of my career and I don't think in another club. ""I just say openly that for many reasons that after Real Madrid, Inter, Italy, Spain, Chelsea, England, Porto, Portugal, that after this project, the next step will be England for many reasons but when I don't know. ""I don't have an idea and I am so happy to be in this moment as manager of the best club in the world."" Mourinho retains a home in London and was keen to emphasize he is still on friendly terms with Chelsea's billionaire owner Roman Abramovich, revealing that the Russian had played a key role in recently allowing Blues midfielder Michael Essien to make a loan move to Madrid before the end of the August transfer window. ""We are in touch a lot, and the last example is Michael Essien was going to another club and when I did (gestures to telephone call) 'please leave it to your friend' he left to his friend,"" said the Real coach. ""We have a great relationship in fact.""","Jose Mourinho's son taunted while playing football .

"(CNN) -- Smartphone owners may have to ask themselves: why text when there's Facebook Messenger? That's a question the cellular carriers will lament as the biggest technology players pile into what's known as the mobile-messaging space. Facebook joined the fray on Tuesday with the release of Messenger for iPhone and Android. Facebook's Messages feature, which allows people to communicate privately with friends on the social network and recently with e-mail acquaintances, is already built into the Facebook apps. However, the new standalone Messenger software is a cornerstone for Facebook's ambition to become the communications hub on phones, Facebook employees working on the messaging product have said in interviews. To design the app, Facebook acquired the development team that built a program called Beluga. It allows users to include photos and location coordinates with each message and can also send text messages to phone numbers, much like the new Facebook app. Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook product director, discussed the potential need for a dedicated client in an March interview, days after the Beluga engineers started at the Palo Alto, California, company. ""One click from the home screen is a valuable trait,"" he said, contrasted with the need to open the full Facebook app in order seek new messages. ""They've built specifically for mobile-to-mobile. Our messages stuff was built for a convergence between mobile and Web and e-mail and a bunch of other things."" Bosworth suggested that a standalone messenger was ""the next step"" in Facebook's plans. As it turns out, it was. But cell operators, which derive substantial profits from texting plans and per-message fees, stand in the way, Bosworth said. How they manage their SMS networks is viewed by tech visionaries as controlled, stifling. (SMS stands for Short Messaging Service, another name for texting.) Facebook is made up of people who breathe the hacker ethos. Earlier this summer, for example, Facebook hired George Hotz, aka GeoHot, who hacked iPhone and PlayStation 3 software. Networks should be malleable, these people often say. ""SMS to SMS: those are controlled by the carriers,"" Bosworth said during the interview from March. ""That's a closed loop."" Apple, whose founders famously built ""blue box"" equipment decades ago for enabling free phone calls, much to the chagrin of telecom firms, apparently buy into this thinking as well. This fall, Apple will bundle a mobile app called iMessage into iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad, which can bypass cell carrier infrastructure granting free text messages to other users of Apple devices. Similarly, Research in Motion has BlackBerry Messenger. And Google provides two services: Huddles, which is part of the Google+ social network, and Google Voice. A dedicated app can be deployed on, say, your mother's smartphone in order to ween her off of AT&T's or Verizon Wireless' texting services and into a free communication network that uses minute amounts of data. ""To people, it's a bridge -- like, 'Oh, I already know how this works. This is great,'"" Bosworth said. These types of apps ""are taking SMS and moving it away from that closed-loop thing and into another space,"" he added. ""This is an area that's very exciting and hot and interesting,"" Bosworth said. ""I don't think anyone has the answer yet. I think Facebook Messages is the very likely substrate upon which these things end up operating."" An AT&T spokesman declined to comment. Verizon has said it intends to eventually move all of its services onto its next-generation 4G LTE data network. The company hasn't said how it would price the different features. Software alternatives to texting could pose a threat to existing money makers, but carriers must find or create other worthwhile channels to charge for, Verizon Wireless marketing chief Marni Walden said in an interview in January. ""We'll always be in a place where we have to evolve how we generate revenue for the business,"" Walden said. ""But we're not going to run away from the innovation that's happening out there. We're going to make sure we innovate it better, or integrate it better on our devices than anyone else, as opposed to putting up a walled garden."" To that, the technorati might say: LOL.","Facebook released the Messenger app for smartphones on Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- It's not every day that just two football matches produce a cricket score -- in this case an incredible 146 goals -- and Nigerian football authorities are so suspicious of the games in question that they have been referred to the police as a ""criminal matter."" As both Plateau United Feeders and Police Machine FC battled to reach the fifth tier of the Nigerian football league on Monday, the amateur sides racked up 79-0 and 67-0 wins respectively. At half-time, the teams had managed a relatively meager 13 goals between them -- only for the avalanche to begin as the teams tried to outdo one another on goal difference. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) indefinitely suspended the winning sides and their beaten opponents as it launched an investigation into an incident it termed ""a mind-boggling show of shame never previously witnessed in Nigerian football."" The scores were the biggest seen in African football since Madagascar's AS Adema won 149-0 in a 2002 match where losing side Stade Olympique l'Emyrne scored numerous own goals in protest at a refereeing decision. ""We have reported the matter to police as it is a criminal matter,"" the NFF's Assistant Media Director Ademola Olajire, told CNN. ""They will do their due diligence, and we will also do our own investigation. The results of our investigation are likely to result in very, very severe penalties for all involved. The clubs may be banned for life."" One of the losing sides, Bubayaro, has already been disbanded by its president following their thrashing by Police Machine FC, while Akurba FC were the side who shipped 79 goals. Like the NFF, Bubayaro owner Shuaibu-Gara Ahmed Gombe also referred the incident to police in Bauchi State, which is where the playoff matches took place. But those associated with the club cannot wash their hands of the matter by simply closing Bubayaro down, says Olajire. ""We still have details of their officials,"" he explained. ""They still exist as people and they will have to answer to the police."" In its initial statement, the NFF described the results as ""scandalous"". The material benefit for whichever side won promotion was minimal, says Olajire, and the players themselves would gain little by stepping up a division. Even wages for those playing in Nigeria's elite Premier League rarely top $200 per month. ""Getting into the (fifth) division is no great shakes financially,"" the NFF media spokesman said. ""Even clubs in the second division struggle to make ends meet. There is sponsorship for teams in the Premier League but very little compared to what they pay to play games around the country."" Football's world governing body FIFA is also interested in what action the NFF takes. ""The matter is firstly the responsibility of the Nigerian Football [Federation],"" FIFA told CNN in a statement. ""Therefore FIFA is currently monitoring the situation and waiting for action taken by the Nigerian [federation]."" As they entered the third and final round of matches to determine which team would gain promotion to the Nationwide League Division 3, Plateau United and Police Machine were level on points, goal difference and goals scored. Both sides had managed a total of just two goals in their previous two games but at halftime in the decisive matches, Plateau United were 7-0 up and holding the advantage as their opponents had scored one fewer. The second half witnessed a tsunami of goals, with United netting on 72 occasions and Police Machine plundering 61 strikes themselves. Police Matter . One thorny issue for those leading the inquiry is that Yola-based Police Machine are a side that represent Nigeria's police force. ""This will be a very dispassionate job,"" the NFF's Olajire added. ""We believe the police will do a fair job, no matter that a police team is involved. ""I want to assure you that this matter will interest the Director General of police, Mohammed Abubakar, who is a former member of the NFF board."" CNN tried to contact police authorities in Nigeria but they were not immediately available for comment. Neither were officials from clubs that traditionally lack presence both domestically and online. News of what leading NFF official Mike Umeh has called a ""scandal of huge proportions"" come in a year when Nigerian football has been on the up. Earlier this year, the West African country won the Africa Cup of Nations when beating Burkina Faso in the final, the Super Eagles' first continental title since 1994 and their third overall. However, Olajire does not believe the playoff farce will be of any detriment to the standing of Nigerian football around the world. ""You have people who try to break the law everywhere. What matters are the steps that are taken next. We want to assure you that the NFF is on top of this.""","Nigeria Football Federation refers ""scandalous"" results to police for investigation .

"(CNN) -- The millennial generation is big, diverse and changing the American landscape. A new infographic and book, ""The Next America,"" by Paul Taylor and the Pew Research Center, examines the data about the change. It's revelatory. Taylor calls the demographic transformations ""dramas in slow motion."" The Gen Y -- or millennial -- generation's lack of religious affiliation, indifference to political parties and strong liberal views are a contrast to previous generations. Additionally, a great deal of the ""next"" in ""The Next America"" has to do with racial and ethnic identity. Immigration, intermarriage and the growing percentages of people who identify as mixed race are drastically recoloring the nation's racial tapestry. Today, just a half-century after interracial marriages were illegal in one-third of the states, nearly 1 in 6 newlyweds marry across racial lines. Immigrants and their children are projected to make up about 37% of America's population by mid-century, the highest share in our history. But what does this all mean? There is often a focus on data highlighting the size and diversity of the millennial generation, drawing the conclusion that it is inevitable that our values will soon take over. But research shows other factors are equally important: Our generation's economic insecurity, dependence on our parents and most notably, the unprecedented size of the older generation. I want to challenge the notion of inevitability, that just because we are more diverse, liberal and ""huge,"" millennials will soon win the culture wars and easily transform our society to reflect our values. In my early 20s, as a Gen Y proselytizer and a person of color, I thought I knew exactly what the demographic changes meant: Millennials, in all of our black, brown and liberal glory, were taking over politically. I spent the early part of my career working on progressive policies and cause campaigns geared toward youth and diverse communities. I even founded a program that applied a racial equity lens to public policy development in part because of the country's changing demographics. The unspoken premise was this: Political elites had better ""get hip"" and start authentically working toward equity. Otherwise, they would be left in the change-making millennial dust. This premise was grounded in what I now call the myth of inevitability. Although I worked hard to increase civic engagement, activism and community involvement amongst my peers, deep down inside, I believed that the odds were in our favor. We would inevitably win the culture wars because of our sheer size and diversity. I believed that increasing our involvement and voice would make the difference of when the United States would be transformed to reflect our values, not if. I was not alone. Others deeply believed this to be true, too. But there are a few important factors that we forgot to consider. First, the country isn't just young and diverse. It is also getting old very quickly. The second major demographic ""drama"" detailed by Pew is one of older Americans living longer than ever before. Ten thousand baby boomers will turn 65 every single day between now and 2030. For the first time, by 2060, there will be almost as many Americans older than 85 as younger than 5. Thus the joke about ""waiting for the older generation to die off"" to see our political and social goals realized isn't just crass: It not a realistic path to social change. And that's not all. There are other cultural realities standing in the way of an ""inevitable"" political takeover. Millennials are economically insecure, politically unaffiliated and, according to Pew, not at all interested in generational warfare. Unlike previous generations, we actually like our parents and grandparents -- perhaps because we're still living with them. Suddenly, revolution doesn't look as inevitable as it once did. But it is still possible. I propose that the value wars that play out on issues such as immigration, women's rights, equality, criminal justice and America's treatment of the poor will be determined by three factors: participation, leadership and systems innovation. Participation in the political process is key. In the research from Pew, it confirms that millennial voting has actually been remarkably solid, increasing and staying strong in presidential elections since 2004. If this continues, adequate political representation should follow. But leading and participating in the system is not enough when the systems are broken, such as the impending doom around Social Security and other programs if left as is. The only way to fix them is to innovate and create them anew. Innovation can come from first learning the ins and outs of the current system, applying creativity and technological prowess to the problems and third, taking the risk to experiment and start enterprises that challenge the status quo if and when necessary. The data about the country's race and age transformation is clear. But millennials will only make a transformational political impact when we take the reins, lead and recreate the United States from the inside out. Now that will be a demographic drama worth watching. Share your thoughts in the comments, on Twitter @CNNLiving or on CNN Living's Facebook page.

"Lampedusa, Italy (CNN) -- ""Today is a day of tears,"" Pope Francis said Friday of a shipwreck off the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa a day earlier, in which at least 111 people died. Italy's government declared Friday a day of national mourning in the wake of the shipwreck. Rescue efforts continued through the day, with divers at the site of the wreck, but rough waters complicated their task. Four children were among the dead, alongside 49 women and 58 men, coast guard spokesman Filippo Marini said. Another 155 people have been rescued: 145 men, six women and four children. There are fears the death toll could rise further since the boat, which capsized after catching fire just half a mile off the coast, may have been carrying as many as 500 migrants from Africa. Italian authorities estimate that about 200 people are not accounted for. The U.N. refugee agency said that all but one of the survivors were from Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa. The other was Tunisian. Among those who escaped with their lives are 40 unaccompanied boys between ages 14 and 17, said Melissa Fleming, chief spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency. She described the migrants as exhausted and in a state of shock. Survivors recounted a harrowing tale of 13 days spent on the boat, which picked up its passengers from the Libyan towns of Misrata and Zuwara, to the west, Fleming said. As they approached the coast of Lampedusa, the engine stopped. The migrants hoped to be spotted, but, they told the U.N. agency, fishing boats passed by without helping, so they set fire to clothes and blankets in a bid to attract attention. A tourist boat finally sounded the alert, and the coast guard came to their rescue, Fleming said. Lampedusa's boat people: One man's story . The survivors have been taken to a reception center that's already overcrowded with about 1,000 other recent arrivals by boat, she said. Lampedusa, south of Sicily and the closest Italian island to Africa, has become a destination for tens of thousands of refugees seeking to enter European Union countries. And such wrecks of migrant boats, although on a smaller scale, have become all too common. Pope Francis, who gave his unscripted remarks while meeting with the poor on a visit to Assisi, the birthplace of his namesake Saint Francis, also railed Thursday against what occurred in Lampedusa. Labeling the tragedy a ""disgrace,"" he called for concerted action to ensure it is not repeated in future. He visited Lampedusa in July to pray for refugees and migrants lost at sea and criticized then what he called ""global indifference"" to the island's refugee crisis. 'Fundamentally wrong' Despite the dangers of taking to the sea in boats that are often barely seaworthy, thousands of migrants and asylum seekers depart North Africa's shores every year in search of a better life. Another 13 men drowned off Italy's southern coast Monday when they attempted to swim ashore, the U.N. refugee agency said Thursday. And last week, the Italian coast guard rescued a ship bound for Lampedusa from Tunisia that had 398 Syrian refugees on board. U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres said the tragedy ""should serve as a wake-up call"" to the world. ""There is something fundamentally wrong in a world where people in need of protection have to resort to these perilous journeys,"" he said. He called for more effective international cooperation to crack down on people smugglers, saying the latest tragedy shows how vital it is for refugees ""to have legal channels to access territories where they can find protection."" Maurizio Albahari, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame, said it was time for Europe to enact new policies rather than simply shed tears for those who died -- or blame the traffickers. ""To solve the problem, it is vital to understand what it is that routinely brings thousands of migrants to trust smugglers, face exorbitant costs and risk their lives on unseaworthy vessels,"" he said. ""It's quite simple. It is legally impossible for them to travel safely on planes and ferries."" This can be because their oppressive home countries won't grant them exit visas or because they're poor and can't offer the financial guarantees needed for a European visa to be granted, he said. ""But they risk the many dangers to escape despair,"" he said. ""They fall through the immense cracks of a system that needs them for a job or might grant them asylum, but only if they first make it through miles of peril and years of exploitation."" Rights group Human Rights Watch said in its World Report 2013 that ""ongoing serious human rights abuses, forced labor and indefinite military service prompt thousands of Eritreans to flee the country every year."" No election has been held since it gained independence in 1993, the rights group said. Meanwhile, torture, arbitrary detention and severe restrictions on people's freedoms ""remain routine in Eritrea."" Overcrowded boats . Just under 115 kilometers (70 miles) from Tunisia, Lampedusa has been the first point of entry to Europe for more than 200,000 refugees and irregular migrants who have passed through the island since 1999. But boats carrying migrants often are in peril at sea. In recent years, the Italian coast guard says, it has been involved in the rescue of more than 30,000 refugees around the island. Izabella Cooper, a spokeswoman for the European Union's border agency, Frontex, said migrants are often sent to sea in overcrowded vessels without the engine power to make such a long and dangerous journey. Since the start of the year, Frontex -- which supports the efforts of individual EU member states -- has helped save more than 16,000 lives in search-and-rescue operations, she said. ""Italy is currently facing the biggest migratory pressure of all European countries,"" she said, adding that more than 31,500 have reached its shores since the beginning of the year. The migrants mainly set off from Libya, but others also leave from Egypt, she said. ""We see an increasing amount of Eritreans, Somalis, to a lesser extent sub-Saharan Africans, and an increasing number of Syrian nationals."" While Italy is the current focus of efforts by migrants and asylum-seekers hoping to enter the European Union, Cooper said, that has not always been the case. ""Seven years ago, it was the Canary Islands, then the pressure moved to the central Mediterranean, then it moved to Greece, then with the Arab Spring, it moved back to Italy,"" she said. ""There are definitely too many lives lost and definitely too many tragedies in the Mediterranean."" Dead or missing at sea . Rights group Amnesty International called for both Italy and the European Union to do more to safeguard the thousands who risk their lives each year in the hope of protection or a better life, rather than focusing on closing off the borders. More than 100 missing after illegal migrant boat sinks off Bangladesh . According to a briefing published by the U.N. refugee agency in July, the peak crossing period for migrants and asylum-seekers runs from May to September. The U.N. refugee agency recorded 40 deaths in the first six months of 2013, a figure based on interviews with survivors of the crossing. For 2012 as a whole, 15,000 migrants and asylum-seekers reached Italy and Malta, and almost 500 people were reported dead or missing at sea, it said. The U.N. agency credits the efforts of the Italian coast guard and Maltese armed forces for a reduction in migrant deaths in the first half of 2013 compared with the previous year. Risk for a better life ends in death for 22 people near Indonesia . CNN's Livia Borghese reported from Lampedusa and Hada Messia from Rome, while Laura Smith-Spark wrote in London. CNN's Alexander Felton and Nina Dos Santos contributed to this report.","Survivors say they set fire to clothes to try to get help after the boat's engine stopped .

"Before her wedding, Katharine McPhee talked with InStyle about meeting her future husband, picking the ring and her wedding day. (InStyle.com) -- Every bit the blushing bride, American Idol alum Katharine McPhee gushes about her producer fiance, Nick Cokas, and shares their plans for a big, fat, half-Greek wedding. Q: How did you and Nick meet? We met in 2005, doing a show in Los Angeles called The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. [Cokas was a producer.] I had just turned 21 and had no idea what I was doing with my life. I was totally focused on my career. Plus, I was at my wit's end with this other boyfriend. Nick and I went on a few dates. We would go to a bar, and then go back to his car. It was so high school. We'd kiss in the car and then talk until like four in the morning. It was very sweet. Q: Tell us about your gown. It's a Manuel Mota for Pronovias. It originally had lace straps that were very beautiful, but I really like my shoulders. That part of my body is one of my favorites. I wanted to show off my shoulders and my back a little bit for the wedding. And the people at R-Mine Bridal Couture, where I bought it said, ""No problem. We can make it into a sweetheart neckline.""  Watch how she looked at wedding » . Q: Are you going to wear a veil? Yes, but I wasn't going to at first. I thought, ""Who wears veils over their heads anymore? This is 2008!"" But now I am excited to wear one. I think it will be good because I might be teary-eyed when I'm coming down the aisle... or nervous. My dad's going to pull it back for me when we get to the altar. The thing about weddings is it's the one time in your life that you actually get to wear a big, poofy dress. Unless you're getting an Academy Award, you really don't have opportunities like that, so you might as well take advantage of it. I say, ""Go big! This is your wedding. Go big!"" Q: Do you have any advice for other brides? Remember that it's your wedding day. Nick and I talk about this a lot. We're having these amazing musicians come for the cocktail hour and we're having this huge gospel choir, this huge band and everything's big, big, big. The dress is big, and we have so many groomsmen and bridesmaids, but you know what? At the end of the day, it's really about the expression of commitment in love and marriage. So, don't get too carried away. A wedding is about the commitment of love that you're making to your partner. It's as simple as that. Q:Will any of your Idol ""classmates"" be performing? Mandisa is actually going to sing at the ceremony. She is going to sing this song that means a lot to me and Nick. It's called ""Stay with You"" by John Legend, and we're going to have the gospel choir behind her. And then Kellie [Pickler] will be there, but I don't know if she'll sing. She might just hang out. Q: Tell us about your ring. Did you pick it out together? Nick designed it with jeweler Cindy Boudov, an amazing woman who does everything by hand. The poor thing [Cokas]. I was all over the place. We'd be in this store, we'd be in that store, and I was, ""I want that one,"" and he'd be, ""But you just said you wanted a pear shape."" And then I'd be, ""Oh, look at this antique ring. I want it to look like that, really antique looking."" He was, ""Oh my god."" He did an amazing job. It's just beautiful, so I'm a happy girl. [McPhee's ring is a 3-carat-brilliant-cut round diamond set in platinum.] . Q: What are your honeymoon plans? We're leaving the day after the wedding for Maui. We've never been there before. I really want to ride in a helicopter and go hiking, and I want to take surf lessons. I am not much of a lay-on-the-beach kind of girl. I want to be in the ocean. E-mail to a friend .

"Washington (CNN) -- If at first you don't succeed, try to change the rules. A proposal under consideration in Virginia's Republican-led state Legislature would change how the commonwealth allocates its 13 electoral votes in the wake of Democratic President Barack Obama's re-election last November. Obama won the popular vote in the crucial battleground state to claim all 13 electoral votes, even though GOP challenger Mitt Romney beat him in seven of the 11 congressional districts. Under the proposed alternative system, electoral votes would get divvied up by congressional districts won. In addition, Virginia's two other electoral votes -- one for each U.S. Senate seat -- would go to the candidate who won the most congressional districts. If the district-based system had been in effect in Virginia last year, Romney would have gotten nine electoral votes to four for Obama. Jindal urges GOP to stop being 'stupid' While a subcommittee has advanced the Virginia proposal, skepticism expressed by some GOP state senators raised doubts that it would proceed any further. Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, does not support the plan, according to his spokesman. ""He believes Virginia's existing system works just fine as it is. He does not believe there is any need for a change,"" Tucker Martin said in statement. However, Reince Priebus, newly re-elected chairman of the Republican National Committee, called the idea worth examining. ""I think it is a state issue, but personally I'm pretty intrigued by it,"" he told reportersFriday. Opinion: Where the stupidity really lies . The state party chairman in Florida, Lenny Curry, questioned the wisdom of such a move at a time when the party is trying to broaden its support. ""It seems to me we ought to be focused on connecting with voters and bringing them into our party versus trying to change the game,"" Curry said. To Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst at RealClearPolitics, the concept doesn't violate democratic principles, but he called it a bad idea. ""Close elections would likely always result in extensive recounts, we could see huge disparities between the popular and electoral vote, and the partisan motive behind it would be transparent,"" he wrote Friday on the group's website. Currently, only Nebraska and Maine use a district-based plan for allocating electoral votes. Their systems differ from the Virginia proposal by awarding the two additional electoral votes to the winner of the popular vote, rather than who won the most districts. Last year, both split their electoral votes between Obama and Romney. Other GOP-controlled state legislatures reportedly contemplating changes to their electoral vote allocation include Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. Under the Electoral College system, each state is worth a certain number of electoral votes based on population. Winning the presidency requires a majority of the electoral vote, regardless of who wins the popular vote. States have the power to decide how their electoral votes get allocated, the National Conference of State Legislatures noted on its website. It cited a similar push for change after the 2000 election, when Democratic Vice President Al Gore won the national popular vote but lost the electoral vote, and therefore the decision, to Republican George W. Bush. From 2001 to 2006, bills proposing adoption of the district system were introduced in many states, but failed to pass, according to the NCSL website. Both Maine and Nebraska adopted their district-based systems before 2000. The issue reflects the regionalization of America's deep partisan divide, with splits in many states between populous urban areas that tend to be more liberal and larger, less populated rural areas that generally are more conservative. In Virginia, Obama got strong support in two heavily populated northern districts close to Washington as well as a district that includes much of Richmond and Norfolk. Romney won more rural districts in the central, southern and western parts of the state. Overall in Virginia, Obama got 51% of the total vote -- more than 1.97 million -- compared to Romney's 1.82 million for 47% of the total. CNN's Mark Preston and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.","NEW: A spokesman for the Virginia governor says he does not support the proposal .

"(CNN) -- The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is an enormous tragedy for the families of the victims. It is excruciating to live through the pain, helplessness, shock and anger. It is as hard to regain some degree of normalcy. I know because I've been there. In 1985, my beloved father died on the Japan Airlines Flight 123 that crashed outside of Tokyo, killing more than 500 passengers and crew. It's one the largest plane accidents in the history of aviation. Sitting on the tatami mat in the city hall in the small village close to the crash site, surrounded by hundreds of other people looking for their loved ones, I felt desperate, scared and suffocated. Contemplating another day of looking at pine wood boxes with inscriptions like, ""part of left hand, possibly male,"" I thought the agony would never end. How can I steel myself to keep on looking to try to identify some remains of what was once my dear father, hero to his family? Emotionally, physically and in every way, I felt drained of life force, like the body fragments in the boxes we were going through one by one in our search for our loved ones. All these years later the scars still sting when scratched, as they were when Flight 370 vanished. I want to share with the grieving, scared and frustrated relatives of Flight 370 victims that while life will never be the same, it will get better. It will take time, but you will laugh again and the sun will come out once more. The lack of closure is the hardest part. How do you know for sure that those on the plane are gone since their bodies have not been found? What if they are alive somewhere waiting for you to rescue them? How do you have a funeral when there are no remains? How can you be so sure? But the truth is that while you may hold out hope, the world is presuming they are gone forever. You have to accept it and move on. Here are some steps that helped me recover from my loss. Perhaps it could be of help to the families of Flight 370: . 1. Grieve. Allow the pain to be released. Cry, punch the pillows, share stories, do what you need to let the feelings out. Let the emotions flow. 2. Get support. From your family, friends and experts. From your spiritual source, in prayer or in nature. In time, maybe join a bereavement group. 3. Eat as healthy as you can. 4. Get rest, even if you can't sleep well, take some down time. 5. Move. Walk, exercise, play a sport, dance, do something physical so that the feelings can be dissipated. 6. Go into nature. Nature is big enough to hold you and your grief. Nature is healing. 7. Know that your loved one(s) are at peace and will be with you always. 8. Help someone who may be in a worse situation than you. In my case I saw that a couple of American families didn't make the trip to Japan. I sent them notes to let them know that I prayed for their loved ones, and that everyone was very kind and respectful in the whole search process. 9. Trust that something good will come out of this tragedy. We may not know what it is, or how, but it will happen. My father's death helped me learn how to be more present, to survive adversity, and appreciate the wonderful kindness of strangers. From disaster I've learned to be strong and flexible, and to seek assistance when I need it. With faith and courage I can make a positive difference in other people's lives. During the course of my life, I've been fortunate to reach many of the goals I had set. I know that my dad was there, guiding, supporting and inspiring me the entire time. He smiled with pride with each new milestone that I crossed. I believe all of us can grow and thrive through the trials of life with peace and happiness. It just takes one step at a time. The families of Flight 370 victims will come out of this tragedy different -- but they will endure and honor the memories of their loved ones. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marilyn Tam.","Families of Flight 370 victims are grieving as searchers continue to look for plane .

"(CNN) -- Filmmaker James Cameron may be about to set out on the first solo dive to the Mariana Trench, the deepest known point of the world's oceans, but sojourns to the darkest recesses of the sea are far from the sole preserve of intrepid would-be record breakers. For wealthy enthusiasts with a passion for underwater endeavors, delving into the deepest and most mysterious ocean basins is a niche but accessible form of adventure tourism. Several companies around the world offer midrange dives of between 1,500 and 3,000 feet, but only specialist tour operator Deep Ocean Expeditions takes paying customers to depths of 10,000 feet and beyond. The UK-based company has been running trips since the late 1990s that can cost between $30,000 and $350,000, depending on the location. Filmmaker James Cameron to visit deepest ocean depths . With the help of Alfred S. McLaren, a retired U.S. Navy captain, honorary director of the Explorers Club and deep ocean pilot with more than 30 years experience, CNN takes a look at the most exciting deep ocean adventures on offer to paying tourists. The Titanic . The most famous cruise liner ever built now rests 12,500 feet below the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean. Tourists have been able to visit the ship's ghostly grave on Russian Mir submersibles leased by Deep Ocean Expeditions since the early 1990's, although the trips have been intermittent and will cease after the 100th anniversary of the vessel's sinking next month. Voyages cost in the region of $30,000 when the tours began, but those partaking in the eight-hour dive have to part with a sum closer to $60,000 these days. For Titanic enthusiasts, however, witnessing the mythical vessel in its final resting place is a priceless if slightly morbid experience, says McLaren, who has piloted several expeditions. ""It is a very eerie site,"" he says. ""When you see people's personal belongings like suitcases and jewelery, it really makes you realize the sheer scale of the human tragedy."" The Bismarck . Another behemoth of the sea to meet its end in the North Atlantic was the German World War II vessel Bismarck. The battle cruiser went down during its first offensive mission at sea in 1941 -- the British Navy claimed to have sunk it, but the Germans countered that the ship was scuttled to prevent it falling into enemy hands -- and now rests 15,000 feet below the surface. Swedish treasure hunters mysterious deep sea find . Only a handful of people, including McLaren, have glimpsed Bismarck since its demise, but Deep Ocean Expeditions is planning a trip to the wreck site this year. ""My experiences of visiting Bismarck are vastly different from the Titanic,"" McLaren said. ""The ship is remarkably well preserved, and my first impressions were not of tragedy but of a menacing enemy ship."" ""It's not until you see the boots of the German sailors scattered around the place that you get a real sense of history and realize the number of men who perished,"" he added. The Mid-Atlantic Hydrothermal Vents . Situated roughly 300 miles from the Azores, Portugal, the hydrothermal vents of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are a towering chimney-like formation of rocks that bellow out a volcanic black mist at depths of nearly 10,000 feet. All manner of strange and unaccounted for life forms have evolved in this fascinating environment hidden away from human eyes for millennia, McLaren said. ""We know so little scientifically about life at these depths that some of the species that live down there are hard for us to fathom,"" he adds. Deep Ocean Expeditions offers trips to this alien landscape that, like dives to the Titanic and Bismarck, are expensive and infrequent -- although a Mir submersible voyage to the hydrothermal vents is scheduled for mid-2012. Voyage to the bottom of the sea . For those able to afford such a daring mission, a mesmerizing ecosystem where the conditions for life are like no other place on Earth awaits discovery, McLaren says. The Arctic depths and beyond . Although there are currently only a handful of sites where tourists can pay to delve into the darkest ocean abysses, McLaren believes that deep sea tourism has the potential to become a major industry in years to come. With science budgets being cut in many countries, taking wealthy tourists on voyages to the deepest recesses of the oceans could be a great way to fund important research explorations, he says. The deep basins of the Arctic Ocean, which have been cut off from the world's oceans for 2 million years, are some of the most interesting deep sea dives that have yet to be accomplished, McLaren explained. With the advances in submersible vehicle technology -- such as the advent of the Super Aviator and Orca Sub, which can reach depths of 15,000 feet and offer increased underwater maneuverability -- all that's missing is the political and financial will to fulfill such missions, McLaren says. By opening deep sea adventures up to private tourists, he adds, science and human exploration could benefit greatly.","Wealthy tourists can voyage to the bottom of the sea with specialist tourist companies .

Deep sea tourism could take off soon, says marine specialist Capt. Alfred S. McLaren ."
"London (CNN) -- Celebrity chef Nigella Lawson said she was ""ashamed"" of her drug use but preferred to be honest, as she took the stand for a second day Thursday as a witness in the fraud trial of two former personal assistants. Lawson's first day of testimony Wednesday gripped the media, as she admitted using cocaine in two periods of her life and spoke of her troubled relationship with ex-husband Charles Saatchi, a millionaire art collector. Quizzed again on the subject Thursday, she said, ""I have been frank, and the fact is I would rather be honest, if ashamed, and explain the drug use rather than be bullied with lies about something that happened in a humiliating and very public way."" In light of her tribulations, she described 2013 as ""the longest year of my life."" The former aides, Italian sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo, deny embezzling hundreds of thousands of pounds on Saatchi's company credit cards while employed by Lawson and Saatchi. Lawson was also asked again Thursday about her initial reluctance to come to court. The allegations of drug use emerged in June, around the time Lawson and Saatchi were photographed having an argument in a restaurant, Scott's. In the photos, which were splashed across the front pages of national newspapers, Saatchi is seen with his hand around Lawson's throat and appears to pinch and look up her nose. Saatchi accepted a police caution for assault, and the couple announced they would divorce soon afterward. Lawson told the court the only thing she objected to was the story ""that I was taking drugs at Scott's,"" a reference to an alleged claim by Saatchi that he was wiping cocaine from her nose at the restaurant. Asked why she hadn't sued Saatchi for libel over the claim, Lawson said that she didn't have the money and did not want to go to court because her ex-husband enjoyed litigation. ""I do not appreciate being bullied. I am not going to continue to be bullied,"" she said. Lawson said she felt it was her duty to come to court in this case. ""I felt it would be an unpleasant experience, but that's not an excuse not to do one's civic duty."" Referring to Saatchi's request for her to attend the trial, made in a letter sent by his lawyers, Lawson said Wednesday: ""He had said to me if I didn't get back to him and clear his name, he would destroy me."" No 'written-down rules' The two defendants, who worked for Lawson and Saatchi for a number of years, were supposed to use the cards for household expenses, but allegedly spent large amounts on themselves. Francesca Grillo's lawyer questioned Lawson on Thursday about exactly what her client was responsible for paying for. Lawson rejected the notion that Francesca had been given free rein to use the credit cards. ""There were not written-down rules. ... But it was known that they were not for personal use unless directed,"" Lawson said. ""I don't think any normal person would think that someone else's credit card was for their personal use."" Lawson said she disputed ""completely"" the claim that Francesca had given money to her two children and stepdaughter to pay for lunches, dinners, public transit and excursions amounting to 29,000 pounds in one year. She also hit out at Francesca's lawyer for raising personal details about her children. Francesca Grillo's lawyer listed a number of purchases of luxury goods made on the company credit card, including 7,000 pounds at Chanel in St. Tropez, which her client said had been approved by Lawson as a treat. Lawson responded, ""7000 pounds of designer wardrobe! No, I would not have said that."" Asked if she had noticed that her personal assistant wore designer clothing, Lawson said Francesca had always claimed they were knock-offs or bought from a sample sale. 'I did not have a drug problem' Lawson denied defense allegations Thursday that she kept cocaine in a jewelry box, or that rolled-up notes used for snorting drugs were left around her house. ""People who are regular cocaine users do not look like this,"" the TV star said, gesturing to her body and face. Lawson said she was a sole parent who looked after herself. ""If you think I am going to sabotage my health and risk leaving my children as orphans, you are very wrong,"" she said. Lawson told the court Wednesday that she had used cocaine about six times with her late husband, John Diamond, when he learned that his cancer was terminal, in order to give him ""some escape from his treatment."" She also used cocaine once in July 2010 when she felt subject to ""terrorism"" by her then-husband, Saatchi, she said. At that point she felt trapped, isolated and unhappy, she said, and a friend offered her the drug. Lawson also admitted using cannabis but said she has given it up. She said she took the prescription drug Xanax only as instructed by her doctor. Lawson insisted, ""I've never been a drug addict, I've never been an habitual user. ... I did not have a drug problem, I had a life problem."" Saatchi had claimed in an e-mail that Lawson had used drugs regularly, but in testimony Friday, he backed off that claim. In the e-mail, which was shared with the court by the defense in a pretrial hearing, Saatchi wrote that the assistants would probably ""get off"" because Lawson was using cocaine and marijuana on a daily basis and ""allowed the sisters to spend whatever they liked."" Lawson, whose culinary skills and flirtatious manner have long entranced UK audiences, has also appeared as a judge on ABC show ""The Taste"" in the United States. A second season of the show is due to air in January. The trial is expected to continue Friday. CNN's Claudia Rebaza contributed to this report.","NEW: ""People who are regular cocaine users do not look like this,"" Nigella Lawson says .

"(CNN) -- A Southern California firefighter ended up in handcuffs this week after he disagreed with a highway patrol officer on where to park a fire engine. The California Highway Patrol detained engineer Jacob Gregoire of the Chula Vista Fire Department for about 30 minutes after he refused to move an engine partially blocking a lane, CNN affiliate KFMB reported. It was there to help protect ambulance crews treating people injured in a rollover accident on Interstate 805. The same officer also asked firefighters with two other engines at the accident to leave the scene. They complied with the request. Fire Chief Dave Hanneman stood by the crew that remained. ""We don't know what was going through the officer's mind,"" Hanneman told CNN affiliate KSWB. ""From our perspective, our engineer was out there doing what they're trained to do and doing everything right to take care of patient care and protect that scene."" The incident prompted a meeting between CHP and Chula Vista officials Wednesday. In a joint statement released after the session, they called the officer's detention an ""unfortunate incident,"" labeling it ""an isolated incident and not representative of the manner in which our agencies normally work together toward our common goal."" The statement promised the incident will be a topic of future joint training sessions between the two agencies.","The firefighter was cuffed at the scene of a rollover accident .

"(CNN) -- Against the stunning backdrop of the French Riviera, hundreds of photographers lie in wait. As the sun shines gloriously on La Croisette Promenade, some of the film industry's most famous faces including Gael Garcia Bernal, Sofia Coppola and Zhangke Jia -- three of whom make up this year's festival jury -- are stepping out for a photocall. Screams of ""Sofia! Sofia!"" can barely be heard over the jostle of photographers wildly gesticulating towards the panel in the hopes of getting the best shots. As the 2014 Cannes Film Festival gets underway, the President of the Jury and former Palme D'or prize winner, director Jane Campion has criticized the film industry for failing to recognize the contribution of women. The prestigious event has been held annually since the 1930s and yet Campion is the only woman to have won the coveted top prize, the Palme d'Or. Speaking at a press conference for the festival jury earlier this week, Campion said: ""I think you'd have to say [there is] inherent sexism in the industry. Thierry [Fremaux, artistic director of the festival] told us only 7% of the 1800 films submitted to the Cannes Film Festival were directed by women and we have 20% [women] in all the programs. ""Nevertheless, it does feel very undemocratic. Women do notice that time and time again we don't get our share of representation. Excuse me gentlemen, but the guys do seem to eat all the cake."" Even Cannes has had its problems: No female directors made the list of Palme d'Or contenders at the festival in 2010 or 2012 and only one was nominated in 2013 -- Valeria Bruni Tedeschi for ""A Castle in Italy."" In April, Fremaux announced at a press conference that 15 women directors would have movies featuring at this year's event. Both Naomi Kawase with ""Still the Water"" and ""Le Meraviglie"" from Alice Rohrwacher are up for the top accolade. Meanwhile, the festival jury is majority-female for the first time, with five women to four men judging the competition. For the artistic director in charge of the annual event, the problem is not with Cannes specifically, but rather the entire film industry. Fremaux recently told France 24: ""We have more women in the official selection than we saw in the selection process. Cannes is much more in favor of women than cinema itself."" But Melissa Silverstein, founder and editor of the Women And Hollywood blog says that she's ""tired of having to be grateful for people doing the right thing."" ""It is the right thing for a jury to be evenly split among men and women and to include diversity at all levels. That makes for better discussions and brings other people's perspectives into the mix. So while it is great that there are equal men and women this should be the norm,"" she says. As for those up for the awards, Silverstein is also critical of the lack of progress when it comes to women behind the lens. ""This year there are 15 total women directors counted on 49 films while there are 58 male directors on those same 49 films. There have to be consistent upticks on a yearly basis for there to be improvement."" READ: 'Slumdog' star Freida Pinto: Film industry too male-dominated .

"London (CNN) -- Senior business figures and other VIP travelers face a new type of scrutiny when flying, with BA's move to search Google Images to identify high-profile frequent fliers. The measure is part of the British Airways ""Know Me"" program, which aims to provide a more personalized service to the airline's frequent fliers. In the words of BA's head of customer analysis, Jo Boswell, the airline is aiming ""to recreate the feeling of recognition you get in a favorite restaurant when you're welcomed there, but in our case it will be delivered by thousands of staff to millions of customers."" The program works by pulling together information on frequent travelers -- including seating location, previous flights and meal choices -- into a streamlined database which, along with Google Images, is accessed on iPads issued to staff on all BA flights and in the airline's lounges. The idea is that BA staff will be able to offer a more tailored service to customers. If, for example, a connecting flight has been delayed, stewards or lounge staff can use the database to see which passengers are most affected, then identify them by seat number or by Google searching their image to address them personally. The airline says it will also allow staff to provide better service by greeting travelers with an apology if there have been issues with their previous flights, for example. The new approach has concerned some privacy watchdogs, who label it an unnecessary intrusion. ""Since when has buying a flight ticket meant giving your airline permission to start hunting for information about you on the internet?"" said Emma Carr, deputy director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch. ""Fundamentally, British Airways have not asked their passengers' permission to take part in this scheme. Surely, if they want to search Google to find pictures and any other information all they have to do is ask?"" Read more: Meet Elvis -- the virtual border official who knows if you're lying . But BA spokesman Philip Allport said staff would only search for images of high profile, VIP travelers -- most of whom would appreciate the more attentive, personalized service it provided. ""Let's the say you're the chairman of HSBC and you're traveling in first class with us and we need to convey a message to you,"" he said. ""They can approach him discretely."" That approach was preferable to calling VIPs via a public announcement over the speakers in the lounge -- ""not necessarily what people want when they're high profile and they're traveling,"" he said. ""There would be no reason why we would want to search for an average passenger."" Privacy campaigners have expressed concern about the amount of information held by airlines, particularly when that data is shared with other agencies. But Allport said he was unaware of any complaints about Know Me in the 18 months since it had first been trialled. ""It collects information on passengers that we have anyway,"" he said. ""The information's already there -- this is just a way of drawing it together."" What do you think about BA searching Google for images of its passengers?","BA customer-service program involves staff searching Google for images of VIP passengers .

"(CNN) -- A Venezuelan fishing boat has rescued 11 Chinese sailors, including four suffering from severe burns, from a life raft floating in the Pacific Ocean about 1,100 km (684 miles) off the coast of Mexico. Six sailors from the Chinese vessel remain missing, and two of the rescued men subsequently died from their injuries. Airmen from an Arizona-based United States Air Force Search and Rescue team assisted in the recovery of two of the seamen, who were critically injured, a spokesperson from the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base said Sunday. The uninjured crew members, along with the bodies of the two deceased, were transferred to a Chinese-flagged vessel which was in the area and are being repatriated. The Venezuelan vessel radioed a request for assistance late Friday afternoon, and airmen from the 563rd Rescue Group, based in Tucson, Arizona, flew to the location to treat the injured crew, where emergency treatment continued into Sunday aboard the ship. The team parachuted from an Air Force aircraft after an 11-hour flight to the remote location in the Pacific, approaching the fishing boat on Zodiac inflatables. The airmen were preparing for the world's largest Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR) exercise, codenamed Angel Thunder, when the real-world distress call came through, a 12th Air Force report stated. ""We were preparing for the training exercise when we were notified of what was going on,"" 1st Lt. Ben Schmidt, 48th Rescue Squadron Combat Rescue Officer was quoted as saying. ""As a Guardian Angel, this is what we are trained and equipped to do, so there is no better way to show our capabilities."" Capt. Susan Harrington, Public Affairs Officer at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, told CNN that the military was hoping to transfer the two injured crew members back to Cabo San Lucas, the nearest landfall in Mexico, on Monday (local time).

"Washington (CNN) -- Are James V. McVay's statements the shocking confessions of a man who planned to kill the president? The exaggerated claims of someone seeking attention? The rantings of a lunatic? Police, prosecutors and others are asking those questions after McVay, 41, was charged in the vicious stabbing death of a 75-year-old woman in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Stopped by police Saturday near Madison, Wisconsin, some 450 miles away from the killing, McVay confessed not only to the stabbing, but to a crime he said he hoped to commit: the assassination of a president. In statements to police, and in an unusual jailhouse interview with reporters, McVay said: . -- He had spent two years while in prison developing a plan. -- He planned, first, to kill someone in Sioux Falls and steal that person's vehicle to drive to Madison. -- In Madison, he would break into another house to kill the occupants and steal their vehicle, or he would ambush a Madison police officer to steal that officer's gun. -- He planned to travel through Chicago, stopping again in Indianapolis to kill people and steal a vehicle to drive to Washington. ""I'm going to kill and kill until I get him,"" he told police, referring to President Obama. ""One of his favorite pastimes, golfing; I was going to get him at the golf range,"" McVay said in a remorseless interview with WKOW-TV reporter Tony Galli. He said the Sioux Falls victim, Maybelle Fetters Schein, was ""collateral damage."" It was not the first time McVay had made threats of this nature. In 2009, following an arrest involving another stolen car, McVay told police he had planned to travel to Washington where he intended to harm Vice President Joe Biden. Police notified the U.S. Secret Service, who twice questioned McVay, as well as family members and acquaintances. During the second interview, McVay recanted his statement about wanting to harm the vice president, a spokesman with the Secret Service said. Court documents provide a detailed account of McVay's alleged actions during the past week, when he again came to the attention of authorities. According to a police affidavit, police were sent to Schein's Sioux Falls home Saturday afternoon after a report of a deceased person. They found a garden tool and a cardboard box propping open the garage door, and a small figurine propping open the door between the garage and the living area. Schein was in her bedroom, dead of knife wounds to the neck. The victim's white 2007 Buick Lucerne was missing. Police soon learned the car was equipped with an OnStar device that allowed GPS tracking of the vehicle, the affidavit says. Investigators contacted OnStar, learned the car was near Madison, Wisconsin, and asked police there to stop it. The driver at first refused to stop, and police chased the car, eventually using a spike strip to bring it to a halt, police said. The driver, McVay, ""had a brief standoff with the officers before being taken into custody,"" police said. As McVay was being placed in a patrol car, he made an unsolicited comment. ""He said that he had 'killed an old lady' by stabbing her,"" and that he had stolen her car, police said. McVay waived his right to remain silent and continued talking, police said, outlining his plan to travel to Washington to kill Obama. McVay said he spent two years developing the plan, ""solidifying"" the plan about two weeks earlier when he discovered he was going to be released from South Dakota State Penitentiary to a halfway house. He said he walked away from the Sioux Falls halfway house on Friday, stole clothes and camping knives from a Walmart, and slept under a bridge for the night. On Saturday he awoke, walked into a nearby neighborhood, slipped into a partially open garage, used the knife to unlock the door to the residence, killed Schein and stole her car, according to his account in the affidavit. McVay is charged with premeditated murder, first degree murder and four burglary-related counts. He is represented by a state public defender, who could not be immediately reached Thursday. This week, when Wisconsin TV reporters interviewed McVay, he told them of the earlier interrogations by the Secret Service. ""I played the game that I didn't have any homicidal intentions and I talked to Secret Service,"" he said. But, McVay told the reporters, his feelings hardened against Biden and Obama while he was in solitary confinement. McVay cited Obama's economic policies and other moves as a basis for the assassination plot, but also said alien forces were using Obama as a ""puppet,"" WKOW reported. On Thursday, a Wisconsin judge ordered a competency evaluation of McVay. This week, Secret Service agents again interviewed McVay. But the Secret Service officials declined to say whether they believe McVay intended to attempt an assassination. And a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office said the office is reviewing the case, but no decision on federal charges has been made.","James V.

"(CNN) -- Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper on Wednesday said a report on the Keystone XL pipeline was ""pretty definitive"" in its assessment that it would not affect climate change, an issue President Barack Obama says must be part of the discussion. The comments by the two leaders came at a news conference following a summit of the leaders of North America, which brought together Harper, Obama and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Toluca, Mexico. The meeting between the two leaders came as the State Department is reviewing whether the proposed pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to refineries in Texas would be beneficial to the country. Obama said the State Department was reviewing the report and that it would be followed by a comment period. ""We'll make a decision at that point,"" he said. Harper and Obama, who have a good relationship, are deeply divided over the issue. And the division was on display at the summit as the two discussed the differences during the news conference. ""My views in favor of the project are very well-known. His views on the process are also very well-known,"" Harper said. Obama reiterated his position that any impact on climate change caused by the pipeline must be considered. ""It has to be part of the discussion,"" he said. The countering statements between Harper and Obama came the same day a Nebraska state judge voided Gov. Dave Heineman's approval of the Keystone XL pipeline route. Lancaster County Judge Stephanie Stacy on Wednesday issued a ruling saying the decision on where the oil pipeline should be located needed to be made by the state's Public Service Commission. Stacy called the current law giving the governor approval authority unconstitutional. The decision can be appealed, but it is if upheld, it would likely delay work on the proposed pipeline. A senior administration official said the decision may ultimately impact the project, but doesn't likely affect its review. CNN's Chelsea J. Carter contributed to this report.","NEW: Canada's Prime Minister says a report on the pipeline is ""pretty definitive""

"Rome (CNN) -- Yes, the Roman Catholic Church still supports the new app designed to help Catholics make confession. To a point. The Vatican qualified its support for ""Confession: A Roman Catholic App,"" on Wednesday, a day after the program's developer announced it was the first app to have official church blessing. ""It is essential to understand well the sacrament of penitence requires the personal dialogue between the penitent and the confessor and the absolution by the confessor,"" Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told reporters on Wednesday. ""This cannot in any way be replaced by a technology application."" ""One cannot talk in any way about a 'confession via iPhone,' "" Lombardi said. The app's developer, Little iApps, created Confession in consultation with two Catholic priests, one of them an official with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. And it has been given the blessing of Bishop Kevin C. Rhoades of the Diocese of Fort Wayne-South Bend, Indiana, marking the Catholic Church's first known imprimatur on a mobile app. The app's developer said Wednesday that he welcomed the Vatican's warning about Confession. ""The app we created is supposed to be used in the actual confessional,"" said Patrick Leinen, co-founder of Little iApps. ""This is an aid to confession and in no way, shape or form a replacement."" The app has three parts. The first is an examination of conscience that's designed to help Catholics prepare for confession before stepping into the confessional, ""so you don't walk in and just start making up sins off the top of your head,"" Leinen said. The second part features step-by-step instructions for what to do inside the confessional. The last part is a space to record any absolution or penance from the priest. The Vatican's Lombardi implied some support for the app on Wednesday. ""One cannot exclude that someone can - in preparation for the confession - reflect with the help of digital instrument, as in the past one did it with the help of the written word on paper,"" he said. Leinen said that he was surprised his app had provoked a Vatican response but that he was grateful for it. ""There just seems to be some confusion,"" Leinen said. ""Some people think they will be e-mailing their confession in and that's just not how it's going to be used.""","A U.S. developer launched a ""Confession"" app for the iPhone this week .

"(CNN) -- Three of the best-loved leaders in the history of the Roman Catholic church will be united this weekend when Pope Francis makes his predecessors, Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II, saints in a special ceremony in St Peter's Square. The two canonization candidates share an improbable path to sainthood: they both rose from very humble beginnings to lead the Roman Catholic church. John XXIII (1881-1963) -- known as Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli before he became Pope -- was one of 13 children born into a family of Italian peasants, farmers from a tiny village in the country's north, before being sent away to study for the priesthood at the age of 11. John Paul II (1920-2005), born Karol Jozef Wojtyla, was brought up in a grimy industrial town in Poland and raised by his soldier father after his mother died when he was just eight. He spent his formative years living under first Nazis, then Communists. For both boys, the church offered a way out -- and up. ""Roman Catholicism, unlike temporal power, has been one of the most effective social elevators on this planet,"" says church historian Alberto Melloni, ""taking people from the most humble positions and bringing them to the top."" Vatican analyst Robert Mickens says the pair's poor backgrounds gave them a ""pastoral sense"" which was key to their success in the church -- and which goes some way to explaining their huge popularity. ""They did not come from noble families either one of them, [but from] working class families and I think they also were two people who had a real sense of humanity."" The pair also turned out to be leaders with unforeseen qualities. John XXIII, already 76 when he was elected pope after a long career as a priest, professor and Vatican diplomat, had been expected to serve merely as a ""papa di passaggio,"" or interim, caretaker Pope. But instead, 100 days into his reign he took the surprising -- and courageous -- decision to try to shake up the church, calling for the Second Vatican Council (better known as Vatican II), which he hoped would modernize Roman Catholicism, bring unity and improve its relations with other faiths. John Paul II, once an actor, had a presence before the cameras that enthralled millions of Catholics young and old as he evangelized to the far ends of the earth. It's not what he might have expected, growing up under not one but two dictatorial regimes. Both men were much loved by the Catholic faithful -- in their final days, masses were held for them around the globe, while thousands of people crowded into St Peter's Square to offer prayers. When John XXIII's death was announced, the crowds wept for ""Il Papa Buono"" (""The Good Pope""); more than 40 years later, when John Paul II died, thousands cried ""santo subito!"" (""Make him a Saint now!""). It didn't happen right away, but John Paul II's canonization did come sooner than tradition would usually dictate. For John XXIII also, the rules have been changed; he is credited with just one miracle, rather than the two which would usually be required for him to ""qualify"" as a saint. The pair's double canonization is unprecedented: it will be the first time two Popes have been made saints on the same day. Experts say that in recognizing the two men together, Francis may be looking to heal a long-term rift in the church, dating back to Vatican II, that ground-breaking conference of church leaders set up by John XXIII. Karol Wojtyla -- who was to become John Paul II, but back then was simply a young bishop -- was at those meetings. He argued against John XXIII's planned ""aggiornamento"" (""updating"") and was in favor of keeping with tradition. The modernizing Pope -- already gravely ill when the meetings began -- died before the event could reach the conclusion he had hoped for. The splits have remained ever since. Cardinal Paul Poupard, former president of the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue, who knew both men, says Pope Francis is hoping to repair that rift by canonizing the two men who have come to represent the two opposing views. ""The pope is going to bring together in one ceremony the father of the council and [the one] who put it into action,"" he explains. For Cardinal Walter Kasper, former president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the double canonization is a sign of the church's future direction. ""It's official recognition that these were good popes and we will follow their steps now,"" he says.","Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II to be made saints in special ceremony .

"(CNN) -- A federal court has ruled in favor of Texas, which wants to ban state funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates participating in a health program for low-income women because the family planning network performs abortions. The ruling vacated a lower court's preliminary injunction and opened the way for Texas to sever money to clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider, which has come under recent attack from anti-abortion politicians. Texas Gov. Rick Perry praised the decision issued late Tuesday by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. ""Today's ruling affirms that Texas' Women's Health Program has no obligation to fund organizations that promote abortion -- including Planned Parenthood,"" Perry said. ""The 5th Circuit's decision is a win for Texas women, our rule of law and our state's priority to protect life."" Who calls the shots on abortion laws? The Texas Women's Health Program provides about 130,000 low-income women with family planning exams, related health screenings and contraception. Texas opposed government funding for Planned Parenthood clinics because the organization provides abortions and has been in a long-running battle with the federal government. The state said in March that it was willing to give up funding from Washington and run the Women's Health Program itself. It then adopted a rule that required clinics funded by the program to certify they do not perform abortions or are not affiliates of entities that perform abortions. In a letter to Texas officials in March, Medicaid Director Cindy Mann said the state's decision was regrettable. It would, she said, ""prevent women enrolled in the program from receiving services from the trusted health care providers they have chosen and relied on for their care."" Planned Parenthood sued Texas, winning an injunction against the law by arguing that abortion is constitutional and Texas' efforts would block women's access to preventive health care. President Barack Obama denounced the state's efforts during a July campaign stop in Austin. ""We're not ending funding for Planned Parenthood,"" he said. ""I think women should have control of their own health care choices, just like men. We're not going backwards."" Perry lashed out at Obama on Tuesday. ""Texas will continue providing important health services for women through this program in spite of the Obama administration's disregard for our state law and unilateral decision to defund this program,"" he said. Planned Parenthood has 77 independent local affiliates that operate nearly 800 health centers throughout the United States. In Texas, Planned Parenthood has been the Women's Health Program's largest provider, serving about 40% of patients. Mississippi's end run around abortion . The program does not pay for abortions, and participating Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas do not perform the procedure. But Texas lawmakers object to Planned Parenthood because the organization is the nation's leading provider of abortions and is a vocal advocate for abortion rights, Gov. Rick Perry and Republicans in the Legislature have worked to cut off its state money. Planned Parenthood says 3% of all its health services are abortion services. But under the Texas program, neither the agency nor its affiliates perform the procedure. The court's decision Tuesday serves as a setback for Planned Parenthood and abortion providers, under attack from conservatives across the nation who say government dollars should never support abortions. In 2011, 21 states passed laws that restricted a woman's access to an abortion, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Nine states have imposed restrictions on family planning funding, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an advocacy group for abortion rights which has argued a trend of anti-abortion hostility is running through state legislatures. Last year, Texas enacted a law that tried to require a woman seeking an abortion to hear the description of an ultrasound of the fetus, even if she objects. The law has been challenged in court. Texas also slashed funding for family planning clinics. Perry praised Tuesday's court ruling as ""a win for Texas women, our rule of law and our state's priority to protect life.""

"(CNN) -- A U.S. Navy submarine and a Navy amphibious ship that collided Friday in the Strait of Hormuz south of Iran have arrived in Bahrain to be assessed for damage, the Navy said. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans are shown in Navy photos. The submarine USS Hartford and amphibious ship USS New Orleans arrived Saturday in Mina Salman pier to ""to further assess and evaluate the damage that resulted from their collision at sea,"" the service said in a written statement. Fifteen sailors were slightly hurt aboard the Hartford in the collision, which occurred early Friday morning. On Friday, Navy officials in Washington told CNN that there was significant damage to the sail, or tower-like structure on the topside of the submarine. On Saturday, the Navy said there was no damage to the submarine's propulsion unit. No injuries were reported aboard the New Orleans. The ship's fuel tank ruptured, spilling 25,000 gallons of marine diesel fuel in the Strait of Hormuz, the U.S. Navy said in the Saturday statement. ""Aerial searches of the area where the fuel spill occurred were conducted yesterday, and revealed no indication of any remaining fuel on the ocean's surface,"" the Navy said. ""The quick dissipation of the fuel is likely due to the type of fuel, and various environmental factors to include air and water temperatures, winds and seas."" When the collision occurred, both vessels were headed to ports in the Persian Gulf to stock up on provisions and allow for some recreation, Navy spokesman Lt. Nate Christensen said Friday. Christensen said there were about 200 sailors in the sub and 1,000 sailors and Marines aboard the ship. The Strait of Hormuz is located between the United Arab Emirates and Iran, linking the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. It is heavily used by oil tankers.

"(CNN) -- So it comes down to Kentucky and Connecticut.

Kentucky will face Connecticut in Monday's title game, after the Huskies came back to oust top-seeded Florida 63-53 earlier Saturday. Neither team was expected to make it this far. Kentucky was a No. 8 seed in its region, while Connecticut was No. 7. Kentucky coach John Calipari said Wisconsin could have easily come out on top before the late toss by Harrison, who has hit two other key long baskets in the tournament.

"Editor's note: The FBI has one more opening on its list of the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives. Tune into CNN's ""Campbell Brown"" at 8 p.m. ET Wednesday to find out who fills the final slot. Alleged cartel hit man Eduardo Ravelo has been added to the FBI's most wanted list. EL PASO, Texas (CNN) -- Eduardo Ravelo is described as a ""ruthless killer"" who has gone to great lengths to avoid law enforcement while contributing to the bloodshed that terrorizes the border between Texas and Mexico. Authorities say the suspected hit man with close ties to the Juarez drug cartel has shaved his head, undergone plastic surgery and even manipulated his fingerprints to elude capture. He heads the Barrio Aztecas gang, but Ravelo isn't flashy, FBI agents say. He keeps a low profile, living modestly. On Tuesday, Ravelo was named to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, taking the second of three vacant slots.  Watch the FBI discuss Ravelo's alleged crimes » . Officially, he's wanted on federal racketeering charges, but the FBI says Ravelo's criminal activities run much deeper. He is believed to be responsible for dozens of murders and assaults, as well as drug trafficking, extortion, weapons offenses and money laundering, FBI Agent Samantha Mikeska said.  Watch the latest on Ravelo » . ""He has no respect for human life,"" she said. Mikeska is leading the hunt for Ravelo, who goes by the nickname ""Tablas,"" which is Spanish for wooden plank.  He's also called ""Two-by-four"" and is believed to be  hiding with his wife and children, probably in a Barrio Aztecas-controlled neighborhood in Juarez, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. ""Eduardo Ravelo rose to power within the Barrio Aztecas criminal enterprise because of his connections with the Juarez cartel and also [because] he's a ruthless killer and will basically carry out what the Juarez cartel wants him to do,"" Mikeska said. Barrio Aztecas started as a Texas prison gang in the 1980s. Federal authorities say the profits from drug sales are often transferred to the commissary accounts of gang members in prison. Ravelo came to his position atop the gang violently, the FBI agent said, killing the person whose place he took. His power comes from his close ties to the Juarez cartel. He has spent the past 15 years cultivating relationships with some of the highest-ranking cartel members. Drug cartel leaders often align themselves with street gangs, employing gang members to carry out some of the cartel's most vicious work. U.S. authorities say the commanders of the Juarez cartel often call on Ravelo to execute their enemies. In exchange, Ravelo and his Barrio Aztecas comrades get drugs to sell on the streets of Mexico and the United States. FBI investigators say they believe that in March 2008, Ravelo carried out a hit on a captain in his own gang. Mikeska believes Ravelo stabbed him several times and shot him in the neck. Shortly after the murder, he became a Barrio Aztecas ""capo,"" or captain. In recent years, federal agents have arrested dozens of Barrio Aztecas' 3,500 members, with six of its leaders sentenced to life in prison. But Ravelo has eluded authorities. He holds both U.S. and Mexican citizenship, federal authorities say, helping him escape across the border into Mexico with his wife and children. While he may be staying out of sight, he's keeping up his violent work, Mikeska says, and he has the resources to do so. ""He has an entourage, he has bodyguards, he has armored vehicles to protect him from rival gangs and rival cartels,"" Mikeska says.","Eduardo Ravelo added to FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list .

"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is on the hunt for a new location to hold its final public hearing on a planned study of hydraulic fracturing, the controversial process used to extract natural gas from underground, agency officials say. ""We wanted a central location and wanted to keep it in the area where the drilling has been proposed. We're leaving no stone unturned,"" said agency spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara. ""We are pushing to make an announcement as swiftly as possible."" In July, public hearings were held in Fort Worth, Texas; Denver, Colorado; and Canonsburg, Pennsylvania, to help determine how the EPA will conduct the study. A final public hearing was slated for Thursday at Binghamton, New York, but on Monday it was rescheduled for Saturday in Syracuse, New York, and on Tuesday it was postponed indefinitely, agency officials said. About 1,800 people had registered to speak for two minutes each, Alcantara said. Both of the proposed venues, Binghamton University and Syracuse's Oncenter Complex, expressed concern about hosting an event estimated to attract 8,000 people. ""The last-minute change to Syracuse was caused by Binghamton University taking several actions to dissuade the EPA from holding the meetings at its campus, including increasing the cost from $6,000 to almost $40,000,"" the EPA said in a statement Tuesday. The university issued a statement putting the cost at $32,000, which it said included ""all of the estimated operational costs that the university believed it would incur in order to ensure that activities associated with these meetings would be carried out in a safe and orderly manner."" The EPA now is planning to hold the meeting in September at a location in upstate New York that will be announced as soon as it is confirmed, Alcantara said. The meeting is open to industry stakeholders and the general public. Victoria Switzer, who registered to speak at Thursday's hearing, is among 15 residents of the northeastern Pennsylvania township of Dimock who filed suit in November 2009 against Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., alleging it contaminated their well water. Cabot solicited Switzer for a gas lease in 2006, according to court records. Changing the location and then postponing the meeting was upsetting but did not come as a total surprise, Switzer said. ""I had a feeling it was going to be big, but it's absurd,"" she said. ""Who's leading this pack?"" asked Switzer, a former schoolteacher. ""I am against drilling as it's going now. They need to step back, call a moratorium and do some serious geological studying."" Julie Sautner of Dimock planned to attend the EPA meeting with her husband, Craig, a cable splicer, and 17-year-old daughter Kelly. They also are a part of the lawsuit. ""We might seem small, but we're here, too, and we're fighting the industry not to pollute, and were fighting for the future generations,"" said Sautner, who added she has been unable to use her well water for nearly two years. ""We're not mad at anybody but we're stuck here."" The EPA announced in March that it would study the potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water, human health and the environment, agency officials said. ""People have raised important concerns that require our attention,"" said Jeanne Briskin, EPA liaison on hydraulic fracturing from the agency's the Office of Research and Development. ""I've worked for EPA for a long time, I was here in the early '80s, this is a case that is unusual."" Hydraulic fracturing is used by gas producers to stimulate wells and recover natural gas from sources including coalbeds and shale gas formations, said Briskin. The process requires the injection of fluids -- generally water and chemical additives. ""We need to have a baseline to get an idea of what the effects of that are, and if you're doing monitoring you have to know what to look for,"" she said. ""At the federal level there is no requirement that companies have to tell us what they use and what concentrations."" The EPA plans to complete the study design by September 2010, begin the study in January 2011 and release initial results by late 2012, she said. ""This is an expedited process; it usually takes longer,"" Briskin said of the timeline. ""As we get results, we're going to be reporting them.""","The large number of people expected to attend has caused two venues to increase fees .

"(CNN) -- He dreamed of being a tennis star, but it was not to be. Instead, Olof Mellberg had to settle for captaining his country on arguably the biggest sporting stage -- and attracting a cult following due to his distinctive facial hair. Playing at the World Cup is the fantasy of millions of football fans across the globe, and the hirsute Mellberg did it twice for Sweden. Not bad for someone who didn't get serious about football until he was 15. ""I wouldn't say it was my dream to play at the World Cup,"" the 36-year-old tells CNN's Human to Hero series. ""I never really thought about it. I never thought about becoming a professional football player."" Mellberg spent his his formative years honing his skills on the tennis court, but he didn't get the chance to emulate the exploits of all-conquering compatriot Bjorn Borg, who retired prematurely with 11 grand slam titles to his name before Olof reached the age of five. Instead, by his mid-teens, he was looking for a new sporting love -- which he found kicking a ball around with his friends in his hometown of Gullspang, about 300 kilometers west of Sweden's capital city Stockholm. ""Both my parents are teachers in physical education so I've grown up with all kinds of sports,"" he explains. ""For a couple of years there, I only played tennis. I actually didn't start playing football properly until I was about 14, 15. ""I just enjoy the physical side of it and I think it suits me, my physique, and also the mental aspect. ""I feel it's a privilege to be able to play a game on this level every week. It's difficult to get everything out of your body in a normal life so I like that -- to be able to just release everything once a week."" A rock-solid center-back who has played in most of the top European leagues, his first World Cup outing was in 2002 and then he captained Sweden in Germany four years later. ""Being captain for Sweden was special as well -- gives you that extra responsibility towards the team and the country,"" he recalls. ""I will probably say the best memory was when we beat Paraguay in Germany. It felt like playing at home. I think there were 40,000 Swedish fans at the big stadium in Berlin. ""The whole buildup to that game, when we were on the bus on our way to the stadium, we saw all these fans walking from the city to the stadium and also the support we had there when we won the game."" The Swedes finished second in their group -- which contained Paraguay, England and Trinidad and Tobago -- but lost 2-0 in the second round against host Germany in Berlin. Four years earlier Mellberg was part of the Sweden team which also reached the second round of the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan, this time beaten by Senegal in a match decided by a ""golden goal"" in extra time. Earlier in the tournament, Sweden recorded an impressive 1-1 draw with football powerhouse Argentina. ""It was fantastic,"" says Mellberg. ""It's probably my best experience as a tournament in 2002, mainly because we did really well and I think that year we could've gone all the way. ""I thought we improved game by game and we were really unlucky to get beaten by Senegal, but the whole experience ... it was only my second (international) tournament at the time so it was nice."" Focusing on football . After giving up tennis, Mellberg's footballing progress was swift. His talents were spotted by Degerfors IF, a club then playing in the Allsvenskan -- Sweden's top division -- where he came under the guidance of Tord Grip, a coach who is best known for being the assistant to former England and Lazio manager Sven Goran Eriksson. His performances during two seasons with Degerfors earned Mellberg a move to Stockholm's AIK, where he won the first silverware of his career as the club clinched the 1998 league title by two points. Mellberg left Sweden in 1998, swapping Stockholm for the idyllic Spanish port of Santander. He signed a three-year contract with Racing, hoping to help the club succeed in the Primera Division. ""They wanted me to adapt to Spain and learn the language before giving me the opportunity,"" Mellberg says of his first months after the move. Once he was given his chance though, Mellberg shined. His performances saw him linked with a number of more prestigious Spanish clubs -- including Barcelona -- but instead he headed for England. Premier League adventure . He was signed by Aston Villa manager John Gregory in 2001 as a replacement for Gareth Southgate, the England defender who had left the Birmingham club to join Middlesbrough. Mellberg became a firm favorite at Villa Park, endearing himself to the fans, who would routinely chant, ""There's only one Mellberg."" ""That's obviously where I spent the major part of my career. I spent seven years there and had a fantastic time,"" he says. ""We changed manager a lot of times, we changed the squad around, and we changed the training ground. Every season was different so I learned a lot during my time there."" Eventually he chose to move on, announcing in January 2008 that he had agreed to join top Italian club Juventus the following season. But before he left Villa, Mellberg had a gift for the fans who had taken him to their hearts. He paid Â£40,000 ($67,000) of his own money to give every Villa fan who attended the team's final game of the 2007-08 season a replica shirt with the message ""Thanks 4 your support"" on the back. Four was Mellberg's shirt number. Time in Turin . The switch to Juventus allowed Mellberg to play in the Champions League, the pinnacle of European club football. ""I was only there for one year but it was a fantastic experience,"" he says. ""I had a great time there and that was the first year I got to play in the Champions League and that was a great experience."" Playing for one of Italy's leading clubs also exposed Mellberg to new levels of pressure and expectation. ""You learn there's no hiding. Whenever you play, wherever you play, there's pressure -- from yourself obviously but also from the club and a lot of fans. I enjoyed that, I liked that and I learned you need to give 100% wherever you are, whenever you play."" Upon leaving Turin in 2009, Mellberg embarked on a three-year stint with Olympiakos in Greece before spending a year back in Spain with Villarreal. He signed for Denmark's FC Copenhagen in 2013, returning to Scandinavia after 15 years spent traveling the continent. ""I'm almost back home in Sweden after 15-20 years abroad and I feel everything is very similar to how it was when I left Sweden a long time ago,"" he says. ""Football both on and off the pitch, I would say, the way things work around football and also the way things work in and around the club -- even though many years has passed. ""I feel it's more similar to when I played back home in AIK or Degerfors, more similar to that than life in the Premiership or La Liga or Italy or Greece."" End of an era . Mellberg retired from international football following the 2012 European Championships, the fourth time he had played at the continent's showpiece event. He scored twice against England but could not prevent a 3-2 defeat which cost Sweden a place in the quarterfinals. His country did not qualify for this year's World Cup in Brazil, where the focus will be on the host nation -- which beat Sweden in the 1958 final in the first of its record five triumphs. ""I think that the World Cup this year will be between a few teams -- Spain, Germany, Brazil and Argentina,"" Mellberg predicts. ""Obviously a lot of attention will be on Brazilian players."" Mellberg's time in the spotlight is now fading, after a 17-year professional career that has brought him financial security and a host of cherished experiences. With only one year remaining on his Copenhagen contract, he's determined to enjoy playing the game while he still can. ""When I was younger, there were a lot of things on my mind,"" he reflects. ""You think about the future, about playing for your country in the future, you think about going to bigger teams, bigger leagues, making more money. ""I think all of that, I've left behind me and just focus on the football and enjoying the football."" One thing he hasn't left behind is the iconic beard that makes him stand out on the football field -- it even has a Twitter page dedicated to it. ""At one point, I started growing a beard and I left it like that. Maybe part laziness and I realized I kind of liked it, so I've had it more or less almost throughout my whole career,"" Mellberg says. ""Now, it's probably a little bit less -- but it will grow bigger soon!""","Olof Mellberg played for Sweden at two World Cups and four European Championships .

"CNN -- Basketball star Kobe Bryant has revealed his love of soccer while doing charity work in South Africa during the 2010 World Cup. The five-time NBA champion told CNN that he was introduced to the sport while living in Italy as a child. Bryant, who helped the Los Angeles Lakers retain their NBA crown this month, moved to Europe when he was six after his father Joe ""Jelly Bean"" Bryant decided to play professional basketball in Italy. The Philadelphia-born Bryant, who speaks fluent Italian and Spanish, grew up supporting Serie A giants AC Milan, with his favorite player being former Dutch striker Marco van Basten. ""AC Milan was always my favorite team growing up,"" he said. ""It actually started in Italy when I used to go to the basketball courts to play by myself and you used to have the little goalposts underneath the basket. ""I'd show up wanting to play basketball and there would be 12 kids waiting to have a match. ""They just put me in goal because I had these long arms and long legs, and I just had to stop everything that came my way. ""Then as months went on, they finally let me out on the field a little bit."" With the World Cup well under way in South Africa, Bryant took time out to visit a new football center in Soweto during his first visit to the continent. The center provides a football life skills program to 20,000 children in South Africa each year, offering them the chance to develop their talent. South Africa has the world's largest HIV-positive population and so, more importantly, the program will also give the children access to a HIV/AIDS education which involves counseling and testing. Speaking to CNN's Pedro Pinto, the NBA star said that sportsmen have an important role off the field in helping to inspire future champions around the world. ""It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to come and see the World Cup and to come and see South Africa,"" he said. ""Even though I'm a basketball player, the messages remain the same because I was a kid just like they were -- it's all about accomplishing the dream. ""I think it's only right and it's important that once you've reached a certain level you give back and you help the next generation of players and kids accomplish their goals too."" Bryant continues to prosper on the basketball court after his Lakers team won a 17th title this year, defeating the Boston Celtics 4-3 in the finals. When asked to compare the Lakers' most recent title with his previous four, Bryant said this year's triumph was his favorite. ""It's the top, because it was so hard to get,"" he said. ""We really had to work extremely hard. The championship is about how guys come together as a group to accomplish a goal.""","Basketball star Kobe Bryant grew up in Italy supporting Serie A giants AC Milan .

"Simferopol, Ukraine (CNN) -- The standoff in Ukraine's Crimea region is a strange one, where soldiers appear to be standing around amid an air of calm. They wear no military insignia, but there's little doubt about who they are. Russian forces ""have complete operational control of the Crimean peninsula,"" a senior U.S. administration official told CNN, with estimates of 6,000 Russian ground and naval forces in the region. A law is being considered in the Russian parliament that would allow Crimea to be annexed, according to the parliament's website. Armed men are blocking 10 Ukrainian military and naval bases in Crimea, the newly appointed naval commander of Ukraine, Rear Adm. Serhei Gayduk, told a Ukrainian TV station. Many ethnic Russians live in Crimea, where support for Russia is strong. Part of Russia's navy -- the Russian Black Sea Fleet -- has a base in Crimea's city of Sevastopol that has been there for 230 years. In Crimea's capital, Simferopol, soldiers were circling government buildings and patrolling some streets, but their presence did not feel invasive, CNN correspondent Diana Magnay reported Monday. It appears that there is a ""war of information"" in the region ""between those who watch Russian state TV and those who are getting their news from the West, none of them listening to the calls from Kiev for unity in this country,"" Magnay reported. It has been, Magnay says, ""a very low-key kind of invasion."" Crimea's First Vice-Premier Rustam Temirgaliyev also described the situation as quiet, Russian state news agency ITAR Tass reported on Monday. ""Despite hysteria in Ukraine's central media, the situation on the peninsula remains absolutely calm. No conflicts have flared up in Crimea over the past 24 hours. Crimea has preserved its inter-ethnic peace,"" Temirgaliyev said, according to ITAR Tass. The calmness contrasts with reports that Russia has issued an ultimatum to Ukrainian forces in Crimea to clear out by 5 a.m. Tuesday or face a ""military storm,"" according to a report from Russian state-run news agency Interfax, citing a Ukrainian Defense Ministry source. Additionally, Ukrainian Defense Ministry spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov told CNN that Russia's Black Sea fleet commander went aboard a blocked Ukrainian warship in Sevastopol harbor on Monday and issued an ultimatum: Swear allegiance to the new Crimean authorities, surrender, or face an attack. The Russian commander, Aleksandr Vitko, did not mention a deadline, Seleznyov said. But Russia denies plans to storm the Ukrainian military units in Crimea, Interfax said, citing an unidentified spokesman for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Interfax said the spokesman called these reports ""utter rubbish."" ""We have gotten used to hearing claims that we are conducting military operations against our Ukrainian colleagues,"" said the spokesman, adding, ""Attempts to set us against each other will fail."" Meanwhile, Seleznyov told CNN that up to 12 trucks full of Russian troops have crossed into the eastern Crimean city of Kerch from Russia. Additionally, Ukrainian Border Service Assistant Chief Col. Sergei Astakhov described Russian troop movements by ferry from Russia across the Strait of Kerch in a phone conversation. Astakhov said the first two ferries carrying armed men were navigating toward the ferry dock and border post in Kerch. As the ferries approached the port, 10 heavily armed troops from the Russian Black Sea Fleet attacked the border post from land and used force to overwhelm the Ukrainian border guards, Astakhov said. The account of the attack contradicts the calm scene that CNN correspondents had observed in Kerch earlier Monday. Close to 100 men in green uniforms, carrying weapons such as AK-47s, lingered outside the main entrance to the ferry port Monday. Soldiers around there were not masked -- they were relaxing, eating and drinking tea, CNN's Ben Wedeman reported. Half the soldiers were sitting around and waiting, with some standing and others spaced out every 100 meters. They appeared not to be on high alert. One Ukrainian soldier with an insignia remained by the entrance where cars enter the ferry port. Three six-wheeled military trucks, used for transporting troops, have black license plates indicative of Russian forces based in Crimea, per the agreement between Ukraine and Russia. An officer who wished to be identified only as Alexander, wearing a hat with the Russian Black Sea Fleet insignia, told CNN he and others from the Sevastopol naval base had been deployed outside the ferry port since Saturday. If they weren't there, he said, ""there would be a civil war in Ukraine."" Alexander said the troops are there to protect their Ukrainian brothers from those who seized power locally in Kiev. Ukrainians gave them places to stay and shower, and locals have brought them food, he said. The troops will stay in Kerch until Crimea decides what it wants to do, Alexander said. Crimea is the last major stronghold of opposition to the new political leadership in Ukraine. The country's President, Viktor Yanukovych, was ousted February 22 after months of anti-government protests reached a bloody climax. Street clashes between demonstrators and security forces left more than 80 dead. CNN's Clare Sebastian, Elwyn Lopez, Marie-Louise Gumuchian, Susanna Capelouto, Dana Ford and journalist Emir Shevkiev contributed to this report.","NEW: Crimea's first vice-premier says situation is quiet .

"(CNN) -- First, Michelle Knight heard pounding on the door. Then, there was silence. A year later, she still remembers the dread she felt that day. Rescuers were banging on the door after learning Knight and fellow captive Georgina ""Gina"" DeJesus were trapped inside. But Knight and DeJesus didn't know the police were coming. ""For me it was the most awesome day ever. But it was also terrifying at the same time, because me and Gina actually thought someone was breaking in,"" Knight told CNN's Anderson Cooper in an interview that aired Wednesday. ""We laugh about it now."" But at the time, it was anything but funny. The two women huddled in their boarded-up bedroom, afraid burglars were coming for them, Knight said. That terror turned to relief, Knight said, when she caught a glimpse of a police badge and heard a police radio. It wasn't long before she jumped into the police officer's arms. ""I ran right into her arms,"" Knight recalled, ""and I literally choked her. ... (and) I said, 'Please don't let me go. Please don't put me down.'"" At 32 years old, Knight walked out the front door of 2207 Seymour Avenue for the very first and last time. Knight recalls being Castro's 'punching bag' Confrontation in court . For 11 years, Knight was brutally raped and tortured in Ariel Castro's ""house of horrors."" Rescuers freed her, along with fellow captives DeJesus and Amanda Berry, a year ago from the Cleveland home, drawing national attention to the horrific case. Knight was rushed to a hospital, where she was treated for a long list of health issues due to the years of beatings and neglect. Although she was free, she was also alone. With no family to speak of, friends or home to go to, she took refuge at an assisted living facility outside Cleveland, where she prepared to face her captor in court. ""After 11 years, I am finally being heard, and it's liberating,"" she said in a powerful statement at Castro's sentencing describing the abuse she endured. ""You took 11 years of my life away, and I have got it back. I spent 11 years in hell, and now your hell is just beginning,"" she told Castro. Knight told CNN she was determined to speak out. ""It was important to me to express how I felt about what he did and how he did it and let the judge know that he needed to be punished,"" she said. How Castro lured her to the house . Hope for the future . One year later, Knight is in a very different place. While Berry and DeJesus have largely stayed out of the public eye, Knight has done the opposite -- appearing at public events and writing a book, ""Finding Me,"" in hopes that her experiences will help people know they can survive anything. Castro, the daily devil in these three women's lives for so long, is now out of the picture. He killed himself in prison last September, just a month into serving his prison sentence of life plus 1,000 years. ""I understand why he did it,"" Knight said. ""He couldn't face what he did with his head held high. He had to face it like a coward, 'cause he was ashamed and embarrassed of what he done. And he didn't want what he did to us to happen to him."" Now, armed with friends and a good support system, Knight said she's giving a voice to other people who are missing, like she once was. ""I was considered a forgotten one,"" she said. ""That's a reason why I made a poem and said that all the people that are out there, they're not forgotten in my eyes. Never."" And she's focused on starting over. The past year, she said, has been ""overwhelming but amazing as hell."" She has changed her name to Lily, after her favorite flower. She's back in school with the hope of opening her own restaurant. And she's planning to get a new tattoo with a message of survival: ""God gave us this chosen life because He knew we could handle it."" After what she's been through, Knight said there's nothing she can't handle. Berry's baby delivered by another captive . Michelle Knight recounts her experience to Dr. Phil .

"(CNN) -- Funny things flags. Essentially they're just pieces of colored cloth, but run any of them up a pole and they become powerful talismans capable of making people behave in peculiar ways. The stories behind national pennants can be inspiring, intriguing and often give an insight into the culture and history of the country. We're all about raising standards and we think some of the tales behind these patriotic pennants are worth saluting. What flags do you love and why? Leave a comment. Canada . Say what you like about over-polite Canadians, at least they've managed to ditch the Union flag of their former British overlords. Canadian leaders debated furiously before finally adopting the resplendent red maple leaf in 1965, an ensign pointedly free of colonial images. Good thing they did, because it gives Americans and Brits a useful flag to slap on their backpacks to stop people hating them. One original proposal, rejected by parliament, featured blue stripes and a maple trefoil that almost completely failed to resemble a cannabis leaf. What to say: ""The Canadian flag has saved my bacon a few times."" Flag it up: Brockville is birthplace of the flag. Main attraction? Possibly the U.S. border 15 miles away. Nepal . Square flags are for squares. As the only country with an ensign that doesn't have four 90-degree corners, Nepal is in a league of its own. Its double triangle design symbolizes the mighty peaks of the Himalayas where foreign mountaineers have planted so many other national flags. The sun and moon symbols represent calmness and resolve -- character traits needed to tolerate the Everest-sized egos of those flag-planting foreign mountaineers. What to say: ""Nepal's 1962 design marked a new a pinnacle for world flags."" Flag it up: You can plan a flag-planting exercise of your own via Nepal's trekking agencies. Greece . Few flags evoke the nation they represent as well as Greece's. The blue stripes conjure the cobalt summer skies and azure seas that annually lure millions of vacationers; the white recalls spotless coastal buildings dotting its beautiful coastline. The nine stripes are said to represent ancient muses or possibly the number of syllables in the battle cry ""eleftheria i thanatos,"" meaning ""freedom or death,"" used in wars against the Ottomans. What to say: ""Tentative signs of a recent economic recovery are a good excuse to wave the flag."" Flag it up: On the gorgeous Cyclades islands the buildings wear the national colors with pride. Bhutan . At first glance, Bhutan's flag appears to bear the image of a dragon on wheels. The reality isn't much less exciting. The beast in question is Druk, a thunder dragon of Bhutanese Buddhist mythology. Rather than riding on castors, he is in fact clutching a spherical jewel in each claw. As flag stories go, this one isn't bad either. The dragon is said to symbolize the origins of religious teachings on which Bhutan was founded. Drukpa Buddhism was so named by its 12th-century founder, Tsangpa Gyare Yeshey Dorji, because he heard the thunderous sounds of dragons while hunting for a monastery site in Tibet. What to say: ""Vacations are never a drag-on this side of the Himalayas."" Flag it up: It'll cost you a dragon's hoard of silver to travel there, but this isolated kingdom is worth it. United States . Poor Old Glory. Those starry spangles and candy stripes have become a teensy bit overexposed thanks to recent American ventures in overseas troublespots. This is a shame as the modern incarnation of Betsy Ross's purported creation is an oft-imitated design of which Americans are rightly proud. So proud in fact, it's one of the only flags to have a National Anthem (""The Star-spangled Banner"") written specifically about it. What to say: Oh long may it wave. Flag it up: Don't get into a flap about whether she designed it or not, just visit Betsy Ross's home in Philadelphia. Brazil . Given Brazil's skills on the pitch, you'd be forgiven for thinking its flag symbolizes a blue soccer ball being booted into space from a grassy stadium. It doesn't. Less excitingly, the green harks back to Portuguese colonial-era royalty, while the slice of night sky represents, even more prosaically, federal regions. It's still a much-loved design, even among non-Brazilians. What to say: ""Brazil's success in securing the upcoming soccer World Cup and Olympics justify the flag's 'ordem e progresso' (order and progress) slogan."" Flag it up: You can take your own flag to Brazil for next year's soccer World Cup Finals. Indonesia . The simplicity of the Indonesian flag belies an interesting tale (if true). The story goes that as they were shaking off the shackles of Dutch colonial invaders, Indonesian freedom fighters created their flag by tearing the blue strip off a Dutch tricolor. Another version claims the flag's colors are derived from those representing the archipelago's 14th century Majapahit Empire. Either way, it excuses the fact it resembles an upside-down Polish flag. What to say: ""Indonesians know how to tear a strip off oppressors."" Flag it up: Surabaya's luxury Hotel Majapahit is supposedly the scene of the flag-tearing incident. Mozambique . Mozambique's flag features a gun! Yes, there's a book, symbolizing education, and, yes, there's a hoe symbolizing agriculture. But there's also an AK-47 assault rifle symbolizing the country's bloody struggle for independence. The only national flag bearing a firearm, it's the subject of intense debate in the now largely peaceful country. Many there feel it's time to ditch the weapon. What to say: ""The economy is booming, not the guns."" Flag it up: Mozambique's flag carrying LAM Airlines is banned in the EU. Panama . Given that it's so widely displayed on ships using the country's emblem as a flag of convenience, it's fascinating to see what they almost used. This rather alarming alternative version, designed by Frenchman Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla, is meant to resemble the country's famous canal. Thankfully, then-president Manuel Amador Guerrero rejected it and hired his son to produce the current ensign, adopted in 1925. The colors represent the country's main political parties. What to say: ""The alternative flag would have been a danger to shipping."" Flag it up: You can board the Panama-registered Carnival Breeze for a quiet cruise -- just you and 3,689 other passengers. Greenland . Granted home rule from Denmark in 1978, Greenlanders decided they needed something new to fly above their frosty territories. The result, adopted in 1985, is both an exercise in classically minimalist Scandinavian design, and a bold departure from other flags favored by Nordic nations. Many in Greenland had hoped to emulate Denmark and its neighbors by using a Christian cross -- preferably white on green -- but from 555 submitted designs, a committee instead chose a red and white split circle on a contrasting background. The symbolism isn't too hard to read: a red sun sinking down into snow and ice. What to say: ""Let's hope global warming doesn't necessitate a redesign."" Flag it up: You can witness Greenland's fantastic sunsets for yourself. United Kingdom . The UK's Union Flag has long lived a double life, serving both as national emblem and an erstwhile fashion icon -- although its associations with the Swinging Sixties are these days just as likely to bring to mind Austin Powers' underwear. The flag itself is an exercise in nation building, originally combining the blue and white saltire of Scotland's patron Saint Andrew and the red cross on white of England's Saint George when the two countries united in the 18th century. The red diagonal cross of Ireland's Saint Patrick was added later. Of course, all this could change again if Scottish people vote for independence in a referendum scheduled for 2014. In which case, perhaps Wales might finally get a mention. What to say: ""Groovy, baby!"" Flag it up: The Union flags may not be so prominent these days, but London's Carnaby Street is still a swinging center for fashion. Which flag do you think has the best design? The most boring?

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Barry Neild.","Colors clash on Brazil's flag, the ball of stars looks messy ... yet somehow it works .

"(CNN) -- How eager are retailers to boost sales this holiday season? It's no longer enough for them to offer one special day of discounts to online shoppers -- they're stretching the deals out over an entire week. While retailers are still trumpeting deals for this Monday after Thanksgiving, many such as Amazon, Target and Walmart are now promoting some version of ""Cyber Week"" and extending Web-only deals through next weekend. The online discounts apply to all types of items, from appliances to clothes to consumer electronics. Walmart, for example, says it will offer 200 deals on its website each day through Friday, plus free shipping on all orders over $35. Not to be outdone, Amazon is promising new deals as often as every 10 minutes through Saturday, along with free shipping on ""eligible orders"" of $35 and over (it's not clear how they define ""eligible."") In fact, if you're not getting free shipping on your online purchases this week, you may want to shop elsewhere. Clothing chains such as H&M, Gap and Banana Republic also are offering storewide Cyber Monday discounts of 40%. It's not always clear whether Cyber Monday discounts are much greater than what retailers offer online during other sale events. Also, supplies may be limited. Here's a sampling of some online deals being advertised for Cyber Monday (and in many cases, the rest of the week): . -- Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 tablet with 16GB of storage: $399, down from $499 (Amazon) -- Canon Powershot A3500 16MP digital camera with 5x optical zoom (red model only): $99, down from $199 (Target) -- HTC One 32GB smartphone: 1 cent (it's normally $199), with two-year contract from AT&T, Verizon or Sprint (Amazon) -- 46-inch Samsung LED TV: $478, marked down from $949 (Walmart) -- Kindle Fire HD 16 GB tablet: $119, down from $169 (Amazon) -- Jawbone Jambox Bluetooth rechargeable portable speaker: $69, down from $199 (eBay) -- HP Pavilion 15-N066US 15-inch laptop: $459, down from $649 (Staples) -- Motorola Moto X smartphone: $349 without a contract, down from $499. The discount is available for all carriers and for both 16GB and 32GB models, although Motorola says supplies will be limited. -- Dyson DC41 Multifloor Bagless Upright Vacuum: $399, down from $549 (Best Buy) -- Craftsman 192-piece mechanics tool set: $99, down from $199 (Sears) -- Select coats from Kenneth Cole, Calvin Klein, DKNY and London Fog: 50% off, plus free shipping on online purchases of $75 or more (Macy's) -- Half off select men's and women's clothes and accessories (Target) The term Cyber Monday was coined in 2005 by a division of the National Retail Federation with the thinking that shoppers, after browsing in stores over Thanksgiving weekend, would wait to make online purchases Monday from their offices, where they had faster Internet connections. That notion is somewhat outdated now because 70% of Americans have high-speed broadband Internet service at home, not to mention on their phones and tablets. But since 2010, Cyber Monday actually has been the biggest online-shopping day of the year -- and retailers are trying to capitalize.","Retailers offering Cyber Monday deals of up to 50% on electronics and other items .

"(CNN) -- Australia has extradited a man from Germany to face charges of people smuggling, after a three-and-a-half year manhunt by federal police and Interpol. The 42-year-old man was allegedly involved in organizing a fishing boat carrying 56 people, which arrived in Australian waters from Indonesia in September 2010. He's been charged with eight counts of people smuggling. If found guilty he faces up to 20 years in prison. Australia's Minister for Justice, Michael Keenan, said the man's extradition sent a clear sign to other suspected traffickers. ""The message to those who are suspected of participating in this evil crime is clear -- Australian law enforcement will ensure they are tracked down to face the full force of our laws,"" he said. OPINION: Deterring and denying asylum seekers in Australia . Border crackdown . Soon after his election as prime minister in September 2013, Tony Abbott declared an unofficial war on people smugglers. He announced ""Operation Sovereign Borders,"" a military-led crackdown meant to deter potential asylum seekers from making the risky voyage to Australian waters. The government said the policy would save lives lost at sea. Critics responded that it was an attempt to evade Australia's international obligations to provide refuge to those fleeing persecution. On Thursday, Abbott announced again the policy was working; no asylum seekers had successfully arrived in the country by boat in six months. ""I'm not declaring victory; there's no hint of mission accomplished,"" Abbott told reporters. However, he pointed out in a statement that under the former Labor government, during the same six-month period the previous year, 190 boats with 12,773 people had illegally arrived in Australia -- ""more than a boat a day."" The operation may have been successful in reducing the number of boats arriving in Australia, but the government's policy on asylum seekers has attracted fierce criticism. Amnesty International has called the government treatment of asylum seekers ""cruel, inhuman and degrading."" Violence on Manus Island . After taking office, the Abbott government said it would continue a Labor plan to process all asylum seekers at offshore detention centers. One of the most controversial centers is on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, where hundreds of male asylum seekers are being held in four security compounds. The center opened in August 2013, but the numbers of detainees, or transferees as they're also known, has since swelled to more than 1,300. In February, uncertainty about their future, combined with antagonism between the detainees and PNG nationals working at the center, saw protests erupt into a night of violence. An independent review commissioned by the government into the riots heard claims of simmering tensions between asylum seekers and PNG nationals employed at the center. The report, released in May, found the detainees became angry after a meeting because they felt questions relating to when their claims would be processed weren't being answered. What happened next was a blur of beatings and clashes that ended in the death of one asylum seeker, Iranian Reza Berati.

Another, former G4S security guard, Steve Kilburn, told the inquiry that within a week after arriving on Manus Island he formed the opinion that ""there is only one possible outcome on Manus Island and that is bloodshed."" He said he thought ""violence was inevitable"" because of the remote location of the center, the poor living and working conditions, tensions between local PNG guards and transferees and the lack of hope felt by the asylum seekers that their claims would ever be processed.

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Police mismanaged a shootout connected to the deaths of four Oakland, California, police officers last March, making a series of poor decisions that might have contributed to the record death toll, an independent board says. The board this week released a sometimes scathing report that paints a vivid picture of the chaos that descended on an east Oakland street on March 21 after a convicted felon opened fire on officers during a traffic stop. Lovelle Mixon, 26, is accused of fatally shooting two Oakland patrol officers and fleeing to a nearby apartment building. Mixon then allegedly shot and killed two SWAT officers who burst into the apartment before police fatally shot him. The incident was deadliest in Oakland police history, the board said. The panel, made up of law enforcement experts, said the two officers made a mistake in the traffic stop when both approached the car on the driver's side. That approach violated Oakland police training procedures and safety practices. But the report's most severe criticism focuses on how Oakland police handled the surge of 115 police cars that rushed to the scene after the traffic stop. ""The activities of the 115 OPD [Oakland Police Department] and outside agency units on scene were disorganized and confused due to poor situational awareness and lack of clear command and control,"" the report says. Some other criticism: . • None of the highest-ranking officers at the scene took an overall leadership role in the operation, and no command post was set up to efficiently dessiminate information. ""As a consequence, no one knew who was in charge, adding to the confusion and disorganization,"" the report says. • Police leadership violated policy by assembling a SWAT team from officers on scene instead of waiting for the official special weapons and tactics team to arrive. • A decision was made to have the ad hoc SWAT team enter an apartment where the suspect was thought to be hiding. But the building was not ""formally scouted; no effort was made to ascertain the status of apartment building residents, the apartment building's interior configurations, as well as individual apartment floor plans,"" the report says. • The SWAT team entered the apartment without a warrant before hostage negotiators or snipers arrived. The team had never trained together and was not ready for the high-powered response it received from the gunman. The gunman shot the first two officers who entered the apartment, killing one of them. As other officers entered the dimly lit front room filled with children's toys, the officers were startled to see a woman running at them, screaming. ""Surprised entry team members alerted on her as a possible shooter, but held their fire while they assessed the threat she posed as she ran yelling past them into the outer hallway,"" the report says. The gunman retreated to a bedroom, where he fatally shot one more officer before police killed him. The report praised the officers' restraint in not shooting the woman who was in the apartment. But, in all, the report found 11 things that Oakland police did well during the incident and 23 things that needed improvement. The report will help strengthen the police department, Chief Anthony Batts told CNN affiliate KGO. ""We will correct those areas that we were flawed in. We will improve,"" Batts said.","Poor decisions may have contributed to death of four officers, board says .

"(CNN) -- Once investigators looking for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 decide to shift from listening for pings emanating from the floor of the Indian Ocean to poring over its terrain, they will begin drawing from a whole new set of tools. Among them will be the Bluefin-21, a probe equipped with side-scan sonar -- an acoustic technology that creates pictures from the reflections of sound rather than light. ""That is a piece of equipment that does assist in locating where the wreckage may be,"" said Sylvia Earle, an oceanographer from National Geographic who was chief scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A 'massive, massive task' Though the discovery of four pings believed to be from the jet's so-called black boxes -- its flight data recorder and its cockpit voice recorder -- have helped investigators narrow the search area, they would still face a formidable task. ""It's a lot of terrain to cover,"" given that the Bluefin-21 moves at the pace of a leisurely stroll, she told CNN. Though it moves slowly, it creates good images -- so good that they are ""almost a picture of what's there ... but it's imaged with sound instead of with a camera."" Listen for a ping, and the water may play tricks on you . Once the debris field is found, then other equipment -- such as remotely operated vehicles -- would be brought in to recover the black boxes, Earle said. ROVs working at depths of three miles would require power conveyed down a cable from a ship above, she said. ""There are not many pieces of equipment in the world able to do this."" And there are only a handful of countries that have manned submarines capable of descending to such depths, she said, citing the United States, Russia, Japan, France and China. ""Having the human presence there can make a big difference,"" she said. It ""can give you a real edge in terms of understanding what's there."" The scarcity of resources ""shows how ill-prepared we are to operate in the deep sea,"" Earle said. ""We've invested in aviation and aerospace, and we've been neglecting the ocean."" The time to move from listening for pings to looking for debris is fast approaching, said Alan Diehl, a former Air Force accident investigator. ""We're right on the cusp where we need to go from passive listening to active (looking) with the Bluefin,"" he told CNN. That's because the batteries powering the black boxes' locator devices are probably already dead, said Mary Schiavo, former inspector general for the U.S. Department of Transportation, who noted that more than four days had elapsed since any pings were detected. ""I'm surprised that they lasted as long as they did,"" she said. The failure of searchers to find any debris linked to the plane has not surprised CNN Aviation Analyst David Soucie, author of ""Why Planes Crash."" The model used for tracking the debris could be incorrect, he said, noting that that was the case when investigators were searching for evidence of Air France Flight 447, which plunged into the southern Atlantic Ocean in 2009, killing all 228 people aboard. ""They spent weeks looking for debris in the wrong area,"" he said. The lack of debris could also mean that the plane did not break apart on impact, but instead sank largely intact, he said. If that was the case, it could complicate the effort to retrieve the black boxes, since they were stored inside the tail of the plane. Investigators would have to dismantle the tail in order to extract them and whatever secrets they may hold. Lessons from past air disasters . Where's the debris?

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- When celebrated film composer Hans Zimmer agreed to create the soundtrack for Disney's 1994 animated film ""The Lion King,"" he knew there was only one person he wanted to work with -- South African singer and songwriter Lebo M. Award-winning Zimmer, whose illustrious body of work includes scores for mega-hits such as ""Gladiator,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""The Simpsons,"" had already collaborated successfully with Lebo on ""The Power of One,"" a 1992 drama set in South Africa. ""By the time he [Zimmer] had committed to what became 'The Lion King,' there were other people hired that I replaced ... because Hans was reluctant to continue without me in the project,"" remembers Lebo. For Zimmer, however, there was still one big problem: finding Lebo in his hometown of Soweto. ""They looked all over,"" says Lebo with a smile on his face. ""At that time there was no iPhone, the world was not here, you know? To find somebody in Soweto, good luck!"" After a long search, Zimmer eventually tracked Lebo and asked him to fly to Los Angeles immediately. Read: Africa's Hollywood music man . Lebo put his stamp on the movie; his credits include choral arranger and conductor but to most ""Lion King"" fans he is famous for delivering the powerful vocal sequence in the opening moments of the film. The duo's collaboration earned them a Grammy while Zimmer was awarded an Oscar for Best Original Score. The movie also turned out to be a roaring success, winning two Academy Awards and three Golden Globes, as well as becoming the highest grossing hand-drawn film in cinema history . ""We had created a formula with Hans that puts together Eurocentric orchestration with African voices and African big drums,"" says Lebo. ""We created a very unique soundtrack -- it's still my very favorite soundtrack."" Lebo's arrangements captured the spirit of Africa, in tune with the politics of the time in his home country. ""When Simba takes over Pride Land, to me is not an animation,"" he explains. ""The lyrical inspiration around that is visualizing Nelson Mandela becoming president at the same time when Simba takes over Pride Land,"" he adds. ""It's a personal journey for me, this project."" Born in Johannesburg in 1964 as Lebohang Morake, Lebo grew up during the height of apartheid. Gifted with a natural musical talent, he left school at the age of nine to start performing at local night clubs. The young musician, who idolized soul legends such as Marvin Gaye and The Commodores, soon started making a name for himself, becoming the youngest singer to perform at The Pelican Club in Soweto, aged 13. Two years later, his talent was recognized by a local U.S. ambassador who arranged for Lebo to apply to the Duke Ellington school of music in Washington, D.C. Lebo's unique musical intuition led him to Los Angeles where, after a tough spell where he lived on the street and found himself working in car washes and fast food chains, he managed to establish himself as a Hollywood-based musician. Read: Healing a wounded nation through music . Lebo's first big break came when the 1987 South African-themed movie ""Cry Freedom"" was nominated for an Academy Award. Lebo was asked to assemble a choir to perform at the Oscars. Their act received a standing ovation and people in the film industry took notice. More projects followed suit but in the early 1990s Lebo decided to go back to his apartheid-free home country and reunite with his family. He later returned to the U.S. to work with Zimmer on ""The Lion King."" While making the movie the pair wrote so much music that an executive at Disney decided to put out a second album, ""Rhythm of the Pride Lands."" Film, theater and opera director Julie Taylor heard it and approached Lebo about collaborating on a Broadway adaptation of ""The Lion King."" Following in the footsteps of the movie, the musical has gone on to become a long-running hit, amassing awards and spawning several productions across the world. Lebo says that it is the combination of the African spirit with a global story line that has made the show such a success. ""I think the authenticity and the raw African-ness of 'The Lion King' is a bigger selling point than any other product that has ever been on Broadway or on stage, done with a world-class quality approach,"" says Lebo, who is determined to keep the show's feel authentically African by making sure that all international productions feature South African performing in them. Read: Afrobeats going global . ""In the last 15 years we've hired well over 250 South Africans, unknown, that come from raw townships, rural areas and suburbs that are spread around the world where 'The Lion King' is and there are probably more than eight productions of 'The Lion King' outside of New York and that for me has given me the opportunity to give back,"" says Lebo, who is currently working on his first-ever tour. His advice to the young people of his continent is to embrace their African identity. ""I think the biggest challenge for us South Africans specifically, is how do we continue to define ourselves in a global community as part of the world community?"" he says. ""That's the hardest thing to do right now -- to tell young people in Nigeria, in Johannesburg, in Ghana, that the African in you is your ticket to Hollywood versus the hip-hop African American wannabe in you,"" he adds. ""You are a commercially viable product in the world and you can play and be commercially successful like anyone else but self-identity defines you.""","Lebo M conducted and sang on the movie The Lion King .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- With Quentin Tarantino's recent disclosure that Brad Pitt ""pulled out a brick of hash"" for the pair to smoke during a meeting about Tarantino's new film ""Inglourious Basterds,"" the two movie icons could today be mistaken for old roomies. Brad Pitt and Quentin Tarantino have always wanted to work together but couldn't find the right project before ""Inglourious Basterds."" However, in an interview with CNN, the charismatic director of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" insists that the well-anticipated union was a long time in the making. ""It was very much a case of us wanting to work together, but waiting for the right project to come along,"" he told CNN. It has been 16 years since a youthful Pitt featured -- rather fittingly, it seems -- as a stoned layabout in ""True Romance,"" the Tarantino-scripted tale of lovers on the run. Since that time, Tarantino says, ""everybody's been wondering when this great love affair is gonna happen."" And yet, when Tarantino first approached Brad's representative about another project, the agent was apparently ""too protective"" of the future relationship between the director and his client. ""He told me the last thing he wanted was to put us in the same room and let us fall in love over a movie we wouldn't be able to do."" A seasoned filmmaker by this time, Tarantino could relate to the points raised by the agent and decided to take a step back and let things happen naturally. He first sensed Pitt could be a strong contender for the role of Aldo Raine, the ""fast-talking, vengeance-driven hillbilly from the mountains of Tennessee"" who leads Tarantino's critically-divisive ""Inglourious Basterds,"" when he was half way through writing the script.  From ""Dogs"" to ""Basterds:"" Tarantino's career in pictures » . At this stage, however, Tarantino was still not entirely convinced Pitt would be the best choice. ""Then, I wrote a little bit more and thought Brad would be terrific. By the time I got towards the end, I felt he would be perfect but became worried I wouldn't get him."" He quickly made contact with the agent again and explained there was another project in the pipeline. At this point, he was worried Pitt could already be committed for the next few years. Fortunately for the army of Pitt and Tarantino fans around the world, this was not the case. ""His agent said Brad doesn't do that because he wants to be available when good material is offered."" The rest, as they say, is history. ""It was a lot of fun working with Brad, which wasn't very surprising,"" Tarantino told CNN. ""We had already been told we would get along like a house on fire, and that's pretty much what happened.""

"(CNN) -- A Montana judge seeking re-election next year is facing calls to step down immediately after handing down a 30-day sentence to a teacher who admitted raping a 14-year-old student. Petitions calling for Baugh's resignation flooded the Internet this week after he passed up a chance to impose a tough sentence on Stacey Dean Rambold, a former high school teacher. The teen, who was 14 when Rambold had a sexual relationship with her in 2008, committed suicide in 2010, as the case made its way through the courts. After her death, prosecutors offered to dismiss the charges if Rambold admitted to one charge of rape, completed a sex offender treatment program and met other requirements. But Rambold failed to tell his counselors about relationships he had with women, a violation of his deal. So his case was revived and it was up to Baugh to decide on a punishment. Prosecutors asked for a 20-year sentence with 10 years suspended, court documents show. But the judge followed the recommendation of the defense, which called for a sentence of 15 years, with all but 30 days suspended. NYC police: Teacher accused of raping 10-year-old student . The mother of the teen, Auliea Hanlon, called the short sentence for Rambold a ""travesty."" Hanlon said she was particularly upset that Baugh said her daughter ""seemed older than her chronological age"" and was ""as much in control of the situation"" as the teacher. Baugh apologized on Wednesday. ""I made some references to the victim's age and control,"" he told CNN affiliate KTVQ. ""I'm not sure just what I was attempting to say at that point, but it didn't come out correct. What I said was demeaning to all women, not what I believe in and irrelevant to the sentencing."" About the sentencing itself, Baugh said he would file an addendum to the case file to ""better explain"" his rationale. Baugh, 71, the oldest son of Washington Redskins' legendary quarterback Sammy Baugh, grew up on a family farm in Rotan, Texas, with four siblings, according to a 2008 Montana Standard article. In the story, which was written after Baugh's father's death at age 94, the judge told the newspaper he moved to Montana in the 1960s to practice law before seeking a spot on the bench. Baugh has served as a judge in Yellowstone County since 1984. He was an attorney in Billings and served as a U.S. magistrate before running for district court judge. The judge has imposed tough sentences in rape cases before. Canadian teen commits suicide after alleged rape . In September 2011, Baugh sentenced a 26-year-old man to 100 years in prison, with 50 years suspended, for the rape of an 11-year-old boy, according to local media reports. In that case, the man had met the boy at a video store and later met him at school and lured him to an empty irrigation ditch, according to local reports at the time. In August 2012, the judge sentenced a 23-year-old man to 56 years in prison, with 31 years suspended, for possessing child pornography that included images of children under age 12. State law mandated a minimum of 25 years for such crimes. The Billings Gazette reported that the defendant also admitted to sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl, for which Baugh sentenced him to a concurrent 10-year term.","Montana Judge G.

"(CNN) -- Like clockwork, waitress Zoe Spawton would spot Ali walking past her Berlin cafe every morning around 9 while she was setting up sidewalk furniture. Naturally, the mustachioed 83-year-old stood out in his impeccably tailored suits and bold ensembles usually topped off with an oddball flourish, be it a Nike knit cap, a diamante skull baseball cap or a silver chain around his neck. ""His outfits were so put together and he obviously took great pride in his appearance,"" said Spawton, a 29-year-old photographer from Australia who has lived in Berlin for almost a year. ""Also, it was the way he walked,"" she said in a Skype interview Thursday. ""He obviously had a bit of swagger."" It took a few weeks of nodding, smiling and greeting Ali in broken German for Spawton to work up the courage to for his picture. He obliged and thus was born ""What Ali Wore,"" Spawton's popular blog documenting Ali's daily sartorial choices. The Tumblr blew up on social media this week after a German street style blog featured an interview with her on Monday. Since then, Spawton said she has been fielding e-mails and interview requests from media outlets all over the world and new fans eager for a glimpse into Ali's life. Related: Aging stylishly, online and in the streets . With just 31 images to date taken since August, something about Ali has captured the public's imagination. Maybe it's the way he leans into the camera with a beckoning stare, or his seamless transition from head-to-toe camouflage on one day to glen plaid three-piece suit the next. ""It's a simple sort of idea but people are curious about other people. It's been an interesting week, for sure,"" said Spawton. She declined to give Ali's last name or say where he worked, citing concerns for his privacy. People tell her that Ali reminds them of their father or grandfather, she said, or that they can see the friendship developing between them with each photo. ""What Ali Wore"" comes off part style blog, part private journal documenting the relationship between a man in his twilight years and the rapt young woman whose attention he has caught as it evolves along with his transition from blazers and sport coats to puffy winter jackets. ""First photo! Ali walks past the cafe I work at in Berlin every morning at 9:05am,"" Spawton wrote in her inaugural post in October, featuring Ali in a crimson shirt with matching pointy boots and white creased slacks. ""He always wears such great clothes. I don't speak much German and he speaks a little bit of English, but I managed to ask if I could take his photo. He gladly accepted."" After that day, Ali began adopting the tilted pose that has become his signature, she said. He also began to bring her small gifts, like a piece of fruit or chocolate. He also appeared to start dressing for the shots, declining on some days to be photographed if he'd worn the same thing earlier in the week, she said. ""Today was my first day back at work after two weeks and I think Ali and I were equally excited to see each other,"" she posted on in January. ""We've seen this suit before, however the way he is working that coat (and a new pose!) is just wonderful!"" She eventually learned that he worked six days as a tailor nearby and that he made some of his own clothes. Otherwise, because of their language barrier, Spawton says she knew practically nothing about him until the two met randomly one night on the tram. She was returning home from visiting a friend and he was nursing a beer while on his way home, she said. She learned that he was originally from Turkey and lived in Berlin for 44 years. He was a retired doctor who now worked as a tailor and that he had lived alone for at least 10 years. Oh, and he has 18 children, she said. ""What an amazing life. Can't wait to learn more,"" she posted on her blog. Since then she has not learned a whole lot more, though the two have gone on one extracurricular excursion to an apple orchard with his colleague from the alterations shop, she said. ""There's only a handful that we can say,"" she said. ""But in a way, when I do manage to glean those little bits of information from him, it makes it all the more rewarding."" She went to his shop for the first time last week to get measured after he informed her earlier this month that he was going to make her a skirt, she said. His flirtatious side came out as he asked her if she wanted a mini-skirt; she opted for something just above the knee. Maybe it's his age, or the lack of commitment except for the promise of a photograph in exchange for being friendly, but there's just something unthreatening about him, she said. ""It feels so simple, just a friendship where we enjoy seeing each other,"" she said. ""He seems to enjoy having his photographs taken. It must be nice to have it acknowledged that he's a stylish man."" The attention has been somewhat overwhelming, she said, but she appreciates it and so does Ali. She told him about it earlier this week in her broken German and she got the impression that he understood, and might have even stepped up his game for his new fans.

"(CNN) -- Generations of rock hounds and miners have turned the earth in western North Carolina, looking to bring a special ruby, sapphire or emerald -- the ""big three"" of the gem world -- to the light. The passion started early for Terry Ledford, 53, who operated a gem stand on weekends when he was a kid. ""I always loved rocks,"" said the Spruce Pine resident. For W. Renn Adams, 90, the world of spodumenes, hiddenite and beryl runs even deeper in his blood. His Alexander County family has been digging for them since the 1880s. The men's interests became intertwined early this decade when they became partners on the Adams family farm, which grows corn along with its treasures below. They unearthed hiddenite, a rare pale-to-green mineral in the spodumene family, and other specimens. ""We never found any good emeralds,"" said Adams. Until that day in August 2009. ""It was just a normal digging day,"" said Adams, who used to grade roads before he retired. Using a track hoe and other equipment, Ledford worked his way down a hole in the earth and through a quartz vein, 14 feet below the surface. That's when he found it. Reaching below a crystal, he saw what looked to be part of a 7UP bottle. It was an emerald crystal. A very big emerald crystal. Some 310 carats of it. ""Terry really had a time when he found that one,"" recalled Adams, without a hint of understatement. Dubbed the ""Carolina Emperor,"" the gem has been trimmed to 64.83 carats and is called the largest cut emerald ever found in North America. It is being compared to an emerald that once belonged to Catherine the Great of Russia. And it could be yours. The co-owners are selling it, perhaps by the end of the year. While rubies and sapphires are found near Franklin, about 75 miles southwest of Asheville, different gems lure residents and visitors to Alexander County, about 30 miles northeast of Hickory. The small town of Hiddenite is named for William Earl Hidden, who mined North America's first emerald and hiddenite on the Adams property in the 1880s, said geologist Ed Speer. ""Emeralds are very rare in the world and only a few countries host emerald deposits,"" Speer said. ""North Carolina is lucky to have three known emerald districts, including the Hiddenite district."" Michael Wise, a geologist with the National Museum of Natural History, said emeralds are more likely to be found outside North America. Most are from Colombia, Russia, Brazil and Afghanistan. According to Speer, emeralds (a beryl colored by chrome and vanadium) and the rarer hiddenite (spodumene) are together only in this part of North Carolina. Gems have created a cottage industry around Hiddenite, with amateurs and mining operations working the soil. At Emerald Hollow Mine, options for the energetic are ""digging,"" ""creeking"" and ""sluicing."" ""We have people from everywhere,"" said employee Whitney Day, who said the region offers 63 types of minerals. Mining has a significant impact on the state's economy, with gem mining a small part of that, said Speer, who has 40 years' experience in mineral exploration around the world. The presence of pegmatites, a form of igneous rock, is largely responsible for the number and quality of gemstones, he said. Although the public's imagination often revolves around precious gems and stones used in jewelry, including diamonds, collectors often come at gems from a different perspective. They may prefer a certain locality or type of gem, Wise said. ""A serious collector may prefer an uncut crystal to a cut gem,"" he added. Adams said his family used to open the farm to the public in the 1970s and into the 1980s. People paid $3 to dig by hand and foot; no machinery was allowed. Since then, the small mining operation has been private. Failing eyesight has somewhat sidelined Adams, but he still has a penchant for the craft. ""I like moving the dirt."" Ledford, who also sells gems and operates an amethyst mine in Georgia, and Adams have had the six-sided ""Carolina Emperor"" crystal cut twice. It is now slightly wider than a quarter. They received a comprehensive analysis in early August, and are now marketing the stone. The emerald compares in size and quality to one surrounded by diamonds in a brooch once owned by Catherine the Great, who was empress in the 18th century, said C.R. ""Cap"" Beesley, a New York gemologist who examined the stone. Beesley told The Associated Press that Christie's auction house in New York sold that gem in April for $1.65 million. Chips or cuttings that resulted from the faceting of ""Carolina Emperor"" sold for between $10,000 (1.89 carats) and $15,000 (2.36 carats), said Ledford. Ledford, the son of a mica miner, said he would rate the quality of the gem an 8 on a 10-point scale. Its uniqueness and size, with color and clarity following, may put it in the area of the selling price for the Catherine the Great emerald, he said. Generally, larger gems are more likely to have internal flaws and inclusions, said Wise. But Douglas Hucker, CEO of the American Gem Trade Association, who like Wise said he has not seen the stone, said those factors are not as critical as size and color. The Hiddenite emerald's biggest asset is that it is from an area not known for large emeralds, said Hucker. ""If it wasn't from North Carolina it wouldn't be creating the buzz it is now,"" he said. Standards for colored gems are not as exacting as for diamonds, he added. Still, Hucker said, it is a large stone with desirable color and a potential buyer may be drawn to it. ""When you combine all those things it increases the rarity."" Hucker said that comparing the emerald to the Catherine the Great gem is a stretch because the empress, who he described as a ""jewelry hog,"" was a person of special historic significance. Beesley's report, which calls the ""Carolina Emperor"" one of ""the most important gemstones in American history,"" mentions an 18.88-carat pear-shape emerald, which until now was considered the continent's most valuable cut emerald. ""This is a monster by comparison,"" said Wise. ""Several people are interested in it,"" said Ledford, adding an unnamed museum has expressed interest. Meanwhile, Ledford and an assistant continue to operate at the Adams family farm. ""Terry's emerald find is very exciting as it confirms that more large emeralds are still out there,"" said Speer. At 90, Adams can savor the moment. ""This is what I always dreamed to find,"" he said.","Gem is called largest cut emerald in North America .

"(CNN) -- Unbelievable. That's how a police captain described the case. A 39-year-old woman in Utah is in custody, accused of murder, after authorities found the remains of seven infants at a home where she used to live. ""During the course of the investigation, information was obtained that over a 10-year period a 39-year-old female gave birth to the infants and then killed them. The female was booked into the Utah County Jail on six counts of murder,"" Pleasant Grove, Utah, police said in a statement. Capt. Michael Roberts identified the woman as Megan Huntsman. It was not immediately clear why she faces six, not seven, counts of murder. The bodies were found at a home where Huntsman had lived until 2011, said Roberts, adding that the residence is currently occupied by family members of her estranged husband.

"(CNN) -- Accusations of blame abounded Thursday, a day after a 28-year-old man who had volunteered for a center that serves gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people was taken into custody for allegedly shooting a building manager at the headquarters of a Christian conservative group. ""Let me be clear that Floyd Corkins was responsible for firing the shot yesterday,"" Family Research Council President Tony Perkins told reporters in Washington about the suspect. ""But Corkins was given a license to shoot an unarmed man by organizations like the Southern Poverty Law Center that have been reckless in labeling organizations hate groups because they disagree with them on public policy."" Perkins said the SPLC ""should be held accountable for their reckless use of terminology that is leading to the intimidation and what the FBI here has categorized as an act of domestic terrorism."" Who is DC shooting suspect? Prosecutors said they are still investigating the motive behind the shooting, and the motive could determine whether Corkins is charged with domestic terrorism or hate crimes. In a statement, the Southern Poverty Law Center described as ""outrageous"" the suggestion that it had contributed to the attack. The Family Research Council, which focuses on family and anti-abortion issues and religious liberties, recently supported Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy, who had become embroiled in controversy after making comments in support of traditional marriage. ""We are very much supportive of the family, the biblical definition of the family unit,"" Cathy told The Baptist Press in an interview published July 16. ""We are a family-owned business, a family-led business, and we are married to our first wives. We give God thanks for that."" The statement sparked an uproar, with activists saying that Cathy voiced opposition to gay marriages. Corkins, who was carrying 15 Chick fil-A sandwiches in his bag when he was taken into custody, ""has strong opinions with respect to those he believes do not treat homosexuals in a fair manner,"" authorities said in the complaint filed against Corkins, citing the suspect's parents, with whom he lives in Herndon, Virginia, outside Washington. Asked what evidence he had linking the center to the shooting, Perkins referred to the Chick-fil-A matter. ""You have seen Family Research Council listed in many of those stories -- that Chick fil-A supports and underwrites the Family Research Council. Chicken, with a side of politics . ""And in those stories where it says the Family Research Council, it says they're a certified hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center. We've seen that term used increasingly over the last two years and it marginalizes individuals and organizations, letting people feel free to go and do bodily harm to innocent people who are simply working and representing folks all across this country."" He said the company donated $1,000 to the Family Research Council ""a number of years ago"" but does not underwrite his group. The Family Research Council says it promotes ""faith, family and freedom in public policy and public opinion."" National Organization for Marriage President Brian Brown also criticized the Southern Poverty Law Center, saying that its listing of the Family Research Council on its website was equating the group with violent extremist groups. ""The responsibility is on the shooter, but we need to have a civil debate over issues like redefining marriage,"" he said Thursday on CNN's ""Early Start."" ""But we should not be attacking and labeling as hate groups those that we disagree (with). We should condemn violence of any sort, but we should also be responsible."" In its statement, the SPLC said it had listed the Family Research Council as a hate group since 2010 ""because it has knowingly spread false and denigrating propaganda about LGBT people -- not, as some claim, because it opposes same-sex marriage."" ""The FRC and its allies on the religious right are saying, in effect, that offering legitimate and fact-based criticism in a democratic society is tantamount to suggesting that the objects of criticism should be the targets of criminal violence."" The SPLC criticizes the Family Research Council for asserting, ""in Perkins' words, that pedophilia is 'a homosexual problem' -- an utter falsehood, as every relevant scientific authority has stated. An FRC official has said he wanted to 'export homosexuals from the United States.' The same official advocated the criminalizing of homosexuality."" Perkins was using Wednesday's shooting ""to pose a false equivalency between the SPLC's criticisms of the FRC and the FRC's criticisms of LGBT people,"" the SPLC said. ""The FRC routinely pushes out demonizing claims that gay people are child molesters and worse -- claims that are provably false. It should stop the demonization and affirm the dignity of all people."" In wake of shootings, opinions on gun control unchanged . One legal expert said Perkins seems to be inconsistent in deciding which battles to pick. After Dr. George R. Tiller, a Kansas abortion provider, was shot dead in May 2009, Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly came under criticism for having called him ""Tiller the baby killer."" Referring to O'Reilly, Perkins announced in August that year that ""We're going to give him an award for his courage in exposing the truth behind the late-term abortion industry."" ""I wish Perkins would not use a double standard,"" New York University Law School Professor Burt Neuborne told CNN in a telephone interview. ""When opponents of abortion engage in astonishingly bellicose speech where they call people 'murderers' and they virtually encourage people to take their lives and some nut acts on it, Perkins keeps his mouth shut. I don't see him criticizing that speech. The truth is, you can't pick and choose what kind of rhetoric to condemn."" By the numbers: Guns in America .","""Corkins was given a license to shoot,"" Family Research Council president says .
He says the Southern Poverty Law Center ""should be held accountable""

"(CNN) -- Liverpool closed on a first English title since 1990 with a thrilling 3-2 win over Manchester City in an emotion charged atmosphere at Anfield Sunday as the 25th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster was marked before kick off. The vital victory left Liverpool two points clear of Chelsea, who beat Swansea 1-0 later Sunday and seven in front of third-placed City, who have two games in hand. Philippe Coutinho scored the winner with a 78th-minute snap shot after the visitors had come back from two goals down and threatened to grab the three points. His goal came after a mistake by Belgian international Vincent Kompany, whose sliced clearance fell straight to the midfielder. Liverpool held on to the lead despite having Jordan Henderson sent off in injury time for a rash challenge on Samir Nasri . Their captain Steven Gerrard had tears in his eyes as he gathered his team in a huddle at the final whistle and admitted that City had proved a formidable hurdle in the title run-in. ""That's the longest 90 minutes I've probably ever played in. I felt like the clock was going backwards in some points of the game,"" he told Sky Sports. ""But this is a big result for us. We have four cup finals left,"" he added. City manager Manuel Pellegrini rued their missed opportunities after such a strong comeback. ""We had clear chances to score in the last 15 minutes but we made a mistake and they won the game. ""They started very well and scored two goals. It's easier when you are playing at home and go two goals in front -- it's more easy to play with calm,"" he added. Liverpool, who were claiming a 10th straight EPL win, started with confidence and in free-scoring mood, with youngster Raheem Sterling and Martin Skrtel grabbing first half goals. City came back into it after the break with David Silva and a Glen Johnson own goal leaving the home fans fearing the worse until Coutinho's late intervention. The match started seven minutes late in honor of the 96 Liverpool fans who died before an FA Cup semifinal match against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium in 1989. All matches in the English football program this weekend had similar tributes and a memorial service will be held at Anfield Tuesday, exactly 25 years since the tragedy. Earlier this month a new inquest into the deaths started after the original verdicts delivered by a coroner were quashed by the High Court in December 2012 amid claims of malpractice by police on duty that day. Chelsea, who visit Anfield in a fortnight, scrambled to a 1-0 win at the Liberty Stadium against a team reduced to 10-men after the early dismissal of Chico Flores. A Demba Ba goal in the 68th minute, his second crucial strike in a week, gave Chelsea the three points. While key matches were taken place in the title race, fellow EPL side Hull City reached the FA Cup final for the first time with a 5-3 win over third-flight Sheffield United at Wembley. Hull will play Arsenal, who saw off Wigan on penalties in the first semifinal Saturday, next month but were given an almighty scare by the underdogs. United led through Jose Baxter and Stefan Scougall either side of a Yannick Sagbo goal at halftime. Hull substitute Matty Fryatt drew them level just after the break before Tom Huddlestone and Stephen Quinn put Hull them two clear. Jamie Murphy gave Sheffield United late hope then David Meyler added a fifth for the top flight side in injury time. In the Spanish title race, Atletico Madrid stretched their lead to three points with a 2-0 win at Getafe as Diego Godin and star striker Diego Costa scored in each half. Costa, who has just returned after injury, collided with a goalpost in scoring the clinching second, but he should be fit to play in their next match against Elche Friday. Atletico are heading city rivals Real with champions Barcelona, who lost to Granada Saturday, a further point behind, with five games to go in La Liga.","Liverpool beat Manchester City in crucial match at top of EPL .

"New York (CNN) -- Philip Seymour Hoffman was mourned in New York on Friday with a star-studded private funeral attended by family and close friends. In the late morning, friends of one of the greatest actors of his generation began streaming through the bronze doors of the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, the 116-year-old landmark that hosted the funerals of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Lena Horne. A black hearse pulled up to the church shortly after noon Friday as a couple of dozen fans and mourners gathered nearby to pay their respects. Six pallbearers carried Hoffman's coffin into the church's Baroque-style interior, where friends such as Cate Blanchett, Meryl Streep, Louis C.K., ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer and director husband Mike Nichols, Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Brian Dennehy, Michelle Williams and others awaited. Nichols directed Hoffman in his acclaimed portrayal of Willy Loman in ""Death of a Salesman"" on Broadway. Hoffman and Blanchett co-starred in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" Phoenix appeared with him in ""The Master."" Hoffman's longtime partner, Mimi O'Donnell, held their young daughter atop the church's marble stairs as traffic was momentarily halted on Park Avenue and quiet enveloped the normally bustling thoroughfare. At about 1:30 p.m., pallbearers in black suits emerged from the church with Hoffman's coffin, carrying it to a hearse as O'Donnell and the couple's children stood at the top of the stairs. Hoffman's mother, Marilyn O'Connor, stood behind O'Donnell. The Oscar-winning actor was found dead in his Manhattan apartment Sunday of an apparent drug overdose, law enforcement sources said. Hoffman, 46, was found on the bathroom floor of his apartment, a needle in his arm. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Investigators discovered close to 50 envelopes of what they believed was heroin in the apartment, law enforcement sources said. They also found used syringes, prescription drugs and empty plastic bags of a type commonly used to hold drugs, the sources said. On Tuesday, police arrested four people in connection with the drugs found in Hoffman's apartment and recovered 350 small plastic bags of what is believed to be heroin. The district attorney's office declined to prosecute one suspect. Two others were released pending court appearances. A fourth suspect, Robert Vineberg, charged with a felony count of criminal possession of a controlled substance, pleaded not guilty. He is due to appear in court February 14. A spokeswoman for the New York medical examiner's office said Wednesday a determination of the cause and manner of Hoffman's death is pending further study, including toxicology reports. A larger memorial service is being planned for later this month. On Thursday night, family and close friends attended a private wake at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home. The night before, Broadway honored Hoffman by dimming its marquee lights for a minute and fellow actors held a vigil. Hoffman, who was nominated for Academy Awards four times, won the Oscar for best actor in 2006 for his portrayal of writer Truman Capote in ""Capote."" He earned Academy Award nominations for roles in ""Charlie Wilson's War,"" ""Doubt,"" and ""The Master.""","Actor Philip Seymour Hoffman mourned privately by family and friends .

"(CNN) -- If you're a Michael Jackson fan, chances are you spent May 13 escaping with some of his new music. The King of Pop's posthumous album, ""Xscape,"" officially landed Tuesday after weeks of anticipation, and critics have been generally pleased. The disc features eight never-before-heard Jackson songs that have been finished by a crew of producers led by the prolific Timbaland. Using an array of tracks that were worked on from 1983 to 1999, ""Xscape"" digs into Jackson's archives and updates the music to make it sound like a contemporary release. In a review, Billboard reassures the curious that the album is worth a listen, adding that ""it's better than you think,"" primarily because Jackson's vocal talents are ""front and center."" Rolling Stone gives the record a more reserved three and a half stars, calling the track ""Loving You"" a standout. ""(The song) follows the wonderful, breezy legacy of 'Rock With You' and 'The Way You Make Me Feel,' but it's an exception: Most of these songs rot and sway with fear,"" the review says. ""Even with such dark subject matter, though, it's a joy to hear the joy in Jackson's voice."" The artist died at 50 in 2009 and, as The New York Times points out in its review, a ""contemporized"" album such as ""Xscape"" can only do so much to sate a fan's desire to hear new music. While "" 'Xscape' does polish up these old songs,"" the Times observes, it's also ""clear why Jackson shelved (them). They're near misses, either not quite as striking as what he released or lesser examples of ideas he exploited better elsewhere."" The U.K.'s Guardian found the effort to be lacking in coherence, but does believe it's a sound reminder of why ""Jackson was once pop's premier genius, still cited by the likes of Pharrell Williams and Justin Timberlake,"" the review notes. ""You could even say it's a fitting bookend to the man's career.""","Michael Jackson's posthumous album ""Xscape"" arrived Tuesday .

"(CNN) -- In 33 years with CNN, Jim Clancy has been almost everywhere and seen almost everything. That includes covering the aftermath of horrific commercial jet crashes, like Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, and Swissair Flight 111 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. It's what he does. So naturally, when he got a call on March 8 that Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 had vanished, Clancy went to work. After that first week, though, the veteran international journalist said it became evident this wasn't your typical jet crash. That's all the more obvious four weeks in as investigators don't have the plane's wreckage in hand. Nor do they have a fact-based explanation as to what happened. Below, Clancy reflects on the story and what makes it so unique and baffling -- one that might take years to unravel. QUESTION: What did you expect when you got the call and headed from Seoul to Kuala Lumpur? CLANCY: I've covered various other air crashes that resulted in great loss of life. As I landed that Saturday in Kuala Lumpur, I thought -- as did most journalists -- that the biggest challenge to the story would be facing grieving families, having to interview and interact with them at what was almost certainly one of the worst times of their lives. But I was certain the crash itself would be quickly explained, a search would quickly bring us to conclusions. We expected the sadness and the sorrow from the families. We knew because there were so many people on board and so many different nationalities, that it would be a major story. We expected it to be resolved in 72 hours. QUESTION: When did you get the sense that wouldn't happen? CLANCY: Very early on, at the very first news conference they hinted that the plane may have tried to reverse course, make a ""turn back"" as they called it. And I asked the head of the air force: A turn back 5 km, did it make it 10 km, 20 km? And he said, I can't tell you that, I don't know. And then after that, that's when we learned that it had flown hundreds of miles on radar. QUESTION: What's your take on Malaysia's response, and the reaction to it? CLANCY: While this was not Malaysia's first air tragedy, it was an unprecedented situation where a plane had gone missing -- not because something happened that forced it down, but because it abandoned its flight course and we don't know why. The officials here were really hard pressed to know what do, how to react, who was in charge. From the very beginning, everybody wanted to know the answer to one question: Where is the plane? What happened to my loved ones? And why did it go off course? These are fundamental questions that would be asked by anyone. The problem was that Malaysian authorities didn't have any idea what the answer was to these questions. How could they? But that was seen by many as they must be covering something up, they must be hiding something. It didn't help that the aircraft flew back across the Malay Peninsula undetected, they didn't scramble any jets and it simply flew away into the Indian Ocean. And it appeared at the time that their civil aviation and that their military aviation weren't talking to one another or hadn't communicated with one another. So the combination of multiple voices with no answers undermined any trust that the families had. The Chinese, especially, were bitter. Internet chat rooms and news outlets pumped up the theories . They included accusations that the Malaysians may have shot down the plane and they are covering it all up, that there was a hijacking and the Malaysian government was negotiating with them and they weren't telling the families. China's government allowed protests in Beijing against Malaysia's embassy. The kind of protests China would never tolerate if its own government were the target. (They fueled the idea) that somehow the Malaysian government was directly responsible for the fate of their relatives and was trying to deceive them. QUESTION: What's at stake for Malaysia? CLANCY: They knew they were overwhelmed, confused and sending mixed signals in the first week. They tried to do their best, but it was an unprecedented situation. Rivalries within the government may have contributed. Clearly there was some level of incompetence. People forget that the United States on 9/11 didn't realize that those planes were going into the World Trade Center until the second one hit and the Pentagon had been hit. And that's when (the United States) scrambled jets. So here's tiny Malaysia -- with no experience in any of this -- and they know that they screwed up, but they desperately wanted to show they could get it right. That's why they brought in a PR firm and reorganized themselves to help get a single message out and to try to dispel the rumors that they were trying to cover something up. It's a national airline. It's national pride. Their logic has been: If we find the plane and unravel what happened here, people will overlook the first few days of confusion and know we were never hiding something. They didn't have any of the capabilities or any of the assets to find this plane. So they organized a huge effort for the region. They also wanted this opportunity to shine. But again, they knew that they had to find the plane to make the whole thing work. So that's why they're so dedicated ... They will happily spend the last dollar that Australia has to find this plane. QUESTION: Why has this story resonated with so many people? CLANCY: This story has captured the world's attention because no one can believe that a sophisticated airliner like the Boeing 777 with 239 people on board can simply vanish into thin air. With no answers coming out of Kuala Lumpur, the internet went wild with speculation. Movie scripts started appearing online, there were attempts to crowdsource the search for the plane by looking at satellite photos. All kinds of images would pop up that you couldn't trace. Because there were no facts, you could make them up. QUESTION: How do you approach a story like this? CLANCY: I've never covered a story like this one that had so few facts and so much speculation in so many different directions. Very quickly we saw chaos. Yes, the government was responsible for some of it. But Malaysia and the media danced down the road of contradiction and confusion together. Reporters misinterpreted what they were told. Sources misinterpreted what they were telling reporters. When I began to see it unfolding, I was more determined than ever to avoid speculation and conjecture about what happened to the plane. From what our sources were telling us, it was obvious they didn't have any real facts and there was no point in pretending we did, either. I wasn't going to embrace some theory. Once CNN broke the story this plane had flown out of the South China Sea, back across the Malay Peninsula, I understood this was a bizarre, unprecedented event. The outcome was unpredictable because almost anything was possible. And so I kept convincing myself that evidence has to be coming. It has to be seen on a satellite, it has to be seen on a radar. (And conspiracy theorists speculating about terrorism) never stopped themselves to ask the basic question of: Who did it? Tell me who on board did it? They couldn't do that. Some of these rumors persist. Some of them start in China, some of them have started with aviation buffs. But none of the theories have any evidence to back it up. It is such a mystery because we have so few facts. QUESTION: What makes this story stand out for you, of all those big ones you've covered? CLANCY: I'm trying to think of a story that's more baffling. I can't. With Lockerbie , Pan Am Flight 103, they had the airplane. It was a mystery at first because they didn't know why it came down. But we knew we had the evidence there and we would be able to find out what caused it. This case is far more baffling because we have a plane that reversed its flight path, traveled almost in a line to Antarctica and apparently stayed aloft until it ran out of fuel. That's a plot? There's been no claim of responsibility. There's been no manifesto explaining any political motives or personal motives for anyone. How does a plane with a catastrophic mechanical malfunction go on to fly another seven hours? And as we try to imagine what was going on aboard the aircraft this entire time, would the other crew members have just stood by and let the plane go off in the opposite direction? There's a very good reason for our curiosity. There's a very good reason for us to want to extend the resource necessary to unravel this mystery.","CNN anchor Jim Clancy is a veteran international journalist .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Coast Guard said Sunday it has suspended its search for four British sailors missing since Friday. The 40-foot (12 meters) Cheeki Rafiki was sailing from the Caribbean to the United Kingdom Thursday when it began taking on water, according to the yacht's managing agent. ""Unfortunately, we lost contact during the early hours of Friday morning, and we believe the crew abandoned to the life raft,"" Doug Innes said in a statement. Royal Yachting Association identified the missing yachtsmen as skipper Andrew Bridge, 21; Steve Warren, 52; Paul Goslin, 56; and James Male, 23.

"(CNN) -- Police say a young man who went on a rampage at a shopping mall in Columbia, Maryland, was so obsessed with the April 1999 massacre at Columbine High School that he dressed up in an outfit reminiscent of those shooters and took a picture of himself. The shooter, 19-year-old Darion Marcus Aguilar, uploaded the picture of himself dressed in cargo pants and boots to the social networking web site Tumblr before the incident, police said Wednesday. The photo was taken in the dressing room of the The Mall in Columbia store where Aguilar would commit his crimes. In late January, Aguilar fatally shot Brianna Benlolo, 21, and Tyler Johnson, 25, and injured a third person before turning the gun on himself. Police declined to release the photo, saying they believe Aguilar took it to gain notoriety and they won't honor that desire. Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said a message accompanying the picture read, in part; ""I had to do this."" A police statement said Aguilar's account has been deactivated by Tumblr. Police verified previous reports that the shooter and the victims, one of whom worked at the skateboard apparel shop, were not acquainted. What was made clear from the latest release of information about the case was that police believe Aguilar had studied the Columbine shooting and seemed to be trying to mimic what occurred there. ""Aguilar's weapon, attire, backpack containing explosives and method of suicide were all similar to those used in the Columbine incident, said a Howard County police statement. On April 20, 1999, two Columbine students, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, killed 12 of their classmates, a teacher and then themselves. The school is in Littleton, Colorado. McMahon said police have learned Aguilar began using the Internet last year to search for information about mass shootings in malls and schools, gun laws and explosive techniques. He even downloaded a video game allowing players to act as one of the shooters from that day. Juxtaposed with those searches were inquiries about mental illness and visits to sites about suicide prevention. McMahon said Aguilar also sought help from his regular doctor because he said he was hearing voices. The doctor said he referred Aguilar to a psychiatrist, but it doesn't seem he ever made an appointment. The doctor told police Aguilar said those voices were non-violent and didn't direct him to do anything, authorities said. In December 2013, Aguilar purchased a shotgun at a shop just outside Washington, D.C. He was there with a friend, but police said the friend had no suspicions and no knowledge of Aguilar's future plans. Aguilar told his friend he was buying the gun for target practice. Police also recovered a journal which they said ultimately did not shed a lot of light on Aguilar's motives, but did give them some insight into his disturbed mind. In one entry, Aguilar wrote, ""I (sic) going to *expletive* kill you all in a couple of hours I'm anxious, I hate you all so much you are pathetic pieces of *expletive* who deserve to die. worthless you are all *expletive* worthless. Everything seems fake. I think that I may already be dead."" Police said Aguilar fired a total of nine rounds, but came into the store with 54. ""Frankly, we're fortunate he took his own life rather than to run down the hallway and chase victims as they were leaving,"" McMahon told reporters. In the end, McMahon said, it's clear Aguilar thought he was suffering from a mental illness but was afraid to even tell his own mother. McMahon said he believes the discussion on mental health treatment must continue. ""Nobody saw this coming,"" McMahon said. ""He was a young man that didn't garner much attention to himself.""

"FORT MYERS, Florida (CNN) -- Three men were charged Saturday with felony first-degree murder in the shooting death of NFL player Sean Taylor, a death police say was unplanned. Eric Rivera Jr., 17; Venjah K. Hunte, 20; and Charles Kendrick Lee Wardlow, 18,  each faces charges of felony first-degree murder, burglary with a firearm and home invasion robbery while armed, according to court documents. The charge of felony first-degree murder can be applied if someone is killed, even accidentally, during certain violent felony crimes. Rivera appeared in a courtroom in Fort Myers, Florida, while Hunte and Wardlow appeared via video phone from jail. A fourth suspect, Jason Scott Mitchell, 19, was processed too late to appear in court, officials said. He is to be in court Sunday, and he faces the same charges as the other three. Taylor, 24, a safety for the Washington Redskins, died Tuesday, a day after he was shot during an apparent burglary at his Miami home. The four suspects could be moved to Miami -- where the charges are based -- as soon as Sunday for a first-appearance hearing, said John Evans, Wardlow's lawyer. Police have more than one confession in the case, according to Robert Parker, director of the Miami-Dade Police Department. Rivera's attorney, Wilbur Smith, said Saturday he ""had been led to believe"" that his client confessed, but wasn't sure after speaking to Rivera. Asked about news reports alleging Rivera was the shooter, Smith said that he was aware of the stories, but that he had ""not talked enough to Eric to find that out."" ""The brief probable cause statement that we received did not indicate who was the shooter,"" he said. Smith described his client as ""stunned."" Asked whether he showed any remorse, Smith said, ""Oh yeah, you could see that in his eyes."" Evans said that despite a court affidavit alleging that his client confessed, he has not seen ""a transcript or heard any audio ... about any confession from any of the four people who are currently charged."" The four men were expecting to find an unoccupied home, ""so murder or shooting someone was not their initial motive,"" Parker said. ""They were certainly not looking to go there and kill anyone,"" he said. ""Their obvious motive was to go there and steal the contents of the house."" ""The key to solving this case was citizens' tips,"" he said. The men knew Taylor lived at the house, said Parker, who added that additional arrests were possible. A police official told CNN that officers are investigating whether one or more of the suspects knew members of Taylor's family. At 1:45 a.m. Monday, Taylor's girlfriend, Jackie Garcia, called 911 and said someone had been shot. Authorities have said she told police she was hiding under the bedding during the attack. Garcia did not see what happened and could not provide a suspect description, Parker told reporters Wednesday. Police said that Garcia and Taylor were awakened by noise in the living room, and that Taylor got up and locked the bedroom door. The door was kicked in and two shots were fired, one striking Taylor in the leg. Garcia tried to call 911, and failing that, used her cell phone instead, police said. There was no evidence the line had been cut, Parker said Wednesday. A break-in was also reported eight days earlier, Miami-Dade police said. A police report said someone forced a window open and left a kitchen knife on a bed. Several drawers and a bedroom safe were searched during the break-in, according to the report. Taylor was home unexpectedly because of an injury, his former attorney, Richard Sharpstein, told reporters Tuesday. ""I think he was surprised, or they were surprised to find him there,"" he said. Taylor spent four years with the Washington Redskins, but had been out with a sprained right knee. He did not play in Sunday's game against Tampa Bay. Taylor was a first-round pick in the 2004 draft, according to his team's Web site. He played at the University of Miami, where he was an All-American in 2003, and was also a high school standout in the city. Dubbing him ""the prototype NFL free safety,"" the Redskins credited Taylor's team-leading tackling prowess. He was regarded as one of the hardest-hitting players in the league. During his brief career, Taylor recorded 306 tackles (248 solo), two sacks and 12 interceptions. E-mail to a friend .

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods is dealing with a back injury and doesn't know if he'll be able to play at the Masters next month. He may not be the only multiple major winner from the U.S. struggling to be ready for Augusta. Phil Mickelson -- a three-time Masters winner -- pulled out of the Valero Texas Open on Saturday after sustaining a pulled muscle. He got through half of his third round but then stopped. The Golf Channel said he injured his right side. Mickelson earlier this year skipped the Farmers Insurance Open with a back complaint. ""My back's feeling great, my body's been feeling great,"" Mickelson said in a statement posted on the PGA's website. ""I felt as good as I have all year. My speed is back, I was hitting the ball hard, driving it great. ""I pulled a muscle on my downswing trying to hit the ball hard on the (first hole -- his 10th). It just killed and it wouldn't subside for 10 or 12 seconds. ""I'm going to go back to San Diego for a couple of days and have a doctor take a look at it but there's really not much you can do for a pulled muscle. I hope I'll be OK to play the (Shell Houston Open) but I just don't know."" Mickelson barely made the cut at the Texas Open. ""As you might imagine, he's trying to get ready for Augusta, he's hitting a lot of drivers, hitting them harder,"" his caddie, Jim Mackay, told the Golf Channel. ""He hit one off the first tee, his 10th hole today and just felt a little pain in his side. ""It continued on for a few minutes and he just decided that he didn't want to take anything to chance relative to what's going on the next couple weeks.""","Phil Mickelson withdraws from the Texas Open midway into his third round .

"(CNN) -- The show will go on. Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus will return to the ring Thursday for its first show since an accident sent nine performers to the hospital. ""I know all of our performers are looking forward to having a smiling audience in those seats this evening,"" said Steve Payne, circus spokesman. On Sunday, during a show in Providence, Rhode Island, eight performers plummeted to the ground when a hair-hang apparatus -- which holds performers by their hair -- failed. Another performer was injured on the ground. The accident was caused by a 5-inch D-ring that snapped, according to the lead investigator for the city's fire department. Payne said that an investigation is ongoing and that all the carabiners linked to the incident were replaced as a precaution. Among the performers who remain in the hospital, three are still in serious condition, the spokesman said. Thursday's show will be in Hartford, Connecticut. It will not include the hair-hanging display, also known as the human chandelier.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A Moroccan court sentenced a Moroccan man to 20 years in prison for his role in the Madrid train bombings of 2004, in a case built on evidence from Spanish police, a Spanish court spokeswoman said Friday. Abdelilah Hriz (left) is escorted to the anti-terrorist court in Sale, near the Moroccan capital, Rabat. The sentence against Abdelilah Hriz was announced late Thursday. Hriz, in his early 30s, was arrested in Morocco last January on a Spanish warrant for participation in the attacks that killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 on Madrid commuter trains. He was convicted of ""constituting a criminal group to carry out a terrorist act"" and ""complicity in the destruction of transport systems"" and ""participating in the premeditated assault,"" said the spokeswoman for Spain's National Court in Madrid. Morocco and Spain do not have an extradition treaty and it is believed to be a rare instance in which Morocco tried one of its nationals for a crime committed abroad, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. The main trial of the train bombing defendants was held in 2007 at the National Court in Madrid, resulting in numerous convictions. Spain's Supreme Court last summer ruled on appeals, which left a total of 18 convictions, including 14 Islamic militants and four Spaniards, the latter for trafficking in explosives used in the attacks. But Spanish authorities have long said that a few suspects remained at large, and Hriz was one of them. Spain has sought Hriz since 2005, after DNA tests indicated he had been present at a rural home near Madrid where authorities say the bombs were assembled, and at a suburban Madrid apartment where seven suspected terrorists blew themselves up, three weeks after the attacks as police closed in on their hideout. Spanish news reports said Hriz admitted that he had been in Spain from October 2003 to March 2004 but that he denied the charges against him in court in Sale, Morocco, near the capital, Rabat. The Moroccan prosecution sought life in prison against Hriz, Spanish media reported, but the court decided on a sentence of 20 years. Spain's National Court expressed ""satisfaction"" at Morocco's ""complete collaboration"" in the case, the spokeswoman said. The cooperation included a visit to Morocco by Spain's main investigating magistrate for the train bombings.","Abdelilah Hriz arrested in Morocco last January on a Spanish warrant .

"(CNN) -- Tom Braden, the creator and co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire,"" which pioneered the talk-show format that pitted a conservative against a liberal, died Friday at age 92. Tom Braden died Friday at age 92 of natural causes at his home in Denver, Colorado. Daughter Susan Braden said he died of natural causes at his home in Denver, Colorado. In 1982, Braden took ""Crossfire"" to CNN from a local station in Washington and served as the program's host ""from the left"" until 1989. ""Many people believe that Tom created the genre of political talk shows and debate programs that has now been copied and copied and copied,"" said Sam Feist, CNN's political director and senior executive producer of political programming. ""He was a giant of a man and one of the most decent human beings you'd ever want to meet. CNN was a better place because Tom Braden worked here."" Born in Greene, Iowa, Braden graduated from Dartmouth in spring 1940, when the Germans overran France. He volunteered to join the British army, said his good friend and conservative sparring partner, Pat Buchanan. After fighting in the African desert, Braden joined the U.S. Office of Strategic Services when the United States joined the fight, then joined the CIA, Buchanan said. Braden tried his hand at politics, running for lieutenant governor of California in 1966, when he lost in a Democratic primary. He and Bobby Kennedy ""were real buddies,"" Buchanan said. Braden decided to become a journalist at the suggestion of the poet Robert Frost, Susan Braden said. In 1975, he wrote the best-selling book, ""Eight is Enough,"" about his eight children, which was made into a television sitcom that starred a crusty political columnist named Tom Bradford. In 1977, he was co-hosting a Washington radio show called ""Confrontation,"" a format that caught on quickly, Buchanan said. ""We took over afternoon drive,"" the former GOP presidential candidate said. ""Braden and I would interrogate people, and we'd go at it 'til all hours."" Their show caught the attention of a local television station and then caught the attention of CNN's first president, Reese Schonfeld, who hired them to appear late at night on the fledgling cable channel, Buchanan said. ""We'd go out and have dinner and a few drinks and come back at 10 or 10:30 and start preparing for the 11:30 show,"" Buchanan said. ""We'd have to yell to people to shut up in the newsroom."" Braden played the establishment liberal -- a Rockefeller, Kennedy man, and Buchanan played the Goldwater, Nixon man. ""He was a cantankerous character,"" Buchanan said. ""He really didn't like conservatives, especially the new breed. It made for great chemistry and opposition."" But the dislike didn't get personal. ""He would laugh at something that was at his expense if it was a good line. That's what you need in the show. An appreciation if the other guy scores a good point."" Once, they both found themselves interviewing a man representing the Ku Klux Klan. ""He had on his hat and everything and he was sitting there with his arms folded,"" said Buchanan, who introduced the guest to the audience. ""So Tom Braden starts off and says, 'What the hell are you doing in this getup?' ""The guy said, 'Your producer told me to wear it.' It was ratings month. It was like that in the early days. It was wild, crazy stuff. But the ratings were tremendous."" So good that, after six months, the duo's show was moved up to 7:30 p.m., a half-hour after they finished their three-hour radio show, he said. ""We'd get in our cars, race to CNN, put powder on our faces, sit in the chair and start going after somebody,"" he said. Braden stuck to his guns, Buchanan said, citing an interview with Cal Thomas, the columnist. ""Cal accused him of writing, I think, for a pornographic magazine, and Braden hadn't written for them, but had been interviewed by them. ""Braden says, 'You're going to apologize to me or I'm walking off the show.' And Cal didn't apologize, and Braden walked off his own show. It was a very funny moment. ""I immediately said, 'We're going to have to go to break here.' "" After the break, Braden returned. ""Fortunately, it was taped,"" Buchanan said. ""It was the most important part of his life,"" Susan Braden said of her father's years at CNN. ""It was his life, it was what he did. He was a part of something, the beginning of something."" She said that, despite their philosophical differences, ""he and Pat Buchanan actually liked each other."" Braden left the show in 1989. ""I think he left because CNN thought it was time for a change and to bring in a newer, younger adversary,"" Buchanan said. ""The truth is, I opposed Tom's leaving at the time."" Funeral arrangements had not been made Friday, but Braden is to be buried in Dubuque, Iowa, Susan Braden said.","Tom Braden was the creator and co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire""

"(CNN) -- News of Angelina Jolie's decision to undergo a prophylactic double mastectomy has instantly increased awareness of hereditary forms of cancer caused by mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. While the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were discovered in the mid-1990s, genetic testing for the genes is increasingly available. Jolie's case highlights the importance of knowing one's family history and learning one's cancer risks in order to address them proactively. Everyone has the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. We have two copies of each gene and get one each from our mother and father. They play a role in protecting the body against the development of cancer. Individuals with mutations in either of these genes have increased cancer risks, most notably for breast and ovarian cancer. Individuals with mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 benefit from tailored management aimed at reducing cancer risks and detecting cancers early when they are most treatable. Genetic counselors and other health care providers can help determine if testing is appropriate and who in the family should undergo testing first. In addition, it is important to provide educational and anticipatory guidance on the impact and implications of genetic test results. Five reasons we love Angelina Jolie . Here are some common questions that our team is asked regarding genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer: . What is BRCA testing? BRCA testing is a genetic test that looks at the sequence or code of the BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 genes. Changes or mutations in the genetic code indicate increased cancer risks. The test can be performed on a blood or saliva sample. It takes about three weeks to get results. What does a positive result mean? A positive test result in BRCA1 or BRCA2 means that the person has a genetic mutation that increases cancer risk. A positive BRCA1 result gives a woman a 60% to 80% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 30% to 45% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. A positive BRCA2 result gives a woman a 50% to 70% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 10% to 20% lifetime risk of ovarian cancer. Opinion: When removing breast is not the answer . BRCA1 and BRCA2 are also associated with other moderately increased cancer risks that vary, depending on which gene has a mutation. For example, BRCA2 mutations are also associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer and male breast cancer. Does everyone need to be tested? If not, who should be? Only about 5% of breast cancers and 10% to 15% of ovarian cancers are caused by mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Therefore, not everyone needs to undergo genetic testing. Genetic counselors and other health care providers can help determine whether genetic testing is appropriate by exploring one's personal and family history of cancer and other factors such as ethnicity, as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are more common in certain populations. How much is BRCA testing, and does insurance cover it? BRCA testing is usually covered by insurance if certain criteria are met. There are different types of BRCA testing, ranging in cost from $475 to about $4,000. Genetic counselors are helpful in determining what type of testing is indicated. Testing is less expensive once a mutation has been identified within a family. Who should get genetic counseling? Individuals with a personal or family history of breast cancer appearing before age 50, ovarian cancer at any age, breast cancer in both breasts, male breast cancer, multiple cases of breast cancer within a family, and breast cancer in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry should get genetic counseling to determine whether they should be tested. When should I be tested? In addition to determining if BRCA testing is appropriate for you or your family, your health care providers can help you consider when to undergo genetic testing. Why more women are choosing double mastectomies . It is important to consider when medical management might be changed for individuals with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, as this can guide the decision of when to test. For example, breast cancer screening typically starts at age 25 for women with mutations. Since BRCA mutations are not associated with pediatric cancer risks, testing for children is not recommended. What factors should I weigh in deciding whether to have a preventive mastectomy or oophorectomy (ovary removal)? Detailed discussions with genetics experts, surgical oncologists, plastic surgeons and genetic counselors are important steps in considering whether and when a prophylactic mastectomy or oophorectomy is right for you. While the lifetime risk for breast and ovarian cancers in BRCA carriers are high, the risks increase with age. Considering the risk of breast or ovarian cancer based on age can be helpful in timing these interventions. Since breast cancer screening is good at picking up breast cancers early, when they are most treatable, screening is a reasonable option for carriers. Since ovarian cancer screening has not been proven reliably to catch ovarian cancers early, risk-reducing oophorectomy is recommended for BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, ideally between the ages of 35 and 40. Should I test my breasts?","Everyone has BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes; a mutation can show increased cancer risk .
Not everyone needs to be tested for the gene mutation .
Genetic counselors and other providers can help determine whether to test and when ."
"(CNN) -- In this era of ever-accelerating technological development, we all tend to be so fixated on the gizmos of the future that we rarely take the time to think about the glorious technology of the past. Fortunately, a treasure trove of rarities, oddities and tech ""firsts"" has been brought together -- including an experimental 17th century mechanical calculator, a hundred-year-old telephone and an incredibly rare, headline-grabbing Apple 1 computer -- to be sold at auction Saturday in Cologne, Germany. While they may look dated today, the objects gathered by Auction Team Breker trace an evolution of technological thinking that stretches from the dawn of the industrial revolution through to the present day. It is a story of cutting edge tinkering; an inventors' hall of fame. Basking in the limelight at the auction will be one of just six surviving functional Apple 1 computers -- a tech superstar which is likely to sell for a small fortune -- an estimated $400,000 -- propelled by bids from collectors, museums and Macolytes. The Apple 1 was the first computer built by the California technology company. The computer was hand-assembled by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, who, according to legend, financed the device's construction by selling his HP-65 calculator (co-founder Steve Jobs also sold his VW campervan). Approximately 200 of the devices were made, of which fewer than 50 are thought to remain -- and only six in working order. Company founder Uwe Breker said the sale is ""unique in presenting masterpieces from the spectrum of antique technology, from the 17th century to the 21st."" Long before the current era of computers, the inventor Blaise Pascal designed a mechanical calculator in 1642 -- regarded by many as the first decisive step toward modern microprocessors. The ""Pascaline"" was operated with a stylus to turn digit-wheels. These wheels connected to a ""display"" on the top of the device which showed the result after each equation. A sliding rule could be shifted to change the function of the device from addition to subtraction. Multiplication and division were also possible (though very difficult to execute). The Pascaline was a significant breakthrough at the time of its invention, demonstrating, as it did, how complex arithmetic could be carried out by a machine. Its introduction led to the development of mechanical calculators across Europe. Only a handful of the original Pascaline machines still exist today -- most of which are held in museums. At auction Saturday will be a 20th-century reproduction, valued between $30,000 and $50,000. Alongside the Apple 1 and the Pascaline will be an original Apple Lisa, one of the earliest computers to feature a graphical interface and mouse -- technologies which paved the way for desktop computing as we know it today. The Lisa was a commercial failure, in part due to its inordinately high price. Retailing at $10,000, it was significantly more expensive than rival IBM PCs. Apple, for its part, owes much of its success to some of the early pioneering personal computers such as the SCELBI-8H -- a kit computer which was released in 1973. Its 8-bit Intel microprocessor was incredibly powerful at the time (though only a tiny fraction of contemporary processor power). Just 200 or so SCELBI-8Hs were made, making them quite valuable. The SCELBI-8H up for auction tomorrow is expected to go for $20,000 to $25,000. As well as early artefacts from computing's prehistory, the auction will feature a number of historical typewriters. A patent was lodged by Henry Mill for a typing device as early as 1714, but typewriters didn't go into mass production until the 1860s. Today it is difficult to see them as anything but antiquated, yet the invention of typewriters caused a revolution in writing. A range of early typewriters will be sold, including an extremely rare 1895 Ford typewriter with a filigree copper grille valued between $13,000 and $20,000, an 1879 Crandall with gold-gilt highlights and mother-of-pearl inlay, and a rather more functional-looking 1994 Crown, with an unusual keyless design, which is expected to fetch between $11,000 and $15,000. Another ""first"" to go under the hammer is a portable copying press devised by the legendary Scottish inventor of the steam-engine, James Watt. The laptop-sized invention allowed multiple copies of a document to be produced, something like a photocopier, with ink transferred from the original to moistened copying paper below via a pressure plate. The portable device was said to be a favourite of U.S. president Thomas Jefferson. Of even greater significance to communication was the invention of the telephone in the mid-19th century. From its early experimental incarnations in the workshops of a number of inventors including Alexander Graham Bell, the telephone was in broad use by the beginning of the 20th century. Could Bell have predicted how contemporary telephony, with cell phones, texting and Skype would look today? It's unlikely. But if you fancy picking up the low-tech progenitor of your iPhone 5 you could bid on a 1905 L. M. Ericson & Co desk telephone, known as the ""coffee grinder"" due to its circular shape and unusual lithographed decoration. It is expected to sell for up $13,000.","Rare Apple 1 computer could sell at auction for $400,000 .

"(CNN) -- Our winter blues are about to turn pink! This year's National Cherry Blossom Festival starts in Washington on Thursday. The annual event attracts more than a million people from across the country and abroad. The festival is starting on the first day of spring, as always, but peak bloom is predicted to be later this season because of the brutal winter in the D.C. area. ""We're really excited to welcome spring with all this winter weather,"" said Danielle Davis, a festival spokeswoman. The National Park Service says peak bloom, the day when 70% of the blossoms of the Yoshino cherry trees around the Tidal Basin are open, is forecast to fall between April 8 and 12. The average peak bloom date for the past 21 years has been March 31.

"(CNN) -- The 2011 Arab uprisings presented the United States with a historic opportunity to take a clear stand on the side of freedom and democracy and strengthen its own standing in the process. Incredibly, the Obama administration has blundered and stumbled, with a response marked by timidity and caution. As a result, America appears weaker, less influential and less trusted, while the Arab Middle East continues to seethe with instability and violence. Today, as the Egyptian state shudders, with millions taking to the streets infuriated with a government that is taking the country down a path they do not trust, and as Syrians continue to slaughter each other, with death toll approaching 100,000, there is no side in the conflicts that feels warmly toward America. The most astonishing part is that the uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa were launched by young, progressive idealists, whose objective was to reshape their countries by overthrowing entrenched dictators and bringing pluralism and democracy. The DNA of the revolution made it a natural for American support. Granted, the uprisings also targeted strong American allies, such as Egypt's now-deposed president, Hosni Mubarak. But once the dictator fell, America should have made a much stronger case for the fundamental principles of liberal democracy. It is extraordinary this is happening under Obama, the leader who took the dramatic step of traveling to Cairo just months into his first term and delivering a landmark speech that vowed to end the ""cycle of suspicion and discord"" between Americans and Muslims, and affirmed his belief that all people ""yearn for certain things,"" including freedom, democracy, and genuine justice. When the people took the reins of history into their own hands, Obama's poetry crashed into geopolitical realities, not to mention domestic political considerations. The choices, in fairness, were not easy. But Obama could have done much better. Coup worsens Obama's Egypt policy headache . In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood, a group with a deeply anti-Western, anti-American ideology, won the elections. Washington was right in trying to work with a government that had been elected by the Egyptian people. But it went too far, ignoring the fundamental principles of democracy that America should have kept at the forefront of the agenda. Washington had to work with Cairo -- and hence, with the government of President Mohammed Morsy -- but it didn't have to keep as quiet as it did when Morsy and his supporters started pushing away from democratic principles, undermining freedoms and laying the groundwork for a state that would change the character of the country. The pan-Islamist vision of the Brotherhood is deeply offensive to supporters of equality for women, legal protections for minorities, free media, and respect for the views of the opposition. Instead, in pursuit of stability, the U.S. held its tongue. Occasionally, American officials spoke out, as when the ambassador to Egypt, Anne Patterson, told a small group in Alexandria that ""democracy needs a healthy and active civil society."" But when the government went after that same civil society, arresting and then convicting 43 members of nongovernmental organizations -- including 16 Americans -- and sentencing them to prison terms on sham charges, the U.S. kept its voice low, to the dismay of its friends. The Obama administration has been so timid, so eager to stay out of the fray, that a few weeks before the verdict against the pro-democracy activists, Secretary of State John Kerry passed up the opportunity to take a stand for the workers, and for democracy, by quietly waiving the human rights preconditions of U.S. aid to Egypt and thus allowing $1.3 billion in aid to go forward. There were better ways to play that hand. America threw away its aces. In Syria, the U.S. passed up for too long the opportunity to support the most liberal of rebels fighting against the dictator Bashar al-Assad, allowing extremist radicals to dominate the opposition. Now the choices are far more difficult, and America's standing is in tatters with the people who should have been its natural allies. The oversimplified equation says the country has to choose between its ideals and its interests. But in the case of the Arab uprisings, America's ideals and interests overlap. If Washington stood more convincingly with those who share its ideals, it would strengthen them within their revolutions. It would help them to victory, and then America would become stronger, having real friends in power in the post-revolutionary Middle East. It's not too late for a course correction. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Frida Ghitis.","Frida Ghitis: The Arab uprisings gave the U.S. a historic chance to side with freedom .

"(CNN) -- Barcelona's immediate footballing fortunes may be in some doubt, but the Spanish club's members voted Saturday to approve a proposal aimed at securing its long-term future. Involved in a tense La Liga title race, locked in a Champions League battle with Atletico Madrid, facing a transfer ban due to alleged irregularities involving the signing of youth players, plus a tax investigation over the murky deal to buy Neymar -- it has been a testing season for the Catalan outfit. And the reaction has been one of defiance. Before Saturday's 3-1 win at home to Real Betis, a big flag in the Camp Nou stated ""Don't touch La Masia"" -- a response to FIFA's punishment for infringing transfer rules relating to players under the age of 18. Barca's famed academy has produced a conveyor belt of talent, but the ""Espai Barcai"" proposal is deemed to be just as important to the team's continued success. Some 118,000 members were called to vote after the Betis match in the club's first referendum since 1950, when it was decided to leave the Corts stadium and build a new one -- the Camp Nou. The turnout was not quite that high -- just under a third of the total. More than 27,000 members approved plans for a $725 million revamp that will extend the ground's capacity to 105,000 people and develop the surrounding areas. Just over 9,500 voted against. The project is due to start in 2017 and be completed four years later, including the creation of a 12,000-capacity multi-sports pavilion and 5,000 new parking spaces. ""The members were voting for the future of this club,"" said president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who was appointed after Sandro Rosell stood down in the wake of the Neymar revelations -- the club later paid an extra $18.5 million in taxes after being hit with fraud charges. ""Days like today are when the world sees what FC Barcelona is and means,"" he added. ""The support for the New Espai BarÃ§a proposal has been extraordinary. It's a huge project that will improve the club for years to come."" Saturday's win on the pitch kept Barca a point behind Atletico with six games to play, ahead of Wednesday's second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal at Vicente Calderon, with the score 1-1. Lionel Messi opened the scoring from the penalty spot in the 15th minute after Alexis Sanchez was tripped by Jordi Figueras, who in the second half diverted Adriano's pass into his own net. Substitute Ruben Castro immediately reduced the deficit but Messi netted his 25th league goal this season after his 86th-minute penalty was blocked by goalkeeper Adan. Atletico stayed top with a 1-0 win at home to Villarreal thanks to Raul Garcia's first-half header -- his 16th goal this season. Third-placed Real Madrid remained two points behind Barca following a 4-0 win at Real Sociedad, who stayed sixth. With star player Cristiano Ronaldo injured, record signing Gareth Bale took center stage with an opportunist long-range strike to put Real 2-0 up after Asier Illarramendi's opener. Pepe then volleyed in from fellow defender Sergio Ramos' headed pass, while Angel Di Maria sent substitute Alvaro Morata clear to wrap up a comfortable win ahead of the Champions League trip to Borussia Dortmund, with Real holding a 3-0 advantage. In Italy, Inter Milan's hopes of qualifying for the second-tier Europa League suffered a blow as striker Diego Milito missed a penalty in Saturday's 2-2 draw at home to struggling Bologna. It meant Walter Mazzarri's fifth-placed team have not won for the past four Serie A matches. In France, Paris Saint-Germain guaranteed another season in the Champions League with a 3-0 win at home to Reims which put the Ligue 1 titleholder 16 points clear of second-placed Monaco with six games to play. Uruguay striker Edinson Cavani made up for the absence of injured star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic by opening the scoring just before halftime, while Algerian defender Aissa Mandi netted two own-goals after the break.","Barcelona's members approve plan for $725M redevelopment of Camp Nou stadium .

"(CNN) -- Was it a miracle? Perhaps not. But Saturday's much anticipated Olympic men's hockey showdown between Russia and United States sure was one amazing game. And it was a long one, at that. After 60 minutes of regulation, then after five minutes of overtime, even after the three required shootout attempts for each team, the contest was still all tied up. T.J. Oshie finally broke the ice, notching his fourth goal in the shootout stage -- which happened to be all four of the Americans' shootout goals -- to give his USA squad a 3-2 victory. ""My hands are a little tingling, my feet are tingling,"" Oshie admitted afterward. ""It was pretty nerve-racking out there."" See game-winning goal . His heroics, and that of U.S. goalie Jonathan Quick, capped a tight, hard-fought affair. There wasn't as much at stake compared to the historic 1980 Winter Olympics game in Lake Placid, New York, between the underdog Americans and the Soviet Union (the closest thing to today's Russians). Mike Eruzione's goal lifted the U.S. to victory, setting the stage for their gold medal win. And the loss hardly eliminates the host Russians, which entered the Sochi Games with high hopes, and high pressure, to take home gold. They still have a good shot to reach the quarterfinals, having one preliminary round victory under their belt and another game in this round -- against Slovakia -- to go. As Russian forward Ilya Kovalchuk said, ""Everything is OK. Nothing terrible has happened."" Kovalchuk, who once starred in the NHL but now plays in St. Petersburg in Russia's professional league, even saw positives. ""We played good and showed our character by equalizing the game at the end,"" he said, ""and now we will be getting ready for the future."" Still, the energy in the Bolshoy Ice Dome, the presence of Russian President Vladimir Putin and the intense attention worldwide all suggested that this wasn't just any other game. It helped, too, that both squads are talented, played well and had legitimate shots at winning gold. A report by NHL.com described the sounds of air horns blasting through the arena in what was mostly a pro-Russian crowd. Russian flags and chants of ""Russ-ee-ya"" echoed throughout, according to the report. ""It was loud, crazy, a circus-like environment,"" NHL.com reported. ""It was the Olympics at their finest."" Russia grabbed an early lead, before the Americans responded with a pair of power play goals -- one in the second period, another in the third -- to jump ahead. Then Russia's Pavel Datsyuk of the NHL's Detroit Red Wings netted his second goal of the day to tie the score 2-2. And with just under five minutes to go, Russia appeared to score a go-ahead goal on a blast. But after mulling it over, the referees called off this score because -- before the shot went in -- the net had moved off its moorings, barely. See controversial shot that was disallowed . That set the stage for the five-minute overtime period and, after no one scored then, the shootout. The Americans were on the verge of winning until -- on Russia's third chance -- Kovalchuk got one past Quick, who plays for the Los Angeles Kings. After that, things reset. Unlike in the NHL, where no player can have more than one shot in a shootout, the international rules allow for players (after the first three attempts by each side) to go again and again and again. Oshie -- whose day job is with the NHL's St. Louis Blues -- did just that. He went five more times, beating Russian net minder Sergei Bobrovsky's on three of those attempts. Bobrovsky, who also plays in the NHL for the Columbus Blue Jackets, wasn't as positive afterward as his teammate, Kovalchuk. ""It was a shootout; we wanted more,"" the Russian goalie said. ""It is heartbreaking."" Oshie himself said he felt some pressure,"" but then the puck hits your stick and you start skating. It's just you and the goalie. I was fortunate enough to keep him guessing."" And afterward, Americans had no doubt what they think of Oshie. As one person said on Twitter: ""T.J. Oshie put his country on his back! Unreal."" Showdown was physical and intense .","Team USA beats Russia in a thrilling game, winning 3-2 in a shootout .

"(CNN) -- The man who accused pop star Michael Jackson of molesting his son in 1993 killed himself in his New Jersey condo earlier this month, police said. Evan Chandler, 65, was found by the building's concierge November 5 after a doctor, who was treating him for cancer, said he missed an appointment, the Jersey City, New Jersey, police report said. Chandler was ""extremely ill"" with cancer, the report said. He was working as a dentist in Beverly Hills, California, in 1993 when he said his son, who was 13 at the time, told him that Jackson had molested him. His son revealed it, he said, when he put him under anesthesia to pull a tooth. The Los Angeles County district attorney did not pursue criminal charges against Jackson, but Chandler and his son reached a confidential financial settlement with the singer after filing a lawsuit. Reports at the time said the Chandlers got between $16 million and $20 million from Jackson's insurance company. The Chandler accusation became a key part of the prosecution's case when Jackson was tried and acquitted of molestation a decade later in Santa Barbara County, California. The elder Chandler was found ""on his bed in a lifeless state with a gun in his hand,"" the investigator's report said. ""The victim had a silver revolver in his right hand which was pressed against the right side of his head,"" Officer J.S. Sielski wrote. Chandler, who was estranged from most of his family, owned the .38-caliber pistol he used to kill himself, Jersey City spokesman Stan Eason said. No suicide note was found, Eason added. Chandler's brother -- a lawyer in Santa Barbara County -- told CNN in 2003 that Chandler feared for his life because of threats made by angry Jackson fans. ""There's a hard-core group, there was and probably still is, of fanatical fans who see him as a deity,"" Ray Chandler told CNN's Larry King. ""Some of them will go to any lengths that, you know, there's some who will just go as far as threatening, there's some who will go -- who will be violent, and you know, you never know how far it is going to go."" Ray Chandler has not responded to calls from CNN for comment about his brother's death.","In 1993, Evan Chandler said Michael Jackson had molested son .

"(CNN) -- It was a year ago that 13-year-old Jon Carmichael committed suicide, hanging himself in a barn near his home in Cleburne, Texas. Monday, on the anniversary of his death, his parents, Jon Timothy and Tami Carmichael, filed a $20 million federal lawsuit against several officials at the school Jon attended, alleging they deliberately turned a blind eye to the bullying of their son, prompting his death. In the lawsuit, documents state that staff and students at The Joshua Independent School District observed several explicit acts of bullying, including Jon being thrown into a trash can ""easily a few times a week,"" but did nothing to stop it. ""He was placed upside down in a toilet bowl, and had his head flushed several times, at each occasion. These acts were observed by other students who failed to report the incident,"" the documents said. ""Just prior to his death he was stripped nude, tied up and again placed into a trashcan."" The lawsuit states that event was taped and put on YouTube, but was taken down ""at the direction of an unknown staff member, who also failed to report the incident."" Carmichael family attorney Martin J. Cirkiel said the family's goal in issuing the lawsuit is to educate. ""On the human level, the family wants what every family wants when they come to me in these kind of cases. They want to make sure it doesn't happen to someone else."" Cirkiel said the family would like to see a program developed in their son's name and to be able to open a trust fund for kids who need it who are being bullied. ""They want to increase planning and education,"" he said. Joshua Independent School District Superintendent Ray Dane said he hadn't seen the lawsuit and could not comment, but that the school has had teaching mechanisms on bullying in place for at least the duration of his 12-year tenure there. ""We do what we can to train and remind students and staff that bullying is something we always have to be aware of,"" he said. ""We've even got a student-led program where students lead other students about bullying and teaching them about our differences."" Additionally, the district has implemented a new anonymous reporting system called ""Talk About It"" -- a way for secondary students to report bullying without feeling pressure to attach their names. The program began last year at the middle school and expanded to the high school this year, Dane said. The lawsuit acknowledges the school's rules of conduct but says it failed. ""Even though the district ostensibly had a policy in place to deal with known incidents of bullying and harassment, school district personnel clearly had an actual practice and custom of looking the other way,"" it states. Dane said the climate in the Joshua school halls is overall very positive and sensitive to bullying issues. ""I would say that we've never had many reports of bullying in the school system. Are people more aware? Yes, because we're trying to make people more aware about the issue and being sensitive. Being kind to each other and doing things that one would expect them to."" Cirkiel said the Carmichaels had a memorial ceremony Monday for their son. ""They want their son's life and death to have meaning,"" Cirkiel said. CNN's Aaron Cooper contributed to this report.","13-year-old Jon Carmichael committed suicide in Texas last year .

"(CNN) -- World number one's Rafael Nadal and Serena Williams continued their successful title defenses in Madrid Thursday but the Spanish capital again proved a less than happy hunting ground for Wimbledon champion Andy Murray. His 2014 travails continued with a 6-3 6-2 defeat to in-form Colombian Santiago Giraldo in the third round, extending his poor record at the Caja Magica since the tournament switched from hard courts to clay in 2009. Murray scored an impressive victory over Spain's Nicolas Almagro the previous evening, but he never looked set to stage a repeat against Giraldo. The British No.1 has slipped to eighth in the rankings after undergoing back surgery in the autumn of 2013 and his match against Almagro was his first in a month. Murray is also without a coach following the end of his relationship with Ivan Lendl, but even at his best might have struggled to cope with Giraldo, who reached the final in Barcelona two weeks ago. ""It's tough because some days just now I'm playing well and then the next day I'm not playing well at all,"" Murray told gathered reporters after his defeat. ""Even within matches I'm playing really well for periods and then other times not great at all. ""I need to become more consistent,"" he added. After losing the opener, Murray had a break point on his opponent's service in the second set but squandered the opportunity before sliding to defeat. In seven tournaments this year, Murray has failed to reach a final and admitted he was struggling to find answers. ""I'm not 100 percent sure what it is, but I need to sit down and think about that over the next couple of days and see what I need to do."" Giraldo will play Spain's Roberto Bautista Agut in the last eight. Earlier, Nadal, looking to get back to his invincible best after defeats David Ferrer and Almagro in the quarterfinals in Monte Carlo and Barcelona, dispatched Finn Jarkko Nieminen 6-1 6-4. Nadal saw his 3-1 lead in the second set disappear, but he reasserted his control to go through in some style. ""During the first hour I played better than yesterday, more dynamically and with more intensity,"" Nadal told the official ATP Tour website. ""I was defending properly and knowing what was happening in every single moment. Perhaps that's something I wasn't able to do in recent weeks,"" he added. Nadal will next face sixth seed Tomas Berdych, who had to battle past Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov 3-6 6-3 6-2 in one hour and 50 minutes. It was his first win in three meetings with Dimitrov, the turning point in the second set when he broke him for the first of three times. ""Grigor started really well. He was serving exceptionally well, playing aggressively and I couldn't find a way to get into his service games,"" said Berdych. ""But, finally, I took my first break point in the second set and from that point things changed quite dramatically. I was happy with the way I handled the match and how I played."" Barcelona winner, 10th seed Kei Nishikori also advanced to the last eight with a 7-6 7-6 win over Milos Raonic of Canada. The Japanese star came from 2-5 down in the first set to win the opening tiebreak and set him on his way to a crucial victory. ""I'm playing well and feeling very confident,"" said the 24-year-old. In the WTA event at the same venue, top-ranked Williams overcame problems on her own service in beating Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro 6-2 6-3 in search of a third straight title in Madrid. Williams was broken twice in her opening three service games, but Suarez Navarro was unable to hold on her own delivery. It was the same in the second set, with Williams broken twice more but she held on to set up a meeting with Petra Kvitova in the last eight. Kvitova beat fellow Czech Lucie Safarova 6-4 6-3, while second seed Li Na had a more testing morning as she came from a set down to beat 16th seed Sloane Stephens of the United States 2-6 6-3 6-2. Australian Open champion Li will now face Maria Sharapova for a place in the semifinals after the Russian continued her superb recent form on clay with a 6-4 6-3 win over Australian Samantha Stosur. Former French Open champion Sharapova is coming off a title success in Stuttgart and used her serve effectively to see off Stosur.","Rafael Nadal reaches quarterfinal of Madrid Open .

"(CNN) -- Juan Manuel Santos was sworn in Saturday as Colombia's new president, vowing to unify his country around the goals of prosperity for all and of thwarting the nation's leftist rebels. ""It is possible to have a peaceful Colombia, a Colombia with no guerrillas, and we will prove that by reason or by force,"" Santos said in Bogota in his first televised remarks as head of state. ""As long as they don't free the hostages, as long as they perpetrate terrorist acts, as long as they don't return children recruited by force, as long as they keep on planting mines and polluting the Colombian countryside, we will keep on battling those who commit violence, without exception, by any means available,"" he said. Earlier in his speech, Santos vowed to ""preside over a government of national unity."" ""The priority, the obsession of my government, will be to generate prosperity for society through the creation of jobs,"" he said. In an early test of Santos' diplomatic skills, his inauguration was attended by the foreign minister of Venezuela, which is at odds with Colombia over accusations that Colombian rebels have found refuge in Venezuela. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro said he wanted to deliver a positive message from President Hugo Chavez. ""We would like to deliver -- that's what President Hugo Chavez specifically indicated -- a message of love and solidarity to all of the people of Colombia; a message for the future and for hope,"" Maduro said. ""We would like to reach out with our loving hand, of friendship and of fraternity to all of the people of Colombia."" In a speech later on Saturday, Chavez said that Maduro will meet with his Colombian counterpart in Bogota on Sunday. Chavez also said that he wants to meet with Santos. ""I invited Santos to go to Caracas,"" Chavez said, referring to Venezuela's capital. ""If he can't come, I'll go to Bogota."" ""But I am telling you,"" Chavez said at another point in the speech, ""the first disrespect to Venezuela, the first false accusation, and everything will be over."" Santos was elected president of Colombia in June with the highest vote total in his country's history, garnering more than 9 million ballots, roughly 70 percent of the electorate. He ran as a conservative promising to improve Colombia's security. Some of the strongest strikes against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, came under Santos' leadership as minister of defense, including the high-profile hostage rescue of former presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt in 2008. ""We have been tough on terrorism and we will be even tougher now,"" Santos said at a victory celebration in June. Venezuela broke off diplomatic ties with Colombia last month after Colombian officials said they had photographic evidence of guerrilla camps in Venezuela. But on Friday, Chavez said he hoped to offer more details about relations with Colombia in the coming days, according to state media. ""We are very optimistic. We must move forward,"" Chavez said, according to the state-run Agencia Venezolana de Noticias.","NEW: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez wants to meet with new Colombian president .

"(CNN) -- Some off-duty public safety workers ended up with an unusual catch when they went fishing off the coast of Florida Saturday morning. They found a man and woman splashing in the water 7 miles from shore who said they'd spent the last 14 hours treading water, the Broward County Sheriff's Department said. Sean McGovern, 50, and Mellisa Morris, 52, said they'd fallen off their boat in Key Largo about 6 p.m. Friday. The boat was in gear, and they watched it pull away from them, the sheriff's department said. ""They are very lucky â€” they didn't have any signal device,"" said U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Mark Barney. ""They were trying to signal people down with their T-shirt. To be located and recovered by off-duty cops and a firefighter â€” that's a stroke of luck right there."" About 8 a.m. Saturday, two Broward sheriff's office detectives, a Broward firefighter and one of the men's father-in-law noticed splashing in the water from their boat, the sheriff's department said. ""We saw birds diving,"" said Adam Lee, a detective. ""As we got closer, I saw fish jumping. We saw a white male with his shirt flagging us down."" The men pulled McGovern and Morris onto the boat. They were exhausted after drifting 10 nautical miles and appeared to have mild hypothermia and jellyfish stings, the sheriff's department said. ""We checked them out, made sure they were stable,"" Lee said. The fishermen passed them over to the Coast Guard, which carried them to the Fort Lauderdale Coast Guard Station. Friends picked them up there. ""A lot of people don't wear life jackets because they don't have intention of being in water,"" Barney said.

"(CNN) -- We've all done things in our past we might prefer the general public not talk about, but only the lucky few get to be the targets of whole industries dedicated to digging those things up. Targets like celebrities. Politicians. And apparently CEOs, that is if the abrupt resignation of Mozilla's new chief Brendan Eich is any indication. For many, the story of Eich -- who stepped down this week amid criticism of his contribution to a 2008 initiative to ban same-sex marriage-- is one of freedom of speech trampled by the intolerant. I don't see it that way. Don't get me wrong; to paraphrase Voltaire, I disagree with Eich's views on marriage equality but will defend to the death his First Amendment right to express them. But as I've written in the past, the First Amendment doesn't protect him, Mozilla, or anyone else from others' using their First Amendment right to signal their disapproval. To me, Eich's case is about the power of information, and how -- with technology, 24-hour news and social media- -everyone's past is just a hashtag away from being the present. Sometimes this is a good thing for the public, like the digging up of David Duke's KKK past as he attempted to climb the political ladder. Sometimes the information is significant, but used mainly to score points against a political opponent, as in the GOP's escalation of the Bill Clinton-Monica Lewinsky saga. But more often than not it's about gossip to sell magazines or get clicks on a website. NeNe Leakes, one of the stars of ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta,"" for example, is currently trying to explain why a 20-year-old mug shot of her is on the cover of Star Magazine. The Robertson family members, of Duck Dynasty fame, were exposed as frauds after photos of the clan looking less like down-home folks and more like a J.Crew ad began circulating on the Internet. The more notable a person is the riskier the strategy of distancing him or herself from the past in hopes that it just goes away. Did Mozilla even think about this? To Eich's credit, he has stuck with his position on same-sex marriage despite a torrent of complaint from inside and outside his company. That the company didn't anticipate the backlash is the real head-scratcher. Six years ago, when Eich donated to an anti-marriage equality initiative, less than 40% of Americans favored marriage for same-sex couples. Today 54% do, including nearly 70% of people ages 18-29. That latter number is particularly important to Mozilla because 1) no group goes online more than millennials, 2) no group supports marriage equality more than millennials, and 3) millennials are a significant portion of current and future employees. The Eich fallout is less about the First Amendment and more about a business not understanding its business. The country's present attitude regarding same-sex marriage is not top secret. And neither is Eich's past. Mozilla should've had a better strategy than ""let's hope nobody notices."" Yet the fact that the board caved to the pressure, instead of standing behind its choice, suggested it was completely blindsided by the uproar. This is mind-boggling considering that the controversies surrounding Chick-fil-A and Paula Deen did not happen in an alternate universe. By all accounts Eich, who helped develop some of the Web's most important technologies, was qualified for the job and Mozilla would likely be hurt by his resignation. But Mozilla is an activist organization more than a money-making corporation. The Apples and Googles of the world can lure top young talent with money and perks. Mozilla's recruiting success depends on its ability to sell its mission. Thus the effectiveness of the CEO rests heavily on his or her ability to foster a community, not just make a buck. And generally speaking, discrimination is a community buzzkill. Still, the company's leadership, not Eich, is to blame for this PR nightmare, They're the ones who thought what happened in 2008 stays in 2008.","LZ: Mozilla CEO resigned after firestorm over 2008 donation to anti-same-sex marriage Prop 8 .

"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Michele Trobaugh regrets the day she heard a radio advertisement for Dr. Jan Adams. Beverly Hills plastic surgeon Jan Adams operated on the mother of rapper Kanye West the day before she died. Eager to fix breasts that weren't the same size and a rash that occurred where her breasts rubbed against her stomach, Trobaugh, then 28, went to see Adams in his office in Huntington Beach, California. She says she trusted him right away. ""I fell for his charm. I fell for his confidence,"" she says. But her surgery turned out to be a ""nightmare,"" she says. Trobaugh says that in March 2006, Adams gave her a breast augmentation, tummy tuck and liposuction -- all at one time. ""The next day I woke up fighting for every breath. It was like an elephant was sitting on my chest,"" she says. ""And when I got up to go the restroom I noticed the girdle I was wearing was soaked with fluid and blood. For days I was soaking through blankets and towels."" Trobaugh says she had three infections. She had a second surgery a few weeks later to remove fluid from her hips. Questions surrounding the death of another of Adams' patients, Donda West, mother of rapper Kanye West, have reignited Trobaugh's pain, she says. She has not sued Adams but says she may in the future. Asked to respond to Trobaugh's comments, Adams issued a statement through his publicist, Kevin Williams. ""I believe very strongly in the fundamental American principle of the right of the individual to defend himself,"" the statement said. ""Recently inaccurate and, frankly, false statements have ciruculated that require clarification. Unfortunately, it has become impossible to separate thsese statements from other professional issues. I will await my turn."" Today, Trobaugh has advice on how others can avoid becoming plastic surgery victims, and so do board-certified plastic surgeons. Make sure the surgeon is board-certified . This one, say experts, is a no-brainer. For plastic surgery, you want a doctor who's certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery. It's simple: The American Board of Medical Specialties' Web site will tell you if a doctor is board-certified in plastic surgery. Why is it so important to have a board-certified surgeon? Because legally any doctor is permitted to do any procedure -- a psychiatrist could do a breast augmentation. If you use a board-certified plastic surgeon, you know he or she has completed three to five years of training in general surgery and a minimum of two to three years of training in plastic surgery, plus they have to take written and oral tests, according to Dr. Jim Stuzin, chairman-elect of the American Board of Plastic Surgery and assistant clinical professor at the University of Miami. Board-certified plastic surgeons also have to do continuing medical education and take a written test every 10 years. Check the surgeon's record . Trobaugh says she never would have gone to Adams if she'd known he had two malpractice judgments against him. She could have found that out easily by going to the Medical Board of California's Web site. Links to the Web sites of every state's medical board can be found here. Many state licensing boards, like California's, list malpractice judgments, plus any disciplinary actions by the board. (Since Trobaugh's surgery, Adams has had a third malpractice judgment against him, plus an accusation filed with the board). Ask if the surgeon has hospital privileges . Even if you're having a plastic surgery procedure at an outpatient clinic, it's worth asking where the doctor has hospital privileges, because hospitals do background checks, says Dr. Rod Rohrich, past president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. ""If they don't have hospital privileges, that's a huge red flag,"" he says. Come armed with questions for the doctor . One crucial question for your potential surgeon is how often he or she does the procedure you're interested in. ""If I'm coming to you for a facelift, you'd better do it almost weekly,"" says Rohrich, who's also chairman of the department of plastic surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. The Arizona Medical Board's Web site has a list of questions you can print out and bring with you to the doctor's office. For example, the medical board suggests asking whether the physician will be performing the procedure in its entirety. Be wary of multiple procedures . Trobaugh says when she went to Adams, he suggested three procedures. ""When you bundle procedures, the risk goes up,"" says Stuzin, the plastic surgeon in Miami. The more procedures you have, the more money the doctor makes. Dr. Grant Carlson, a plastic surgeon at Emory University School of Medicine, says an unethical surgeon might suggest a neck lift when someone has come in looking for just for a nose job. ""Unfortunately, money is a motivation in some people."" Perhaps the most valuable advice, Trobaugh says, is to be swayed only by objective information about the surgeon, and not by how the doctor makes you feel. ""[Adams] truly sounded like he was going to help me. He seemed like he would be truly concerned about me,"" she says. But Trobaugh says that when things didn't go well after her surgery, she was taken aback by Adams' response. ""I told him, 'I can't put my right arm down -- there's a huge lump under my arm.' I was crying,"" she says. She says he told her to take her medicine and rest and give herself time to heal. More than a year and a half after her surgery, Trobaugh says her stomach is ""concave,"" she has shooting pains in her breasts, and her ""nipples are uneven and in the wrong place."" Trobaugh says she wishes she had taken a friend or relative with her to her pre-surgical appointments with Adams. ""An aunt or my mother or some other strong female in my life might have picked up on things I didn't pick up on, or thought of questions I didn't think of,"" she says. ""And there are no stupid questions when you're about to alter yourself in some major way."" E-mail to a friend . Elizabeth Cohen is a correspondent with CNN Medical News.

"(CNN) -- It's been 25 years since I last heard my mother's voice. Jean was home in New Orleans, fretting about the ingredients for her jambalaya, preparing a big tossed green salad. I'll never forget her. The look she would give me simply to shut up, or how she raised her hand, signaling it was time to stop playing around. The sound of her small feet walking toward the back of the house, then her waking us up in the order of our birth: Cheryl, Sheila, Donna, Teddy, Chet, Lisa, Demetria, Kevin and Zeola. When she called, we had to start moving. Right then or else. My mom passed away when I was in my 20s, but she's still with me today. How could I forget her, when every day I'm reminded of her loving spirit, her decency, her humor, her optimism, her generous spirit -- and those rules? My mom was born and died at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. Appropriate -- because she was a living embodiment of charity. Despite having nine children, my mother always had some spare food or clothing or -- whatever -- for any child in the neighborhood in need. She taught us how to share, how not to waste anything, how to think about others who had even less than we did. That's why I have to think constantly of ways to give back. She was a friend and confidante to everyone, and a keeper of secrets. She was an optimist. I don't think she knew how to complain. Jean wanted everybody to be happy. (My oldest sister, Cheryl, started calling her ""Jean,"" and it stuck.) One weekend, I came home from college and told my mom about a roommate who had a difficult time going back home to rural Louisiana. Jean said to invite her to our house. I asked where would she sleep, and my mom answered with her big smile, ""There's enough room for everyone if they just scoot over and make space for others."" Jean made room for others. She had to. She came from a family of seven, and my dad, Lionel, was from a family of 12. Everyone was welcome, anytime -- but they had to bring their own beer. (The Kenner Grocery Store, behind the train tracks on the corner, was open late.) Food was plentiful. Jean cooked like she lived -- with largesse.

After our meals and once we removed the throw rugs and put the furniture against the wall, we had a dance floor. My brother Teddy Man and I did the James Brown moves; our cousin Gale did the funky chicken better than anyone on the block. The older kids showed off their fancy footwork, doing the Popeyes or Four Corners. Soon the adults took over. That's when I learned how to really dance. Jean told us, ""Straighten up your backs, never bend over. Raise up your arms like a bird in the sky and sway those hips from side to side."" After a while, I realized my Mom was also getting us to work off some of the good food. My mom led by example: Step up, speak up, be dignified, be respectful -- and be tolerant of others. Her rules have sustained me, guided me and inspired me. I share them with my nieces and nephews -- many of them never met their Maw-Maw, as Janika, her oldest grandchild, referred to her. Here are 10 of Jean's rules: . 1. Don't you ever talk back to grown folks. 2. If you make a mess, clean it up. 3. Don't expect others to do for you what you're not willing to do for yourself. 4. Get up and go to work. If you want it bad enough, earn it. 5. Watch what you say. 6. If you have something to give, then go ahead and share it. 7. Never go to a party before eating at home. You'll regret it later. 8. If you lie, you steal. If you steal, you kill. So always tell the truth. And if you're wrong, ask for forgiveness. 9. Have faith in God. Prayers work. 10. Nobody has all the answers, so if you get lost, ask for help. I last talked with Jean the day before her death. She wasn't feeling well. She was tired. My sister Sheila told her to take the day off from work. A day later, Jean went to the emergency room and never came home again. My mom was -- is -- unique. Isn't yours? To honor Jean's spirit on Mother's Day, I will cook a delicious Cajun or Creole meal. I hope you're doing something special to honor your mom. So, in appreciation to all the mothers out there, the soon-to-be moms, the PANKs (Professional Aunt No Kids) and those who embrace motherhood at some level, thank you. Thank you, Jean!

"(CNN) -- You're in a restaurant, or at an airport, or on a crowded street. The man or woman next to you crumples to the ground. Do you know what to do? Anyone trained in CPR knows the first step: Check for breathing, and check for a pulse. If there's no heartbeat -- what then? That question has been the subject of intense debate, especially since 2008 when the American Heart Association said that bystanders could try and keep a cardiac arrest victim alive just by pressing on the chest in a hard, quick rhythm. How fast? The exact pace of the Bee Gees' ""Staying Alive."" A big part of the thinking is that people are more likely to attempt resuscitation if they don't have to perform rescue breaths, also known as mouth-to-mouth. An unresolved question has been whether chest-compression-only CPR, sometimes known as CCR, is truly just as good as the original. Two large studies published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine seem to provide an answer: yes. The two papers are remarkably similar in design and results. One was conducted in Washington state -- mostly the Seattle suburbs -- and in London, England. The other study was done in Sweden. In both cases, patients whose hearts had stopped received either traditional CPR, or a version with chest-compressions only. The patients were divided randomly, with 911 dispatchers giving instructions to callers who performed the CPR. In the Seattle-London experiment, patients receiving chest compressions without mouth-to-mouth were more likely to survive without brain damage. In both experiments, patients getting chest-compressions only were more likely to survive, period. In both cases, the difference was small enough that it was not considered statistically significant. But the authors -- and an accompanying editorial -- all said the findings support the idea that bystanders should be encouraged to do steady chest compressions on victims of apparent cardiac arrest, without pausing to give breaths. Dr. Benjamin Abella, an emergency physician who helped develop the 2008 AHA guidelines, agrees. ""Our fundamental position is that doing something is better than doing nothing. This [studies] confirms that there is very little benefit to giving breaths, in the majority of cardiac arrest cases,"" Abella said in an interview. Dr. Myron Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University, who wrote the editorial accompanying the two papers, cautioned in a separate statement that there are some exceptions to the rule. ""It is very important to understand that the patients in this study were adults and that for most children who suffer cardiac arrest, such as drowning victims, we must do rescue breathing."" He also said patients with chronic lung disease or acute asthma, should also receive mouth-to-mouth. The Red Cross issued a statement, saying it considers traditional CPR to be better, but that compressions without mouth-to-mouth ""is an acceptable alternative for those who are unwilling, unable, or not trained to perform full CPR."" There are some indications the new papers actually understate the overall benefit of CCR. Last November, at an American Heart Association meeting, a group from Arizona reported significantly better outcomes for people who received CCR from a bystander, than for those getting CPR with mouth-to-mouth. Chest compressions work by circulating oxygen that is already present in the blood. The bloodstream of a person breathing normally -- up until a cardiac arrest -- contains enough oxygen to sustain life for several minutes. However, oxygen can't nourish cells -- most importantly, brain cells -- unless it is circulated, either by a beating heart or by chest compressions. It's unclear whether CCR is effective simply because it minimizes interruption to chest compressions, maintaining a steady flow of blood, or if the explanation is more complex. Oxygen starvation triggers a cascade of damaging chemical reactions inside cells. Some studies suggest that returning oxygen to the mix too soon could make the damage even worse, and that it's better to keep oxygen levels relatively low in the first minutes after the heart stops. Whatever the mechanism, the new papers are likely to give momentum to an overhaul of the way CPR is done around the country. In Phoenix and Seattle, 911 dispatchers already teach callers to use chest compressions only, in cases of apparent cardiac arrest. Officials in Dallas and New York say their 911 dispatchers ""stress"" or ""push"" chest compressions. Ben Bobrow, director of Arizona's emergency services, thinks other cities will follow the same path. ""I really believe these are landmark papers, and that they'll help communities move towards a system where dispatchers give compression-only instructions,"" Bobrow said. While the two trials described in NEJM involve rescue attempts by lay people, the same techniques also are being investigated for professional EMTs. This fall, a randomized trial will get under way in several cities, including Seattle, where some cardiac arrest victims will receive CCR while others get traditional resuscitation. After the first six minutes, when existing oxygen in the bloodstream would most likely be used up, all victims will receive additional ventilation. The experiments are part of a larger movement -- including better coordination of emergency response, and techniques like cooling patients who suffer cardiac arrest -- that has taken cardiac arrest from being a condition that was almost inevitably fatal, to one where substantial numbers of victims are saved. In Arizona last year, rescuers saved nearly a third of cardiac arrest victims who were considered ""saveable"" -- meaning that someone saw them collapse and their hearts still had at least faint electrical rhythms. According to Abella, the takeaway message is that it's easy for a bystander to radically improve the odds. If you see someone collapse without a pulse, he says, ""You should at least provide chest compressions. The most important thing is to move blood.""

"(CNN) -- The United States will send more missile defense ships to Japan, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Sunday, as part of an effort to bolster protection from North Korean missile threats. North Korea has carried out a series of missile launches in recent weeks and has warned it was preparing to test another nuclear device, prompting fresh criticism from the United States. Speaking during a visit to Tokyo, Hagel announced that two Navy destroyers equipped with missile defense systems would be deployed to Japan by 2017. ""A key focus for our talks today was the threat posed by North Korea,"" Hagel told reporters after he met with Japan's defense and foreign ministers. ""In response to Pyongyang's pattern of provocative and destabilizing actions, including recent missile launches in violation of UN Security Council resolutions, I can announce today that the United States is planning to forward-deploy two additional AEGIS ballistic missile defense ships to Japan by 2017. This will bring our Japan-based fleet of BMD-capable ships to a total of seven."" The announcement followed other steps taken by the Pentagon to bolster its military posture in Japan, including an October decision to establish a second missile defense radar site in Kyoto prefecture. ""These steps will greatly enhance our ability to defend both Japan and the U.S. homeland from North Korean ballistic missile threats,"" Hagel said. South Korea investigates two suspected North Korean drones . ""Great power"" Hagel also addressed territorial disputes between China and its neighbors. Relations between China and Japan are under strain over a territorial row involving a set of small, uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, which has led to frequent tense encounters between the two sides' ships and planes in recent times. ""Great powers have great responsibilities, and China is a great power,"" Hagel said. ""And with this power comes new and wider responsibilities as to how you use that power, how do you employ that military power. And I want to talk with the Chinese about all of that. Particularly, transparency ... The more transparent and open governments can be with each other, the better for everyone. That avoids miscalculation, misinterpretation, misunderstanding, and hopefully that lowers the risks of conflict."" Hagel leaves for Beijing on Monday.

"(CNN) -- The National Basketball Association (NBA) stepped up its global expansion Thursday with announcements of regular season games in the 2014/15 season in Mexico City and London. The Houston Rockets will take on the Minnesota Timberwolves in Mexico City Arena on November 12, while the British capital will host Milwaukee Bucks against the New York Knicks at the O2 Arena on January 15. Minnesota will be hoping to avoid its experience when last scheduled to play at the same venue on December 4 of last year. Its regular season game against San Antonio Spurs had to be postponed after a generator malfunction sent smoke billowing into the arena. The game was made up in April, but Timberwolves president Chris Wright said his team was not put off by the unfortunate incident. ""This is a great opportunity for the NBA and the Minnesota Timberwolves to continue the incredible growth of our international fan base. The Mexico City fans were phenomenal last year and we look forward to visiting them again this season,"" he said in a statement. It will be the fifth regular season game played in London, an annual event which started in 2011. A capacity crowd last year saw Brooklyn Nets beat the Atlanta Hawks 127-110 at the O2. London is also part of the expansion plans for the National Football League, with regular season NFL games being staged at Wembley to sell out crowds since 2007. The four teams selected for the overseas feature games next season have many non U.S. players on their rosters. At the end of the 2013/14 NBA campaign they had a combined 18 international players from 17 countries . ""While London and Mexico City each have their own unique culture, they both have rich sports traditions and share a great passion for the NBA,"" said NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. ""These regular-season games will bring the excitement and incredible competition of our league to more fans in Europe and Latin America,"" he added. The NBA has previously announced a series of pre-season games as part of the league's Global Games promotion. Two-time defending champion Miami Heat will be among the five teams playing the matches across four countries. The Heat joins the Brooklyn Nets, Cleveland Cavaliers, Sacramento Kings and San Antonio Spurs in a series of games in Brazil, China, Germany, and Turkey.","NBA to play regular season games in London and Mexico City .

"(CNN) -- A man charged in the alleged hit-and-run death of a 4-year-old girl at a Florida day care center will remain in jail at least until a Monday hearing about bail, a judge in Orlando ruled Friday. The judge initially set bail for Robert Alex Corchado at $100,000, but prosecutors asked that it be revoked. At a hearing Friday, the judge gave the state until Monday to file a request that Corchado be detained until his trial. Authorities allege Corchado, 28, was behind the wheel of an SUV that hit a car, sending the car into a Winter Park day care center and killing Lily Quintus, 4, on Wednesday afternoon. Corchado, who Florida Highway Patrol spokeswoman Maj. Cindy Williams said had gang ties as well as numerous drug arrests, fled the scene then surrendered at the Orange County jail, according to a tweet from the Sheriff's Office. He was charged with leaving the scene of an accident with a death. Thirteen children were injured, as was one adult. Williams said Corchado rented a black Mazda CX-5 on Wednesday afternoon after fleeing the accident. Corchado's Dodge Durango was found abandoned a few hours after the crash. Lily's mother, Nicole Quintus, called her daughter ""painfully beautiful"" and told the New York Daily News, ""She was incredible and she deserved so much more."" ""I have no idea how I'm supposed to survive after this. I don't know how I'm supposed to go back to a daily routine. I'm wandering about, lost,"" she told the paper. Lily's 7-year-old brother aspires to be an engineer and is building a time machine out of his Erector set so he can bring his sister back, the Daily News reported. Lily's father is a paramedic with the Groveland Fire Department, and one of his co-workers has set up a page so people can donate funds for medical and funeral expenses. As of Thursday night, people had given more than $33,000.

"(CNN) -- When Darla Arni's mother began showing the first signs of dementia 16 years ago, Arni worried she was doomed to the same fate. So Arni began reading up on what she could do to stay mentally sharp. Turns out, plenty. Arni, now 55, grew up on a farm where her mother fried just about everything in lard. Today, she skips the fried foods and eats plenty of fruits and vegetables, takes fish oil pills, goes for regular walks and meditates during a weekly yoga class. ""I'm doing everything I can,"" says Arni, a public speaker and author who lives in Slater, Missouri. And what's the point? Doctors who specialize in the aging brain say that dementia is not inevitable, even in very old age. Making positive lifestyle changes earlier in life, they say, can lessen the chances of the faulty thinking and flagging memory that often come with advancing years. Dr. Gary Small, director of UCLA's Longevity Center, says lifestyle may play a bigger role than genetics when it comes to who will fall into what he calls the ""mental fog"" of dementia. Alzheimer's is perhaps the best known and most feared form of dementia. Early onset Alzheimer's disease, which often has a strong genetic component, may not be delayed with any lifestyle changes. But late-life Alzheimer's, affecting people in their 80s and 90s, has only a minor genetic component and can be delayed or prevented with lifestyle changes -- especially if the changes begin in midlife, says Dr. Majid Fotuhi, chairman of the Neurology Institute for Brain Health and Fitness and a neurology professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. I say, 'Dance' Fotuhi began ballroom dancing when he was a student at Harvard Medical School. It was a break from all the studying. More than that, it was fun. Now a neurologist, Fotuhi still dances. He and his wife, Bita, have mastered the tango. As an expert on how the brain ages, Fotuhi sees another benefit: Dancing is the perfect activity to keep the brain young. ""When people say, 'What's the one thing I can do?' I say, 'Dance.' "" Fotuhi says. The answer to keeping the brain sharp, neurologists agree, is not sudoku or crossword puzzles -- despite the conventional wisdom. Staying physically fit is the most important element to keeping the brain young later in life, they say. Remaining socially engaged and mentally active in new and challenging ways are the two other components to long-term brain health. Fotuhi says ballroom dancing is perfect because it combines physical activity, social interaction and the mental challenge of remembering the steps. Growing the brain . Using new, more powerful MRI scanners, researchers have shown how even moderate exercise can actually increase the size of the hippocampus, the part of the brain responsible for forming memories, essentially turning back the clock and making the brain younger. ""We have found this treasure, this amazing phenomenon that the brain can grow,"" Fotuhi says. After 50, the brain -- and the hippocampus -- typically begins losing volume. The hippocampus loses 1% of its volume every two years and accelerates up to 2% per year later in life. But this loss is not set in stone. Dr. Arthur Kramer at the University of Illinois and his colleagues took 120 older adults and put half of them into an exercise group, which walked three days a week, and the other half on a stretching regimen. After a year, the group that walked had better memory than at the start of the study. More than that, MRI scans showed that hippocampal volume increased, on average, by 2%, effectively making their brains a year or two younger. The brains of the group that stretched continued to age. ""This is cutting edge. We can reverse the atrophy that happens to the brain with aging, particularly the hippocampus,"" says Fotuhi, author of ""The Memory Cure."" A study at the University of Pittsburgh showed that exercise improved the thinking speed of previously sedentary people in their 80s. Staying in shape helps maintain a healthy blood flow to the brain, critically important because blood vessels make up one-third of the brain's volume. But Caterina Rosano, the study's lead author, says the benefits to the brain of such modest exercise as walking three times a week appear to exceed the small improvement in overall fitness that exercise offers, though she's not sure why. One hypothesis: Walking is often a social activity, which engages the brain. It also may elevate the mood of the walker. Begin early . Exercise doesn't help just the elderly. Another University of Illinois study found an association between aerobic fitness, hippocampus size and memory performance in preadolescent children. UCLA's Small says the focus on keeping the brain healthy should begin early. ""My opinion is we should begin in school,"" says Small, author of ""The Alzheimer's Prevention Program,"" scheduled for publication in January. ""The earlier you get started, the more you're going to benefit from it."" Fotuhi uses the analogy of saving for retirement. The more ""savings"" you build up with a brain-healthy lifestyle, the better off you'll be in your 60s and beyond. A model life . If Fotuhi was looking for someone who has done everything right, he'd have trouble finding anyone more on the ball than 91-year-old Angela Little. ""I've lived a fairly healthy life. I've been active. I exercise. I eat moderately. I try to keep my mind as tranquil as possible, not get too upset about anything,"" says Little, a retired professor of biochemistry at the University of California, Berkeley. Little belongs to the Bay Area History of Medicine Club, attends a class on Italian literature and discusses the classics -- in Italian -- and attends a weekly conversation circle, also in Italian. She does tai chi and goes to the gym three times a week for weightlifting, core strengthening and stretching. ""I keep myself busy, and I keep my mind engaged,"" Little says. ""These are the things that keep me happy."" Mothers and daughters . In Missouri, Arni's mother, Dorothy, went on blood thinners more than 11 years ago. Doctors were worried about a massive stroke because the arteries leading to her brain were dangerously narrowed by plaque. Even so, Darla Arni says, her mother's condition has progressed to the point where she no longer recognizes her during visits. But Arni, who has a daughter of her own, says she no longer fears dementia. ""I have a lot of friends. They're scared to death,"" Arni says. ""I'm not so scared. Education and awareness make a difference.""","Doctors who specialize in the aging brain say that dementia is not inevitable .

"Homs, Syria (CNN) -- It has been nearly a week since a truce between the Syrian government and rebel groups took effect in Homs, and as opposition fighters have left the Old Town area of the city, thousands of displaced residents have come back. The streets of the district are packed with people carrying belongings out of the district or moving possessions in to return to their homes. The people are usually busy and rarely joke or smile, but in the middle of this scene there was a tiny, thin and frail-looking woman who stood out. Her name is Zeinat Akhras and a group of people had gathered around her, hugging and kissing her, almost crying with joy. Zeinat is one of fewer than 30 civilians known to have lived through the entire siege of Homs -- more than two years of constant shelling, sniper fire and starvation. ""I am 49 years old and I weigh only 34 kilos (about 75 pounds),"" Zeinat told me when I met her at a damaged church in Old Homs. ""The shelling was terrible, it was going on almost all the time. I got wounded on my arm and my shoulder once."" Zeinat survived the siege with her brother Ayman. They remained in a little apartment, hoping it wouldn't be flattened by an artillery shell, or that Islamist rebels would not kill the two Christians, as Christians are often perceived by the opposition to support the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. ""They often accused me of supporting the government,"" Ayman Akhras said, sitting in the apartment with his sister Zeinat. ""I told them -- who am I supposed to support when I am stuck in here? I am not supporting anyone."" Ayman and Zeinat devoted all of their energy to staying alive. Ayman ventured out into the dangerous streets almost every day, looking for material to burn in the little stove they have in the apartment. ""I only got the wood that the rebels left behind after they cut down the trees. I also never burned any furniture, all I used were broken window frames and doors after they were blown out by the shelling."" The windows in the little apartment the brother and sister occupied were quickly blown out as well, leaving them cold on top of being hungry and scared of the war that was being fought around them. Rebels captured the old town of Homs in 2011. The Syrian military later started a massive push to win the territory back using heavy weapons including artillery in the urban area. Then government forces encircled the rebels and laid siege to the district, preventing food and medical supplies from getting in. The West accuses the al-Assad regime of using starvation as a weapon in the civil war. The United Nations says both sides are guilty of keeping supplies from reaching besieged places, but that the government's use of starvation is more widespread. Zeinat and Ayman soon found their supplies running out as the siege raged on. ""In the beginning we had some canned foods, but those quickly ran out,"" Ayman said. ""Then the rebels came and raided our apartment. They took a lot of the dry foods we had left like flour, bulgur and rice. They came more than 30 times and broke in and held guns to our face. It is an awful feeling to be sleeping at night and then to wake up with a gun to your head."" When the last of the food was gone, Ayman was forced to go out and search for grass and leaves to eat. He found the leaves that saved their lives on a tree in a graveyard, of all places. ""They taste the best. The other ones were very bitter,"" he said. ""We ate them for breakfast, dinner and for lunch every day."" Zeinat showed me a tiny bowl, which was the serving size they allowed themselves for each meal. ""We cut them up and made a stew with them for lunch,"" she said. ""In the mornings we would eat them fresh with some oil we had left, and in the evenings we tried to fry them on the stove if we had wood. These leaves saved our lives."" The brother and sister say it was also their faith that helped them through the two years of confinement, violence and hunger. Both are devout Orthodox Christians. ""There were some nights that we were just sad,"" Ayman said. ""When you just think that you have not seen your family in such a long time, that you might never see them again and that you have no idea when you will be able to get out of here. In those times, sometimes we just cried."" But in the end they made it through more than 700 days of the siege of Old Homs. Zeinat is still weak and cannot stand for an extended period of time. She spends most of the time on the couch in the apartment reading books or resting. Ayman is stronger, but his clothes look baggy on him after he lost so much weight due to the starvation. But both Ayman and Zeinat are survivors. They say the hardship they have endured might have made them thin and frail, but it has made their spirits stronger than ever, and they are looking to the future with optimism.","As a truce in Homs holds, life comes back to the Old Town area .

"New York (CNN) -- A man who spent nearly 25 years behind bars for a 1989 Brooklyn murder he didn't commit has filed a notice of claim to sue New York City for $162 million, according to his lawyer Wednesday. Jonathan Fleming, 52, who was released from prison in April after spending 24 years and 8 months in prison for the slaying of Darryl Rush in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, filed the notice signaling his intent to sue the city, the police department and the King County district attorney's office on Tuesday. ""It signifies the beginning of the process that will hopefully make him whole,"" said his lawyer, Taylor Koss. ""He will never be the same. It's impossible to give him the time back."" Fleming had always maintained that he was on a family trip to Disney World in Florida when Rush was shot to death early on the morning of August 15, 1989, in a dispute over stolen money. After years of reviewing documents and re-interviewing witnesses as part of a joint investigation between his attorneys and the Brooklyn district attorney's Conviction Review Unit, it was determined that the only evidence tying him to the crime was an alleged witness who later recanted her statement. When he was released, Fleming had no place to live and less than $100 to his name, according to Koss. He still has no permanent home and no job. ""It has been a struggle since he got out,"" Koss said, adding that the damages Fleming is seeking include the loss of wages, companionship and emotional anguish. ""It's tough to put a value on those things,"" Koss added. ""I'm not sure how you value one year in prison for a crime you didn't commit, let alone 25."" A New York City Law Department spokesman said the claim will be reviewed. At Fleming's initial trial, defense lawyers provided family photos and home videos of Fleming in Florida around the time of Rush's killing. But, according to Koss, they did not have evidence he was in Florida on the day of the slaying. The prosecution persuaded jurors to ignore the alibi. Fleming told his attorneys he had paid a bill for phone calls made from his Florida hotel room the night before Rush was killed, and he believed the receipt was in his pocket when police arrested him. But authorities told the defense he had no such receipt, according to Koss. In the course of the investigation, the Conviction Review Unit found the receipt in police records, time stamped and dated -- solidifying Fleming's claim that he was in Florida at the time of the crime, according to the district attorney's office. ""This is proof of alibi that was basically purposely withheld,"" Koss said. The review unit also interviewed Fleming's former girlfriend, who said she called Fleming the night of the killing while he was still at his hotel in Florida. The investigation found her story to be credible, with phone records to support it. The prosecution also produced a witness who said she saw Fleming commit the crime. According to Koss, the woman recanted her testimony weeks after Fleming's conviction. She later testified in front of a judge that she was on parole and had been arrested with another woman for being in a stolen van the night of the killing. She said police persuaded her to give a statement against Fleming to avoid going back to jail. Koss said the judge threw out her later testimony because she could not provide enough facts to back up her story.

"(CNN) -- The global list of incredible viewing platforms designed to elevate your heart rate continues to grow, with Canada's Glacier Skywalk the latest gravity-defying walkway to welcome tourists. Jutting 35 meters out the side of a cliff on Jasper National Park's Icefields Parkway, the glass-floored observation walkway hangs 280 meters above Sunwapta Canyon. It opened to tourists May 1 after five years of design, two years of seasonal construction and a reported cost of CAD$21 million ($19 million). In addition to the incredible views, owner Brewster Travel Canada says the attraction has an educational side. A 400-meter-long Discovery Trail cliff-edge walkway leading up to the glass platform includes multi-sensory interactive experiences centered around the glaciology, biology and ecology of Canada's Columbia Icefield region. Visitors must take a five-minute bus transfer from the Columbia Icefield Glacier Discovery Centre to access the Skywalk, which is an hour from the town of Jasper in the Canadian Rockies. The Glacier Skywalk is open daily, May through October. Price of tickets is CAD$24.95 for adults and CAD$12.50 for children. To see how it stacks up against other global viewpoints, check out the gallery on the left. Environmentalists oppose commercial development . Not everyone is thrilled with the Glacier Skywalk. Canada's CBC website quoted Sean Nicholson of the Alberta Wilderness Association as saying this type of development doesn't belong in national parks. ""They represent almost a taking over of the management of the park in a sense by commercial interests, which we don't think is a good thing for the wildlife that live there and the ecosystem in general,"" Nicholson said. Prior to the build, Brewster Travel Canada says it commissioned a 169-page environmental assessment, including a study on wildlife and vegetation. ""The assessment was reviewed by Parks Canada officials and was deemed acceptable within Parks Canada's policy framework governing the management and protection of our national parks,"" said the company. The motivation behind approving the Skywalk was to make the area more attractive to tourists, said Parks Canada in a statement. ""Parks Canada needs to become more relevant to more Canadians by providing services and activities that respond to a broader range of visitor needs and expectations,"" it said. That sentiment is perhaps behind the recent news that the government body is planning to bring WiFi hotspots to at least 50 of its parks this year, claiming visitors want to be able to stay connected even in the great outdoors. Responding to widespread negative reaction to the plan, a Parks Canada official told CTV news that the wireless zones would be restricted to visitor centers and campgrounds -- ""not in the wilderness, and not in the back country.""","Canada's new Glacier Skywalk hangs 280 meters above Sunwapta Canyon in Jasper National Park .

"(CNN) -- If there is one clear emotion emerging before November's U.S. congressional elections, it is that citizens across the political spectrum are  worried about  government spending and a perceived lack of government accountability regarding where tax dollars are spent. Oddly, the government's approach to the illegal drug problem -- which has cost U.S. taxpayers more than $2.5 trillion since former President Richard Nixon first declared America's ""war on drugs"" -- has been largely immune from this concern. CNN iReport: You tell us whether it's time to legalize pot . One dramatic exception is California, where Proposition 19, which proposes to ""regulate, control and tax cannabis,"" will be on the statewide ballot on November 2. In California alone, the illegal market for cannabis, or marijuana, has been estimated to be worth about $14 billion per year, and the legalization initiative aims to redirect the flow of these massive profits from violent drug cartels toward government coffers. Although the full financial impact of legalization cannot be known, cannabis law enforcement in California is estimated to cost taxpayers anywhere between $200 million and $1.9 billion each year, whereas the State Board of Equalization has estimated that taxation could generate $1.4 billion a year in new tax revenue. As the vote approaches, a clear division in political support for Proposition 19 has emerged, with a recent Reuters-Ipsos poll showing that 54 percent of Democrats support legalization as Republican support sits at 33 percent. This division is curious, given that cannabis prohibition takes its biggest toll on the traditional conservative wish list of fiscal discipline, low crime rates and strong families. In fact, as detailed in a report published this month by my organization, the International Centre for Science in Drug Policy, research funded by none other than the U.S. government clearly demonstrates the failure of marijuna prohibition. For instance, government reports demonstrate that even as federal funding for anti-drug efforts has increased from $1.5 billion in 1981 to more than $20 billion today, surveillance systems show that marijuana's estimated potency has increased by 145 percent and its price has declined by 58 percent since 1990. At a 1991 lecture titled ""The Drug War as a Socialist Enterprise,"" conservative economist Milton Friedman noted: ""There are some general features of a socialist enterprise, whether it's the post office, schools or the war on drugs. The enterprise is inefficient, expensive, very advantageous to a small group of people and harmful to a lot of people."" Friedman, who won the Nobel Prize in 1976 for his achievements in the fields of ""consumption analysis,"" had strong views about the certain failure of the war on drugs, which are shared by most economists who stress that costly efforts to remove the drug supply by building prisons and locking up drug dealers have the perverse effect of making it much more profitable for new drug dealers to get into the market. This explains why surveillance systems funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health concluded that over the last 30 years, cannabis has remained ""almost universally available to American 12th-graders,"" with between 80 percent and 90 percent  saying the drug is ""very easy"" or ""fairly easy"" to obtain. Friedman was also vocal about the unintended consequences of the war on drugs, including the enrichment of organized crime and drug market violence. As he wrote in The New York Times: ""The young are not dissuaded by the bullets that fly so freely in disputes between competing drug dealers -- bullets that fly only because dealing drugs is illegal. Al Capone epitomizes our earlier attempt at Prohibition; the Crips and Bloods epitomize this one."" In this context, consider that about 28,000 people have died in drug market violence in Mexico since 2006, when Mexican President Felipe Calderón declared a war on drugs in that country, and that the U.S. government once estimated that Mexican drug trafficking organizations derive 60 percent of their revenue from cannabis exports to the United States. The war on drugs has also had a devastating impact on families. Primarily as a result of drug law enforcement, one in nine African-American males in the 25-to-29 age group is incarcerated on any given day in the U.S., despite statistics that show ethnic minorities consume illicit drugs at rates comparable to those of other ethnic groups in the U.S. In California, where the government spends more on prisons than post-secondary education, a recent report estimated that the cannabis possession arrest rate for African-Americans in Los Angeles County is more than 300 percent higher than that for whites. This disparity has emerged despite data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which has consistently shown that young African-Americans are less likely to use cannabis than whites. In addition to both the racial and budgetary implications of this failed experiment, sociologists and criminologists are decrying the intergenerational effects of these policies on low-income families, as children left behind by incarcerated parents turn to gangs and the cycle continues. One explanation for the persistently high support for cannabis prohibition is the concern that ending the war on cannabis will result in increased use. Interestingly, comparisons between the U.S. and the Netherlands, where cannabis is de facto legalized, indicate that despite the U.S.'s record rates of anti-drug enforcement expenditures, 42 percent of U.S. adults report that they have used cannabis, which is more than twice as high as that observed in the Netherlands, where only 20 percent report a history of cannabis use. While some U.S. economists predict that rates of cannabis use could increase in California under legalization, they have generally ignored the potential benefits of the broad range of strict regulatory tools -- including licensing systems for vendors, purchasing controls and sales restrictions -- that have all proved effective at reducing rates of use and related harms of tobacco and alcohol. As described earlier this month in an article published in the influential British Medical Journal, Robin Room stressed the need for an urgent consideration of the benefits of cannabis regulatory systems, especially given that successful government lobbying by the tobacco and alcohol industries have slowly eroded or eliminated many of these effective regulatory mechanisms in the U.S. As Friedman said, ""If you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view, the role of the government is to protect the drug cartel."" Recent estimates suggest that national regulation of cannabis in the United States would result in savings of more than $44 billion a year on enforcement expenditures alone. Conservatives should look at the ongoing legacy of the failed war on drugs, in light of their traditional commitment to stronger families, economies and societies, and reconsider supporting drug policies that only serve to weaken American society. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Evan Wood.","Evan Wood: Conservatives concerned by spending ignore cost of failed war on drugs .

"(CareerBuilder.com) -- Dressing for work can be a battle, but only if you don't know what you're doing. The way you look and dress in the office makes a statement about what people can expect from you and how you feel about yourself. Here are five areas you should focus on when it comes to having great work style, from the viewpoints of both a man and woman. Remember, every company's culture and dress code are different, so follow our advice as it applies to your workplace. 1. Accessories . She says: Every woman knows that accessories define what look you're going for, whether it's elegant, trendy or casual. If you put 100 women in a room together wearing the same black dress, no two of them would look the same. Why? Because they would all accessorize differently. They'd have to -- it's how you set yourself apart from everyone else. This can be applied at work, too, especially if you work somewhere where everyone wears a different variation of the same outfit. As a general rule, limit yourself to 11 or fewer accessories, and always err on the side of caution and simplicity. If it's excessively cute, big or loud -- just say no. He says: Men don't usually wear as many fashion accessories as women, aside from a watch and perhaps a ring. Just remember to keep it simple. You should have more fingers without rings than with. And your watch should look professional, which means a leather band shouldn't be cracked or its silver links shouldn't be full of scratches. Pay just as much attention to your briefcase or laptop case. If your carrying case is leather, make sure it's not cracked and falling apart. A cloth one shouldn't be covered in dirt or political buttons. 2. Facial appearance . She says: What's that they say? ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder?"" While it's true that beauty can't be defined, it's also true that looking ridiculous can -- and that's the last thing you want a client or colleague to think about you. When you're choosing an outfit, you look for something that complements your features, right? The same goes for your makeup, only on a more subtle level. Don't wear red lipstick and leave the rest of your face bare. Don't highlight your baby blues with 100 coats of mascara. And please, please -- leave the blue, turquoise, bright green (and all other jewel-tone) eye shadows for next Halloween. He says: For guys, facial hair is the real conundrum. Showing up to work clean-shaven is always appropriate. A well-groomed beard can look just as professional, but you have to be meticulous about keeping it trimmed or you risk looking like your chin is growing a Brillo pad. The in-between stages and styles, such as 5 o'clock shadows or week-old scruff, are fine for some workplaces and forbidden in others. Remember that you're a regular person going to work, not a rock star going onstage. They can get away with looking like unkempt college students. If you can't find an explicit policy in the company handbook, take a cue from the other men in the office. 3. Hygiene . She says: I'm not sure that this one needs too much explanation, so we'll keep it simple: . 1. Please bathe, if not daily, at least every other day. 2. Please wash your face. Your makeup never looks as good after it's been slept in and reapplied as when you do it fresh every day. 3. Please wash your hair, or at the very least, brush it. 4. While we're washing things, give those clothes a good scrub, too. 5. Please brush your teeth, as no one wants to smell your morning-coffee/last-night's-happy-hour breath. The bottom line is that, when given a choice, colleagues and clients will be more apt to interact with people who look neat and smell great. The last thing you want is to have your pungent aroma be the topic of water-cooler conversation. He says: Let's assume you bathe and brush your teeth regularly -- if not, we've got a whole separate set of issues. One important problem that continually plagues men is cologne: Go easy on it, please. I think everyone understands you're trying to smell good, but don't suffocate everyone with your fragrance, even if it is by a fancy designer. Many people are allergic to colognes, so skipping it altogether might not be a bad idea. If you do decide to dab a little on, keep it very light. Remember that just about everything is scented these days, so between your cologne, laundry detergent, fabric softener, hair product and deodorant, you're a cornucopia of fragrance. 4. Overall outfit . She says: Women have several options when it comes to work attire and we should be grateful for that. What to wear to the office hinges on several things: your company culture and dress code, current trends, the climate and your personal style. What's important is finding a style that works for you, your company and your budget. Whether it's a pair of jeans with a white T-shirt, a blazer and a pair of pumps; or a pencil skirt with a button-front shirt and pantyhose, your outfit is a reflection of your personality, which in turn can reflect your work style. Whatever you do, make sure your outfit is in line with the company dress code and whatever is on the day's agenda. He says: Here's a situation where men generally have fewer options than women. You can go dressy (a suit), business casual (pants or nice jeans and a button-up shirt) or very casual (plain jeans and a tee). Look at what others are wearing to see what you can and can't get away with at the office. If individuality is appreciated, feel free to be a little more daring than you would be if you were a trial lawyer. Even in a reserved office, a colorful pocket square or a bright tie can stand out and give you a little personality. What matters most is that you always appear pulled together and professional. In a relaxed business setting, even a plain black tee and jeans can look professional as long as they're not wrinkled, ripped or ill-fitting. 5. Shoes . She says: Some might say that shoes are considered an accessory, but not this girl. If you ask me, your shoes make your outfit. The other day, for example, a woman in the elevator was wearing a short dress, fishnet-patterned pantyhose and a headband with a huge flower on the side. The kicker was her shoes: four-inch, patent-leather, peep-toe platforms that tied around her ankle with satin ribbon. With a few tweaks here and there, the outfit could have worked, but her shoes made her look like she belonged at a Halloween party or street corner instead of the office. Basic rule of thumb for shoes at work? Pick something practical over something cute, and be careful when it comes to flip-flops and sandals. He says: Contrary to a woman's ensemble, shoes rarely make a man's outfit, but they can often break it. If you see a guy wearing a wrinkled suit and a tie with a big soup stain on it, you don't remember what shoes he wore. But if you see a guy wearing an impeccably tailored Italian suit with dirty tennis shoes, you won't be able to forget the footwear. When going for a conservative, professional appearance, stick with basic black or brown dress shoes that are free of scuffs or caked mud. If your attire is more casual, just make sure your shoes are appropriate for that outfit, which might include funky tennis shoes for an employee at a laid-back marketing firm. What matters is that the shoes match your overall image and that they look clean. Even the most relaxed boss doesn't want your work shoes to look like they've run a marathon. &copy CareerBuilder.com 2011. All rights reserved.

"(CNN) -- ""It's a funny thing,"" Cameron Diaz recently told CNN of her career. ""When you just leave your doors open, things come in."" The latest project to walk through that open door is ""The Other Woman,"" a romantic comedy about a married man who has not one but two other mistresses. When Diaz's character Carly discovers that her boyfriend is actually a married man, she teams up with his wife and the other other woman to exact their revenge. It's exactly the type of bawdy romp that Diaz has built her career on. With more than 40 credits to her name, several of the more popular ones -- ""The Mask,"" ""My Best Friend's Wedding,"" ""There's Something About Mary,"" ""Bad Teacher"" -- just so happening to fit the nebulous ""romantic comedy"" label. ""I couldn't force any of these things to happen,"" said Diaz, whose entry to the industry was as a teen model. ""When I had the opportunity, I took them. And that's just sort of how I live my life, just keeping the doors open to whatever could possibly happen."" Her life philosophy has paid off handsomely for the 41-year-old actress, particularly with the ""Shrek"" franchise, in which she voices the princess ogre Fiona. But, perhaps more importantly, it's left her fulfilled. ""I couldn't think of a better life than this,"" Diaz said. ""It was just ... it just happened.""

"Washington (CNN) -- Investigators searching a Washington, D.C., park for a missing 8-year-old girl found the body of a man matching her suspected kidnapper's description, police said Monday. Relisha Rudd has been missing since March 1, when she was last seen with Kahlil Tatum, a 51-year-old janitor at the homeless shelter where Relisha lived. Although the body has not been positively identified, ""everything we have is consistent with what (investigators) know about (Tatum's) appearance,"" D.C. Police Chief Cathy Lanier told reporters Monday, adding that the death was ""most likely a suicide."" The search for Relisha intensified last week when authorities began combing Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens. The search was prompted by evidence that Tatum had spent time there after Relisha's disappearance. ""On March 2, we know that Mr. Tatum purchased, among other items, a carton of black, 42-gallon, self-tie contractor trash bags within the District of Columbia,"" Lanier said Thursday. ""Not long after that purchase, Mr. Tatum was in the area of the aquatic gardens for a period of time."" Lanier said after Relisha was last seen, Tatum continued to go to work and was seen around the capital several times between March 2 and March 20. Lanier said Relisha was not with Tatum in any of those sightings. Tatum had not been seen since March 20. Tatum was a janitor for the homeless shelter where Relisha's family had been staying, and it appears Tatum had permission to be with the girl. The case took on new urgency when police discovered the body of Tatum's wife, Andrea Denise Tatum, 51, at a suburban Maryland motel earlier this month. That discovery prompted police to issue an Amber Alert for Relisha. The possible discovery of Tatum's body will not end the search for Relisha, according to Lanier. ""We're still here for the reason we came to be here, to find Relisha."" The search for the girl has been extensive. Lanier told reporters ""hundreds of police officers and firefighter cadets"" had been pulled to help with the search, along with divers, underwater cameras, aerial surveillance, search dogs, and cadaver dogs. ""Our primary focus here was to find Relisha,"" Lanier said Monday. ""We're not finished. That search is continuing.""","Relisha Rudd, 8, was last seen with Kahlil Tatum, a janitor at the shelter where she lived .

"(CNN) -- It's another day of fast-moving events in Ukraine, and you're a little fuzzy on the details. So we're here to catch you up. Let's get started. OK, so what's happening in Ukraine today? A lot. To be brief, Ukraine's ousted President sounded pretty defiant talking to reporters from Russia. He fled Ukraine days ago but insisted that he remained the legitimate elected leader and that he would not give up. In Crimea, a pro-Russian region of southern Ukraine, armed men in military uniforms alarmed Ukrainian officials by showing up suddenly outside two airports in the region. So men with guns showed up unannounced at airports? What? Though it is an alarming development, that in and of itself doesn't seem to be quite the ""armed invasion"" Interior Minister Arsen Avakov suggested it was. The camo-clad squads showed up toting automatic weapons outside the main airport in the regional capital, Simferopol, as well as at a joint military-civilian airport near Russia's big military base in Sevastopol. They didn't seem to do much but look tough. Later, Ukrainian officials said they were able to stop the squads from taking over the airports without using any weapons. OK, remind me again how the tension in Ukraine all got started? The short version is that Ukraine has long been split between folks who look West toward Europe and those who tend to lean East toward Russia. Last year, now-ousted President Viktor Yanukovych decided to scrap a European trade deal that promised long-term rewards in favor of a pile of quick cash offered up by Russia. The pivot toward Russia set off protests by the pro-European crowd that climaxed in deadly clashes with security forces last week. Dozens died before a European-brokered peace deal ended the fighting. But Yanukovych fled before the deal could all be implemented, first to pro-Russian strongholds in Ukraine, then finally to Russia. What did the ousted President say today? And why is he in Russia? Pretty much this: I'm still president. I had to leave Ukraine because people kept trying to kill me. And ""Western powers"" are to blame for all of this chaos. He also said that he won't ask Russian President Vladimir Putin for military muscle to help restore him to power, and seemed to reject talk of splitting up Ukraine into pro-European and pro-Russian halves. So who's in charge in Ukraine and what are they doing about all this? Ukraine's Parliament says it's running things. Lawmakers have named an interim president, started to set up a new government and called elections for May. They've also been talking tough to Russia about keeping its military on its leash and avoiding anything that seems provocative. Why does Russia care so much? Why does the United States care what's happening in, say, Mexico? Pretty much the same reasons apply -- the two countries have traded territories back and forth, they have a shared border and there are lots of business and cultural associations. Ukraine is literally on Russia's doorstep. It's home to the country's Black Sea naval fleet. Ukraine used to be one of the republics in the Soviet Union, and Crimea used to belong to Russia. The countries are big trading partners, and Ukraine hosts part of Russian state-owned natural gas provider Gazprom's network of pipelines that serve European markets. What's going to happen next? Who knows, but keep an eye on Crimea. Pro-Russian forces still hold several government buildings, and lawmakers there have voted out a government they saw as too pro-Kiev. With so many ethnic Russians and a big Russian military presence there, it's a potential flashpoint. MAP: How Ukraine is divided .","Armed squads appear at Crimean airports .

"(CNN) -- An elderly man stares forlornly at his feet, surrounded by twisted reindeer carcasses, their matted blood stark against a field of endless snow. He clutches a knife, and at first glance you'd be forgiven for thinking he caused the carnage himself. Instead, the two reindeer locked antlers in battle, and unable to untangle themselves, starved to death over many days. Sven Skaltje, the herder in the haunting photo, discovered their entwined bodies and finally cut them apart. Erika Larsen, a 37-year-old American photographer living with the mysterious Arctic tribe, caught the moment forever. Larsen is one of 11 female National Geographic photojournalists whose remarkable images are now on display in a new exhibition in Washington D.C., called -- aptly enough -- ""Women of Vision."" From Larsen's dramatic images of Scandinavian tribes people, to Stephanie Sinclair's intimate photographs of Yemeni child brides, and Beverly Joubert's action shots of leopards in the wild, the exhibition delves deep into hidden communities, often in some of the most inhospitable environments on the planet. ""You must have a certain amount of resilience and courage to be a photographer in general, and perhaps especially to be a photographer for a magazine like National Geographic,"" said the show's curator and senior photo editor, Elizabeth Krist. ""We put people into the field for quite long times -- eight weeks would be the average."" Women's work? Featuring almost 100 images taken since 2000, the exhibition is a world away from when first female staff photographer, Kathleen Revis, started working in the 1950s. The male chief of the photographic lab at the time had some advice for Revis: ""If you find the going too tough, why not run over to Paris for a weekend and get some new clothes -- I understand that is good for a woman's morale."" It's enough to make any feminist's blood boil. But as Krist explains, ""Unfortunately, it was really characteristic of the time."" Indeed, in the 125-year-history of National Geographic, a magazine which prides itself on intrepid exploration, there have been four female staff photographers, compared to around 50 men. ""At National Geographic there probably was more of a sense that people needed to be really tough to do some of these stories on the other side of the world. And it was much harder for a woman to counter these societal norms and be on her own in a lot of remote areas,"" said Krist. ""Now, seeing all these women working in really difficult conditions -- not just conflict but also in the middle of epidemics, facing wild animals, political repression, severe climates. It really shows what women are capable of, it's a direct answer to the person who said that to Kathleen Revis."" True grit . If ever there was an indication of how far female photojournalists have come in the last century, it's in the work of Larsen, who spent four years living on-and-off with traditional reindeer herders, called Sami. The mother-of-one learnt their language and even worked as a housekeeper, or beaga, in an effort to immerse herself in their ancient culture, spread across Scandinavia and parts of Russia. Living in a tepee-like structure called a laavo, in temperatures plunging to -40C, Larsen says being a woman actually helped her integrate into the family. ""Sami culture in general has this tradition of having a beaga, which is a woman that would come into the home, help with the children, help with the meals, help with the cleaning, help prepare skin, which I did,"" explained Larsen. ""I don't think a male photographer would be able to sit around the table and sew with the women, and hear their stories in quite the same way."" Similarly, fellow photographer Stephanie Sinclair found her gender gave her unique access to the women's barracks of Yemen's elite counter-terrorism unit, capturing a khaki-clad officer patrolling the lurid pink halls. Meanwhile, Amy Toensing went on an impromptu swim with three elderly women on America's Jersey Shore, using an underwater camera to photograph the sprightly women in the ominous surf. For Larsen, it was the pioneering female photographers of the last 50 years who really paved the way for her today, admitting: ""I haven't found the obstacles I believe they have come up against."" Krist agreed, saying: ""Today it feels much more 50-50 to me in the photojournalism schools. It's becoming much more even, but I think there's still a residue of all the generations which have come before."" The perfect shot . Following an assignment, it's up to photo editor Krist to sift through over 50,000 images, before publishing the best handful. ""What I'm looking for is something that's both meaningful, that reveals something, and something that's really striking visually,"" she said. Larsen's haunting photograph of Skaltje the reindeer herder made the grade when it was published in 2011. But it also summed up the photographer's fascination with mysterious hunting societies. ""What I realized from Sven in this moment is that we are all part of this cycle of life,"" she said.","New exhibition of National Geographic female photographers opens .

"(CNN) -- The fate of the top U.S. military commander in Afghanistan hinges on his meeting Wednesday with President Barack Obama, who was ""angry"" after reading the general's remarks about colleagues in a magazine profile to be published Friday. Gen. Stanley McChrystal will likely resign, a Pentagon source who has ongoing contacts with the general said. The ""magnitude and graveness"" of McChrystal's mistake in conducting the interview for the article were ""profound,"" White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said McChrystal had ""made a significant mistake and exercised poor judgment."" McChrystal apologized Tuesday for the profile, in which he and his staff appear to mock top civilian officials, including the vice president. Two defense officials said the general fired a press aide over the article, set to appear in Friday's edition of Rolling Stone. ""I extend my sincerest apology for this profile. It was a mistake reflecting poor judgment and should never have happened,"" McChrystal said in a Pentagon statement. ""Throughout my career, I have lived by the principles of personal honor and professional integrity. What is reflected in this article falls far short of that standard. McChrystal has been recalled to Washington to explain his actions to the president. He is expected to meet with Obama in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Gibbs said. Gibbs refused to speculate about McChrystal's fate, but told reporters ""all options are on the table."" Obama, questioned about McChrystal before a Cabinet meeting Tuesday afternoon, said he had not made a decision. ""I think it's clear that the article in which he and his team appeared showed poor judgment, but I also want to make sure that I talk to him directly before I make that final decision,"" he said. McChrystal is prepared to resign if the president has lost confidence in him, a national security official told CNN. Most of the Pentagon brass, the ofrficial said, hopes he will be upbraided by the commander-in-chief but sent back to continue the mission. The White House will have more to say after Wednesday's meeting, Gibbs said. He noted, however, that McChrystal did not take part in a teleconference Obama had with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and other top officials on Tuesday. Several elected officials have strongly criticized McChrystal but deferred to the president on the politically sensitive question of whether the general should keep his position. A couple of key congressmen, however, have openly called for McChrystal's removal. In the profile, writer Michael Hastings writes that McChrystal and his staff had imagined ways of dismissing Vice President Joe Biden with a one-liner as they prepared for a question-and-answer session in Paris, France, in April. The general had grown tired of questions about Biden since earlier dismissing a counterterrorism strategy the vice president had offered. ""'Are you asking about Vice President Biden,' McChrystal says with a laugh. 'Who's that?'"" ""'Biden?' suggests a top adviser. 'Did you say: Bite Me?'"" McChrystal does not directly criticize Obama in the article, but Hastings writes that the general and Obama ""failed to connect"" from the outset. Sources familiar with the meeting said McChrystal thought Obama looked ""uncomfortable and intimidated"" by the room full of top military officials, according to the article. Later, McChrystal's first one-on-one meeting with Obama ""was a 10-minute photo op,"" Hastings writes, quoting an adviser to McChrystal. ""Obama clearly didn't know anything about him, who he was. Here's the guy who's going to run his f---ing war, but he didn't seem very engaged. The Boss (McChrystal) was disappointed."" The article goes on to paint McChrystal as a man who ""has managed to piss off almost everyone with a stake in the conflict,"" including U.S. Ambassador Karl Eikenberry, special representative to Afghanistan Richard Holbrooke and national security adviser Jim Jones. Obama is not named as one of McChrystal's ""team of rivals."" Of Eikenberry, who railed against McChrystal's strategy in Afghanistan in a cable leaked to The New York Times in January, the general is quoted as saying, ""'Here's one that covers his flank for the history books. Now if we fail, they can say, ""I told you so.'"" Hastings writes in the profile that McChrystal has a ""special skepticism"" for Holbrooke, the official in charge of reintegrating Taliban members into Afghan society and the administration's point man for Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""At one point on his trip to Paris, McChrystal checks his BlackBerry, according to the article. 'Oh, not another e-mail from Holbrooke,' he groans. 'I don't even want to open it.' He clicks on the message and reads the salutation out loud, then stuffs the BlackBerry back in his pocket, not bothering to conceal his annoyance. ""'Make sure you don't get any of that on your leg,' an aide jokes, referring to the e-mail."" Both Democrats and Republicans have been strongly critical of McChrystal in the wake of the story. House Appropriations Committee chairman David Obey, D-Wisconsin, called McChrystal the latest in a ""long list of reckless, renegade generals who haven't seemed to understand that their role is to implement policy, not design it."" McChrystal is ""contemptuous"" of civilian authority and has demonstrated ""a bull-headed refusal to take other people's judgments into consideration."" Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota, became the first member of the Senate Democratic leadership to call for McChrystal to step down, telling CNN that the remarks were ""unbelievably inappropriate and just can't be allowed to stand."" Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, deferred to Obama on the question of a possible McChrystal resignation. He said the controversy was sending a message of ""confusion"" to troops in the field. I think it has ""a negative effect"" on the war effort, he said. Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman John Kerry, D-Massachusetts, urged a cooling off period before a final decision is rendered on the general. My ""impression is that all of us would be best served by just backing off and staying cool and calm and not sort of succumbing to the normal Washington twitter about this for the next 24 hours."" Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Joe Lieberman of Connecticut and Jim Webb of Virginia -- also key senators on defense and foreign policy issues -- were each strongly critical of McChrystal's remarks, but noted that the general's future is a decision for Obama to make. Karzai weighed in from abroad, urging Obama to keep McChrystal as the U.S. commander in Afghanistan. The government in Kabul believes McChrystal is a man of strong integrity who has a strong understanding of the Afghan people and their culture, Karzai spokesman Waheed Omar said. A U.S. military official said Tuesday that McChrystal has spoken to Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and other officials referenced in the story, including Holbrooke, Eikenberry and Jones. An official at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul said Eikenberry and McChrystal ""are both fully committed"" to Obama's Afghan strategy and are working together to implement the plan. ""We have seen the article and General McChrystal has already spoken to it,"" according to a statement from an embassy official, making reference to McChrystal's apology. ""I have enormous respect and admiration for President Obama and his national security team, and for the civilian leaders and troops fighting this war and I remain committed to ensuring its successful outcome,"" McChrystal said in the closing to his apology. Rolling Stone executive editor Eric Bates, however, struck a less optimistic tone during an interview with CNN on Tuesday. The comments made by McChrystal and other top military aides during the interview were ""not off-the-cuff remarks,"" he said. They ""knew what they were doing when they granted the access."" The story shows ""a deep division"" and ""war within the administration"" over strategy in Afghanistan, he contended. McChrystal and his staff ""became aware"" that the Rolling Stone article would be controversial before it was published, Hastings told CNN Tuesday. He said he ""got word from (McChrystal's) staff ... that there was some concern"" about possible fallout from the story. Obama tapped McChrystal to head the U.S. military effort in Afghanistan in the spring of 2009 shortly after dismissing Gen. David McKiernan.

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Nancy Lanza was raising a quiet, socially awkward young man, the kind of teenager who, a former classmate recalled, would just go stand in the corner. Lanza herself seemed nothing like her boy. She was affable and outgoing, and easily made friends. Sure, she liked guns, say people who knew her. But she was responsible with them. She knew how to handle the weapons she collected. How Adam Lanza apparently got hold of at least a few of them to commit a massacre in an elementary school is still unclear. Authorities believe he killed his mother as she slept in her bed. She was shot four times in the head, Connecticut Chief Medical Examiner H. Wayne Carver said Tuesday. Then, authorities say, Adam Lanza went to Sandy Hook Elementary -- which he'd once attended -- and killed 20 children and six adults. Then, he used a handgun to kill himself with a shot to the front of the head, Carver said. Friend, classmate describe family . A friend of Nancy Lanza, who had done contracting work for her, was last in the home eight months ago and remembers seeing a lock box in the basement where Lanza kept her guns. He describes her as a country girl from New Hampshire who grew up shooting. The two of them bonded, partly because both had family members with autism, the friend said. He also said he met Adam Lanza, who did not make eye contact or engage in conversation. Lanza tried hard to mainstream her son, the friend said. He now questions whether she tried too hard to have him ""fit in."" He says she took her son with her to the gun range because, she said, she couldn't always leave him at home. On Monday, just a few days after the massacre at the school, a schoolmate of Adam Lanza told CNN that he bumped into Nancy Lanza a while ago. Alan Diaz, 20, who was a freshman at Newtown High School when Adam Lanza was a sophomore, asked her how her son was doing. To Diaz, it seemed that Adam Lanza just disappeared from high school after his sophomore year, but it turns out that Lanza, then 16, was taking classes at Western Connecticut State University, a school spokesman said. It was hard to forget a kid like Adam Lanza. ""I would call him a genius,"" Diaz said. Lanza got a 3.26 GPA at WCSU, including an A in a computer class, the school spokesman told CNN, but Lanza took his last class in 2009 and didn't come back. When Diaz and Lanza were classmates, Diaz went out of his way to include Adam Lanza when few others would, he said. It worked, for a little while. Lanza opened up, sometimes telling jokes to the other students. There he'd be, in the same plaid green button-up shirt and his khakis -- the weird kid, telling jokes. So those few years later, seeing Adam Lanza's mother, Diaz just had to ask: How are things going with Adam? ""When I talked to Nancy that time, about how he was doing, she said he's been going to the (gun) range a lot recently,"" Diaz told CNN. ""That he'd taken that up as a hobby."" In school shootings, patterns and warning signs . Guns and gardening . Nancy Lanza was a personable neighbor, acquaintances said. Sandy Hook is an affluent area about 60 miles from New York City. The homes are huge and so are the yards. It's the kind of neighborhood where Christmas cookies are exchanged and people get together at each others' houses. When Connecticut winters bring blankets of snow, the kids ride sleds on a big hill in the neighborhood. Nancy Lanza and her two boys -- Ryan and Adam -- and her husband, Peter, moved there around 1998. The couple divorced in 2009. Peter Lanza is listed on LinkedIn as a tax director and vice president of taxes for GE Energy Financial Services in the New York City area. According to divorce documents, he agreed to pay his wife, on average, $250,000 a year in alimony. He also agreed to buy his son Adam a car, though his wife would have to pay for the vehicle's upkeep and insurance. Adam Lanza's primary residence was with his mother, the documents show. They lived in the Newtown home that Peter Lanza ceded to Nancy. The father was also responsible for paying for Adam's college, as well as for Ryan Lanza's schooling. Peter and Ryan Lanza were questioned after Friday's rampage. 'Anarchist Soccer Mom' cries out for help . CNN spoke with a friend of Nancy Lanza who said she'd grown concerned about Adam lately, worrying about what she was going to do with her boy who was growing up, maybe in the way that all mothers worry. She talked about wanting to sell her house and move West, and was eyeing Washington state. Lanza wasn't debilitated, though, by her worry. She still got out there and lived. She went on short vacations and went to Red Sox games. The friend asked not to be named. A 'normal family' and target shooting . ""It was just a nice, normal family,"" neighbor Rhonda Cullen said Saturday, recalling how she and other women on the street would often go to each others' houses to play cards. Nancy Lanza preferred to garden. ""We used to joke with her that she'd do all this landscaping that no one could see because it all was in the back (of the house),"" Cullen said. Nancy Lanza also collected guns, say those who knew her. Dan Holmes, who owns a local landscaping business, said she showed off a rifle she recently purchased. ""She told me she'd go target shooting with her boys pretty often,"" Holmes said. Nancy Lanza kept a lot of weapons, from assault rifles to handguns, at her home. The weapons were for self-defense, said Marsha Lanza, Peter Lanza's sister. Yet, Marsha Lanza said her former sister-in-law ""never felt threatened."" If she did, Marsha Lanza said, Nancy would have spoken up about it. Nancy was self-reliant, a trait that she possibly picked up while growing up on a farm in New Hampshire, Marsha Lanza said. Groups: Autism not to blame for violence . At some point, she worked in finance in Boston and Connecticut, a friend said. She was not a teacher, as some media had previously reported, the friend added. Despite whatever problems Nancy Lanza might have been facing behind closed doors, on the outside she kept a cheerful face. Several people who knew her said she was incredibly social and warm. Several nights a week, she got take-out from the My Place bar in Newtown. CNN sat down with owners Louise, Mark and John Tambascio. Louise recalled Nancy starting a conversation with her, and how they become fast friends. ""She's funny. We took to her,"" said Mark Tambascio. ""She did a lot in town and was always on the go."" Louise Tambascio said Nancy Lanza worked in charities for people with AIDS, and said she was extremely generous. Louise saw Nancy Lanza take out her checkbook and write checks to anyone who told her they were going through a rough time and needed money. ""She was very kind,"" Louise said. Lanza was generally in a good mood, several people said. ""Every time I saw her, she was so giddy and happy,"" said Amanda D'Ambrose, 23, Alan Diaz's sister. D'Ambrose also knew Adam, and knew that Nancy owned guns. ""She was very responsible. She transported them safely. It wasn't something she boasted about,"" D'Ambrose told CNN. Yet when she heard the news that there had been a shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary, D'Ambrose started calling Nancy Lanza's cell phone. As the young woman recalls this terrible moment, she weeps. I was ""hoping it wasn't true,"" she said. Nancy Lanza's guns . The three weapons found at the scene of the shooting were legally purchased by Nancy Lanza, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation told CNN. Statement from Adam Lanza's father . The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives is investigating the school shooting. CNN confirmed Monday afternoon with ATF that Adam Lanza and his mother frequented several gun ranges over the past several years. The agency will not identify which ranges. Russ Hanoman, a friend of Nancy Lanza, said she was the ""epitome of responsibility."" ""They've painted her as some irresponsible gun freak, but she wasn't,"" he said. ""She was a paragon for gun safety. She taught the boys how to use the guns responsibly."" Police Chief Donald Briggs Jr. said he, too, knew Nancy Lanza. ""She was a great person who would do anything for you, a heart of gold,"" he told the Union Leader newspaper. ""She was just a real, real nice, nice person."" Alan Diaz keeps asking the same question everyone is: How could this person he knew, who seemed a little off, kill children? ""You know,"" he began, ""in the media, the person who does (these) things is seen as just evil. But I've thought for a long time: What about the people who knew them? What about the friends?"" He chews this over. ""They knew them as a person. And now, being in that situation, it is very strange,"" Diaz said. ""I knew this kid and there was no sign ever that he could hurt another person."" Many people told Diaz not to talk to reporters, but he just wants to talk. He wants information he might never get. ""I want to know how this could happen. How ... a shy kid could do this.""

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's mother and three children may be on the hook for $800,000 if they lose their appeal of the AEG wrongful death verdict, a judge ruled Monday. Katherine Jackson and grandchildren Prince, Paris and Blanket would have to personally pay the money, because California law prohibits her lawyers, who footed much of her legal costs in the lawsuit, from paying it. The Jacksons sued the concert promoter, accusing the company of responsibility in the pop icon's 2009 death because it hired, retained or supervised the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter. A jury rejected their case after a six-month trial last year. AEG Live lawyers initially asked for $1.2 million from the Jacksons, but Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos ordered them to resubmit their claim with $400,000 in expenses removed. The Jacksons will not have to pay the $800,000 until their appeal is concluded and only if they lose. A California appeals court will hear arguments on the case in November, but it could be years before the judgment is final. Jackson's mother and children are the only beneficiaries to the trust funded by his estate. Palazuelos denied the Jacksons' request for a new trial in January. Jackson lawyers argued the verdict form used by the jury was faulty and that the judge erred by refusing to let them pursue a negligence claim independent of the hiring case.

"(CNN) -- A suspect is in custody in a case involving the beating of a gay man during Detroit's Motor City Pride festival that was caught on cell phone video, according to Detroit police. The suspect is a juvenile. Police say they are are still looking for help to identify the other men shown in the video beating Christin Howard, a 20-year-old hairdresser, on June 8. Howard told CNN affiliate WXYZ he was taking a picture with a friend when things suddenly turned violent. A group of men began to ""gay bash"" him, he said, hurling anti-gay slurs his way. Then they started to physically attack him. ""I just thought I was going to die. At one point I thought they were going to kill me,"" Howard said. The attack left Howard bruised, with a bloody eye, cuts and a broken finger, leaving him unable to sleep or work. David Wait, chairman of Motor City Pride, called the incident troubling, adding that he'd noticed ""record attendance on Sunday and we took steps to increase security."" Wait praised police for their ""swift efforts"" at investigating the crime. CNN's Melodi Smith contributed to this story.","Detroit police arrest a juvenile suspected of beating a gay man .

"(CNN) -- An investigation into the outing of the CIA's top intelligence official in Afghanistan last month determined the leak was inadvertent. No one was disciplined or fired, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Wednesday. When pressed on who was responsible for revealing the name to some 6,000 journalists, Earnest said the White House was focused on changing procedures, rather than one specific misstep. Those new procedures include: . -- Additional training for communications, White House scheduling and advance staff; . -- On presidential trips abroad, a staffer will notify participants in a meeting open to the press that their names and titles will be released to reporters, giving them an opportunity to object; . -- On such trips, the White House press lead will clear the names and titles of meeting participants with National Security staff prior to release. The updated procedures are expected to be adopted immediately in the hopes of avoiding another leak. The official's name was included on a list of people attending a military briefing for President Barack Obama during his surprise visit to Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan last month. It's common for such lists to be given to the media, but the names of intelligence officials are rarely provided. In this case, the individual's name was listed next to the title, ""Chief of Station."" A station chief heads the CIA's office in a foreign country, establishing a relationship with its host intelligence service and overseeing agency activities. The identities of station chiefs, like most CIA officers, are rarely disclosed to protect them and their ability to operate secretly. Given the potentially dangerous nature of the situation, CNN has not broadcast or published online the name of the official. CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","CIA chief of station in Afghanistan accidentally named in White House media report .

"(CNN) -- An Arkansas student says his high school is ""history"" after school officials pulled a profile of him from the school yearbook because he is openly gay. Taylor Ellis, 17, told CNN affiliate KATV that Sheridan High School pulled seven student profiles from the Yellowjacket yearbook rather than publish an account based on his coming out. ""It's a big thing in Sheridan to be gay,"" the yearbook's assistant editor, Hannah Bruner, told KATV of why she profiled Ellis. ""That something that doesn't get told a lot."" In a statement, Sheridan Superintendent Brenda Haynes said, ""We must make decisions that lead in the proper direction for all of our students and for our community. We must not make decisions based on demands by any special interest group. The seven profiles will not be published in the yearbook."" She added, ""We have reviewed state law, court cases, and our own policies. It is clear that the adults who have the responsibility for the operation of the District have the obligation to make decisions which are consistent with the mission of our school. We have done so."" The district decided to scrap the seven profiles rather than publish Ellis' story, Bruner said. To Ellis, the reason for taking out all the profiles was clear. ""We have a good idea why they're not going into the yearbook,"" he said. ""They don't want to just throw out the gay kid's interview."" Ellis, who came out a year ago, said he didn't understand the decision. ""I'm already openly gay,"" he told KATV, ""so there's no reason that it should affect how people see me."" Bruner's profile of Ellis said, in part, ""Although the thought of coming out and the repercussions of doing so, frightened Ellis at first, he found that most of the student body, as well as the teachers, were very accepting of him."" Ellis' mother said the principal, Rodney Williams, contacted her. ""I didn't understand, because there had been no problems, so I ask him, 'have you had threats?' "" Lynn Tiley told KATV. ""He said, 'no, ma'am, just his well-being.' "" On Tuesday, representatives from a national civil rights organization staged a demonstration on the State Capitol steps in support of Ellis, KATV reported. ""This discriminatory exclusion by Sheridan High School administrators has nothing to do with Arkansas values,"" said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign. On Wednesday, Williams was to receive a petition with more than 30,000 signatures asking that the decision be reversed, KATV reported. The Human Rights Campaign urged Gov. Mike Beebe and the state's education commissioner, Tom Kimbrell, to intervene, but representatives of their offices said it was a matter for the local school district. ""They're history,"" Ellis said of his high school. ""When I'm done with Sheridan, I'm done with Sheridan. I have one more year, and after that, I'll thank God every day that I'm not there anymore.""

"New York (CNN) -- A New York man has been charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with the stabbing of two children in Brooklyn, police said Thursday. Daniel St. Hubert, 27, was charged with second-degree murder, second-degree attempted murder, and two counts of criminal possession of a weapon. Police believe Hubert was out on parole Sunday when he stabbed the two children -- killing one of them -- inside an elevator. Authorities also said that St. Hubert might be linked to a fatal stabbing Friday in a Manhattan subway. Detectives were obtaining evidence Thursday that could link him to the subway stabbing in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, a law enforcement official said. Investigators were executing search warrants to see if he is linked to additional stabbings since his release from prison last month, another law enforcement official said Wednesday. St. Hubert was arrested by detectives around 8 p.m. Wednesday. He was arrested around the same time that Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce identified St. Hubert by name for the first time as the suspect in the attack. Prior arrests . St. Hubert has at least nine prior arrests, though police did not specify all the outcomes. The most recent outcome was May 23, when, Boyce said, St. Hubert was released on parole in connection to a domestic assault case. Nine days later, police believe he encountered 6-year-old Prince Joshua ""PJ"" Avitto and 7-year-old Mikayla Capers inside an elevator at a public housing complex in Brooklyn. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the two children were ""on their way to get ice cream"" at the time. For reasons authorities haven't yet explained, the two children were stabbed -- both in the torso. PJ Avitto was transported to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. ""These parents are in such pain now,"" de Blasio said. ""... I ask all New Yorkers to help in this investigation any way you can. Do it for this grieving family. Do it for all of us."" Police initially said Mikayla was in critical condition. Speaking Wednesday, the mayor said, ""She's doing much better. She's a strong young lady."" A spokesman for New York-Presbyterian Hospitals said Thursday he couldn't comment on her condition. Bryan Dotson confirmed she was a patient at New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. A knife believed to have been used in the attacks was recovered at the scene. A law enforcement official said Wednesday that DNA evidence from that knife helped police identify the suspect. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, however, said later in the day that police ""said nothing about DNA"" while insisting forensic evidence more generally helped lead them to the suspect. Parents' struggle . As the investigation continues, families of the two stabbed children struggled with the senselessness of the attack. ""Pray for her, and us. And pray for PJ's family. This is senseless. I don't know what monster would do something like this,"" said Regenia Trevathan, the girl's great-grandmother, to CNN affiliate WCBS. Scott Avitto, PJ's uncle, similarly said the violence ""doesn't make any sense."" ""We're all just struggling, we're trying to pull it together,"" he added. ""Our family is strong, but we just want justice to be done."" Avitto was related to Taj Gibson, a forward for the Chicago Bulls. Gibson tweeted Monday morning: ""They killed my lil super man. #rippj only two more weeks until your 7 birthday. Tears forever."" Gibson also posted a picture of Avitto to his Instagram account. PJ's godfather, Henry Alston, said the boy's funeral will be Friday. Investigators are considering the possibility the suspect may be responsible for another fatal stabbing that occurred just two days earlier and blocks away. Tanaya Copeland, 18, was found in the same neighborhood Friday night, unconscious and unresponsive with multiple stab wounds to her torso. Copeland was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, police said. The close proximity of the incidents, as well as similarities in the type of weapons used, have led detectives to believe the two cases may be related. ""We have to proceed as if they are aligned,"" Boyce said. ""The knives are very similar. The proximity is four blocks. We have a basic description of the male."" 12-year-old girls accused of stabbing friend .

"(CNN) -- Police evacuated a mall in New Jersey on Saturday night after people mistook a car explosion for gunfire, a law enforcement official said. Panic ensued at Westfield Garden State Plaza Mall in Paramus, with some taking to Twitter to say a shooting had occurred. A car's battery or fuel tank caught fire and caused a small explosion, creating the noise some people mistook for gunfire, a law enforcement official told CNN . ""Due to that car fire ... smoke started entering the mall there,"" Lt. Kenneth R. Ehrenberg of the Paramus Police Department told CNN affiliate WABC. ""At some point, we received a call, people said they heard loud noises, possibly shots in that area of the mall. Nobody saw any gunman. Nobody saw anybody shooting, anything."" The owner of the vehicle was interviewed by police and cleared, authorities said. A real shooting occurred November 4, 2013, at the mall, causing an evacuation. Authorities said a man fired at least six bullets inside the mall without striking anybody. Richard Shoop's body was found at 3:20 a.m. the next day in an obscure part of the mall.

"Cleveland (CNN) -- When her chance came, kidnapping victim Michelle Knight lit into Ariel Castro, the man who held her captive and raped her in his Cleveland home for a decade. ""You took 11 years of my life away,"" she said. ""I spent 11 years in hell. Now, your hell is just beginning."" In handing down a sentence of life without parole plus 1,000 years in prison, Judge Michael Russo told the kidnapper there was no place in the world for his brand of criminal. Castro's first stop after country jail will be the Lorain prison in Grafton, Ohio, where officials will evaluate him and decide where he will serve his sentence. ""You don't deserve to be out in our community,"" Russo told the defendant, explaining he would never leave prison. ""You're too dangerous."" Castro pleaded guilty last week to 937 counts, including murder and kidnapping, in exchange for the death penalty being taken off the table. The charges stem from his kidnapping, rape and assault of three women: Knight, abducted in 2002; Georgina DeJesus, abducted in 2004; and Amanda Berry; abducted in 2003. Castro is the father of Berry's 6-year-old girl, DNA tests confirmed. All three women kept diaries with Castro's permission, providing many of the details of their abuse. Berry and DeJesus, who did not attend the hearing, sent family members to deliver impact statements on their behalves, while Knight, 32, chose to address her abductor head-on. ""I cried every night. I was so alone. I worried what would happen to me and the other girls every day,"" she said, promising to overcome the experience. ""I will live on. You will die a little every day."" She said her friendship with DeJesus was the only positive element of her years in captivity and expressed gratitude that her ""teammate"" was there to save her when she was ""dying from his abuse."" In a pre-sentencing evaluation, Dr. Frank Ochberg, a pioneer in trauma science, wrote that Knight suffered ""the longest and most severely."" ""It was Michelle who served as doctor, nurse, midwife and pediatrician during the birth (of Berry's child). She breathed life into that infant when she wasn't breathing,"" he wrote. ""At other times, she interceded when Castro sought to abuse Gina, interposing herself and absorbing physical and sexual trauma. But each survivor had a will to prevail and used that will to live through the ordeal."" ""Happy household"" Despite his repeated insistence that he wasn't making excuses for his conduct, Castro played the victim, saying he was addicted to porn and masturbation. In his oft-disjointed statement, he referred to himself as ""very emotional"" and ""a happy person inside."" Castro appeared to blame the victims and accused them of lying about their treatment. He went on to say that none of the women was a virgin when he abducted them, that they wanted sex and there was ""harmony"" in the ""happy household."" Castro even claimed that no one cared enough about Knight to search for her after her after she disappeared. ""I'm not a monster. I'm just sick. I have an addiction, just like an alcoholic has an addiction,"" he said. ""God as my witness, I never beat these women like they're trying to say that I did. I never tortured them."" When Castro finished his statement, Russo dubbed him a ""violent sexual predator"" and thanked Knight for showing ""remarkable restraint"" during the hearing. Ariel Castro's son: I won't visit dad in prison . Wearing eyeglasses and an orange prison uniform, the shackled Castro characterized his crimes in a far gentler light than the book-length indictment handed down against him: ""I'm not a violent person. I simply kept them there so they couldn't leave."" Testimony from authorities and mental health experts didn't jibe with Castro's recollection, however. Police recalled how the women were forced to play Russian roulette and how Castro would throw money at them after raping them. Det. David Jacobs of the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Office testified he'd also show a gun ""to the girls as a form of control."" It was all to ""purely satisfy his sexual needs,"" Jacobs said. "" 'I knew what I did was wrong.' He said that more than once."" Castro's 1,400-square-foot home was reconfigured to keep their whereabouts a secret, FBI agent Andrew Burke testified. The back door was outfitted with an alarm, bedspreads and curtains obscured parts of them home and a porch swing was placed in front of the stairs leading to the rooms where Castro held the women and girl hostage. Police also testified Castro would chain the women to objects, including a support pole in his basement. In the room where Berry and her daughter were held, the doorknob was removed, a lock was affixed to the outside and a hole was cut through the door for ventilation because the windows had been boarded up from the inside, Burke said. Burke also described a handwritten letter in which Castro claimed he had been sexually abused as a child and wrote, ""I am a sexual predator."" ""You saved us!"" The first police officer on the scene, Barbara Johnson, recalled for the court how she and another officer heard the pitter-patter of footsteps in a dark room where Knight and DeJesus were held. When the captive women realized they were police, Knight ""literally launched herself"" onto an officer, ""legs, arms, just choking him. She just kept repeating, 'You saved us! You saved us!' "" Johnson said. The women were described as scared, pale, malnourished and dehydrated when they were rescued. Dr. Gerald Maloney, who was in the emergency room when the victims arrived, said Knight requested that no male physicians attend to her. Several witnesses said the women told them stories of being physically abused and deprived of food, and Det. Andrew Harasimchuk told the judge the women were raped ""vaginally, orally and anally"" during their captivity. Multiple officers testified that Castro appeared to show no remorse for his crimes, and prosecutor Anna Faraglia said he ""tormented"" his victims by allowing them to watch vigils held in their honor, and he even attended some. Castro would talk to his victims' parents as if he were distraught by their disappearances when ""they were right underneath his roof,"" Faraglia said. Child custody rights for rapists? Most states have them . Outlining the emotional toll their captivity took on the women, Ochberg said the victims will be subjected to life sentences of their own, as their memories will not go away. When they were abducted, the women were all of the age at which humans are learning to be intimate in life. ""This was not real intimacy. This was a perversion of intimacy,"" Ochberg said, further describing the women's survival and coping skills as ""marvelous, compelling examples of resilience, of imagination, of humanity."" Ochberg's evaluation -- using statements, medical records, videotaped interviews and transcripts -- painted a horrifying picture of physical and emotional abuse at the hands of Castro, including brutal beatings and repeated rapes that resulted in pregnancies that he would terminate by punching the women in the stomach. ""He appeared to be evolving in an ever more dangerous direction, capturing younger and younger women, telling his captives he was hunting for replacements,"" Ochberg wrote before sentencing. Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Gregory Saathoff described the women's ordeal as a ""complete and comprehensive captivity"" and said when he first learned of Castro's crimes, he wrote, ""The scope and magnitude of Ariel Castro's crimes is unprecedented."" But asked if he felt Castro suffered from mental illness -- something the defendant repeatedly asserted during his statement -- Saathoff was firm that an examination showed he suffered from ""no psychiatric illness whatsoever."" ""Thank you, victims"" In addition to the guarantee from Russo that he ""will never be released from incarceration during the period of his remaining natural life for any reason,"" Castro was also hit with a forfeiture of property and fined $100,000. As the judge sentenced him, Castro took issue with the aggravated murder charge related to the termination of his victim's pregnancies, saying there was no evidence those incidents occurred. Judge Michael Russo reminded him that he had already pleaded guilty, and Castro said he did so only to save his victims further trauma. ""In your mind, there was harmony and a happy household,"" Russo said. ""I'm not sure there's anyone else in America who would agree with you."" As the hearing came to a close, Castro turned around and glanced at family members of the victims. ""Thank you, victims. Please find it in your heart to forgive me,"" he said. Why so many high-profile crimes in Cleveland? In each case, Castro lured the women into his car with the promise of a ride, according to court documents. The women and girl were freed in May after Berry shouted for help while Castro was away. Neighbors heard her cries and came to her aid as she tried to break through a door. One neighbor gave her a cell phone to call authorities. ""Help me, I am Amanda Berry,"" she frantically told a 911 operator. ""I've been kidnapped, and I've been missing for 10 years. And I'm here, I'm free now."" In early July, Berry, DeJesus and Knight released a YouTube video offering their thanks to all those who have helped them since they were freed. Berry and DeJesus have not faced their tormentor since their rescue. ""I want to thank everyone who has helped me and my family through this entire ordeal. Everyone who has been there to support us has been a blessing,"" Berry said in the video. ""I'm getting stronger each day."" CNN's Pamela Brown reported from Cleveland; and Eliott C. McLaughlin reported and wrote from Atlanta.

"New York (CNN) -- L'Wren Scott left her entire estate to her longtime lover, Mick Jagger, according to the late fashion designer's will. ""I give all my jewelry, clothing, household furniture and furnishings, personal automobiles, and other tangible articles of a personal nature...to Michael Philip Jagger,"" Scott wrote in her will, according to a document released by the Manhattan Surrogate's Court Thursday. Scott, 49, was found dead by her assistant in her New York apartment March 17. Her death was ruled a suicide, according to the New York City medical examiner, who determined Scott killed herself by hanging. Scott's personal estate is estimated to be worth $9 million, according to public records. Her main asset was her Manhattan apartment, which is worth a projected $8 million, according to the filings. Noticeably absent from the will are Scott's two siblings, Randy Bambrough and Jan Shane. Representatives of the siblings could not be immediately reached. Scott signed the will on May 23, 2013, in Beverly Hills, California, according to the probate documents. Scott's birth name was Lu Ann Bambrough, the filing said. Jo Wood, the ex-wife of Rolling Stones guitarist Ronnie Wood, told CNN last week that the finances of Scott's fashion business may have played a role in her suicide. Annual accounts show her London-registered business -- LS Fashion Ltd -- had racked up debts of 5.5 million euros ($7.6 million) by the end of 2012 and was burning through cash at a rapid rate. The accounts, filed in October 2013, show LS Fashion's cash reserves were decimated over the course of a year, plunging to just under 70,000 euros at the end of 2012 from over 750,000 euros a year earlier . The company's deficit ballooned by 40% to surpass 4.2 million euros ($5.9 million) over the same period. However, in a statement issued last Friday, a representative for Scott said, ""The figures quoted in the media regarding the financial status of LS Fashion Limited are not only highly misleading and inaccurate but also extremely hurtful and disrespectful to the memory of L'Wren Scott."" ""The long-term prospects for the business were encouraging. Ms. Scott was very focused on doing what was right for her global business and for the support of her team,"" the statement said. Jagger, 70, posted a personal statement about Scott's death on his website last week: ""I am still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this tragic way. We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me."" Scott had been dating the Rolling Stones frontman since at least 2003. The lanky former model designed clothes worn by a number of celebrities, including singer Madonna, actress Allison Williams of HBO's ""Girls,"" and actress Christina Hendricks of AMC's ""Mad Men."" She also created many of Jagger's looks for the Rolling Stones' 50th anniversary tour, which began in 2012 and is currently in Australia. The Art of Elysium, an organization that brings the arts to hospitalized children, announced Thursday that it had created an award in Scott's name. A private service for Scott was held Tuesday at a Hollywood cemetery.

"(CNN) -- Like the six other former captives who have been through the Army's reintegration program at Brooke Army Medical Center before him, daily life for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is focused on routine. He rises, eats and sleeps on a ""normal schedule"" and lives in a ""typical"" room at the huge hospital facility on a floor he shares with other patients. What isn't typical is the security presence outside his door. The reason, says Col. Hans Bush, command spokesman for U.S. Army South, is not to keep the returnee in, but ""to make sure he doesn't get overwhelmed in a social setting."" In other words, the goal is to prevent someone unwanted by either Bergdahl or his reintegration team from entering. The medical center has a staff of hundreds, but America's newest and perhaps most controversial returnee interacts daily with a very small, intimate circle numbering less than a dozen. One of the most important parts of his routine is storytelling. The returnee personally recounts all that happened from the moment he left the security of his post in Afghanistan, though the five years he survived in captivity, right up until the day he was freed last month. And for the first time, the person telling that story is Bergdahl himself. The listeners are a small group of professionals including a SERE (Survival, Evasion, Resistance, Escape) psychologist, members of his medical team and Army debriefers. ""The idea is to take the returnee from former captive all the way through a safe landing, where we have a soldier who can step forward as a soldier and do the next thing the Army calls on him to do,"" Bush says. Army general to start investigating how, why Bergdahl left base . Bergdahl may be the seventh former captive reintegrated since U.S. Army South was tasked to be the center for assisting them, but he is the first junior enlisted person to go through the program. Previous returnees were either Department of Defense employees or contractors. The program began at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Texas, in 2006. ""Daily life gradually expands to cover all things you and I take for granted"", Bush says, ""personal encounters, personal hygiene, recreation/leisure and structure including direction, guidance and instruction (having a leader telling you when and where to do something). The goal is to provide the returnee the opportunity to make more and more decisions on his own and exercise more personal freedom."" When I ask if Maj. Gen. Kenneth Dahl, the man leading the military's investigation into how Bergdahl left his post in Afghanistan, had been in touch with the sergeant, I was referred to the Pentagon. Bush would say only that ""investigation is not part of reintegration."" ""Does Sgt. Bergdahl have access to an attorney?"" I ask. ""Legal counsel is available throughout the entire reintegration process,"" is the reply. Bergdahl has a long road ahead . Previous captives have completed their reintegration in a week to 10 days, but each case is as unique as the conditions of captivity, military experts say, and there have been early suggestions that Bergdahl's stay may be much longer. Officially, the Army will say only that the length of treatment is ""event-driven, not timeline-driven."" And just where will Bergdahl go after he completes reintegration? Since he is still an active member of the Army, Bush said, ""He will go where the Army will tell him to go."" Past returnees have gone back to family and back to their places of employment, such as contractors. ""Anyone in a military unit would return to their branch of service."" Bush says. ""In this case, the Army."" Once Bergdahl is cleared to leave San Antonio, the orders for his next destination are likely to come from Human Resources Command at Fort Knox, Kentucky. But Bush says he doesn't know if any such decision has been made yet. What is pretty much decided is that unlike his life now, life after reintegration for the 28-year-old probably will be anything but routine.

"(CNN) -- A 16-year-old from Brazil can dash off a wordy, complicated, text message in the time most of us can thumb ""Where R U?"" And the folks with Guinness World Records have noticed. Marcel Fernandes typed a 25-word pre-selected paragraph into his touchscreen phone in 18.19 seconds, just enough to break the record of 18.44 seconds set in January. And that phrase was no easy task, either. It reads: ""The razor-toothed piranhas of the genera Serrasalmus and Pygocentrus are the most ferocious freshwater fish in the world.

He said his skill started developing in 2009, after the then-13-year-old grew frustrated with a wonky monitor on his desktop computer. ""So one day I got so stressed out about it that I literally took a hammer and broke my desktop monitor,"" he said in an e-mail. ""With no money to buy a new one, I resorted to using exclusively my iPhone 3Gs, which I had at the time, to do everything that I needed to do.

"(CNN)  -- Uruguay beat Ghana in a dramatic penalty shoot out to reach the semifinals of the World Cup where they will face the Netherlands. But Ghana were left to rue a missed penalty in the last minute of extra time on Friday night which denied them the honor of becoming the first African team to reach the semifinals. The penalty was awarded after Ghana's Dominic Adiyiah had his first shot blocked on the line by Luis Suarez and his follow up effort was kept out out by the Uruguayan striker's hand. It meant a red card for Suarez, but Asamoah Gyan's spotkick hit the crossbar to stun Ghana and their supporters in Johannesburg's Soccer City. In the shootout, Sebastian Abreu coolly chipped Richard Kingson in the Ghana goal for the clinching goal in the penalties to give his side an unassailable 4-2 lead. Ghana were always on the backfoot after John Mensah and Adiyiah had weak efforts saved by Uruguayan goalkeeper Fernando Muslera . Maxi Pereira also blazed over for Uruguay but Abreu kept his nerve to put his side through. They will play the Netherlands in the semifinals in Cape Town next Tuesday, but Suarez will miss out after his sending off. The Dutch had upset Brazil 2-1 earlier Friday. Ghana, the only team from Africa to reach the knockout stage, went ahead in first half stoppage time as midfielder Sulley Muntari scored with a superb long-range strike. But Uruguay's star striker Diego Forlan equalized with a swerving free-kick which deceived Ghana keeper Kingson in the 55th minute. Both teams had opportunities to claim victory in normal time but the match was petering out in extra time until the cruel last-gasp drama. Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez acknowledged his team had been fortunate to go through. ""I am very emotional. We didn't play well, but we have gone through,"" he told AFP. ""The players are very strong and have a strong team spirit. We have a little time to prepare for the match against Holland but we are going there to win.""

"Teresopolis, Brazil (CNN) -- The death toll from flooding caused by torrential rains in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro state rose to 591 people Saturday, Brazil's official news agency reported. Most of the deaths were reported in the cities of Nova Friburgo and Teresopolis, located in a mountainous region northeast of Rio, according to Agencia Brasil. Rescuers have not been able to reach some hard-hit areas and many more people are feared dead, the agency said Friday. The rain is predicted to continue for several days in areas already submerged in water or slathered with mud. Thousands of families are still living on mountain slopes or on riverbanks and face extreme risk of being washed away. One resident described the disaster as a tsunami that fell from the sky. Chaos reigned in the especially hard-hit city of Teresopolis, where some residents donned masks and helped clean streets or deliver first aid. Others combed the city, searching desperately for missing loved ones. Schools and police stations turned into overflowing morgues, where people waited to identify their family and friends. Municipal worker Reginald de Oliveira came to see if he could find the body of his uncle, missing in the floods. He was trying to save his family when a wall of water washed him away. Red Cross volunteer Maria Helena de Jesus was helping with first aid. ""You have to almost have a heart of stone,"" she said. ""It was very difficult."" Teresopolis Mayor Jorge Mario Sedlacek declared his city a natural disaster area. At least 257 people died in Teresopolis, while 267 were killed in the town of Nova Friburgo, Agencia Brasil reported. President Dilma Rousseff flew over flood-affected areas Thursday and landed in a slushy, trash-littered soccer field in Friburgo, the agency said. The floods are her first test as president. She trudged through mud in her rain boots to talk to residents in a neighborhood where four of seven firefighters attempting to rescue people had been buried under mud. Three others were pulled out alive. ""We are going to take firm action,"" to help the devastated areas, said Rousseff, who assumed office at the first of the year. Brazilian authorities have been criticized for a lack of disaster planning and allowing people to build homes in areas known to become treacherous in the rainy season. They are under increasing pressure to show a strong response. Brazil is scheduled to host the World Cup in 2014 and the Olympics in 2016. With more rain forecast, Brazilian authorities have ordered evacuations for at least 5,000 families living in especially perilous areas in Rio de Janeiro state, Agencia Brasil said. Another 3,000 families from a mountainous region were homeless and sheltered in schools and gymnasiums, the news agency said. ""The most important thing right now is to assist the homeless population and reach the most critical points,"" said Rodrigo Neves, the state secretary of Social Welfare and Human Rights. State health officials pleaded for people to donate blood that will be sent to the Serrana region, where only 36 units of blood remained for treatment of flood victims. Rain has affected neighboring Sao Paulo as well, killing 24 people there, authorities said. Journalists Fabiana Frayssinet and Helena DeMoura contributed to this report.","Most of the deaths occurred in hard-hit cities of Teresopolis and Nova Friburgo .

"Kiev (CNN) -- Pro-Russian protesters who disarm and leave occupied buildings will not be prosecuted, Ukraine's acting President Oleksandr Turchynov said Thursday. ""In the case when people put down their weapons and free administrative buildings, we don't need to approve laws about amnesty. We guarantee there will be no criminal prosecutions of people who put down their weapons and leave the buildings. And I am prepared to formalize it with a presidential decree,"" Turchynov told parliament. He added that ""the main problem is that the people who are holding the buildings in Donetsk and Luhansk are being used by the enemies of Ukraine."" The announcement came a day after Ukrainian acting Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said the separatist protests in Ukraine's eastern region would be resolved within 48 hours -- either through negotiations or the use of force. The protests, which began Sunday, have been centered in three eastern cities: Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv. The United States has accused Russia of fomenting the separatist unrest as a pretext for military intervention. Speaking Thursday in the Czech Republic, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen also pointed the finger at Moscow for ""stirring up ethnic tensions in eastern Ukraine and provoking unrest."" And he cast doubt on Russia's assertion that the troops it has along Ukraine's eastern border are simply there for military exercises. ""As I speak, some 40,000 Russian troops are massed along Ukraine's borders,"" he said. ""Not training, but ready for combat. We have seen the satellite images, day after day."" The United States also estimates there are up to 40,000 Russian troops near the border, based on classified and commercial satellite imagery. Military hardware . A series of satellite images released Thursday by NATO appear to show large amounts of Russian military hardware, including armored vehicles, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, massed at different places near the Ukrainian border. This is accompanied by the full range of ""combat support"" capabilities, such as medical facilities, fuel, food, spare parts, logistics and maintenance, NATO sources told CNN. The U.S. ambassador in Kiev, Geoffrey Pyatt, also posted photos via Twitter on Wednesday to illustrate the U.S. estimates of Russia's troop buildup. The images depict what is said to be a field outside the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don -- empty in October, but filled with troops and armored vehicles on April 2. A U.S. official with direct knowledge of the matter told CNN those photos ""are consistent"" with classified imagery. Washington is sharing some information with the Ukrainians, but not highly classified intelligence, the official said. Ukraine was aligned with Moscow until a month ago, and it is believed that Ukraine's security services are still penetrated by the Russians, the official said. 'Nothing but propaganda' Russia's Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that Ukraine and the United States have ""no reason for concern"" about the presence of Russian forces, which it says are on military exercises. ""Russia has repeatedly stated that it does not conduct unusual or unplanned activities which are militarily significant on its territory near the border with Ukraine,"" the ministry said in a prepared statement. But Rasmussen had stern words for Russia's leaders, accusing them of spreading misinformation to justify their behavior. ""Russia is trying to justify its actions by accusing the Ukrainian authorities of oppressing Russian speakers. And by accusing NATO of a Cold War mentality,"" he said. ""This is nothing but propaganda. Designed to subvert the Ukrainian government, pervert the truth and divert attention from Russia's own illegal and illegitimate actions."" The West has strongly condemned Russia for annexing Ukraine's southeastern Crimea region last month, after a referendum held while pro-Russian forces controlled the Black Sea peninsula. It fears Russian President Vladimir Putin may next seek to invade eastern Ukraine, where there are also many ethnic Russians. Putin said Thursday that Russia had not planned in advance to absorb Crimea, according to Russian state news agency ITAR-Tass. ""I made final decisions only after the mood of the people became clear, because we had not been preparing for such developments,"" Putin is quoted as telling Russian social activists. Asset freezes . As the interim government works to realign the country with Europe, the state financial monitoring office announced asset freezes Thursday against ousted President Viktor Yanukovych and dozens of those close to him. Bank accounts belonging to 67 representatives of the previous government have been blocked, the office said. The action comes as the office investigates the alleged laundering of money ""obtained as the result of corruption, theft and appropriation of budget resources and property by the Ukrainian ex-President and his family, as well as members of the previous government and people connected with it,"" it said. It also concerns people accused of involvement in the deaths of protesters whose street demonstrations pushed Yanukovych out of office, and of those accused of organizing separatist activity in Ukraine, the office said. Gas prices . The crackdown on alleged corruption comes as Ukraine's interim government seeks also to shore up its struggling economy. Its dependence on Russia for supplies of natural gas is a key area of concern, especially in light of a hefty price hike last month that took the cost to nearly $500 per 1,000 cubic meters. Ukraine owes about $2.2 billion for natural gas bills to Gazprom, Russia's state-owned energy monopoly. Putin warned in an open letter Thursday to 18 European leaders that Gazprom could demand advance payment or even shut off the gas supply to Ukraine if it doesn't pay up, according to the state-run RIA Novosti news agency. ""We fully realize that this (move) increases the risk of natural gas passing through Ukraine's territory being siphoned off as it heads to European consumers,"" Putin is quoted as writing. ""We also realize that this may make it difficult for Ukraine to accumulate sufficient gas reserves for use in the autumn and winter period."" Ukrainian Energy Minister Yuriy Prodan told CNN earlier that Russia was using its energy dominance as a weapon. ""Russia announced an unacceptable price for Ukraine. There is no justification for this, and of course Ukraine cannot accept that price, which is almost $500 for 1,000 cubic meters,"" he said. ""This is a political cost. It is an economic weapon which Russia is now using after they made a war in Crimea."" He said that Ukraine is ready to pay its debt but wants to pay it within the parameters of a 2013 agreement -- a deal that has since been torn up by Russia. Negotiations continue over the price, which Russia has increased by 81% since Yanukovych was ousted in February, but Moscow has not accepted Ukraine's proposals, he said. Prodan says Ukraine, which produces only limited amounts of gas itself, is not piping gas from Russia and has enough in reserve to last three months. But it needs a new deal either with Russia or Europe for gas before July, when it has to start stockpiling gas for essential winter heating, he said. CNN's Kellie Morgan reported from Kiev and Laura Smith-Spark wrote and reported in London. CNN's Barbara Starr, Lindsay Isaac, Carol Jordan, Holly Yan contributed to this report.","NEW: Putin writes to European leaders warning that Russia could cut off gas to Ukraine .

"(CNN)  -- A decade-long civil war wrecked Sierra Leone's economy, but now a juice business could provide a blueprint of how to add value to the country's exports. Although the civil war in Sierra Leone ended nine years ago, it is only now that the country's first significant value-added export has emerged. Africa Felix Juice produces juice concentrate from mango and pineapple farmed throughout Sierra Leone and exports it internationally. The company is working from a special economic zone, in the form of a 54-acre low-tax industrial park, built just outside of the capital Freetown. It is designed to attract foreign interest and although similar zones exist in other parts of Africa, this project is a first for Sierra Leone. The zone was set up by First Step -- a commercial subsidiary of the American NGO World Hope International. First Step discovered that many farmers in Sierra Leone struggle to turn their fresh produce into money and that a lot of fruit ends up unsold or left rotting on the ground. Sierra Leone's Deputy Minister of Information Sheka Tarawalie admits: ""We have fruits like mangos, pineapples all over the country, but they are being wasted, and there is not much value added to these resources."" First Step's industrial park is intended to house factories that can process Sierra Leone's natural resources, rather than simply exporting them. Richard Schroeder, First Step's CEO, sees the industrial park as a logical solution to help develop new business in the country. He says: ""We're just making it possible for businesses to easily establish and employ people to start processing resources locally instead of what always happens in Africa, which is, it's seen as a source of natural resources. ""Natural resources are dug up, brought some place else, cut down or taken out of the water, and processed and sent back to Africa or other places in the world, when the real value addition is, where jobs are created, where income is created -- where an economy can really find its engine."" There are stringent selection criteria for potential tenants to obtain a plot in the industrial park. ""There has to be a commitment to not only the financial bottom line,"" says Schroeder. ""We're looking for tenants that also are passionate and care about their impact in terms of social impact and environmental impact."" Africa Felix Juice is now the first tenant and enjoys a three-year tax holiday, along with security, electricity and water supplies. Majority-owned by First Step, Africa Felix was founded by Claudio Scotto. Its mission is, ""to become a pioneer and leader in the Fairtrade tropical fruit juice concentrate market in the EU."" It pays farmers about $250 to $300 for each tree harvest--- a substantial jump from the $15 they would get at the local market. Africa Felix Juice eventually plans to directly employ close to 100 Sierra Leoneans and provide a market for nearly 1,000 small farmers throughout the country. ""We're targeting the fair-trade niche of the business, obviously, because Sierra Leone has a difficult past,"" says Claudio. ""A fruit juice coming from Sierra Leone, we think, will have a very good impact into European consumers that can now choose something tangible coming from a place that they were thinking is only war, famine and death,"" he added. Although special economic zones have been successful in Asia, some analysts have voiced concern that they won't work in countries without a well-developed labor force or infrastructure. But with Africa Felix Juice up and running, and farmers receiving increased profits, the success of the project has not gone unnoticed. ""First Step is doing something that is historic, is unheard of in contemporary history in our country,"" says Tarawalie. ""And they're changing the lives of people in the sense that they can see development taking place in our own lifetime."" He says he hopes Africa Felix Juice and the special economic zone will act as a catalyst for potential investors, demonstrating that, ""we have created an enabling environment for companies to come in and do their business without hindrance.""","Special economic zone is a first for Sierra Leone .

"(CNN) -- Pity the poor U.S. airport; its self-esteem has taken a beating in recent months. In February, as reported by the New York Daily News, Vice President Joe Biden said New York's frequently lambasted LaGuardia Airport ""feels like it's in some third world country."" ""Why did we lead the world economically for so long?"" Biden lamented. ""We had the most modern infrastructure in the world."" In March, the UK-based Skytrax consultancy released its annual list of the world's top 100 airports. The highest ranking any U.S. airport managed to muster was No. 27, achieved by the relatively small Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Now, The Economist has joined the dogpile. After combing through data on more than a million flights in 2013, the venerable British magazine concludes in its current issue that U.S. airports are ""awful,"" beset by ""soggy pizza, surly security staff and endless queues."" The Economist article poses the million- (or, rather, multimillion-) dollar question: ""Why are foreign airports better than America's?"" Perhaps indicative of the global traveling public's dismissal of the standards at U.S. airports, the online article doesn't bother to provide an answer. Best eats at 20 busiest U.S. airports . Hope for U.S. airports? Well ... maybe . ""There's no question that U.S. airports suffer from an image problem globally, and the main culprit is our nation's lack of dedicated infrastructure investment, particularly in its aviation infrastructure,"" Airports Council International North America President and CEO Kevin M. Burke said. ""Many of our airports are operating well beyond the capacity for which they were originally intended several decades ago, and this is the reason why air travelers -- international and domestic -- experience crowded terminals and outdated facilities. ""The other source of harm to our global reputation has been the unacceptably long waiting times to process through customs at U.S. international airports."" Burke is optimistic about correcting the problems, pointing to a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection announcement that it will add 2,000 officers, many assigned to airports. ""ACI-NA has been working with Congress for additional staffing, and with international traffic on the rise, this increase could not have come at a more critical time for U.S. airports,"" Burke said. Hong Kong airport glory days, breathtaking photos . Meager public funding bedevils performance, improvement . At the root of many problems experienced by travelers at U.S. airports is an atypical system of governance and finance. Unlike many of their overseas counterparts, U.S. airports are predominantly owned and operated by city, county or state governments. ""This means that how they are funded is far more restricted than the rest of the world,"" Burke said. ""For our large hub airports, their primary source of funding for capital improvement projects is the Passenger Facility Charge."" The charge is a nominal user fee paid by passengers upon purchase of airline tickets in the United States, ""virtually all of which,"" according to Burke, is returned to the airport for investment in infrastructure projects. 10 of the world's top airport lounges . The problem is, the fee no longer amounts to as much as it once did. ""The PFC's ceiling of $4.50 hasn't been raised since 2000, and this has meant that its purchasing power has eroded by roughly half due to inflation over the past 14 years,"" says Burke. Lack of Passenger Facility Charge punch has hindered significant improvements and updates at many major U.S. airports. Despite all this, Burke, and perhaps at least some of the millions of visitors who continue to pour into U.S. airports each year, remains bullish about the future of U.S. airports. But can U.S. airports realistically improve vis-a-vis their international counterparts in, say, the next five to 10 years? ""Yes, but it's going to take an unwavering commitment to upgrading our infrastructure,"" Burke said. ""It's crucial that Congress and the American public recognize that infrastructure investment in airports is reinvestment in the communities they connect to rest of the world. ""And in an increasingly global marketplace, the U.S. will require world-leading airports to stay competitive."" Or, by now, simply to catch up to a field that has already, by many estimates, flown far ahead of them.

"(CNN) -- Christchurch may come back now that the earth-rumbling monster that devoured the city's downtown is gone, but the pointy-hatted, black-robed man who preached almost daily outside the cathedral on his ""theory of everything"" will not. The Wizard of New Zealand -- as he is known, and listed in telephone directories -- says he's calling it quits, now that his public stage has been destroyed. So he is moving down island with his 91-year-old mother to the east coast town of Oamaru. ""Almost every building I really love is gone,"" he said. ""My platform is gone. Without Cathedral Square I can't function. I am heart-broken."" The Wizard, who is otherwise known by his given name, Ian Brackenbury Channell, has been entertaining tourists and fans since 1974. Channell did so first as a wanted soapboxing miscreant evading arrest, and later as an honoraria-paid attraction registered by a local gallery as ""living work of art."" Channell was awarded the Queen's Service Medal in 2009 and, during a chance meeting, told Sir Ian McKellen, the actor who played Gandalf in ""The Lord of the Rings,"" how a ""real"" wizard does the job. Channell travels with his own special passport that bears the name ""The Wizard of New Zealand,"" according to his website. Besides being a wizard, the London, England-born Channell is also a comic, teacher and politician with views that are not easily categorized. Soon after arriving in New Zealand, he founded the ""Imperial British Conservative Party."" Channell, a former sociology professor at the University of South Wales, had previously run three times for Parliament in Australia -- and lost. At the university, Channell managed to persuade the vice chancellor to declare him wizard of the institution, his website states. ""People think I'm mad, but they can't prove it. They also think I'm evil, but they can't prove it,"" said the wizard. ""So they're stuffed."" Channell said he was headed out the door to make his daily appearance at Cathedral Square when the earthquake struck around 12:50 p.m. Between November and Easter, the wizard makes his daily appearance in the square at 1 p.m. ""It felt like being in a cocktail machine,"" the wizard said. Magically, perhaps, Channel's house was largely unharmed by the temblor. The wizard shrugged off the suggestion that had he left the house early, he might have been killed. Thwarted from his daily wizarding duties downtown, Channell said he went knocking about his neighborhood to offer his help and managed to find a dog in distress. The dog, a Brussels Griffon named Molly, was drowning in water that seeped up from the ground until the wizard stepped in with a rescue that made headlines. While Channell may have the power to save a drowning dog, saving Christchurch is beyond his magical abilities. He predicted that the old Gothic buildings in the city center will be replaced by skyscrapers. ""Unless they have a change of heart, the heritage and the image of Christchurch will be gone,"" Channell said. The wizard's part of that heritage is disappearing for a different reason, he says. ""Young and old are going to the internet,"" said Channell. ""People don't go to the square to exchange ideas so much anymore.""","""My platform is gone. Without Cathedral Square I can't function,"" he says .

"Dakar, Senegal (CNN) -- The aliens have landed -- and they look rather fabulous. Centuries rolled forward and outfits got quirkier in the heart of Dakar late last month as Senegalese fashion designer Selly Raby Kane showed off her futuristic creations for her latest collection, ""Alien Cartoon."" Set in 2244, the dazzling show transformed Dakar's 100-year-old deserted train station into a whimsical space where humans co-existed alongside strange and mysterious creatures -- from alien invaders and giant metallic insects to a massive inflatable octopus whose glowing tentacles stretched throughout the historic building. ""Alien Cartoon is a story about an African invaded city where weird, fantastic and sci-fi creatures evolve among human beings,"" says Kane. ""My collection is an answer to what the consequences of the invasion would be on women's and men's wardrobes, on music, on architecture -- what would that city look like? What would its inhabitants wear?"" 'Surreal universe' The answers were both eye-catching and grandiose. More than just a fashion show, ""Alien Cartoon"" brought together nearly 120 models, actors, musicians and art performers who created an otherworldly experience for some 2,000 spectators. Read this: Luxury shoes put sparkle in your step . Amid the giant installations, streams of models in translucent parkas, quilted tops, full-length jumpsuits, leather prints and LED accessories paced up and down the runway to the sound of hypnotic electronic beats. Blending urban culture with strong pop art influences, Kane's structured creations nodded to the fantasy worlds staged by directors like Tim Burton, while being firmly rooted in Dakar. ""It was important to confront the Senegalese audience with a fashion point of view that is alternative, playful and inhabited by that surreal universe,"" says Kane. Passion for fashion . The talented designer is part of an exciting and ambitious generation of young Senegalese artists that want to share their creative visions both locally and internationally. A member of the artistic collective ""Les Petites Pierres,"" Kane first started drawing clothes at a young age while growing up in Dakar. After high school, she went on to study business and law but her love for fashion never wavered -- in 2008, Kane created her first collection and two years later she headed to France for fashion studies. She then returned to Senegal and in 2012 Kane presented her ""Be Street"" collection, a massive urban decor production that paid tribute to street art through music and cinema. ""I have very strong cinematographic references,"" says the young designer on a hot May afternoon, sitting inside the Les Petites Pierres compound in a dusty neighborhood of southwestern Dakar. ""I am addicted to everything that makes me leave Earth and discover other things, other realities,"" adds Kane. ""From my first fashion show and the first time I've presented my collection there has been a small evolution and everything is going to that path; that fantastic and surreal approach of what a garment is."" 'This is who I am' That journey culminated last month with ""Alien Cartoon"" and now Kane says she's determined to continue developing her brand and collaborating with other artists. Yet, the road has not always been free of hurdles. ""Fashion in other countries is more organized,"" says Kane. ""When you are a young designer [abroad] you know where you have to go, where you have to produce your pieces, where you can distribute it. Everything is organized, and here you have to do it yourself."" She quickly adds, however, that these challenges only serve to motivate her to push her boundaries and work harder. ""This is who I am, this is where I live and it's important for me to do it here,"" says Kane. ""I have the feeling it really matters -- it really inspires other people and I am inspired as well by the people surrounding me,"" she says. ""It makes sense to do it here, on the continent, and after, maybe when we get bigger, go somewhere [else] -- but we have a duty to develop things from here.""

"(CNN) -- Moments after blasting what he called Russia's illegal ""military aggression"" of his nation, Ukraine's interim leader insisted Thursday that a peaceful resolution that ends with Kiev and Moscow becoming ""real partners"" is still possible. ""We still believe that we have a chance to resolve these conflicts in a peaceful manner,"" interim Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk told the U.N. Security Council. Yatsenyuk's remarks come as thousands of Russian troops staged military exercises not far from his nation's border. And they are entirely new, given that Ukrainian officials have previously called for talks and slammed what they say is Russia's military invasion of their country, something that Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied. Still, the stage -- addressing representatives of the world's most powerful nations, Russia among them -- makes the assertions more salient, as does the fast approaching referendum in which residents of the Crimean Peninsula will vote whether to secede from Ukraine and join Russia. Ukraine has been simmering since last November, when protesters angry at the sitting government -- in part for its president's move toward Russia and away from the European Union -- began hitting the streets. In February, after deadly clashes between government forces and demonstrators, President Viktor Yanukovych was ousted (he soon took refuge in Russia). With that, the focus moved from Ukraine's west, which tends to lean more European, to its south and east, where ties to Russia are stronger. Rising tensions have centered on Crimea, where local officials have declared their autonomy from Ukraine and alliance with Russia, as armed men have blockaded and taken other actions against Ukrainian military and other posts. Tensions also have spilled over into other parts of eastern Ukraine, such as Donetsk, where the regional health authority said a 22-year-old man was stabbed to death and at least 10 others were injured in clashes Thursday between pro-Ukraine and pro-Russian protesters. While the bloodshed has been limited so far, fears are percolating that this crisis could turn into a full-scale military conflict. ""We are looking for an answer to the question of whether the Russians want war,"" Yatsenyuk said Thursday in Russian. ""I am sure that, as the prime minister of Ukraine, (which) for decades had warm and friendly relations with Russia, I am convinced that Russians do not want war. Russia kicks off military drill . On Thursday, Putin reiterated his longstanding stance: Ukraine's crisis was caused by internal factors, not by Russia. And if people in Crimea -- including ethnic Russians -- want to be part of Russia, that's their right and likewise Moscow's right to protect them. Speaking after Yatsenyuk at the United Nations, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vitaly Churkin accused the West of having ""fanned the flames of unrest"" in Ukraine by their officials' ""blatant interference,"" which he said contributed to Yanukovych's ""illegal"" ouster. Since then, the Ukraine's pro-western government has exacerbated the crisis by clamping down on opposition and effectively ""splitting this country (into) two parts,"" Churkin said. As to Sunday's referendum, the ambassador said citizens there deserve the same right to self-determination as anyone: ""Why should the Crimeans be the exception?"" Even as Moscow hasn't said it wants to takeover Ukraine, its military has become noticeably active in the region of late -- and not just its thousands of troops stationed in Crimea. Its most recent such action was starting military drills Thursday involving about 8,500 artillery men in the southern part of the country bordering Ukraine, according to Russia's defense ministry. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power portrayed the ""new military operations"" as connected to the ""Russian military intervention,"" telling the Security Council on Thursday that they involve ""artillery batteries, assault helicopters and at least 10,000 additional soldiers near the Ukrainian border."" These exercises -- which include rocket launchers, howitzers and anti-tank cannons -- aim to ""improve the cooperation between artillery (units) and motorized rifle forces, tank forces, air cavalry and the marines,"" Russia's defense ministry said. The Southern Military District borders Ukraine and includes the North Caucasian Military District, the Black Sea Fleet and the Caspian flotilla, the ministry said. One of its four bases is in the Ukrainian city of Sevastopol. The troops involved in these drills seemingly are in addition to the up to 25,000 Russian troops already stationed in Ukraine. Not far away, U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is expected to announce plans to keep the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush in the Mediterranean Sea longer than planned to reassure NATO allies who may be feeling insecure after Russia's moves in Crimea, CNN has learned. Asked about the decision to keep the aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, a senior administration official said not to expect much more muscle-flexing, or additional military steps, before Sunday. Ukraine financial package stalled in Congress . Russia's military activities within Ukraine itself -- including whether its troops are among the men, whose uniforms did not have insignias, who have seemingly marooned Ukraine's military there -- are a matter of intense scrutiny and debate. Yatsenyuk stated Thursday he has no doubt Russian troops have intervened, despite having ""no grounds"" to do so. He said Russia's military presence ""is clearly identified,"" pointing out that vehicles used by some armed men have Russian license plates. ""This is absolutely and entirely unacceptable in the 21st century to resolve any kind of (conflict) with boots on the ground,"" the interim prime minister said. Western officials warn Moscow . Western officials, meanwhile, warned Thursday that Russia will face significant consequences unless it changes course in Crimea, with U.S. President Barack Obama pledging to ""stand with Ukraine."" In a speech to the German parliament, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Sunday's secession referendum is unconstitutional and Russia's presence in the Black Sea peninsula violates Ukraine's territorial integrity. She warned Putin that his actions would lead to ""catastrophe"" for Ukraine. ""It would also change Russia economically and politically,"" she said. In a phone call, French President Francois Hollande told Putin the referendum ""has no legal basis,"" urging the Russian leader to ""do everything to prevent the annexation of Crimea to Russia."" At a Senate committee hearing in Washington, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry -- who is set to meet Friday with his Russian counterpart -- predicted that the upcoming vote would favor Crimea rejoining Russia. But he warned that, absent movement by Russia toward negotiating with Ukraine on the crisis, ""there will be a very serious series of steps Monday in Europe and here."" Already, the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said it had postponed activities related to Russia's process for membership in the organization. In a boost to Kiev, members also ""agreed that the OECD should respond positively to Ukraine's request to further strengthen existing OECD-Ukraine cooperation to take advantage of the OECD's expertise to address the public policy challenges it faces."" 'Putin's opinion is much more important' Crimea is on edge, as evidenced by flaring tensions and growing worries as evidenced by long lines at banks in the regional capital of Simferopol. Separately, Crimean authorities have secured offshore Ukrainian oil and gas projects in the Black and Azov seas, as well as the Chernomorneftegaz company's oil and gas fields, Russia's state-run RIA Novosti news agency reported Thursday, citing Crimean parliamentary speaker Vladimir Konstantinov. ""These deposits and the platform fully become the property of the Republic of Crimea,"" he said. ""We have guarded them. These are our fields and we will fight for them."" A decision on Ukraine's Chernomorneftegaz has not been made, Russia's Interfax news agency reported, citing Crimean Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliev. He said consultations would take place on whether ""this enterprise will remain the property of the Republic of Crimea or will become part of Gazprom,"" the Russian energy giant. Ukraine's armed forces deployed in Crimea have been bottled up since late last month, but they're free to leave their bases to vote in the referendum, said Yury Zherebtsov, the Crimean government's official in charge of the ballot, according to Interfax. Zherebtsov said officials had visited military bases across Crimea to convince soldiers that ""they have simply become hostage of the Ukrainian government"" and to understand that ""the only way to maintain the peace and unity of the Crimean people is by forming a union with Russia."" The new, pro-Russian government on the southeastern peninsula has said that if the voters opt to join Russia, the first step would be to declare Crimea an independent and sovereign state. Then it will apply to join the Russian Federation. INFOGRAPHIC: Comparing Ukraine and Russia's military forces . CNN's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Simferopol, as did journalist Nadjie Femi.

"(CNN) -- Police in the Seychelles investigating the deaths of two former U.S. Navy SEALs have video surveillance showing the private security guards enjoying a night out before the men were found dead in a cabin of the Maersk Alabama, a source with knowledge of the investigation tells CNN. The video led police to two women -- who, the source says, authorities believe to be prostitutes -- seen with the American security guards during the evening. Those women reportedly have identified a location where they say the two men purchased heroin. Video from several surveillance cameras show the security guards in a restaurant and a casino and on a public street in the Seychelles at night while the Maersk Alabama was in port. As CNN reported last week, autopsy results indicate the Americans found dead on the container ship on February 18 died of respiratory failure, coupled with suspected heart attacks. Traces of narcotics and hypodermic needles found with the bodies suggested the deaths resulted from drug overdoses, Seychelles authorities said. Further forensic analysis will be carried out to establish if the two men, 44-year-old Jeffrey Reynolds and 43-year-old Mark Kennedy, had consumed a substance that may have caused their deaths. ""The police preliminary investigation report includes suspicion of drug use, as indicated by the presence of a syringe and traces of heroin which were found in the cabin,"" according to police. Toxicology results are not expected for another three weeks, but police spokesperson Jean Toussaint says a criminal investigation continues, and ""solid evidence could lead to formal arrests in the deaths."" Toussaint confirmed to CNN that the women seen with the men on surveillance video are cooperating with police, but would not give details on the investigation. The two men worked for Trident Group, a Virginia-based maritime security services firm. Trident Group President Tom Rothrauff said both were former Navy SEALs. The 500-foot Maersk Alabama was the target of an attempted hijacking in the pirate-infested waters off East Africa in 2009, an incident that inspired the 2013 film ""Captain Phillips."" The shipping giant Maersk, which hired the Trident Group to guard its ships, said last week that Trident would be conducting random drug tests of its employees. ""Based on our experience with the contractor, this is an isolated incident,"" Maersk said. But it said new drug tests would start immediately and the company's shore leave policy was under review. Police said the ship arrived on February 16 in the Seychelles, an archipelago in the Indian Ocean, with a 24-man crew and had been expected to leave two days later. The bodies were found February 18 by a colleague who had gone to check in with one of the men in a cabin, Seychelles police said. The Maersk Alabama has since left the Seychelles capital of Port Victoria.","The two Americans were found dead onboard the Maersk Alabama on February 18 .

"(CNN) -- It was 1969 and a busy year for making history: Woodstock, the Miracle Mets, men on the moon -- and something less celebrated but arguably more significant, the birth of the Internet. On October 29 of that year, for perhaps the first time, a message was sent over the network that would eventually become the Web. Leonard Kleinrock, a professor of computer science at the University of California-Los Angeles, connected the school's host computer to one at Stanford Research Institute, a former arm of Stanford University. Forty years ago today, the Internet may have uttered its first word. Twenty years later, Kleinrock chaired a group whose report on building a national computer network influenced Congress in helping develop the modern Internet. Kleinrock holds more than a dozen patents and was awarded the National Medal of Science last year by President Bush. In an interview with CNN, the 75-year-old looks back on his achievements and peers into the exciting and sometimes scary future of the Web he helped create. CNN: In basic terms, what happened on October 29, 1969, and what was its importance to the Internet as we know it today? Kleinrock: Millions of people helped create this Internet. I basically supervised the creation of the Internet at the first node, both in the first connection and the very first message. We had just by then connected the first two host computers to the Internet. The first one was on September 2, 1969, when UCLA connected its host computer to the first packet switcher, the first router if you will, ever on the Internet. But there was no other computer to talk to. So a month later, Stanford Research Institute received its interface message processor, or IMP, connected it to their host computer, and we created the first piece of the backbone network when a 50-kilobit-per-second line was connected between UCLA and SRI. What we wanted to do was send a message essentially from UCLA to SRI's host. And frankly, all we wanted to do was log in -- to type an l-o-g, and the remote time-sharing system knows what you're trying to do. So we typed the ""l,"" and we asked over the phone, ""Did you get the 'l?' "" And the response came back, ""Yep, we got the 'l.' "" We typed the ""o."" ""Got the 'o?' "" "" 'Yep, got the 'o.' "" Typed the 'g.' ""You get the 'g?' "" Crash! SRI's host crashed at that point. So the very first message ever on the Internet was the very simple, very prophetic ""lo,"" as in lo and behold. And, you know, we weren't aware that this was a significant event that would be recorded in history. We did not have a very effective message like ""What hath God wrought"" or ""Come here, Watson, I need you."" Or ""One giant leap for mankind."" We just weren't that smart. When the host computers talked to each other, I like to say the Internet uttered its first words on that day. CNN: Before October 29, 1969, was no computer talking to any other computer? Kleinrock: Well, typically not over a data connection, no. What was going on at that time was that many users sitting at terminals were connected to time-sharing systems with a local connection. But that was just connecting to a single computer. CNN: UCLA sent a press release about your work in July of 1969, just a few months before your October breakthrough. At the time, did you have any idea how far-reaching all this was? Kleinrock: Basically, I said the Internet will be always on, always available, [and that] everybody with any device could connect to the Internet from any time and any location, and it would be as invisible as electricity. What I missed was the social aspect, namely that my 99-year-old mother would be on the Internet, as she was until she passed away two years ago. And by the way, at the same time, my preschool granddaughter would be on the Internet. CNN: What is feature shock? Kleinrock: Feature shock is a term I coined some years ago. Systems [such as Windows or Safari] contain an enormous number of features, each one of which may be valuable by itself, but no one is really able to use all the features. However, because you've essentially paid for all those features, you feel guilty if you don't exploit them. So you spend time learning to use them. I'm a power user of PowerPoint. I spend thousands of hours learning how to use it effectively. If someone came along with a new version of PowerPoint that has a different interface than the one I'm used to, and [even] if it were twice as good as PowerPoint, I wouldn't bother installing it. We're overwhelmed by [features]; we don't know how to use them. It slows down the rate at which new applications and features are accepted by the public because of this investment they have in their thousands of hours of learning. And I consider that a good thing. It allows a little more mature thinking in how we start hopping around in technologies and thereby losing the experience and history we had before. There's a kind of a measured way in which people will adopt new technology, and I think that's helpful. CNN: What are you up to these days in the development of the Internet? Kleinrock: I'm working on what we call smart spaces, whereby the cyberspace comes out from behind the [computer] screen, where most people consider it residing, and moves out into your physical space so that there will be intelligence and embedded technology in the walls of your room, in your desk, in your fingernails, in your eyeglasses, in your automobile, in your hotel rooms all across the world as you move around. CNN: If computers will be doing so much of our thinking for us, does that mean our brains will get less of a workout? Kleinrock: It's always been the goal and desire of we technologists that as we provide capability that computers are good at -- number crunching, file storage, massive databases that can be searched -- that it would free us up to do the things that humans do so well, like pattern recognition and putting thoughts together, intuition and innovation. So it may relieve us of some of the mundane things that we don't do well. On the other hand, I personally regret that the youth of today are depending so much for their simple arithmetic calculations on these handheld calculators or wristwatch calculators that they don't know how to make change in the supermarkets anymore. CNN: What other dangers could be ahead? Kleinrock: There's a very dark side to the Internet, which we're all familiar with. It started with a worm in 1988, and it became spam in 1994, and now we have pornography, we have denial of service [attacks], we have identity theft, we have fraud, we have things like botnets [pieces of software that cyberthieves use to remotely and secretly control your computer], which really worry me. One of the problems of the Internet is that we didn't install what I like to call strong user authentication or strong file authentication. We didn't anticipate the level of the dark side we see today. The culture of the early Internet was one of trust of all the users. I knew every user on the Internet in those early days. It was an open culture. We shared everything we did. We got our gratification by putting things out there, which people could use. And there was an etiquette -- net etiquette if you will, which people behaved. CNN: What about privacy? Is it dead? Kleinrock: Yes, in a word. Yes. And it was voluntarily given up in many cases. I mean, when someone lists their telephone number or uses their credit card or makes a cell phone call or even carries around a cell phone, that's an awful lot of info about where you are, what you're doing and some of your private matters. There are cameras all over the place, and they're increasing in number. I like to say the only privacy we can expect is to go to the edge of the ocean, strip down and jump in and hope there's no sonar down there tracking you, by the way, which there will be soon. CNN: Do you like to play video games over the Internet? Kleinrock: The answer is no, no. I'm not of that generation. Nor do I use Facebook or Twitter. I've got enough things that demand my attention. ... E-mail is a wonderful black hole for my time. I don't want to have to answer tweets and SMS messages, following friends, etc. It's too demanding and too frivolous in many ways. CNN: Do you have a certain emotional tie to the Internet as if it were a member of the family? Kleinrock: Of course I do, and it's part and parcel to my DNA. But it's as aggravating to me as to anyone else in terms of when it doesn't work, when the applications don't work. CNN: Were you always an inventor? Kleinrock: When I was about 6 years old, I built a crystal radio from instructions I found in a Superman comic book. The thing that fascinated me was, I could basically get all the parts at no cost. I was totally enchanted. This was magic, and I spent the rest of my life trying to figure out how that works. Life is one big puzzle for me in the positive sense. There are a lot of things to play with. And they pay me for it.","Leonard Kleinrock sent first message over computer network October 29, 1969 .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A 49-year-old man from China is believed to be the world's first human infected with the H5N6 avian flu strain. The man, who was from Nanbu county in Sichuan province, died Tuesday in a hospital after receiving treatment, according to the Sichuan Provincial Health and Family Planning Commission. He suffered a severe case of pneumonia and was detected to have the H5N6 strain after a throat swab, according to the agency. The man had been exposed to dead poultry. Medical experts say this an isolated case and that the risk of human-to-human transmission remains low. People who had close contact with the patient did not show any symptoms after medical observation, according to the commission. Following this latest case, Taiwan issued a travel warning for Sichaun province, advising them to avoid contact with living or dead birds, according to Taiwan's Central News Agency. The H5N6 is believed to be a low-pathogenic bird flu virus that has been found in Germany, Sweden and United States, according to the Taiwanese news service. East Asia has seen several bird flu strains infecting humans recently. In March 2013, a new virus to humans, H7N9 was first reported in China. Since then, 115 people have died and 367 cases of H7N9 have been reported mostly in the country, according to figures from the World Health Organization from February. H7N9 bird flu resurges in China ahead of Lunar New Year . In May 2013, a 20-year-old woman became the first human to be infected with another bird flu strain called H6N1. The woman had not been exposed to poultry and she recovered after a few days, according to Taiwanese health officials. In December 2013, China reported the first human case of another avian flu virus, H10N8. The 73-year-old woman from Jiangxi province died. She had a history of contact with live poultry markets, according to the WHO. Health experts believe that most of these infections are a result of exposure to sickened poultry or contaminated environments.","China confirms first recorded human infection of H5N6 avian flu .

"(CNN)  -- Trailing what would become a fatal flight by some 27 minutes, the same kind of aircraft operated by the same airline traveled the same route last week and landed safely, the NTSB said Monday. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. The pilot of the second Continental Connection flight from Newark, New Jersey, to Buffalo, New York, reported ""moderate icing"" during the trip and ""made it to destination in Buffalo,"" said Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board. The second plane was a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400, like the plane that crashed Thursday night near the Buffalo airport, killing 49 people on board and one person on the ground. Also like the fatal flight, the aircraft was operated on the Continental Connection route by Colgan Air, Chealander said. Possible icing -- and how the aircraft and the flight crew performed if icing was an issue -- has become a focus in the aftermath of the crash of Flight 3407. The pilot and first officer of the flight discussed ""significant"" ice buildup on the aircraft's windshield and wings before the crash, the NTSB said after listening to the cockpit voice recorder. Chealander said Monday that he had been asked about possible icing on the aircraft's tail. ""If there's icing on the wings, there's icing on the tail,"" he said. ""The significance of that is yet to be determined."" The flight data recorder indicated the plane's deicing system was activated 11 minutes after takeoff from Newark and remained on until the crash, according to the NTSB. Chealander said investigators have recovered most of the pieces of that system and will examine those materials to determine whether the system was operating properly. Chealander also said questionnaires were being sent to every pilot who flew in the Buffalo vicinity the night of the crash to find out what icing conditions they might have encountered. He said the only report to air traffic controllers of ""severe"" icing that night came from a pilot ""well south of the Buffalo area."" On Sunday, Chealander gave details of the final violent seconds of the flight, saying the flight data recorder indicated that in the final seconds, the plane's nose pitched drastically up, then down, and the plane then rolled left 46 degrees and then right 105 degrees, or past the 90-degree vertical point. Before impact in a residential neighborhood, the plane fell 800 feet in five seconds, Chealander said. On Monday, he said about half the aircraft wreckage had been removed from the crash site and taken for detailed examination. Giving an indication of the explosive nature of the impact and subsequent fire, Chealander said wreckage is being taken away ""in bins and on trailers."" He said investigators hope to have all wreckage removed from the crash site by Wednesday, when a snowstorm is forecast for the area. Authorities have not discussed the status of the removal of victims' remains since Saturday night, when they said 15 bodies had been recovered.","NTSB says pilot who traveled same route in identical plane reported ""moderate icing""

"(CNN) -- Call it a meteorological mystery: Forecasters warned that there would be at least six Atlantic hurricanes this season, but so far we've seen only one. It's the first year in recent memory that every major hurricane forecast has busted after pointing to ""above normal activity."" We are passing the season's halfway point. Normally, the Atlantic would see its first hurricane by August 10, and a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher) by September 4. But this year is not normal. 2013's first hurricane -- Humberto -- was a month late. It was so behind schedule it nearly set a record for tardiness. Although the number of 2013 Atlantic storms is above average -- at nine so far -- the intensity of those storms hasn't matched the forecasts. Humberto -- a Category 1 with winds under 95 mph -- ranked nowhere close to a major hurricane when it spun out harmlessly in the mid-Atlantic. What's going on here? Climate change? El Niño? Something else? Experts don't have a full understanding, but three things are getting the blame: . --In the eastern Atlantic, where hurricanes are often born, African desert air is drying the moisture that hurricanes need to form. --In the western Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, fast horizontal winds have been cutting off the tops of potential hurricanes, sapping their power. --Experts speculate that dry air from Brazil's drought may be another factor. Chad Myers explains this strange hurricane season . Respected veteran hurricane scientist Bill Gray of Colorado State University has pretty much given up for this year. His research group predicted eight hurricanes this season.  ""The forecast up to now is a bust,"" says Gray. ""The second half of the season will be more active,"" he predicts, with as many as five more hurricanes. Even with the most sophisticated prediction techniques, Gray says, ""there's still 40 or 50% of variations in tropical storm and hurricane activity that we can't explain."" Poking fun at his government rivals, Gray jokes about ""reports of a suicide watch"" among the meteorologists who worked on this year's National Weather Service forecast. Nonetheless, the feds are standing firm. Unlike Gray, they're not ready to cry uncle. ""Our forecast remains the same,"" weather service spokesman Chris Vaccaro said. ""We're sticking by it."" The NWS -- last May -- initially forecast 13 to 20 ""named storms,"" including seven to 11 hurricanes. Then in August, it dialed down that initial forecast to predict 13 to 19 named storms, including six to nine hurricanes. So far, including Humberto, we've seen nine named storms. From the weather service's perspective, that statistic shows its forecast remains valid. ""In some ways we're ahead of schedule,"" says Vaccaro. ""And in late September and October there's plenty of time for the number of tropical storms and hurricanes to climb."" According to the weather service forecast, at least four more tropical storms or hurricanes will form in the next 11 weeks. That's 77 days, or one storm forming every 19 days. It would be a mistake to believe that the second half of any hurricane season would resemble the first half, says Vaccaro, who stresses that we're not experiencing a ""lull."" ""Historically speaking, June and July and the first part of August are typically fairly quiet,"" he says. September, he warns, is the time when storms can start to get get serious. Some key examples: . -Hurricane Gloria hit the eastern United States in September 1985. -In 1938 a disastrous hurricane tore up parts of the northeast, also during the month of September. -In 1998 one of the deadliest storms on record, Hurricane Mitch, raked the Caribbean and Central America after forming in late October. -Hurricane Sandy, which altered so many lives last year when it slammed into much of the Eastern Seaboard, didn't appear until October. -Although Andrew devastated South Florida in late August, it was the first hurricane of 1992, a season that overall turned out to be below normal. -In 2002, Gustav, the first hurricane of the season, didn't occur until September. Weeks later in early October, Hurricane Lili made a destructive landfall along the Louisiana coast. There's also always the possibility of a freak storm after the season ends, says Vaccaro. ""Nature sometimes throws us a curve ball as it has in the past when we've seen storms develop in the month of December."" How likely is it that the weather service forecast will pan out? In this crazy year, it's anybody's guess. Hurricane watchers point out that there are more signs that something may be amiss: . --The Accumulated Cyclone Energy index -- a rating system that compares the intensity of storm seasons -- would normally be around 55 for the Atlantic. It's now a paltry 16. Globally the rating is a stunning 255, roughly half of what we should see this time of year. --When an ocean basin kicks up a fuss on one part of the globe, usually another ocean basin is quiet. Nature tends to balance itself that way. This year, according to the ratings, storm activity in all the world's ocean basins is below normal. This adds even more to the mystery. --This year there is no El Niño, which would keep the season quiet, or La Niña, which would fuel a more active season. Atlantic surface temperatures continue to be above normal, which also would help stir up storms. --Climate change? As you might expect, opinions differ. Some researchers say global warming from the buildup of CO2 carbon gas pollution in the atmosphere will lead to more frequent and more powerful hurricanes. Some studies support that hypothesis, while others are less convinced. Although scientists are 95% sure that CO2 is warming the globe, they're not certain about how that affects hurricanes. ""There are mixed signals,"" says Vaccaro. ""So the jury's still out and research is ongoing."" Related: Silent hurricane season fuels debate over global warming . At the National Hurricane Center in Miami, they're comparing this year to ""a slow first half of a slow football game,"" says hurricane center spokesman Dennis Feltgen. ""It really doesn't matter how many storms form out there,"" Feltgen says. ""If one gets to you, it's a bad year."" The news media isn't making too much of this strange season, he says. But he warns, don't be fooled by it. Be prepared. The mystery has grabbed the attention of Gray and other scientists, who are looking forward to analyzing all the data. Who knows? We may learn a few things. ""We'll figure it out,"" says Gray. ""Let's see what the rest of the season brings.""

"(CNN) -- Three Napoli fans received hospital treatment and one remains in a critical condition Sunday after violence marred the Italian Cup final between Napoli and Fiorentina in Rome. Reports from domestic news agency ANSA said three Napoli supporters suffered gunshot wounds in clashes before Saturday's match in the Olympic stadium, while another from Rome was hospitalized with injuries. The condition of one of the Napoli fans, a 30-year-old, remained ""critical but stable"" after an operation to remove a bullet from near his spinal cord, doctors said. There have been conflicting reports of exactly who was responsible for the incidents and who fired the shots, but with almost 30,000 fans from each club arriving in a capital already boasting two other clubs, Roma and Lazio, the potential for violence was high and sadly this proved the case. Uneasy standoff . After news of the pre-match shootings filtered through to Napoli's fans in the Curva Nord (North End), the match was delayed and no official reason given. An uneasy stand off followed between the authorities and Napoli's ultras -- the club's hardcore, organized fan group -- who pelted the pitch with burning flares as the match was initially suspended. At one point Napoli's Slovakian striker Marek Hamsik appeared to remonstrate with the ultras in a bid to calm the situation down before being ushered away. ""These incidents are simply unacceptable,"" said Maurizio Beretta, the president of Lega Serie A, according to AFP. ""We appeal to the fans who are here for the final to treat it as it should be -- an evening of sport and football and not one that should give rise to episodes of violence."" The match eventually kicked off at 19.45 GMT, 45 minutes late. ""A football match shouldn't be about battles between two sets of supporters,"" said Italian Senate president Pietro Grosso, as quoted by AFP. ""We're here to see a final, to enjoy the game in a festive and sporting atmosphere. I'm saddened to see that this kind of thing is still going on."" Napoli triumph . After the delay a fine game of football finally broke out. Napoli's players, visibly effected by the atmosphere surrounding the game, raced out of the blocks and into a two goal lead. Twenty two year old Italy international Lorenzo Insigne, who was born and raised in Napoli, scored twice and could have had a hat trick. But Fiorentina fought back with Peruvian Juan Manuel Vargas and were then denied what appeared to be a legitimate goal that was called offside right before half time. The second half was a much cagier affair as Napoli coach Rafa Benitez, looking for a trophy in his first season at the club, tried to close the game down. Everything had gone to plan for Benitez and Napoli but a second yellow card for Swiss international Gokhan Inler with just over 10 minutes to go set of a frenetic end to the match. But Napoli broke away on the counter attack and Belgian international Dries Mertens made it 3-1, securing the club's fifth Coppa Italia success. Barca's title setback . Meanwhile, in Spain, Barcelona's hopes of defending the La Liga title suffered a serious setback after conceding an injury time equalizer against Getafe. Lionel Messi and Alexis Sanchez had twice given Barcelona the lead. But on both occasions Angel Lafita scored, his second with only minutes remaining to make it 2-2. There had been emotional scenes before the game at Camp Nou as a gigantic banner was hoisted to honor Tito Vilanova, the club's former coach who died last week of throat cancer. The banner read Tito Per Sempre Etern; Tito, always eternal. A minute's silence followed. The result left Atletico Madrid in prime position to win the La Liga crown with city rivals Real Madrid also still challenging. Atletico play Barcelona at the Camp Nou in the last game of the season in what still be a title decider.

"(CNN) -- Breaking nose news! California Chrome CAN wear a nasal strip on June 7 in the Belmont Stakes, the third leg of horse racing's ""Triple Crown,"" track officials confirmed on Monday, so we can all breathe a little easier about him now. I keep hearing why California Chrome can't become our next Superhorse, with a capital S: . Chrome can't win the Kentucky Derby because: 1) he is the odds-on favorite to win, and the derby's favorite ""never"" wins, and 2) he is a California-bred, and a California horse ""never"" wins the derby. Then he DID win the Derby. Chrome can't win the Preakness because: 1) he developed a cough before the race, so he's obviously too ""hoarse"" to win (hahaha), and 2) the horse ate like a pig for two solid weeks following the Kentucky Derby, putting on so much weight that there's no way he will win the Preakness. Then he DID win the Preakness. I suppose it shouldn't have been a shock that I began hearing why California Chrome wouldn't win the Belmont Stakes on June 7, and with it the ""Triple Crown"" of horse racing, becoming the first horse to earn this coveted crown since Affirmed in 1978. He was going to lose it by a nose. Literally. California Chrome wears a nasal strip, not unlike human beings who want to keep dust and dirt and true grit and other stuff that's hazardous to your health out of their sinus passages. He has won six races in a row with a nasal strip across his handsome proboscis. It obviously gave this California smog-breather a little breathing room. But whoa ... a possibility suddenly existed that Chrome wouldn't be permitted to wear a nasal strip for the Belmont race, which at a mile and a half is the longest of the Triple Crown events and which is run on Long Island in New York, which has been known to have a speck of dust or two. (Hey, it's an ""island."") The last time this nasal-strip business came up, a horse named I'll Have Another had just won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness to become the four-legged darling of 2012. If it could win the Belmont next, it could become the 12th horse in the history of thoroughbred hoofbeats to win that Triple Crown. Not to mention the prize money and the millions of dollars in stud fees that went along with it. Back in 2012, Belmont's racing officials had notified I'll Have Another's handlers that a nasal strip would be prohibited. It is up to each organization's discretion whether to permit such a thing, so Belmont's decision makers, along with those from the New York Racing Association, had the final say. It became moot when I'll Have Another was withdrawn on the eve of the Belmont, unable to go for ""another"" due to a sore tendon. This weekend, the nose thing reared its ugly head again. Chrome's trainer, 77-year-old Art Sherman, pointed out Sunday that there was a distinct possibility the horse's owners might yank their fast horse right out of the race. He said a nasal strip had been the idea of Perry Martin, the horse's co-owner, who has been thoroughly pleased with the thoroughbred's success since strapping it onto his schnoz. ""He might not run if they say you can't run with a nasal strip,"" Sherman suggested. Martin is an unpredictable guy. He didn't even attend Saturday's running of the Preakness. The horse's other owner, Steve Coburn, a walrus-mustached Wilford Brimley lookalike in a cowboy hat, indicated his partner Martin was still doing a burn over what he deemed to be inhospitable treatment at Churchill Downs during the Kentucky Derby. It wasn't long after California Chrome's impressive victory (by a length and a half) in Maryland that the downside of the Louisville experience, two weeks before, reared its ugly head. ""Even though we won (the Kentucky Derby), it was a bad day for my partner and his family,"" Coburn blurted out on Martin's behalf. One complaint reportedly was the way the needs of Martin's mother, an elderly woman in a wheelchair, were not met after Martin went to great effort to bring her to Churchill Downs for the race. By coincidence, Ron Turcotte, the jockey of the great Secretariat during the 1970s, also is in a wheelchair and complained about Churchill Downs' indifference to his situation. Turcotte implied that he would never go to a Kentucky Derby again. ""Handicap"" is strictly a horse-race term in this generation, no longer a permissible word in regard to human physicality. Oh, though, it sure is becoming a topical double-entendre these days at Churchill Downs. As for a certain living creature's breathing needs? Sherman said of nasal strips, ""A lot of horses all over California wear them all the time ... Maryland lets you use them."" Furthermore, harness-race horses -- trotters and pacers pulling sulkies -- apparently do have permission in New York to wear nasal strips as well. But would Belmont say nay to Chrome's wearing one? Nope, they say OK. California Chrome, the coast is clear. And so is your nasal cavity, so on you go to the third and last run for everlasting glory. Triple Crown winners thus far: Sir Barton (1919), Gallant Fox (1930), Omaha (1935), War Admiral (1937), Whirlaway (1941), Count Fleet (1943), Assault (1946), Citation (1948), Secretariat (1973), Seattle Slew (1977) and Affirmed (1978). That's it. I wasn't among the 123,469 spectators at Pimlico who saw Saturday's running of the Preakness. I did, 3,000 miles away, go to Santa Anita, basically the ""home track"" of California Chrome, to watch the race alongside thousands of his fans, many of whom wore a free purple or green California Chrome cap they were given as they entered the track. It was a sunny, smog-free day under a beautiful blue sky, so I saw no human in a face mask. If the West Coast's favorite horse didn't get to run in New York because of what he didn't get to wear, a lot of these people would have had a new reason to hold their noses. They'd have all been saying, ""This stinks."" Luckily, no hanky-panky is happening and Chrome is good to go. The nose mess has been cleared up. (Note: This article was updated with news of the decision by New York officials Monday to allow the nasal strips.)","California Chrome wins the Preakness and could contend for the Triple Crown .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev asked a federal court Thursday to strike his alleged ""betrayal"" of the United States as an aggravating factor for seeking the death penalty against him. A defense motion accused prosecutors of trying to use the suspect's foreign birth and immigration to imply that Tsarnaev is ""more blameworthy, and more deserving of severe punishment"" than a native-born person who commits the identical crime. ""The 'betrayal' factor has no legally permissible role in this case, and can only serve to promote invidious discrimination based on national origin and immigration status,"" the defense motion said. The Tsarnaev family originally came from Chechnya, a war-torn corner of southwestern Russia where Islamist guerrillas have been battling government forces for a decade and a half. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were born in Kyrgyzstan. Dzhokhar had become an American citizen, while Tamerlan's application was still pending when the bombing occurred. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 20, is accused of planting the bombs at the finish line of the 2013 race, along with Tamerlan, who was killed during the manhunt that paralyzed Boston. The city marked the anniversary of the attacks on April 15, pausing to remember the three people who died and the more than 200 who were wounded, many of whom lost limbs. The trial is set for early November, with the government seeking the death penalty. Defense lawyers are expected to argue that the younger Tsarnaev was under the ""domination and control"" of his brother. ""Resentment of Tsarnaev's immigration status and history is perhaps natural, given the nature of the crimes charged, and it is surely very widespread,"" Tsarnaev's lawyers said in the motion. ""But the fact that he had only recently become a citizen, standing alone, does not increase his moral or legal guilt, and it should not be permitted."" In the notice to seek the death penalty, prosecutors said: ""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev received asylum from the United States; obtained citizenship and enjoyed the freedoms of a United States citizen; and then betrayed his allegiance to the United States by killing and maiming people in the United States."" On Wednesday, federal prosecutors filed court papers asking that the family visits of the jailed suspect be monitored to ensure they are not used to convey hidden messages, according to court documents. Prosecutors said Tsarnaev's conversations with his mother, now in the Russian republic of Dagestan, have raised the possibility that the defendant might use social visits ""to communicate with third parties."" In phone calls with him, his mother twice mentioned that she had contact with close friends of Tamerlan Tsarnaev, according to prosecutors. In a hearing last month, U.S. District Judge George O'Toole appeared to side with the defense argument that visits between Tsarnaev and his sisters should not be monitored by the FBI. Defense lawyer David Bruck argued that letting federal agents monitor the conversations intruded on the defense. ""The decision to take the most casual remarks, an ironic comment, and provide it to the prosecution ... becomes ammunition on the death penalty,"" Bruck said. If the charges against Tsarnaev are true, he said, ""This is about a family,"" and lawyers should be allowed to observe the relationship between the siblings without interference. In Wednesday's court filing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Nadine Pellegrini said some of Tsarnaev's telephone conversations while in prison ""have raised the possibility he might seek to use social visits to communicate with third parties."" O'Toole has said he would make a decision after considering the prosecution's response. Separately, Tsarnaev's defense team expressed concern about its ability to be ""adequately prepared"" for the November 3 trial date. In another motion, defense attorneys said they need more information from the government's investigation into the explosive device and other forensic evidence. ""It cannot be ignored that the aggressive timeline for bringing this complicated and multifaceted case to trial dramatically compresses the time available for the defense to adequately prepare for trial,"" attorneys Judy Clarke and David Bruck wrote.","Defense seeks to strike U.S. ""betrayal"" as reason for death penalty .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- A German tarantula dealer has been arrested on charges of illegally sending hundreds of the spiders to the United States through the U.S. mail, law enforcement officials said. Sven Koppler, 37, who had just flown into in Los Angeles, was arrested Thursday after a nine-month investigation dubbed ""Operation Spiderman,"" authorities said. Koppler will remain jailed until a bond hearing December 8, authorities said. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for December 17 and arraignment is December 20. Deputy Federal Public Defender Neha Mehta told CNN ""it is very early in the case"" and that she could not comment. Koppler faces one count of illegally importing wildlife into the United States, the U.S. attorney's office for the district said in a news release. He failed to receive permits and did not declare the spiders, attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek told CNN. Special agents and inspectors with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Postal Service began to investigate Koppler's shipments last March, according to the release. Of the more than 600 tarantulas under question, some were of the Brachypelma smithi species, commonly known as Mexican red-kneed tarantulas. This species is protected under an international treaty and can only be traded with special permits. Koppler failed to declare to the Fish and Wildlife Service that he had shipped the tarantulas and that is why they are considered smuggled, Mrozek said. If convicted, Koppler could be sentenced to up to 20 years in federal prison and fined $250,000, prosecutors said. The Brachypelma genus of spiders is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Specimens can be legally traded only if permits are first obtained from the exporting country, the news release said. According to the criminal complaint, Koppler mailed more than 500 tarantulas. Many were wrapped in colored plastic straws. Agents made subsequent undercover buys from Koppler, the attorney's office says. Koppler received about $300,000 as a result of tarantula sales around the world, according to the release. Michael Sheller, who owns Vogelspinnen, a tarantula clearinghouse in Sprendlingen, near Frankfurt, Germany, said Koppler is a well-known and highly respected man in the tarantula business. ""He is a very reputable dealer,"" said Sheller. ""I am shocked, I know him very well."" Sheller, who exports hundreds of tarantulas each year, said it is important to follow the shipment rules. He said his biggest customers are in the United States. ""Tarantulas are fascinating"" Sheller said. ""I make my living off of them.""

"(CNN) -- For a minute, Courtney Love believed she'd found a clue in the case of the disappearance of Malaysian flight 370. The saga of the missing airplane has captured the public's attention, and Hollywood is clearly not exempt from the intrigue.

"(CNN) -- Children are bearing the brunt of the conflict in Gaza as the Israeli offensive to flush out Hamas fighters leaves youngsters battling indelible trauma while threatening the lives of newborns and their mothers, a senior aid official says. Palestinians carry a boy wounded in an Israeli military strike to hospital on January 14. Ann Veneman, executive director of the United Nations' children body UNICEF, says too little is being done to protect Gaza's children, who account for half the territory's population, from the horrors of the latest conflict. More than 320 children have been killed and 1,500 injured in Gaza since the current conflict began more than three weeks ago, she says, a situation she has described as tragic and unacceptable. ""They are the innocent victims,"" she told CNN in Johannesburg, South Africa, before the launch of UNICEF's annual ""State of the World's Children"" report. Children are particularly vulnerable in Gaza because families are trapped in the conflict areas. ""People cannot leave and be a refugee and find safe haven in another country,"" she said. Because they cannot escape the constant violence, Veneman says, most Gaza kids are severely traumatized. UNICEF is airing radio spots on the Gaza airwaves that advise parents on how to comfort their upset and terrified children. Also, UNICEF has teams on standby to offer psychological support to families. Newborns and pregnant women in Gaza also are a concern, UNICEF says. With hospitals and doctors already battling to cope with the injured, women and their newborns are not getting the medical attention they need. Inadequate medical supplies and severe shortages of food, water, diapers and formula worsen the already dire situation. Power outages also endanger sick babies in neo-natal care.","UNICEF: More than 320 children killed and 1,500 injured since start of conflict .

Huey helicopter flights at Victoria Falls (Zambia) Based in Livingstone on the Zambian side of Victoria Falls (the falls form a border between Zambia and Zimbabwe), United Air Charters introduced 20-minute flights in a ""Huey"" helicopter -- the widely used military helicopter -- in 2013 as a radical way to experience Africa's largest waterfall. With fully open side doors, the 13-passenger Huey zigzags through the 125-meter-high (410 foot) rock walls of Batoka Gorge, skimming close to rapids that make this stretch of the Zambezi one of the continent's best for whitewater rafting. Upon reaching the violent clash of water and rock called Oblivion, the chopper rapidly rises up and over Mosi-oa-Tunya (""The Smoke that Thunders"") at the falls. United Air Charters Huey tours over the falls with an open door are $175 per person for 15 minutes and $330 per person for 20 minutes . 2. Private flying safari (Namibia, Botswana) Little trumps the glamor of a private flying safari in southern Africa, which takes visitors over the Kalahari Desert and Okavango Delta and delivers them to some of the most exclusive and expensive safari camps on the continent. As one of the region's leading flying safari outfitters, African Profile Safaris lists corporate tycoons, politicians and movie stars among its clientele, and organizes flying safaris anywhere in Africa, from week-long trips around Namibia, Botswana and South Africa to month-long Cape-to-Cairo journeys. African Profile Safaris offers 13-day fly-in safaris in Namibia, Botswana, Zambia from 60,900 rand ($5,770) per person . 3. Table Mountain Cableway (South Africa) Table Mountain Cableway opened in 1929 as a vertigo-inducing way to rise from Cape Town to the 1,084-meter (3,558-foot) summit of the giant, flat-topped peak. In the late 1990s, the vintage cable cars were replaced by new pods that can carry 65 passengers and rotate 360 degrees. From the top of the mountain, visitors get breathtaking panoramas of central Cape Town, the beach towns along the western edge of the peninsula, the Cape of Good Hope stretching off to the south and the old prison on Robben Island, where Nelson Mandela spent 18 years. Table Mountain Cableway adult return journeys are 215 rand ($20) per person . 4. Nile High Bungee (Uganda) It took European explorers hundreds of years to come into contact with the source of the Nile. Now it can be done in a matter of seconds at Nile High Bungee. Located in the town of Jinja near the spot where the Lake Victoria turns into the world's longest river, the jump is 44 meters (144 feet) from platform to water. Tandem and night jumps are offered. Leapers can also choose a full dunk -- a brief submergence in the Nile. Nile High Bungee jumps start at $115 per person . 5. Skydiving (Kenya) An hour's drive south of Mombasa, Skydive Diani offers a year-round slate of tandem skydives, full training courses and solo jumps for qualified skydivers. Most jumps are over a permanent drop zone at Diani Beach, but the company runs tandem operations on the coasts of Malindi and Kilifi and in the central highlands outside Nairobi. Each March and November, Skydive Diani and the Nairobi-based Kenya Skydivers Association organize Beach Boogies, a week-long skydiving festival over the white sands and turquoise waters of Diani. Skydive Diani offers skydives from $350 per person . 6. Climbing the West Face at Mulanje (Malawi) Rising 1,700 meters (5,500 feet), the hulking West Face of Chambe peak on the Mulanje Massif is one of Africa's greatest rock-climbing challenges. The wall features two distinct sections -- a 610-meter (2,000-feet) Lower Face and a 1,067-meter (3,500-feet) Upper Face. Those who want to experience the view from the top without the death-defying climb can trek the Skyline Trail, a three-hour hike between Likhubula guest house and Chambe mountain hut. The Mountain Club of Malawi (MCM) offers tips on how to trek or climb Mulanje. Expect to pay around $162 per person for a week on the mountain. 7. Trekking Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania) The six-day trek up and down Africa's highest mountain (5,895 meters/19,341 feet) is one of the continent's iconic adventures. The main routes to the top require no technical climbing experience, but trekkers should be in fairly good shape for an uphill walk that takes three and a half days. Above 11,000 feet, head aches, shortness of breath and other symptoms of altitude sickness are common, and pulmonary edema is a real danger. Tanzania's National Parks Authority requires that all climbers be accompanied by a licensed guide. Ultimate Kilimanjaro offers seven ways to reach the summit. Hikes start at $2,200 per person . 8. Busanga Plains hot air balloon trip (Zambia) ""There's nothing like it,"" says balloon pilot Erik Hesemans of the low-level gliding he does over Zambia's wildlife-rich Busanga Plains with Namib Sky Balloon Safaris. ""Sometimes we're only three meters above the ground -- close enough to look straight into the face of a lion or hippo as you're flying past."" Hesemans pioneered the maneuver over the red hot dunes of the Namib Desert and brought ""skimming"" to Zambia's savannah country in 2012. Hesemans brings his balloons to Busanga during the dry season between June and October, when animals are drawn to waterholes and are thus easier to spot from the air. See a video here. Busanga Bush Camp starts at $799 per person per night; hot air balloon safari is complimentary (and only) for guests who stay minimum three nights . 9. Microlight flights over Kruger National Park (South Africa) Microlights -- lightweight, fixed-wing aircraft -- have been a fixture at South Africa's Kruger National Park for more than a decade, offering bird's-eye views of elephant, rhino, buffalo and other African wildlife. Kwa Madwala Private Game Reserve on Kruger's south side is one of the few lodges with its own microlight -- a sturdy little Bantam that takes off from a grass runway. A six-cylinder engine powers the small aircraft on 15-minute, half-hour and hour-long flights over Kruger, including a glide down the Crocodile River. Kwa Madwala's Manyatta Rock Camp starts at 1,600 rand ($150) per person per night with microlight flights from 650 rand ($61) per person . 10. Cairo Tower (Egypt) Inspired by the lotus columns of the Temple of Luxor and other ancient monuments, Cairo Tower rises 187 meters (613 feet) above Egypt's brooding capital city and remains the third tallest building on the continent more than 50 years after it was first built. From the open-air observation deck at the top, visitors gaze down on central Cairo, up the Nile Valley to the Great Pyramid of Giza and across to the great citadel that dominates eastern Cairo. Cairo Tower observation deck access is 70 Egyptian pounds ($10) per person . 11. Tsitsikamma zipline (South Africa) Africa's best zipline soars through the extraordinary wilderness of Tsitsikamma, featuring an hour-long ""flight"" through the Kruis River Gorge over three waterfalls. The zigzag route features eight different ""slides"" or cables, one of them the length of two soccer fields. Thanks to a patented braking system, fliers can control their speed and come to a complete stop midway along the slides to take in indigenous flora and fauna. Tsitsikamma zipline rates are 350 rand ($33) per person .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- They live largely unseen, in towering Hong Kong apartment blocks, trapped in a life of servitude to pay back crippling debts to unscrupulous recruiters who've lied to convince them to sign up. According to a new report from Amnesty International, thousands of domestic workers from Indonesia are being duped into working in the city by brokers and agencies solely focused on profit. ""Every step of the way, from the moment their documents are confiscated in Indonesia their movements are controlled in Hong Kong,"" said Norma Muico, the author of the report ""Exploited for profit, failed by governments."" ""The recruitment agency tells the employer, 'don't let your workers out for the first seven months when they pay their recruitment fees. Don't let them talk to other Indonesian workers.' Every aspect of their lives is controlled for the purpose of getting the money,"" said Muico, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific migrants' rights researcher. The report accuses the Indonesian and Hong Kong governments of turning a blind eye to the problem because domestic workers provide a valuable service to the city, and send much of the money they earn back to Indonesia. In response to the report, the Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong released a statement saying ""the protection of the Indonesian citizens abroad is the priority of the Indonesian government,"" and ""we have a full commitment to do that with all possible means and resources."" The Hong Kong Labour Department also issued a statement saying, in part: ""We do not allow abuse of FDHs [foreign domestic helpers] including underpayment of wages, non-granting of weekly rest days and statutory holidays etc. Any abuse that is supported by sufficient evidence will be prosecuted."" Hong Kong's domestic help . As of September, almost 150,000 Indonesian domestic workers, or ""helpers"" as they're known, were living and working in Hong Kong, almost half the total number of 319,000. The others are mainly Filipino. Almost all are women. While they come to do the same job, Filipinos receive more support from their own government, and don't have to pay the same extortionate recruitment fees that tie their Indonesian counterparts to months, if not years, of debt, Muico said. ""It's more problematic with the Indonesians because they don't get the support they need from the Indonesian government and the recruitment companies can pretty much do what they like,"" she said. While the report is based on in-depth interviews with 97 workers who sought help, Amnesty said its findings were backed by an independent survey of nearly 1,000 women by the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union (IMWU) conducted in Hong Kong in 2011. Signing up for debt . The typical story starts back in Indonesia where brokers convince poorer women to seek work in Hong Kong. They're taken to training centers, sometimes hours from home, where they spend anywhere between 10 days and 15 months learning the skills and language -- Cantonese -- to do the job, according to the report. In many cases, their documents are taken, along with their phones, and they're allowed only limited contact with their families. Some women told researchers they were forced to cut off all their hair, while others were given mandatory contraceptive injections to avoid pregnancy on short visits home. Once in Hong Kong, Amnesty says local recruitment agencies step in to ensure workers repay their debts. According to the IMWU survey, 85% of women said recruitment fees of around HK$3,000 a month were deducted from their monthly wage for seven months, taking the total recruitment cost to HKD$21,000 (US$2.700). The fee far exceeds the limits set by both the Indonesian and Hong Kong governments. Under Hong Kong law, employment agencies are not allowed to charge more than 10% of a worker's monthly wage, or HK$401 (US$52). Indonesia limits the fee to IDR 14,780,400 or HK$13,436 (US$1,730). In October, the minimum wage for domestic workers rose to HK$4,010.00 (US$517), leaving little left after the monthly fee deduction. And for some it doesn't end there. ""If they want more recruitment fees, they'll manipulate it,"" Muico said, explaining that some recruitment agencies tell employers to terminate their workers after seven months so they can be placed with another employer, with a new set of fees. Nowhere to go . The pressure to repay their recruitment fees prevents many domestic workers from leaving abusive employers, the report said. Stories of the mistreatment of foreign domestic workers aren't too hard to find in Hong Kong. Recently, an extreme example made headlines when a couple was jailed for subjecting their Indonesian helper to ""cruel"" and ""vicious"" abuse. The court heard Kartika Puspitasari, 30, was whipped with bicycle chains and bound with cables during her two-year contract. READ MORE: Despite abuses, foreign domestic workers flock to Hong Kong . Under Hong Kong law, it's illegal for domestic workers to live-out so they sleep in their employers' flats. No limits are imposed on daily work hours, though they're entitled to 24 hours off each week, usually on a Sunday, when thousands gather in public areas in Hong Kong to catch up with friends. Standard duties include cleaning, general household chores and childcare, but some report having to work, illegally, in employers' businesses. One woman told Amnesty she'd been told she'd be taking care of an elderly woman. Instead, she had to carry vegetables at a market and sort trash. ""Without gloves, I had to pick through the rubbish to find items that could be recycled. I then carried them, which were often very heavy, to a center where I could sell them. It was truly horrible work, but I remained because I needed to pay off my recruitment fees,"" she said. What needs to be done . Amnesty has called on both governments to do more to stop unscrupulous recruiters, end the requirement for workers to live-in and make it easier for them to seek help. Both Hong Kong and Indonesia say they've taken steps to clampdown on recruiters, and they're already distributing information letting domestic helpers know how and when to file a complaint. In its statement to CNN, the Hong Kong Labour Department said in 2012 it revoked two employment agency licenses, one of which was due to overcharging. It added: ""The issue of overcharging Indonesian domestic helpers of agency fees back in Indonesia is beyond our jurisdiction and should be tackled at source by the country of origin."" The Indonesian consulate said it had an annual system for evaluating and accrediting agencies in Hong Kong. Since 2009, it said 26 agencies had ""received punishments for their misconducts,"" ranging from warnings, to suspensions and cancellation of licenses. And as of June, 190 employers had been banned from hiring domestic workers, it added. Amnesty International said it's not enough. ""We need to see current laws enforced and people face justice for the exploitation. Only then will we start to see an end to forced labor from Indonesia to Hong Kong,"" Muico said.","Amnesty report claims Indonesia, Hong Kong ignoring problem of unscrupulous recruiters .
Says Indonesian domestic workers being overcharged, underpaid with little or no recourse .
Hong Kong, Indonesia say they're committed to helping foreign domestic workers .

"(CNN) -- After more than seven and a half years of military service, Prince William is leaving the armed forces to focus on royal duties and charity work, Kensington Palace said Thursday. William was a pilot with the Royal Air Force Search and Rescue Force. Known to his RAF comrades as Flight Lt. Wales, he had been stationed at a search-and-rescue base on the remote Welsh island of Anglesey since 2010, and lived there with Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge. Prince William: I dream of Africa . In the next few weeks, the pair will move into their official residence at Kensington Palace. The palace statement said that William is considering a ""number of options"" for public service. For now, he will focus on his royal duties. He will also expand on his conservation work, dealing particularly with endangered species. Kensington Palace announced he will become president of a new collaboration among seven environmental groups. The group, United for Wildlife, will focus on fighting the illegal wildlife trade. William will also focus on charities that deal with children, veterans and service members. CNN's Max Foster: Tired, elated Prince William could be any new dad . William's final search and rescue duty was Tuesday. ""He and his crew had an uneventful 24 hour shift,"" the defense ministry said. ""Throughout his tour his airmanship, often in the most demanding of conditions, has contributed directly to saving lives in the mountains of North Wales and from the ravages of the Irish Sea. He has earned the respect of all who have worked with him as a highly professional and competent pilot,"" the ministry said. Last year, he helped save a teenage girl who was in danger of drowning off the coast of Wales. The 16-year-old girl was caught in a rip current and rapidly losing strength. William, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, had just landed a Sea King helicopter nearby, after going out on a routine exercise, when the alert was radioed through. In less than a minute, he and the crew had reached the scene and a paramedic was winched down into the sea to assist the exhausted girl, who had just gone under water. Royal baby photos: Cozy or just bad? There's no suggestion that William, 31, would ever drop out of public life, but he does crave normality. The prince gets some of that from his role in the military where he's treated as ""one of the guys,"" but he also gets it from Africa. Dreaming of Africa is one way that William escapes from the stresses he faces, he said. ""I regularly daydream,"" The Duke of Cambridge reveals in the CNN documentary, ""Prince William's Passion: New Hope, New Father,"" which airs later this month. ""Africa is definitely one of the places I go to ... I have hundreds of animals on my iPhone. So if I am ever having quite a stressful day ... you can put a buffalo on in the background or a cricket,"" he says.","NEW: William will become president of a group fighting the illegal wildlife trade .

"(CNN) -- When Peggielene Bartels went to bed on a summer night in 2008, she was an ordinary administrative assistant living in a modest one-bedroom condo just outside Washington D.C. But a few hours later, when a persistent ringing phone woke her up in the dead of the August night, the 55-year-old found out she was much more than simply a secretary. At the other end of the line was Bartels's cousin, from Otuam, a small fishing village on the coast of Ghana. Excited and humble, he congratulated her on being the new king of Otuam. ""I said, 'listen, it's 4 o'clock in the morning in the U.S., I am very tired, let me sleep,'"" remembers Bartels. ""I thought he was trying to really play games with me."" But this was no time for games. The previous king of Otuam, who was Bartels's uncle, had just died. The village elders, who remembered Bartels from the times she'd visited with her mother, had decided to anoint her as their new ruler. Watch video: King Peggy shows off her crowns . After the initial shock, Bartels decided to accept the kingship. Over the course of a few days, she went from being plain old Peggielene Bartels, who had worked for nearly three decades at the Ghanaian Embassy in the United States, to becoming King Peggy -- the first female king of Otuam, reigning over approximately 7,000 people. ""It never ever occurred to me [that I'd be Otuam's king],"" says Bartels, who's been living in the United States since her early 20s. ""I realized that on this earth, we all have a calling. We have to be ready to accept it because helping my people has really helped me a lot to know that I can really touch their lives,"" she adds. ""I would have really regretted it if I hadn't really accept this calling."" Although she still works at the Ghanaian Embassy, Bartels uses all her holiday every year to spend a month in Otuam. King is the traditional title of Otuam's ruler, and Bartels says she's happy to be called a king, rather than queen, because it means she can achieve more. ""Most of the time, a king is the one who has all the executive power to do things, while the queen is mostly in charge of the children's affairs and reporting to the king,"" she says. ""So I really love this."" Read more: The Lady King of Otuam . King Peggy was born in Takoradi, southern Ghana, in 1953. She studied in England before moving to the United States, where she became an American citizen in 1997. But after inheriting the throne, Bartels has been living two very different lives in two different continents. In Washington, her secretarial duties include typing letters, answering phone calls and booking appointments. In her little apartment her life is far removed from the luxuries of her royal roots. ""When I am in the United States I do everything by myself,"" she explains. ""I do my own laundry, I do my own cooking, I do my own driving and I do my own bed when I wake up in the morning."" Read more: Secretary is still the top job for women . But back in Ghana, she stands out as a gold crown-wearing, scepter-holding king who lives in a refurbished palace. Otuam residents usually address her as ""Nana"" -- an honorary title given to royalty but also to women with grandchildren -- and bow when they see her. ""When I am back home they see me as their king and they want to pamper me,"" she says. ""They have to cook for me, they have to carry me around and they have to protect me from people. They want to do everything for me which I usually refuse ... Sometimes I say to them 'please, don't bow.' I just want them to be free and comfortable so that way we can really address issues."" In pictures: Africa's power women . But beyond the bows, the royal attire and certain luxuries that come with her title, being a king in an impoverished place like Otuam is all about dealing with the pressing needs of the community and improving the lives of the people, says Bartels. ""To be a king in an African village or some places like this, it's not like European queens where everything is on a silver platter for them,"" she says. ""I have to really work hard to help my people. I have to give myself to people to better their lives."" In the last few years, she's helped poor families pay school fees for their children and brought computers to classrooms. With the help of other Americans she's also provided Otuam with its first ambulance, as well as access to clean, running water. Her next priority, she says, is to bring state-of-the-art toilets to Otuam. And even when she's not in Ghana, her royal duties do not stop; she wakes up at 1am every morning to call Otuam and be informed about what's happening in the community. ""I talk to my regent, I talk to my elders,"" Bartels says. ""If there is something that I want to know, they tell me. If there is something that I want them to do, I tell them."" Last year, King Peggy's real-life fairy tale was documented in a book written by her and author Eleanor Herman. And now she says her amazing life journey from secretary to king will be told in a film, after Hollywood star Will Smith bought the rights to the book. ""Next year, God willing, we are going to have a movie out there,"" says King Peggy. ""Queen Latifah is going to play me and I'm so happy to at least let the whole world know that a secretary can become a king and lead wisely and help the people.""","For more than 30 years, Peggielene Bartels has worked as a secretary in the U.S.
But then one day a phone call took her back to her Ghanaian roots .

"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (CNN)  -- President Obama, on the first leg of a Mideast trip, said Wednesday that he is confident the United States and Saudi Arabia can ""make progress on a whole host of issues of mutual interest."" President Obama meets with Saudi King Abdullah on Wednesday in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Shortly after his arrival Wednesday in Saudi Arabia, Obama and King Abdullah went to the Saudi ruler's farm for a welcoming reception. The two leaders met privately afterward. Obama said he was ""struck by his wisdom and his graciousness. Obviously the United States and Saudi Arabia have a long history of friendship. We have a strategic relationship.""  Watch Saudi officials greet Obama » . ""And as I take this trip -- and I will be visiting Cairo tomorrow, I thought it was very important to come to the place where Islam began and to seek his majesty's counsel and to discuss with him many of the issues that we confront here in the Middle East,"" he added. iReport.com: A Saudi on Obama in Muslim land . Obama leaves late Wednesday for Cairo, Egypt, where he is to address a mostly Muslim audience Thursday (6 a.m. ET). His plans to improve America's image among Muslims have been in the works since his first week in office. iReport.com: How can U.S. better relate to Muslims? ""My job is to communicate the fact that the United States has a stake in the well-being of the Muslim world, that the language we use has to be a language of respect,"" Obama said in a January interview with Al-Arabiya television network. ""I have Muslim members of my family. I have lived in Muslim countries."" When the White House announced the Mideast trip in May, spokesman Robert Gibbs described Egypt as ""a country that in many ways represents the heart of the Arab world."" Gibbs deflected questions at his daily briefing about whether Egypt was a wise choice, given President Hosni Mubarak's resistance to making his government more democratic. CNN's Ben Wedeman, who talked to Egyptians in Cairo to gauge their sentiments, said most of the people were eagerly awaiting the president's visit but said some were concerned that Obama, by making Egypt the focus of his trip, could legitimize Mubarak's 28-year rule. These Egyptians said they feared Obama might not discuss with Mubarak long-sought problems such as the need for democracy and political reform. People are looking for something palpable and concrete, Wedeman said. They would like the United States to be more engaged in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, he said.  Watch what Egyptians say they want to hear from Obama » . ""What they want is results, not just words,"" Wedeman said. There were visible preparations for Obama's visit, he said. Many streets were repaved, and markets were selling T-shirts in his honor, with some reading: ""Obama: New Tutankhamen of the World."" In April, Obama chose Turkey, a more secular state, as the site of his first presidential speech to a Muslim majority nation. He told the Turkish legislature in Ankara that the ""United States is not and will never be at war with Islam."" Former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright pointed to a common theme among the many conferences she has attended with Muslim speakers: ""When the Cold War ended, America needed an enemy to replace Communism and chose Islam."" In an op-ed Tuesday in The New York Times, Albright wrote, ""How else, they ask, to explain the two Gulf wars, Afghanistan, Guantánamo and the plight of the Palestinians? ""To support their thesis, they cite the bellicose post-9/11 rhetoric of U.S. officials, the Western media's preoccupation with Muslim extremists and the plethora of pundits who have identified Islam, especially 'political Islam,' as the leading threat to civilization in the 21st century.""  iReport: Are you concerned about the way Muslims have been portrayed in recent years? Albright said, ""To most Americans, the idea that our country is attacking Islam or that we view the Islamic faith as an enemy is absurd."" She pointed out that in the 1990s, the U.S. twice led NATO into conflicts on behalf of Muslim populations -- first in Bosnia, then in Kosovo. Not long before Obama departed on his trip, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey suggested that more than two in five Americans, or 46 percent, have an unfavorable opinion of Muslim countries. That view is an increase of 5 percentage points from 2002. Three in 10 Americans questioned said they had a neutral opinion. On Tuesday, Gibbs told reporters: ""I think what is important is that we demonstrate that the United States wants to pursue a different relationship and ensure that Muslims around the world understand the message of the United States."" He said, ""We have more in common than we have disagreement about, and I think that's what he wants to ensure that the vast majority of the Muslim world hears."" Mideast expert Mamoun Fandy agrees with Egyptians who say Muslims want more than talk; they want action. They want to hear ""that he is very serious about solving the Israeli-Arabian problem, that he is very serious about engaging the Muslim world on the basis of recognizing the equality,"" Fandy said. After Egypt, Obama will visit the remains of the Buchenwald concentration camp in Dresden, Germany, on Friday. He then is scheduled to take part in D-Day ceremonies commemorating the 65th anniversary of the World War II Allied landings in Normandy, France.","NEW: President Obama says U.S., Saudi Arabia ""have a long history of friendship""

"MOSCOW, Russia (CNN) -- The United States is ""absolutely not"" giving Israel a green light to attack Iran, U.S. President Barack Obama told CNN Tuesday. President Obama meets Tuesday with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin near Moscow. ""We have said directly to the Israelis that it is important to try and resolve this in an international setting in a way that does not create major conflict in the Middle East,"" Obama said, referring to Iran's nuclear ambitions. Obama has been in Moscow for a summit aimed at trying to reset the U.S.-Russian relationship. On Sunday, U.S. Vice President Joe Biden appeared to leave the door open for Israel to attack Iran if it saw fit. ""Israel can determine for itself -- it's a sovereign nation -- what's in their interest and what they decide to do relative to Iran and anyone else,"" Biden said on ABC's ""This Week."" Obama said Tuesday that Biden had simply been stating a fact, not sending a signal. ""I think Vice President Biden stated a categorical fact, which is we can't dictate to other countries what their security interests are. What is also true is that it is the policy of the United States to resolve the issue of Iran's nuclear capabilities in a peaceful way through diplomatic channels,"" he said.  Watch CNN's Ed Henry interview President Obama » . The top U.S. military leader, Adm. Mike Mullen, said later on Tuesday that he understands Israel's position. ""The Israelis see Iran achieving a nuclear capability as an existential threat, and that fact is tied to the rhetoric of the leadership of Iran, which ... has said that they would seek to eliminate Israel,"" said Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His counterparts in the Gulf also understand the Israeli stance, whether or not they agree, Mullen said. ""That gets back to the criticality ... of solving this before Iran gets a nuclear capability, or that anyone... would take action to strike them. And I think that window is a very narrow window,"" he said in a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. He said he hoped diplomacy would resolve the issue. ""I am hopeful that that dialogue is productive. I worry about it a great deal if it's not,"" Mullen said. The State Department took a similar line on Monday. ""Our goal here is to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. When I say 'our' it is just not the United States -- it is the international community,"" spokesman Ian Kelly said. ""Israel is a sovereign country. We are not going to dictate its actions. We also are committed to Israel's security and we share Israel's deep concerns about Iran's nuclear program."" Asked if this could be interpreted as the United States flashing a green light for Israel to attack Iran's nuclear sites, Kelly said, ""I certainly would not want to give a green light to any kind of military action."" The Israeli government considers Iran's nuclear program to be the dominant threat facing the country.

"(CNN) -- Businesses in parts of Pakistan's most populous city shut down Thursday, amid uncertainty and tension tied to the recent arrest, by London police, of the leader of one of the country's most powerful regional parties. Video from CNN affiliate Geo TV showed shops that had closed or were in the process of closing in Nazimabad, Liaquatabad and other parts of Karachi. ""There are elements that are forcing people to shut down their shops and businesses,"" local trade society president Tajir Ittehad Ateeq Mir told reporters. Such shutdowns have been connected to the arrest in London of Altaf Hussain, head of Pakistan's Mutahida Qaumi Movement, on Tuesday morning. Metropolitan Police said they arrested a 60-year-old man, who they did not name, at a home in northwest London on suspicion of money laundering. But officials in Pakistan subsequently identified him as Hussain. Members of the Mutahida Qaumi Movement, which is known as MQM, have staged protests, including sit-ins, since that arrest. But party officials insist they have nothing to do with shutting down businesses, accusing others of manipulating the situation. ""The MQM Central Coordination Committee has strongly condemned the miscreant elements who are involved in closing down businesses and aerial firing in some areas of Karachi and Hyderabad,"" the party said in a press release. ""It seems that some elements want to deteriorate the situation deliberately so that MQM can be blamed."" The party appealed for people to go about their business as usual and remain peaceful, with senior leader Haider Abbas Rizvi telling reporters that Hussain himself has related that he doesn't want supporters to take the law into their own hands. MQM is the fourth-largest party in Pakistan's parliament, holding 25 out of 446 seats, though it is a greater force in Sindh province, including Karachi. It is led by Hussain from his base in the United Kingdom, where he sought asylum in 1991 because of an attempt on his life, his party has previously said. Hussain -- who had been ill and was preparing to leave his home to get checked at a hospital when he was arrested, according to MQM Senior Deputy Gov. Nadeem Nusrat -- was still in a hospital Thursday under police watch. Pakistan's High Commissioner to the UK Imran Mirza has visited Hussain at the hospital and given him documentation -- including a Pakistani passport -- so that he and other Pakistani officials could continue to have access to him, said Pakistani Information Minister Pervez Rasheed. Some protests called by MQM after Hussain's arrest turned violent, something that the party condemned. Thursday saw more bloodshed in Karachi. A bomb placed on a motorcycle exploded outside of a mosque, killing one person and injuring five others, according to Ahmed Chinoy, the chief of the citizen's police liaison committee told CNN. There is no indication whether that attack had anything to do with MQM or Hussain's arrest. More arrests made in stoning death of pregnant Pakistani woman .

"(CNN) -- More than a dozen Chinese activists have been detained by authorities in an apparent crackdown ahead of the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Others have been placed under house arrest or questioned by police in what Amnesty International says is an attempt to prevent public commemorations of those who died on June 4, 1989. Among those detained are five activists -- a human rights lawyer, two writers and two academics -- who were held by police on May 6 after attending a low-key seminar in Beijing to discuss the anniversary. They were subsequently held on suspicion of ""picking quarrels,"" according to Amnesty. Among them is prominent human rights lawyer Pu Zhiqiang, well known in the Chinese media for representing high-profile dissidents such as artist Ai Weiwei, and those detained in the now-defunct ""re-education through labor"" system. On Thursday, Pu's lawyer and neice, Qu Zhenhong, was also detained on suspicion of ""illegally obtaining personal information,"" according to Human Rights in China. 'Nervous' authorities . Pu took part in the student-led demonstrations in the summer of 1989 that ended in a tragic military crackdown on protestors in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4 of that year. An official death toll has never been announced but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to thousands. Other seminar attendees currently being detained include online dissident Liu Di, also known as ""stainless steel mouse,"" film critic Hao Jian, dissident writer Hu Shigen, and noted Chinese scholar Xu Youyu, according to rights lawyer Shang Baojun. William Nee, a China researcher for Amnesty International, said the arrests were ""distressing."" ""It is distressing when some middle-aged people had a small gathering in a private setting, trying to remember the people who died in Tiananmen Square... that even this kind of low key-event with moderate people is not allowed in China right now,"" he said. ""If having a small gathering in a private setting is 'picking a quarrel,' then what isn't? ""I think (the authorities) are very nervous about the 25th anniversary of Tiananmen Square and what it represents."" More arrests . Signs of an apparent crackdown appeared when press freedom advocate Gao Yu and her son Zhao Meng were both taken away by authorities on April 24. She was reported missing by rights groups after she failed to show up for the Tiananmen commemoration seminar in Beijing. On May 8, Gao was formally detained on suspicion of leaking state secrets to a foreign entity. The whereabouts of her son are still unknown. Another activist, Xie Wenfei, was arrested in Guangdong Province on the same day as the Beijing group, also on suspicion of ""picking quarrels,"" according to Amnesty International. ""These charges and detentions lay bare just how little the Chinese government's attitudes towards human rights have changed since 1989,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. When asked about criticism of China's human rights record, Ministry of Foreign Affairs Spokesperson Hua Chunying told CNN that human rights shouldn't been viewed in the ""criteria of the United States."" ""Our society is moving forward, the living standards of people have improved and level of freedoms are at their highest,"" she said. Others being held include former Tiananmen student leader Xu Guang, who was formally arrested in Zhejiang and charged with ""inciting subversion of state power."" Three others who are being detained but had not been formally arrested or accused of a crime, among them are Chen Guang, an artist and former soldier held in connection to a private art performance referencing the Tiananmen incident. Two more are under house arrest, including Ding Zilin, spokesperson for the Tiananmen Mothers group, while 10 had been questioned by police, according to Amnesty. In another case with links to Pu, a Beijing-based journalist, Wu Wei, has been missing since May 7. Wu frequently interviews Pu and her last microblog post discusses his case. She is widely believed to be in criminal detention, according to China Human Rights Defenders. Moderates . Public discussion of the June 4 anniversary is still taboo in mainland China and it is never been publicly marked there, though an annual vigil is held in the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong. In the lead-up to the anniversary each year, many activists in China are typically held by police. But the recent detentions are unusual as the anniversary is still a month away and those targeted are considered moderates. In an interview with CNN in July last year, Pu dismissed the risks he could be taking with his work. ""I think I am fine, I am a moderate, the government has treated me well and I am a veteran lawyer. I didn't make any mistakes in my career. I am not radical, I do not threaten the government."" ""When you block the moderate channels you are pushing people to more extreme actions,"" said Maya Wang, researcher for the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. ""The government is detaining people who have acted as bridges between authorities and activists. It leaves the question of what authorities are able to tolerate and what avenues people have to complain."" While many activists initially hoped that President Xi Jinping would preside over a system more tolerant of dissent and discussion, his administration is widely seen as tightening the screws on the work of activists and intellectuals, including the sentencing of Xu Zhiyong, another human rights lawyer pushing for financial transparency of China's leaders, to four years in prison in January.

"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- When all was said and done, Jerry and Dottie Sandusky did not ask the judge for mercy. They did not try to extol Jerry's virtues, list good deeds or express regret. Instead, they depicted the boys he sexually assaulted as ungrateful and called them liars. They blamed the young men -- including their own adopted son, Matt, who now claims he, too, was molested -- for their downfall. In letters to the judge who would sentence the former coach, the Sanduskys portrayed themselves as virtuous victims of a vast conspiracy. They blamed powerful, image-conscious forces at Penn State University, lying cops, ambitious prosecutors and a scandal-hungry news media. Victims angrily confront Sandusky at sentencing . The couple's letters were mentioned in court on Tuesday but not read aloud. Judge John Cleland and the Centre County courts made them public, and CNN obtained copies. In them, Jerry Sandusky expressed little sympathy for the 10 boys he was convicted of molesting. As he wrote about their families, he tried to shift the blame, pointing out that the boys came from unstable homes. ""Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this,"" he wrote. He said nothing about the damaged lives and institutions his molestation case left in its wake. Read the letters (.PDF) Instead, both Sanduskys wrote that the justice system let them down. Just as letters to one of the boys he was accused of molesting helped secure his conviction, the letters to the judge all but guaranteed a maximum punishment, legal observers say. Cleland, who presided over the trial and sentenced Sandusky on Tuesday to 30 to 60 years in prison, noted that others wrote letters as well. But he indicated that he considered only the Sanduskys' letters in handing down a sentence that, for a 68-year-old man, is likely to be a life prison term. Victim to Sandusky: 'Because of you, I trust no one' ""Sentencing is a time to ask for mercy, not to attack others,"" said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who teaches legal ethics at Loyola Law School. ""In my experience, judges really hate letters that try to shift the blame to others or which belittle the victims or the court."" B.J. Bernstein, an Atlanta attorney who comments on legal matters for CNN, agreed that Sandusky didn't do himself any favors. ""The old adage 'if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all' applies to sentencing statements,"" Bernstein said. ""It is awkward when you deny you are culpable and a jury says otherwise. For appellate purposes Sandusky was never going to accept responsibility or admit doing something wrong, but lashing out at everyone so strongly was irrational."" She added that Sandusky might have thought he was still playing to his Penn State fan base, but it backfired. ""Between Jerry and Dottie's vicious protestations of innocence,"" Bernstein said, ""all I can think is the victims -- and in particular their son Matt -- should shout back the lyrics from the Eric Clapton song, 'Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.'"" Sandusky's son comes forward as victim . Jerry Sandusky bashed victims and laid out the conspiracy theory in a pre-recorded interview leaked to a campus radio station on the eve of his sentencing. He hinted at it again when he spoke in court on Tuesday, after being warned by his lawyers to avoid criticizing his victims or the justice system. His performances on air and in the courtroom were widely derided by prosecutors, legal analysts and commentators as narcissistic, self-absorbed and even more hurtful to the young men he was convicted of molesting. Jerry Sandusky's letter expanded on the rambling, 15-minute courtroom soliloquy that touched on everything from the writer Henry David Thoreau to ""special inmate friends"" to wet kisses from dogs. Like that speech, it was part locker room pep talk and part Sunday school inspirational, with a heaping side order of the Frank Sinatra ballad ""My Way."" He wrote about life in protective custody, and how it led him to think about all the interests that were being protected as the case unfolded: ""The system protected the system, the media, the prosecution, the civil attorneys and the accusers. Everybody protected themselves,"" he wrote. ""Penn State, with its own system, protected their public image,"" he continued. ""Media protected their jobs and ambitions. Prosecutors protected their jobs and egos. The accusers were protected and provided access to potential financial gain, free attorneys, accolades, psychologists and attention."" McQueary files lawsuit against Penn State . He wrote that he was heartbroken. ""My trust in people, systems and fairness has diminished,"" he said. ""In my heart I know I did not do these disgusting acts. However, I didn't tell the jury. Our son changed our plans when he switched sides."" Matt Sandusky was 18 when he was adopted by the Sanduskys after spending time with them in foster care. The relationship always has been rocky, but it collapsed near the end of Sandusky's trial in June. As the prosecution's case drew to a close, Matt told investigators that Sandusky had molested him, too. Matt Sandusky, now 33, did not testify for either side, but Jerry Sandusky insists that his adopted son's desertion and potentially damaging testimony kept him from testifying in his own defense. The Sanduskys spared no one. ""There were so many people involved in the orchestration of this conviction (media, investigators, prosecutors, ""the system,"" Penn State and the accusers.) It was well done. They won!"" Jerry Sandusky wrote, as if a tragic court case about molested children was an epic gridiron contest. ""When I thought about how it had transpired, I wondered what they had won,"" he continued. ""I thought of the methods, decisions and allegations. I relived the inconsistencies and dishonest testimonies."" He pondered what would happen if the tables were turned. When the hero falls off the pedestal: The emotion of betrayal . ""What would be the outcome if all the accusers and their families who were investigated?"" he wrote. ""I knew the answer. All their issues would surface. They would no longer be these poor, innocent people as portrayed."" Dottie Sandusky also wrote of her disappointment, saying she has lost faith in the police and the legal system. ""To think that they can lie and get by with the lies. The press has been unbelievable. People who have not met us are writing untruths."" Dottie Sandusky's letter is revealing because she has stood silently by her husband in court. She testified at his trial that she never heard or saw anything strange or sexual going on in the basement of their home, where many of the victims say her husband molested them. In her letter, she unloaded on her adopted son, Matt. ""People need to know what kind of person he is,"" she wrote. ""We have forgiven him many times for all he has done to our family, thinking that he was changing his life, but he would always go back to his stealing and lies. He has been diagnose (sic) Bipolar, but he refuses to take his medicine."" Records from Centre County's probation department and juvenile courts tell part of the story of how Matt H., as he was known, came to the Sanduskys. Like the boys who testified against Sandusky at the trial, Matt participated in Sandusky's youth mentoring program, The Second Mile. Jerry Sandusky was in Southern California, preparing for the Rose Bowl, when Matt was arrested in 1995. Sandusky called personally and pulled strings to make sure Matt was placed under his care and not sent to juvenile detention. Opinion: For the victims, it's about more than locking him up . The court documents detail Matt's continuing troubles, including an aspirin overdose in March 1996 that is characterized as a suicide attempt. But he maintained that he wanted to stay in the Sandusky home, writing to the court, ""I feel that they have supported me even when I have messed up. They are a loving, caring group of people. They have showed me what a family is really like."" In another instance, Sandusky called police to his house, claiming a burglar was trying to break in. It was Matt, who said he had come to the house for a power tool. Matt Sandusky now is represented by a law firm in State College that is handling the cases of several other Sandusky molestation victims. ""Matt is extremely disappointed that Dottie and the Sanduskys have decided to smear his character in an attempt to deflect attention from Jerry Sandusky's heinous crimes,"" his lawyers Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin said in a written statement to CNN. ""Matt has shown tremendous courage and strength,"" the statement continued. ""Rather than supporting her son when he made the gut-wrenching decision to come forward and tell the truth about the abuse he suffered at the hands of Jerry Sandusky, Dottie Sandusky has chosen to continue Jerry's strategy of blaming and attacking the victims, thereby perpetuating the abuse."" Dottie Sandusky wrote that her adopted son ""has had many run-ins with the law and stolen money and items from our family. We still love him and want the best for him, but because of his actions we cannot express this to him. ..."" Karl Rominger, a lawyer for Sandusky, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the State Attorney General's office said prosecutors ""stand by"" what they said Tuesday about Sandusky's victim and system bashing. The lead prosecutor, Joseph McGettigan, described Sandusky's behavior as ""banal, self-delusional, completely untethered from reality. It was entirely-self-focused, as if he himself were the victim.""

"(CNN) -- Two teenagers accused in a random ""thrill kill"" that left a 23-year-old college athlete from Australia dead pleaded not guilty Thursday to first-degree murder charges, an Oklahoma district attorney said. Chancey Allen Luna, 16, and Michael Dewayne Jones, 18, entered the pleas at their arraignment Thursday inside of a Stephens County courthouse, said Jason Hicks, the district attorney serving that area. Hicks couldn't offer more details of what transpired inside the courtroom or the case because of a gag order. Among those in attendance was Sarah Harper, the girlfriend of the victim, Christopher Lane. Police say the teenagers shot Lane -- who was attending East Central University on a baseball scholarship -- last August as he was jogging in Duncan, a town of about 23,000 people located some 80 miles southwest of Oklahoma City. Luna, Jones and a third teenager -- James Francis Edwards, Jr. -- saw Lane passing by and shot him because ""they had nothing to do,"" according to authorities. As the teenagers sped away, Duncan police Chief Danny Ford told CNN affiliate KSWO that ""there were some people that saw (Lane) stagger across the road, go to a kneeling position and collapse on the side of the road."" When police arrested the teens, one of them offered a motive that made clear that Lane was chosen at random. ""He said the motive was, 'We were going to kill somebody,'"" Ford told Australian radio station 3AW. Police: Australian baseball player killed -- just because . After their arrest, all three alleged assailants were charged as adults, according to Kaylee Chandler, the Stephens County Court Clerk. The shooting shook many around the college town like Sam Malchar, who called his classmate and teammate Lane ""a charming guy, genuinely good person, with great character and ... a love for life."" It also reverberated some 10,000 miles away in Lane's native Australia, from which some called for a U.S. tourism boycott. Former Australian Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer characterized the slaying as ""another example of murder mayhem on Main Street."" A judge on Thursday set Luna and Jones' trial date for August 18, which is when a jury term starts. The other implicated teen, Edwards, is scheduled to be in court for a preliminary hearing on May 13. Edwards' older sister, Rachel Padilla, told CNN last summer that her brother had been in trouble with police before for fighting, but was not a vicious person, and she never thought he might kill someone. Suspect in killing tweeted: 'time to start taken life's' CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","Christopher Lane was attending an Oklahoma university on a baseball scholarship .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- If cranes are a visual barometer of the economic vibe of a city then central Beirut is buzzing. Targeted car bombings linked to the ongoing Syrian conflict have raised anxiety and hurt overall growth in the Lebanese capital in recent years. But this seems to be a city that endures when it comes to real estate. During the boom years towards the end of the last decade, total sales rose by 36% here hitting nearly $9.5 billion in 2010, according to Bank Audi. And even though there was a slowdown last year, real estate purchases fell just 2.4% to $8.7 billion. According to local property expert Freddie Baz, financial troubles elsewhere in the world have failed to dampen local or international interest in Lebanon's high end property market. ""Despite figures which show some kind of slowdown or stagnation, there are 400 real estate projects which are ongoing in Beirut, corresponding to close to 2 million square meters of development,"" Baz said. One such initiative is the 3 Beirut project in the center of the city's bustling business district. Although a couple of years behind schedule, the structure designed by British architects Foster & Partners is comfortably selling units priced as high as $10,000 per square meter ($929 per sq ft), senior adviser to the project, Farris Fara, told CNN. Elsewhere, developers like Karim Basal have been throwing up boutique, modern apartments with a total area between 30 and 70 square meters to cater for modern city living. On the city's waterfront, meanwhile, British design firm Stow is making a statement with the edgy Le Yacht Club leisure and residence development. This particular area of the city has had huge support from Lebanese investors based abroad. Over the last 6 years, there's been nearly $100 billion of net inflows into the country, more than half of which came in the midst of the financial crisis between 2008 and 2010. ""At the end of the day, they (Lebanese investors) are working all over the world, Europe, GCC (Gulf) countries but they all need to come and own part of the country,"" said general manager of Le Yacht Club, Walid Kanaan. Kanaan said he has sold a fifth of the flats ahead of the delayed opening in April with almost all going to Lebanese people outside the country. While these investors may not suffer the first hand effects of car bombs or other violent spillover from Syria, Beirut's continuing appeal is a sign that this city has been shaken but not toppled during another period of regional uncertainty.

"Tripoli, L (CNN) -- Almost a month after he was kidnapped, Jordan's Ambassador to Libya was freed by his captors on Tuesday in an apparent exchange for a Libyan militant jailed in Jordan. Fawaz al-Aytan was met at an airport in Amman by a delegation of senior Jordanian officials and emotional family members. He was kidnapped in the Libyan capital on April 15, when armed men ambushed his vehicle and shot and wounded his Moroccan driver. Al-Aytan appeared to be in good health and spirits as he spoke to reporters outside the airport in the Jordanian capital. He said he had been treated in a ""humane"" and ""civilized"" way by his captors. The ambassador said his kidnapping was an ""isolated incident"" specifically for the release of Mohammed al-Drissi, the Libyan Islamist militant who was serving a life sentence in Jordan since 2007. ""The exchange happened in a smooth and civilized way, it ended in a dignified manner"" the ambassador told reporters. While al-Aytan did not provide many details about his 28 days in captivity, he said members of al-Drissi's family were involved in his abduction. In an interview with CNN Arabic in his hometown in Northern Jordan, al-Aytan said he met al-Drissi on Tuesday morning. ""I met him maybe for a minute this morning in Tripoli after he arrived on a private plane. I greeted him ... as was agreed between all parties"" al-Aytan said. ""We did embrace and I wished all the best whether he was wrong or right."" Libyan officials confirmed that al-Drissi was returned to Libya, but refused to comment on whom he was handed over to and whether he was in prison or free. The Jordanian government insisted that the release was not a swap. ""There was no exchange or swap or deal. ... We dealt directly with the Libyan government"" Jordan's Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh said in a press conference in Amman. Judeh said an agreement to transfer al-Drissi to serve the rest of his sentence in Libya had been in the works for months and the kidnapping only ""expedited"" the transfer. The Libyan government on Thursday announced that the ministries of Justice of both countries signed a ""memorandum of understanding"" to allow the transfer of prisoners serving ""sentences depriving of liberties"". Analysts and terrorism experts have voiced their concerns over the apparent swap of al-Aytan for al-Drissi, who was was sentenced to life in prison in Jordan in 2007 for a bombing plot targeting the country's main airport. ""This is clearly a swap deal -- the authorities in Jordan and Libya can claim otherwise,"" said Mohamed Eljarh, a Libya analyst and a contributor to Foreign Policy magazine's ""Transitions"" blog. It was ""a swap deal between the Jordanian authorities and al-Drissi's comdrades and the best the Libyan authorities could do was to facilitate this deal and set this extremely dangerous precedent,"" Eljarh said. Eljarh and other Libyan sources said al-Drissi's family is known amongst the ranks of extremist and Jihadist groups like Ansar al-Sharia in Derna and Benghazi. ""His return to Libya should raise the alarm bells for the Libyan authorities and Libya's friends in the West"" Eljarh told CNN. Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence for the Texas-based global intelligence firm Stratfor, echoed Eljarh's concerns. ""We learned a long time ago that negotiating with terrorists leads to more threats, attacks and kidnappings"" Burton, who is also a former U.S. counterterrorism agent told CNN via e-mail Tuesday. ""Unfortunately the exchange will elevate the kidnapping and threat profile for other diplomats in Libya,"" Burton said. There are also concerns this could set a dangerous precedent for Jordan, a key U.S. ally that has Jihadists and other al Qaeda linked militants in its jails. Diplomats and officials have been frequently targeted by militias and extremist groups that have grown in size and influence in Libya since the 2011 revolution. The worst such attack on September 11, 2012, was on the American consulate in Benghazi in which U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans were killed. After a string of attacks before and after the assault on the consulate, most countries closed their diplomatic missions in Benghazi where the almost daily violence in the city is blamed on Islamist extremist groups. There have also been attacks on embassies and kidnappings of diplomats in the capital Tripoli, where even a prime minister was kidnapped for several hours in October. So far this year, Egyptian diplomats, a South Korean official and a Tunisian Embassy employee were kidnapped in the Libyan capital. The two Tunisians, a diplomat and a member of staff remain abducted. In a video released last month by a Jihadist group, a man said to be one of the two Tunisians, was seen crying and begging the Tunisian government to negotiate with his captors. The group is demanding the release of Tunisian Islamist militants imprisoned by Tunis. There are increasing worries about the rising threat posed by extremist groups operating in Libya. A recently released annual report by the U.S. State Department on global terrorism trends singled out Libya as an area of concern and instability. ""Libya's porous borders, the weakness of Libya's nascent security institutions, and large amounts of loose small arms create opportunities for violent extremists,"" the report said. CNN's Ed Payne and Saeed Ahmed in Atlanta and Caroline Faraj in Dubai contributed to this report.","News agency: Ambassador Fawaz al-Aytan was freed by his captors .

"(CNN) -- Olympic hero Michael Phelps was suspended from competitive swimming for three months on Thursday -- just hours after one of his sponsors announced it would not renew his contract after a photo surfaced of him smoking from a bong. Michael Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" after a  photo of him smoking from a bong was published. USA Swimming, the nation's governing body for competitive swimming, said it was withdrawing financial support for Phelps and barring him from competition during the period of his ""reprimand."" ""This is not a situation where any anti-doping rule was violated, but we decided to send a strong message to Michael because he disappointed so many people, particularly the hundreds of thousands of USA Swimming-member kids who look up to him as a role model and a hero,"" they said in a statement. ""Michael has voluntarily accepted this reprimand and has committed to earn back our trust,"" the statement continued. Earlier Thursday, Kellogg Co. said it will not renew Phelps' advertising contract. ""Michael's most recent behavior is not consistent with the image of Kellogg,"" company spokeswoman Susanne Norwitz said. ""His contract expires at the end of February, and we have made a decision not to extend his contract."" Norwitz said Kellogg's relationship with Phelps began with the company's support of the U.S. Olympic team. Kellogg did not renew its sponsorship of the team when it expired in December, she said. Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" on Sunday after a British newspaper published the photograph. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina in Columbia. The Richland County, South Carolina, sheriff's office said Tuesday it was investigating whether Phelps smoked marijuana on the school campus, adding it would file criminal charges if it determined he did. Both university police and Columbia, South Carolina, police said they would not pursue charges, according to The State newspaper in Columbia. It was unclear where the party took place, the paper said, or whether it was on campus. On Thursday, before the decisions by USA Swimming and Kellogg were announced, Phelps told CNN affiliate WBAL that the incident was a result of ""bad judgment.""  Watch Phelps' comments to WBAL » . ""I can learn from it and try to make my life better than it has been in the past,"" he told WBAL. ""I think it's hard to really be ready for any of this. But I've actually been able to talk to a lot of people, and lot of people that have been in my shoes in other sports, and I've been able to get their perspective and just talk to them a little bit, and that's been helpful over the last few days,"" Phelps said. In a statement released Sunday, Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, said: ""I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment."" ""I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me,"" he said. ""For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again."" iReport.com: Should Phelps have been suspended? The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part: ""Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions. We are confident that, going forward, Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion."" In 2004, Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. He also issued an apology after that incident. Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who pledged to ""My Victory,"" an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean.","USA Swimming suspends Michael Phelps from competition for three months .

"Perth, Australia (CNN) -- Four weeks to the day since Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, the search is set to continue Saturday -- both on the surface of the southern Indian Ocean and deep below it. Time is fast ticking down to find the missing Boeing 777's locator pingers: If functioning as expected, their batteries will run out of juice Monday. The British Royal Navy survey ship HMS Echo and the Australian naval supply ship Ocean Shield began scouring about 6,500 feet to 13,000 feet deep on the ocean floor on Friday along a single 150-mile (240-kilometer) track, said retired Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, the head of the Australian agency coordinating the search. The Ocean Shield has high-tech gear borrowed from the United States. That includes a Bluefin-21, which can scour the ocean floor for wreckage, and a Towed Pinger Locator 25, with its underwater microphone to detect pings from the jet's voice and data recorders as deep as 20,000 feet (6,100 meters). ""It is a very slow proceeding,"" U.S. Navy Capt. Mark M. Matthews said of the second tool, which is towed behind a vessel typically moving at 1 to 5 knots. Said Bill Schofield, an Australian scientist who worked on developing flight data recorders: ""If they do find it, I think it'll be remarkable."" Up to 10 military planes and three civilian aircraft -- in addition for 11 ships -- will be looking Saturday for any sign of Flight 370, according to the Australian government. The search area will be just under 84,000 square miles (217,000 square kilometers), which is slightly less than the area searched Friday, and will focus some 1,050 miles northwest of Perth. This is about 50 miles further from the western Australian city than was the case a day earlier. Is this the right spot? Will they find anything? So far, all efforts to locate signs of the airliner have proven unsuccessful. Still, those involved have vowed to keep trying. ""Really, the best we can do right now is put these assets in the best location -- the best guess we have -- and kind of let them go,"" U.S. Navy Cmdr. William Marks told CNN. ""Until we get conclusive evidence of debris, it is just a guess."" 'Long way to go' Officials have repeatedly warned that the massive international search to find signs of the Kuala Lumpur-to-Beijing flight may not conclude any time soon. ""We've still got a long way to go,"" Houston said Friday. In the case of Air France Flight 447, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in 2009, officials found debris on the surface after five days of searching. But it took them nearly two years to find the main pieces of wreckage, the flight recorders and many of the bodies of those on board. With Flight 370, the search teams have even fewer clues. On Thursday, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott warned that ""we cannot be certain of ultimate success in the search"" for the Malaysian aircraft. He described it as the most difficult search ""in human history."" Authorities have yet to explain why the plane flew off course or where it ended up; investigations into the 227 passengers and 12 crew members have yielded no suggestion that any of them might have been behind the disappearance. 6 missteps in the investigation . Families' frustrations . Malaysian officials held a briefing for Malaysian relatives of those aboard MH370 on Thursday evening at a Kuala Lumpur hotel, but attendees told CNN that nothing new had emerged. Mohammad Sahril Shaari, whose cousin Mohammad Razahan Zamani was a honeymooning groom on the plane, said the three-hour session had felt like a ""waste of time."" He added, ""I was hoping for some news that they had tracked the plane or some parts of it, but nothing like that happened."" Selamat Bin Omar, the father of another passenger, Malaysian civil flight engineer Mohammed Khairul Amri Selamat, said officials described in detail the satellite data that has led investigators to the current search area. ""They could not tell us if the plane crashed,"" he said. ""They said they were still looking into it."" Danica Weeks, wife of passenger Paul Weeks, said after the meeting that the jet's disappearance still perplexes her. ""The hardest process for me is understanding that a commercial airliner can just go black,"" the New Zealander told CNN's Paula Newton. ""That someone can just turn off all communications, all matter of tracking an airliner, and it can just disappear. And this is the mystery."" About the search for the plane, she said, ""If it's there, they will find it. But are they in the right place? It's all calculations. It's all guesswork."" Hanging on to hope . Weeks said her infant son Jack will celebrate his first birthday next month, and their 3-year-old son, Lincoln, was still coming to grips with their loss. ""Dad was everything for him,"" she said. ""He read Lincoln always his bedtime story, and they had this saying that they'd say -- you know, 'Good night, I love you and see you in the morning for breakfast.' ""And now he comes out and I tell him that Dad is up in the sky, and we come out every night and we find the brightest star. We find the brightest star and he says, 'Good night, Daddy, I love you. See you in the morning for breakfast.' And that breaks my heart."" But, four weeks after the plane vanished, she too has not given up on seeing him for breakfast. ""I know it sounds crazy, but I still have a slight hope, you know,"" she said, adding that she will be able to grieve only after confronted by evidence of his death. ""The grief at this point still hasn't started for me,"" she said. ""I have my moments, but until I have evidence, I still don't know."" The partner of American passenger Philip Wood was also among those who attended Friday's meeting. ""The only thing I learned last night after three hours is that the Malaysian families are more calm and rational than the Chinese,"" Sarah Bajc told CNN's Judy Kwon in an e-mail. ""But they are equally frustrated and have totally lost faith in the Malaysian government."" Bajc noted that officials have concluded that the jetliner flew over Malaysia ""for quite a long time."" ""It is impossible that this relatively sophisticated military power didn't see it,"" she said. ""They are clearly hiding something. We just don't know what."" Malaysia refuses to let families hear the plane's radio communications . The Malaysian Department of Civil Aviation denied a request by Malaysian families to release the audio recording of radio communications among the pilot, co-pilot and air traffic control, two people who attended the briefing said. The department's chief, Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, told the relatives that even the families of pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid have not been allowed to listen to the recording because it is part of an ongoing investigation, the two attendees said. Malaysian authorities released a transcript of the recording Tuesday. ""This is an event that is so unprecedented and I think that is so significant that it can never be allowed to get off the screens, get off the radar,"" K.S. Narendran told CNN's Erin Burnett. His wife, Chandrika Sharma, was on the flight. ""My concern is that if we don't really get to the bottom of it, we cannot really be certain that we are safe and that we are secure every time we board a flight.""

"(CNN) -- It was once a potent symbol of Britain's industrial revolution. With its myriad mills, factories, train lines and canals, the area surrounding King's Cross railway station in London was a hive of production -- if smoggy and bleak. Today, this centrally located district is drawing in cutting-edge businesses big and small. ""It's a really vibrant area,"" explained local barista, Louis Gill. ""It's got Central Saint Martins (college), all the art students, the fashion students, interesting businesses, Guardian Media, and there's a tech industry flourishing here as well."" See also: London's insane luxury basements . What Gill describes is the first stages of one of the large`st regeneration projects in the UK. When finished, 2,000 new apartments and 23 new office buildings will stretch across 650,000 square meters (6.9 million square feet) of land to the north of central London. All in all, the ambitious project is set to cost an estimated $33 billion. ""We really wanted King's Cross to be a mixed-use project with lots of offices, homes, retail, a proper destination with lots of different characters across the site and very much making the most of the fantastic heritage we have here,"" said Robert Evans of Argent Developers, the company charged with bringing the project to life. Google has chosen this site to be its UK headquarters, BNP Paribas has reserved a substantial office space while the Grand Northern Hotel, which has stood as an icon of Kings Cross since 1854, has had a makeover. A nearby Victorian grain store has also been refitted to host one of London's most prestigious art schools. ""When we were talking to Google about why choose King's Cross (and) what is it that makes it so attractive, of course they talked about the transport, ability to do a building of one million square feet in one place, but it's also the tone of the place,"" said Evans. ""They said to us what you've managed to create here is something professional, not corporate."" ""With lots of different characters across the site (we are) very much making the most of the fantastic heritage we have here,"" Evans added. A new power source . This integrated mix of commercial and residential real estate development is impressive in its sweeping scale and ambition, but its not the only mega-project transforming a previously industrial area of the city. Battersea Power Station in southwest London opened in the 1930s and at its peak generated one fifth of the British capital's power. See also: Where are the world's most expensive luxury homes? After it closed in 1983, however, it was widely considered an eyesore. Plans to revamp the site never came to fruition -- until now. Work has begun on a project that will see 3,000 new homes, 120,000 square meters (1.29 million sq ft) of retail space and 160,000 (1.72 million sq ft) square meters of offices built. Two new underground stations will connect the area to central London. ""This is a big project ... a challenging project,"" said CEO of Battersea Power Station, Robert Tincknell. ""The equity that is necessary is very large, our shareholders have pledged up to Â£1 billion ($1.63 billion) worth of equity."" ""Having that weight of support and financial backing behind this project has been the key to getting it over the line,"" he added. Securing funds of this size in today's market means sourcing money not just from London and the UK but from investors around the world as well. The Battersea development has been paid for by a consortium of funds that are partly owned by the Malaysian government. According to Stephen Miles-Brown, head of residential at property consultancy, Knight Frank, these investment trends reflect the nature of many major international projects today. ""Emerging economies like China, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, tend to see opportunities, tend to be braver, than the indigenous population."" ""Often, they come and they see there's central London, there's King's Cross, there's Elephant and Castle, there Stratford and they look in terms of their own cities. (They ask) it's central London, why isn't everyone redeveloping this?"" ""(They are) coming over here with large checkbooks, huge ambitions, and a great deal of skill."" See also: Meet the micro-homes offering big solutions . So far, both King's Cross and Battersea developments look like smart money for those who have stumped up the cash. Early interest from commercial and residential buyers has been high. Of the 900 apartments in phase one of the Battersea project, only seven remain unsold. As both projects continue and more property reaches the market, developers will hope this demand remains. With real-estate prices currently soaring and office space at a premium it seems the lure of London is feeding the furnaces, not of the industrial mills and power stations of days gone by, but of its burgeoning property sector.","Old industrial sites in London are being redeveloped to host new office and residential space .
Giant projects are underway at King's Cross and Battersea Power Station .

"(CNN) -- Tamika Morrison and Joi Disroe knew each other for several months before they met in person. But, when they finally did connect, it was as if they had known each other for much longer. ""The emotion was so genuine,"" Morrison said of their first encounter. ""When she looked at me, she looked like she saw a friend of hers that she had not seen in a long time."" The two met at a gathering for Atlanta-area ""pinners,"" the name fans use to pledge their allegiance to Pinterest, the popular Internet pinboard. As the online community swells with more and more people sharing images of dream homes, extravagant food and inspirational phrases, pinners are forging connections in real-life at fan parties such as May's ""Perfect Pinterest Party"" in Atlanta. The gatherings also offer an opportunity to capture a slice of Pinterest's audience in one room at a time: women of all colors, sizes and income brackets and a few well-dressed men. Many have dozens of boards and hundreds, if not thousands of pins, that they use for a variety of purposes, from sharing and storing recipe and decor inspiration to networking and creating their own brand. From pins to projects: Pinterest in real life . Pinterest has organized several meet-ups in the past year in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles, which drew guests from San Diego and even as far as Mexico. The Atlanta event was unique because pinners from the area hatched and planned the event on their own. Besides donating T-shirts and promoting the event on social media, Pinterest had no hand in directly organizing it. ""This party and other parties of this nature are truly an amazing effort by the Pinners themselves,"" a Pinterest spokeswoman said in an e-mail. The self-driven model is gaining ground. Pinners are known to host get-togethers in homes or organize outings based around activities and recipes discovered via Pinterest. And, because they already have one passion (or several) in common, striking up small talk at these events can be a little easier than meeting up with perfect strangers. The parties are opportunities to meet others whose taste these pinners admire from afar. Melanie Woodroffe, who admits to being ""pin-obsessed,"" started planning the Atlanta event in February with the goal of bringing pinners together to benefit a local nonprofit. It turned out to be an easy sell for Pinterest, which contributed giveaways for a raffle, and for local sponsors, who donated free food and drinks. She found the perfect venue in craft store Re-inspiration, a converted house that sells recycled goods by local artists, from wind chimes and jewelry made of glass bottles to driftwood wall signs bearing inspirational phrases. ""Re-inspiration represents a live version of Pinterest,"" Woodroffe, who wore a gray Pinterest T-shirt as she greeted visitors outside the store. ""It is creative and community-based, and I love that. [It] reminded me why I love Pinterest so much!"" It was a no-brainer for the store's owner, Brooke Schultze, an avid pinner who promotes items from the store on her boards. Interest, meet Pinterest: Site helps users catalog their passions . ""The idea was to form a community around Pinterest in Atlanta that extends beyond just sitting behind a computer [and] into the community to see actual things that are featured on Pinterest, "" Schultze said. Guests walked up stairs to an enclosed porch, where a table of red velvet and rum raisin cake balls awaited them, courtesy of ""Kheesecake"" baker Kelli Fair. Past the colorful wooden birdhouses and lawn decorations of corrugated metal, another table offered vases of M&Ms and popcorn in a nod to the ""vase-as-a-vessel-for-other-items"" motif popular on Pinterest. Several guests remarked that they had seen the sausage cheddar balls on Pinterest as well. Initially, guests moved around tentatively in groups of two and three, taking pictures with smart phones and iPads of store goods and pinning them. As time passed and drinks were imbibed, people began mingling. Joi Disroe was milling among the crowd when she recognized Tamika Morrison from photos on her boards. Disroe, who owns a catering business with her husband, wanted to put a real face to the person whose images of food and ""tablescapes"" she frequently ""liked"" or commented on. Morrison started following Disroe's ""Haute Kitchen"" board after seeing a blog image of a kitchen with black cabinetry accented with a gray, heavily distressed island and wood floors. ""When I look at her pins, I think, 'that kitchen could be my kitchen,' "" said Morrison, a public relations professional who runs her own boutique agency. ""Pinning is about creating a place to escape to, a perfect world around whatever the topic is. She gives me photos that I can bring to my collection."" The two shared a laugh over the odd familiarity of the relationship and talked about each other's pins before parting ways, feeling as if they had just reconnected with an old friend. ""It reminded me of the importance to still connect face-to-face with people, but the cool part was that social media, pinning to be exact, was the commonality we shared,"" Morrison. ""Instead of the usual 'hello, I'm so-and-so, what do you do?' it was more like, 'Oh! You're so-and-so!!! I love the picture you posted the other day,"" she said. ""It was a very cool experience and shows just how social media has influenced the way we connect."" Pinterest not manly enough for you? Try these sites, bro . Have you connected with people in person that you met online via social media? Let us know in the comments below.","As Pinterest community grows online, pinners organize meet-ups to connect followers .

"(CNN) -- At the age of 12, Stephen Wolfram was reading college physics textbooks and toying around with a computer roughly ""the size of a large desk. With 8K of 18-bit words of core memory. And programmed with paper tape."" By the age of 20, he had gotten his Ph.D. and was on his way to inventing his own computational system. But last year, at the age of 50, Wolfram launched what may be his most ambitious effort -- Wolfram|Alpha, a knowledge engine that answers users' questions on the Web by computing answers in real time with the help of a vast collection of databases. In a talk at the TED2010 conference in February, Wolfram outlined the potential of the Alpha engine and talked more broadly about using computing to understand physics and model the universe. Learn more about Stephen Wolfram at TED.com . He talked in greater detail about the development of Wolfram|Alpha by videoconference at the 50 Years of Public Computing at the University of Illinois conference at Urbana-Champaign on April 15. Here are excerpts from that talk: (A complete version is available here.) ""A year ago, we launched Wolfram|Alpha. ""It was quite tense. The culmination of about five years of work and 25 more years of previous development. An absurdly ambitious project that I hadn't been sure was going to be possible at all. ""Our long-term goal was -- and is -- to make all the world's systematic knowledge computable. To take all the data, and models, and methods that our civilization has accumulated -- and set it up so that it can immediately be used to compute answers to whatever questions people ask. ""There's a long, long history to this basic idea. [German mathematician Gottfried] Leibniz was talking about a version of it 300 years ago. And 50 years ago, when computers were young, it seemed like it wouldn't be long before it was possible. ""But people mostly thought that it'd happen by computers managing to emulate brains -- and pulling in knowledge and processing like we humans do. Well, I myself am right now 50 years old... and, as perhaps I'll show you later, I'd actually been thinking about globally systematizing knowledge since I was a kid. ""It was about 30 years ago when I first started thinking about making knowledge broadly computable. And at the time I concluded it'd require solving the whole problem of artificial intelligence -- and was way out of reach. But then I spent the next 25 years doing things that, as I'll explain, finally made me think: Maybe, just maybe this computable knowledge idea isn't so out of reach. ""I must say that at first I still didn't know if it was only not out of reach in the 50-year-type time frame. Or the 20-year. Or the five-year. But I decided that we should give it a try. ""It had all started with some abstract intellectual ideas. And now, in the end, it had turned into millions of lines of code, terabytes of data -- and 10,000 servers that we'd just been finishing assembling. ""Some news had come out about our project, so there was a lot of anticipation. And we knew there'd be a big spike in people wanting to try out what we'd done. ""We'd obviously done lots of testing. But we really didn't have any idea what would happen when millions of people actually started accessing our system. ""But we thought: Let's let as many people as possible share the experience of finding out. ""So we decided to do a live webcast of the moment when we actually made our system live to the world. ""Well, actually, the day of the event I was thinking: this is going to be such boring TV. All that's going to happen is that at some moment we'll push a virtual button, and everything will go live. ""Well, needless to say, it didn't stay boring long. ""Early in the day, we had finally finished assembling all our servers -- and were able to switch them all on. And... oh my gosh... lots of stuff didn't work. ""Well, at the appointed time we started the live webcast. And still things weren't working. There was a horrible networking and load-balancing problem. ""We'd advertised 9 p.m. as our go-live time. We figured at that time on Friday evening most people wouldn't be thinking about us... so we'd have a comparatively soft launch. ""Well, with perhaps 15 minutes to go, we'd finally solved the main technical problem. ""You know, some people had said when you look at other peoples' control rooms they often have television weather and news playing. Perhaps we should have that too. ""I said bah, we won't need that. This is just a computer thing. We don't care if it's raining. ""Well, fortunately we did actually have good weather and news feeds. Because this was May in the Midwest. And as it turned out, with perhaps 30 minutes to go, there was another problem. Here, we can actually look at live Wolfram|Alpha to find out about it. [By typing in ""weather champaign may 15 2009,"" a chart was generated of wind speed in Champaign, Illinois, for that date.] . ""See that giant spike in wind speed just before 8pm? That was a tornado. Approaching our location. Well, we had backup generators -- and of course we had several remote co-location sites for our servers. ""But still, we had a tornado coming straight for us. ""Well, fortunately, at the last minute, it turned away. And the power didn't even go out. So at 9:33:50 p.m. central time on May 15, 2009, I pressed the button, and Wolfram|Alpha went live.

"London, England (CNN) -- When it comes to theatrical dance in the Arab world, all roads lead to Mahmoud Reda. During a glittering career, the 79-year-old Egyptian dancer and choreographer has performed on the world's most prestigious stages, including New York's Carnegie Hall and Congress Hall in Berlin. His universal appeal, likened to U.S. dance legends Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire, has allowed Reda to export his particular mix of theatrical and traditional dance around the globe. This year, the Arab dance ambassador celebrates the 50th anniversary of his influential folk dance group, the Reda Dance Troupe. Reda's style draws from techniques of jazz, ballet, Hindu dance and Russian folkloric dance. It has had influenced and shaped the dance form known as ""Raks Sharki"" (Oriental dance), more commonly known as ""belly dancing"" outside the Middle East. ""I was inspired by folklore and putting my own technique with some blend of classical ballet to improve, you know, the movements,"" Reda told CNN.","Egyptian legend Mahmoud Reda celebrating 50 years of his dance troupe.

"(CNN) -- NGOs can be funny, at least that's what Hussein Kurji is banking on. As a filmmaker in Nairobi, Kenya, he was constantly privy to stories of hilarious ineptitude by supposedly do-good organizations. ""Nairobi has a large development community, and I realized it's never actually been talked about in the context of comedy. I thought it would be good to bring the two worlds together,"" he says. Thus, he was inspired to create ""The Samaritans,"" a mockumentary-style show about the inner workings of the NGO world. Characters include Scott, the cocky American brought in as the new country director at the Kenyan field office for ""Aid for Aid"" (the organization's mission is a little unclear). There's the substance-addicted former interim director (her ""usual"" consists of ""a bottle of 75% proof vodka, six Valiums and a crack pipe"") and a finance director who refers to posting pictures on ""The Facebook."" Read more: Stunning photos of Kenya at 50 . ""The Samaritans is a work of fiction, but based on true stories,"" Kurji explains. ""A lot of what we have portrayed has actually occurred, but since it's a comedy, we exaggerated to get good laughs."" A good deal of inside knowledge is provided by Liam Acton, the actor who plays Scott. In a previous incarnation, Acton actually managed an NGO, a job, he admits, for which he was under qualified. ""I'm not even a good actor, let alone an NGO worker,"" he jokes. Making the switch, he says, was easier than one might imagine. ""There are only about three white actors in Kenya. When the role was written for a white guy, I guess I was privileged to be one,"" he says. In truth, though, Acton's non-profit experience has proved useful to the show, especially in developing his character. ""There are about 20 real-life 'Scotts' I've come across in my time [in Nairobi]. He's an amalgamation of different despicable elements,"" he says. Since the episodes have gone live, Kurji says several NGO workers have reached out to share their more ludicrous stories. Prime examples include the charity that auctioned off a permit to hunt a black rhino in Namibia for $350,000 -- money raised to conserve the black rhino species -- and an NGO that spent money sending a technologically challenged motivational speaker to a South African village to teach the local school children IT skills. Read this: Kenyan yoga strikes a pose . ""There's a fine line between what's funny, and what's truly tragic,"" says Acton. Kurji used Kickstarter to fund the pilot for the show, and is relying on donations through the show's website (all pledges enable donors to watch the first two episodes -- the only ones produced at the moment) to finish the season. The show has proved popular. So far, the trailer has garnered nearly 92,000 views on YouTube alone. At one point, it was the most popular clip in Kenya. Somewhat bafflingly, Kurji has also received funding from an NGO, begging the question: What do they get out of it? ""We asked the same question, and they told us they've been looking for a way to start a dialogue regarding certain NGOs that don't necessarily behave themselves. They thought comedy would be a great way to highlight those issues of credibility and accountability,"" Kurji says. Still, the team point out that ultimately, their goals for making the show are not particularly lofty. ""I guess the main reason I chose this subject matter was because I thought the stories were absurd, and would make for good television. As a producer, my primary goal was entertainment,"" notes Kurji. ""We're not pushing to make changes; we're not qualified for that. You can say you recognize the funny part -- whether its NGOs that are funny or the people in them -- but I don't feel anyone doing this had high-minded ideals,"" adds Acton. While he is in talks with a pan-African distribution company, ultimately, Kurji is hoping the show will appeal to an international audience. ""Ideally, we'd like to be on platforms like Netflix. Or maybe we could co-produce this with you guys at CNN?"" he asks. Read more: Maasai Cricket Warriors .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Twin car bombs exploded near three Iraqi government buildings Sunday in central Baghdad, killing at least 132 people. It was the deadliest attack in the country in more than two years. More than 500 people were wounded. The blasts had ripple effects throughout the country, triggering questions about the state of Iraqi security and about national elections planned for January. No one immediately claimed responsibility. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki vowed to punish ""the enemies of the Iraqi people who want to spread chaos in the country and derail the political process and prevent the parliamentary elections from taking place as planned."" Surveying the carnage shortly after the explosions, al-Maliki said holding the elections as scheduled would send the strongest response and message to the ""enemies of the political process who are supported from the outside."" ""The cowardly attack that took place today should not affect the determination of the Iraqi people from continuing their battle against the deposed regime and the gangs of criminal Baath party and the terrorist al Qaeda organization, who have committed the most heinous crimes against the civilians,' "" al-Maliki said in a statement. Iraqi and U.S. officials had warned of a possible increase in violence ahead of the balloting. President Obama condemned the ""outrageous attacks against the Iraqi people."" In a statement, Obama called the bombings an attempt to ""derail Iraq's progress"" and pledged that the United States would be a ""close friend and partner"" as Iraq prepares for elections. According to the statement, Obama spoke Sunday with al-Maliki and Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to express his condolences and reiterate U.S. support. The area struck Sunday is close to the heavily guarded Green Zone that also houses the U.S. Embassy. Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. military commander in Iraq, and Christopher Hill, U.S. ambassador to Iraq, condemned the bombings, which came a day after the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, visited the country for the first time. ""We will assist the Iraqi government in any way we can to ensure that those individuals or groups responsible for such horrific acts be pursued and brought to justice,"" they said in a joint statement. The European Union condemned ""this terrorist attack"" and sent its condolences to the families of the victims, the Swedish presidency said in a statement. The bombs detonated in quick succession about 10:30 a.m., as the Iraqi work week began, an Interior Ministry official said. Among more than 500 people wounded were three American security contractors, the U.S. Embassy told CNN. The embassy would not give any more details. One of the bombs exploded outside Baghdad's governorate building. The other was outside the Justice Ministry, about 500 meters (1,600 feet) away. The nearby Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works also sustained severe damage. Plumes of smoke billowed from the sites of the attacks as victims fled, some with blood streaming down their faces. The streets were strewn with debris, including charred cars and chunks of concrete from damaged buildings. Some government buildings and others in the area were heavily damaged. It was the deadliest attack on Iraqi civilians since August 2007, when three truck bombings targeted Iraqi Kurds, killing hundreds in Qahtaniya, in northern Iraq. In August, more than 100 people were killed in a series of bombings in Baghdad in what Iraqis have dubbed ""Bloody Wednesday."" Those attacks shook confidence in the abilities of Iraqi security forces who took over securing urban areas from U.S. troops over the summer. Security was tightened around Baghdad in the wake of the August bombings. Blast walls were erected around the city and more checkpoints were set up. Susan Rice, the ambassador, completed her two-day visit to Iraq on Saturday that included a condolence stop at the Foreign Ministry, one of the sites attacked in August. Iraqi journalists grilled officials on TV on Sunday, demanding to know how the most recent attacks could have taken place given the new security measures. An Iraqi official said the government was working to bolster security, but regional cooperation was needed to help fight suicide bombers. ""We are calling on international and U.N. envoys to come and find out why Iraq is being targeted this way,"" said Ali al-Dabbagh, the Iraqi government spokesman. He said Iraq's setbacks are mainly caused by a fledgling intelligence that has ""not been completed."" The Iraqi government has blamed Syria for harboring former Baath party members who it said planned the August attacks, and asked for their handover. Relations between the two neighbors were strained after the bombings. Each withdrew its ambassador from the other's country. Sunday's bombings came on the day Iraqi officials were due to try to break a logjam holding up a new election law. Iraqis are supposed to go to the polls January 16, but Parliament still has not passed the legislation, putting the balloting in limbo. The original deadline for parliament to pass the law was October 15, because Iraq's electoral commission says it needs 90 days to organize the process. Iraq's parliament failed Wednesday to reach agreement on a new electoral law, so the issue was supposed go to the Political Council for National Security on Sunday. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Mohammed Jamjoom, and Mohammed Tawfeeq contributed to this report.","Obama condemns bombings, pledges U.S. support for Iraq election .

"(CNN) -- U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Saturday warned officials in the embattled Central African Republic not to repeat the mistakes that led to the Rwanda genocide 20 years ago. In a speech to the country's National Transitional Council in the capital city, Bangui, the leader of the international body also urged the world not to ""look away"" from the nation's turmoil. ""Some say this is a forgotten crisis,"" Ban said. ""I am here to help make sure the world does not forget."" The Central African Republic, a former French colony, plunged into chaos last year after a coalition of mostly Muslim rebels ousted President Francois Bozize. They have since been forced out of power, but Christian and Muslim militias continue to battle for control. Thousands have died during the fighting and 2.2 million people, about half the country's population, are in need of humanitarian aid, according to the U.N. More than 650,000 people are still internally displaced, and nearly 300,000 have fled to neighboring countries in search of refuge. U.N.L Soldiers from Chad killed civilians in neighboring CAR . The latest setback comes in the form of charges by the U.N.'s human rights office that soldiers from neighboring Chad attacked civilians in a Bangui market last month. According to a preliminary report from the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, the soldiers killed nearly 30 civilians and injured 300 more on March 29. Investigators said the Chadian soldiers were not part of the African-led peacekeeping force, which is meant to stabilize the Central African Republic, but a group that appeared to have returned to Chad after the attack. Just before the U.N. published its preliminary findings of the attack, Chad decided to withdraw its 850 troops from the peacekeeping force, a move the chairwoman of the African Union said is understandable. Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said Chad had been the target of repeated attacks by Christian militia elements and unfounded allegations by a number of actors. ""The stigmatization of the Chadian contingent has contributed to the establishment of a climate of insecurity and hostility for which the nationals of that country had paid a heavy price,"" Dlamini-Zuma said in a statement. Rwanda: Remembering -- and trying to forget . In his speech Saturday, Ban stressed that the international community has an obligation to act, warning that the Central African Republic is ""at risk of partition."" ""The international community failed the people of Rwanda 20 years ago,"" Ban said. ""And we are at risk of not doing enough for the people of the C.A.R. today."" In 1994, Hutu extremists in Rwanda targeted ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a three-month killing spree that left an estimated 800,000 people dead. After his visit to the Central African Republic, the U.N. Secretary-General travels to Rwanda for the ceremonies observing the 20th anniversary of the genocide there. Ban thanked the African Union-led peacekeeping force, as well as the French forces, for their efforts to maintain order in the country. He said there are preparations for a U.N. presence in the Central African Republic, but peacekeepers ""will not arrive right away,"" as their deployment depends on decisions from the Security Council.

"(CNN) -- General Motors is under fire following its delayed decision to recall 2.6 million cars over a faulty ignition switch. The automotive giant's CEO says she is ""deeply sorry"" for 13 deaths caused by the defect. In isolation that's bad enough. But it's been exacerbated by another recall, this time of 1.3 million vehicles beset by a potentially dangerous power steering problem. Critics might say it's hardly unexpected from a company that took a $49.5 billion U.S. Government bailout in 2008 and ended up costing the US tax payer $10.5 billion. Apologists claim that if General Motors had been allowed to wither and die, it would have cost the US in the region of $66 billion. Probably more important is the potential human toll -- an industrial apocalypse like this would have wreaked on GM's 212,000-strong global work force. Then there are the millions of employees working for the various suppliers who would also have suffered. But was saving General Motors, and thereby condemning it to more of the same, really the triumph that some (mainly blinkered GM management) claimed? In 2013, General Motors' global sales were up 4% compared with the previous year. That's in a market of worldwide vehicle sales that was up 7%. GM's big rival Ford's global sales increased by 12% over the same period. General Motors has multiple problems and none of them is new. Lack of positive image and identity is one. Hear the words General and Motors together in the UK and it's usually because of mass redundancies or a factory being shut. Of its brands, Vauxhalls are insipid and to sell in the required volumes they are heavily discounted and sold to rental firms, a killer for models' retained values that increasingly savvy consumers now consider. Then there's Chevrolet. The decision to import the latest iterations of Camaros and Corvettes -- cars more worthy of the bowtie badge than the Sparks and Aveos we've currently got, coincided with a GM directive to withdraw Chevrolet from the UK by the end of 2015. To calm a nervy dealer network, prices in January were slashed by up to 42%. You could buy a Chevy Captiva seven-seat SUV for Â£12,295 ($20,460), the sort of money that barely buys a decently equipped three-door Volkswagen Polo. Unsurprisingly at that sort of money dealers haven't struggled. Chevrolet's February sales were up 114% proving what Korean firms have known all along: workmanlike products will sell if priced correctly. Such business blunders abound. Twenty years ago, General Motors became the first major car manufacturer in the modern era to mass produce an electric car. It wanted to prove the viability of the project by inviting drivers to become one of 50 to lease the Impact electric vehicle. The project leader anticipated 80 applicants. In Los Angeles there were 10,000. In New York 14,000. There was evidently an appetite for electric cars. GM shelved the Impact. Management admits that now its zero and low emissions vehicle technologies have fallen behind rivals. Defeat from the jaws of victory and symptomatic of a company lacking the vision now required to compete at the cutting edge of car manufacturing. GM used to own Swedish car firm Saab. In 2008 it finished development on the 9-4X, a competent SUV designed primarily for the US market. It was the sort of car that should turn a decent profit margin, perfect to help re-fill a cash-strapped company's depleted coffers. GM didn't launch the car until 2011. Three years can be more than half a car's life: the 9-4X was past-it before anyone outside GM and Saab even drove it. You can almost hear the mirth from boardrooms in Germany, Japan, Korea and even China. But could that be GM's salvation? As a Brit who has watched an entire car industry slip into foreign hands I can tell you overseas ownership hasn't been too bad at making viable businesses out of MINI, Rolls-Royce, Jaguar, Land Rover and Bentley. A fresh culture could be equally positive for GM. Successive American management teams have had their chance and at least 13 people have lost their lives. GM might be too big to die. It's not too big to be run properly by a foreign company. Read more: The 57-cent part at the center of GM's recall crisis . Read more: 7 takeaways from GM recall hearing .

"(CNN) -- A line of angry protesters waving signs and wearing scows formed a ring around the front entrance of the Daily News' headquarters. They took turns at the bullhorn accusing the paper of everything from libel to genocide. They didn't bring a list of demands; they weren't looking to negotiate. They had one goal: to shut the paper down forever. ""We're going to march until the walls come down,"" one shouted. Employees who would normally head out the revolving door to one of the lunch trucks along Broad street developed a taste for cafeteria food that day. Not Chuck Stone. Stone, senior editor of the newspaper they had pledged to kill, walked out the front entrance and met their scows with a broad smile. Picketers committed to the complete destruction of the Daily News returned his smile or nodded in recognition as they passed him. A few even shook his hand. I'll never forget that scene. It was, at once, improbable yet typical of a man who was as comfortable in the salons of power as he was in the embrace of the disadvantaged. Chuck was the last man you'd pick out of a lineup of guys suspected of aiding and abetting dangerous felons. In his horn-rimmed glasses, hand-tied, silk bowties and graying crew cut, he looked like a grown-up version of the nerds that tough guys used to beat up to burnish their reps. But fugitives who were wanted for vicious assaults and heinous crimes would call Chuck before they called their lawyers. In a town where some cops were known to administer curbside justice, surrendering to Chuck Stone was a way to keep from having their faces rearranged on the way to jail. At least 75 fugitives did just that over Stone's 19-year career. In 1981, he negotiated the release of six prison guards being held hostage by a band of armed inmates whose leader was doing life for killing a cop. Prisoners guards and a remarkably composed Chuck Stone emerged unscathed from the two-day ordeal. His departure in 1991 ended a 19-year run as the most influential columnist in town. Chuck's courtly manners and air of refinement could disarm the unwary. But the Daily News knew what they were getting when they hired him in 1972. Newsweek magazine had once dubbed him ""the angry man of the negro press."" Philadelphia was a target-rich environment in 1972. Frank Rizzo, a former police commissioner who had once left a formal dinner in a tuxedo to supervise the public strip search of a group of unarmed Black Panthers, had been elected mayor. Chuck began his Daily News tenure in time to see four City Council members, including the city council president get ensnared in the Abscam net. In a one-party town where an inbred Democratic machine reigned supreme, Chuck Stone was like a kid in a candy shop. He attacked police brutality, political corruption, the chronic failure of public schools and institutional injustice twice a week in the Daily News and weekly on his aptly-named TV show, ""On Target"". He was the Daily News' first black columnist. But he never saw color when he was looking through his gun sights. He described Wilson W. Goode, the city's first black mayor, as a ""paternalistic ferret."" When State Rep. Dwight Evans was the most-powerful black politician in the state capital, Stone called him ""an oleaginous eel."" The English language was a sharp tool in his hands. He described one of his targets as a ""retromingent,"" a term for an animal who urinates backward. But he could be effusive in praise. He originated the George Fencl Award, an honor named for a cop known for the kind of firm but fair police work which Stone advocated. His death on April 6 at age 89 ended a lifetime of service. He was trained as a Tuskegee Airman in a segregated U.S. Army in WWII. He had worked overseas for an international aid organization in the '50s. In the '60s, he was a special assistant to U.S. Rep. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. and later authored three books. He ended his career as a professor of Journalism at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, before retiring five years ago. Perhaps his most lasting legacy is as a founder of the National Association of Black Journalists. Les Payne, a Pulitizer Prize-winning columnist and NABJ co-founder once described him as the first amongst equals in founding NABJ. ""There were a lot of us in the room,"" Payne told me.

"Washington (CNN) -- It cost more than $193 million for the Pentagon to implement the policy of removing gays and lesbians from military service over six years, a study says. The Government Accountability Office, the congressional watchdog agency, looked at the cases of 3,664 active duty personnel forced to leave the service from 2004 to 2009 because of the ban on gays and lesbians serving openly in the military. The cost came to an average of $52,800 to take each person out of the military and find and train a replacement, it found. And the report released Thursday says that 40% of those service members had skills in a ""critical"" occupation or foreign language such as Arabic, or both. ""Our calculation includes the cost to the services to recruit a new service member, provide him or her with basic training and graduate the service member from initial skills training in the occupational specialty in which a service member had been separated,"" the report said. Of the cases examined by the GAO, 39%, or 1,442, service members who were removed under the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy held ""critical occupations"" such as infantryman. Less than 1%, 23, had foreign language skills, like Arabic or Spanish, according to the report. But the GAO noted that the number of people with critical skills and occupations might be even higher because of problems compiling the information. ""Service members with critical occupations and important foreign language skills are not necessarily mutually exclusive groups because some critical occupations, such as cryptologic linguists and interrogators, require an important foreign language skill,"" the report said. ""According to our analysis, 7 service members held a critical occupation and also held an important foreign language skill."" Congress approved a repeal of the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy and President Obama signed that change into law in December. The Defense Department is now drafting its plans to implement the change. But for now the policy remains in force. Opponents of the ban had long claimed that it caused a talent drain on the military, forcing soldiers with critical skills to leave the military at a time when the nation was fighting two wars. Rep. Susan Davis, D-California, asked for the study. She said the GAO report solidifies her belief in the repeal. ""Clearly this was the right thing to do,"" Davis said in a statement released by her office. ""No longer will American taxpayers continue to pay to throw out patriotic service members who want only to serve their country.""","Over six years, ""don't ask, don't tell"" cost more than $193 million, the GAO finds .

"Buenos Aires, Argentina (CNN)  -- Argentina's capital city was beset by strikes Thursday, with teachers, doctors and transit employees refusing to work over money matters. Teachers and doctors in Buenos Aires went on strike Wednesday and are scheduled to go back to work Friday, the government-run Telam news agency and other outlets reported. Subway workers will go on strike Thursday night for a few hours, they said. This is the fourth work stoppage in the past six months for doctors. Only emergency cases are being treated. The doctors are not only seeking better salaries, but also improvements to the public health system. They are protesting ""the lack of money in the public system, the possibility that the health budget will be reduced by 500 million pesos (about $130 million), the lack of professionals, the lack of labor to solve the problems in Argentina's public health,"" said Alicia Kobylarz of the Federal Syndicate of Health Workers. The nation's public hospitals treat the poor and needy. Health professionals want the government to employ more doctors to meet rising patient loads and an increase in diseases and epidemics such as H1N1 flu and dengue fever. The hospitals depend on funding from the provinces, leading to major differences in each area's needs and what local health care facilities can offer. ""Provinces that have petroleum income, for example, are provinces that have better budgets, that have better hospitals"" said Aldo Neri, a former national health minister. ""There is much inequality in the treatment that the poor receive in Argentinean public hospitals depending on which province they live in. That's why I say the inequalities have increased."" The current health minister, Juan Manzur, said next year's health budget will have an increase of more than 15 percent, greater than the national budget, which will have a 12.4 percent increase. Teachers also want greater pay and announced Thursday they would go back on strike Tuesday because of failed talks with Buenos Aires Education Director Mario Oporto. The teachers say they want their raises by year's end. Oporto said there's no money for raises now, the official Telam news agency reported. ""The province's posture is very clear: There won't be raises in 2009 because there already have been,"" Oporto told a radio station, according to Telam. ""We're sorry about the work stoppage, and we are ready to keep working. This time we are very firm: There will be no raises in 2009."" Daniel Scioli, governor of Buenos Aires Province, said public education ""is our top priority"" but also emphasized there would be no raises this year, the news agency reported. Teachers' union leaders complained Thursday that government officials went to schools Wednesday to find out which teachers were there and which had joined the work stoppage, Telam said. Subway workers in Buenos Aires announced they will walk off the job at 7 p.m. Thursday. They, too, want pay raises. Educators also are on strike in neighboring Chile, where professors say they are owed a ""historic debt."" The indefinite strike entered its fourth day Thursday and negotiations are scheduled to resume Friday. Jaime Gajardo, president of Chile's College of Professors, told a local TV station there has been improvement in negotiations with the government and the talks could advance noticeably in the next few days. Pablo Zalaquett, the mayor of Santiago, the capital of Chile, said the two sides are closer on a pay bonus the professors want. CNN's Javier Doberti contributed to this report.","Teachers, doctors in Buenos Aires scheduled to go back to work Friday .

"(CNN) -- It would be easy to criticize the burgeoning science of astrobiology as an intellectual endeavor best left to more profligate times. The search for extraterrestrial life and expeditions to hunt for life in Earth's extremes -- from the bottom of the oceans and Antarctica's extremes -- seem like luxuries for excitable explorers and space scientists. The enthusiasm about alien life isn't new; the ancient Greeks wondered whether there were other habitable worlds. But it is only recently that the search for extraterrestrial life has been underpinned by experiments -- telescopes to search for Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, rovers, like NASA's Curiosity, to hunt for life on Mars. In wanting to better assess whether life could be elsewhere, astrobiology has also set out on the more homely tasks of understanding how life evolved on the Earth, how life has persisted on our own planet for over three-and-a-half billion years and how it manages to thrive in extremes that to humans seem completely inimical to life. In uncovering the secrets of life's survival on the Earth, astrobiology has some found remarkably prosaic applications. The powder that works in your washing machine at high temperature functions because it contains proteins extracted from microbes that grow in volcanic hot springs. They were first found by scientists (who would today call themselves astrobiologists) seeking to know how life adapts to such primitive, searing surroundings. Read More: $1B mission to reach the Earth's mantle . Yet, some of the most promising locations to search for ancient life on Mars are places where water may have been in contact with volcanic rocks, ancient hydrothermal systems where conditions may have been conducive to life. As astrobiologists dig and scrape in amongst the microbial inhabitants of Earth's most hostile environments to understand the possibility of life elsewhere, they learn things that have economic uses. The link between the search for extraterrestrial life and our Earth-based problems is not surprising, because fundamentally it is all the same thing -- understanding how life, whether us or microbes, can be sustained in the cosmos. A hypothetical microbe on Mars might need to adapt to live in a high temperature stream. A human on Earth needs to find a way to clean its washing at high temperature. Both are trying to make a living on a planetary surface and both are trying to do this as efficiently as possible without wrecking their living conditions. Both might find that they can share a common way of accomplishing these things. Read more: Super telescope to search for secrets of the universe . It isn't uncommon to find environmentalists who are in awed disbelief that we can be spending billions searching for life on Mars and space explorers who feel that a focus on environmentalism narrows the reach and vision of our civilization. Both groups of people are separately emboldened by their vision. Environmentalists understand the great challenges that lie ahead in dealing with a population of seven billion apes inhabiting a piece of rock a mere 12,500 kilometers in diameter; space explorers understand that if they achieve their vision, and establish a permanent human presence beyond the Earth, they will not only open new opportunities for knowledge and resources, but they will also enhance our civilization's long term chances of survival. Now, more than at any time, we need a unified vision. Astrobiology is a bridge between understanding our Earth and exploring space and it reminds us that both endeavors are not merely linked, but basically one and the same challenge. By exploring the origin and evolution of life on the Earth and beyond we learn things of practical benefit to living on Earth and settling space. Once we see how environmentalism and space settlement are linked, we no longer stand peering into a future where we have to grapple with an either/or choice: settle space or save the oasis of Earth -- or indeed a future where we have two enormous challenges to juggle both at once. Instead, we are confronted by a future with a single challenge -- build sustainable human settlements in the cosmos, whether on Earth or in space. The science that generates the knowledge that underpins this, astrobiology, becomes a glue between these two communities and offers us the chance to become the space-faring guardians of an oasis in space. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Charles Cockell .","Astrobiology is the study of the origins and evolution of life on Earth and in space .

"(CNN) -- On a record attendance day at the Monte Carlo Masters tennis event, the king of clay held court. World No. 1 Rafael Nadal began his quest for a record-extending ninth triumph at the principality tournament with a 6-4 6-1 victory over Russia's Teymuraz Gabashvili. A capacity crowd of 14,600 fans packed into the Monte Carlo Country Club, where Nadal won eight successive titles between 2005 and 2012. His winning run was snapped 12 months ago by rival Novak Djokovic, who opened his campaign Tuesday with a defeat of Albert Montanes. Nadal came within a point of going a double break down in Wednesday's opening set, but he recovered to wrap up victory in resounding fashion. ""It was very important that point, 3-1, break point for him,"" Nadal told the ATP Tour's official website. ""I saved it with one good shot and one good volley. ""After that I felt that was the time to try to push a little bit more and increase the rhythm and the intensity. I played a good game to get the break back. I felt that I had the match a little bit more under control."" Next for Nadal is a third-round tie with Italy's Andreas Seppi, who emerged victorious from a marathon encounter with Spaniard Pablo Andujar that lasted two hours and 48 minutes. Also off to a winning start was Roger Federer, who took a wildcard to appear at the tournament for the first time since 2011. The 17-time grand slam champion effortlessly dispatched Radek Stepanek of the Czech Republic 6-1 6-2, and will next face Czech Lukas Rosol. ""I'm very happy now that I'm doing well,"" said fourth seed Federer, a three-time runner-up in Monte Carlo. ""But, of course, I also expect this from myself. So I'm just trying to keep up that rhythm. I feel free physically and in my mind. I'm eager to play, I'm eager to practice. ""I want to play good points. I'm no longer afraid that the rally will last too long. This was getting in the way of my game last year, whereas now I can really enjoy myself."" Federer has been usurped as Switzerland's top-ranked player by Stanislas Wawrinka, who won the first grand slam title of his career at January's Australian Open. The world No. 3 wasted no time in his match against Croatia's Marin Cilic, sealing a 6-0 6-2 triumph in just 46 minutes. ""I practiced perfectly before,"" said the 29-year-old, who next faces Spanish 15th seed Nicolas Almagro. ""I expected a more difficult or more complicated first round against him. ""But I was able, as I said, to practice well before. I felt good on the court. I know that physically if I feel good, then I am able to put a lot of pressure on the opponent. ""Now the clay court season is just starting and I'm always very pumped up for this particular moment of the year.

"(CNN) -- Cannes has been a hotbed of controversy since the beginning. The first festival, organized by the French in 1939 as a response to the Venice Film Festival -- then a vehicle for Nazi propaganda movies -- had to be canceled after it launched on the day WWII broke out. The festival returned in 1946 and has since been a fertile ground for taboo-breaking films, wannabes disrobing for a shot at fame, public spats between directors and critics and publicity stunts gone wrong. The latest rumpus surrounds ""Grace of Monaco,"" a biopic of Grace Kelly, the Oscar-winning American actress who subsequently became the princess of Monaco. The film has been criticized by the Monaco royal family who said it contains ""major historical untruths and a series of purely fictional scenes."" The festival would not comment on whether Prince Albert and his sisters, Caroline and StÃ©phanie would attend the gala premiere. Altercations, scandals and stunts are arguably as much the lifeblood of Cannes as the films and here, in no particular order, are some of the greatest. Robert Mitchum and the topless starlet . Publicity-hungry starlet Simone Silva took her top off during a photo shoot with Hollywood star Robert Mitchum and briefly made global headlines during an infamous incident at the 1954 festival. The British B-movie actress and glamor model turned up on the Croisette looking for exposure and was quickly crowned ""Miss Festival"" by organizers who set the photo shoot up for her on the beach. ""The photographers got down on their knees to plead with me to take the top off,"" she was quoted as saying in Ohio newspaper, The Daily Reporter. She did, removing her flimsy scarf top and cuddling up to Robert Mitchum, in just a grass skirt and covering her breasts with her hands. In the ensuing scrum three photographers fell into the Mediterranean, a fourth broke his ankle and another suffered a fractured elbow. Silva left the festival a few days later, after being asked to leave, but remained defiant: ""As long as sex is box office and I keep my figure, I'm out to be the sexiest thing on, oh, two legs."" Dead pigeon gag gone wrong . There are some things you just know are a bad idea, right? Apparently not if you are the upstart cast of a hot Brit-flick. In 2001, actors from ""24 Hour Party People,"" which tells the story of the Manchester music scene in the late '80s, attacked each other with dead pigeons on a private Cannes beach splattering diners at an exclusive restaurant with fake blood, feathers and worse. Security guards threatened the actors with mace and they were unceremoniously ejected from the beach along with the film crew and entourage of British journalists who had been watching gleefully. Actor Danny Cunningham, who played Shaun Ryder the wild lead singer of Manchester indie band Happy Mondays came up with the ill-judged publicity stunt. He said it was inspired by an alleged incident from Ryder's youth shown in the film where he poisoned 3,000 Manchester pigeons with crack cocaine. The actors brought stuffed pigeons as props for the stunt. Cunningham, who received a cut to the head in the scuffle, told the BBC: ""I think Shaun would have been proud of us. We came to Cannes to be wild and now we are going home."" See: Movies to watch out for at Cannes 2014 . New Wave on the beach . It was May 1968 and revolution was in the air. Students were marching in the streets and workers were participating in the biggest strike France has ever seen. It was, perhaps, inevitable that some of that fever would infiltrate the rarefied movie theaters of Cannes. Politics burst into the festival when a group of filmmakers led by New Wave directors Jean-Luc Godard and Francois Truffaut demanded it close in solidarity with the strikes. ""We're talking solidarity with students and workers and you are talking dolly shots and close-ups,"" Godard memorably shouted from behind a pair of Ray-Bans. ""You're assholes!"" Godard and Truffaut stopped the next screening by hanging off the curtain as it was being pulled back and the festival was canceled shortly after, five days before its scheduled end. No prizes were handed out. Over the next few years, counterculture also invaded the content of the festival with films like ""Easy Rider"" and ""M*A*S*H."" Vincent Gallo vs Roger Ebert . When cult film director and actor Vincent Gallo turned up to Cannes in 2003 with ""The Brown Bunny,"" an incoherent road movie with a graphic, unsimulated oral sex scene, the critics booed in boredom and disgust and Roger Ebert called it ""the worst film in the history of the festival."" A humiliated Gallo returned to the U.S. and began a new edit of the film but found the time to embark on a vicious war of words with Ebert, calling him ""a fat pig,"" who ""had the physique of a slave trader,"" topping it off by putting a hex on his colon and saying he hoped he got cancer. Ebert retorted, tartly: ""I had a colonoscopy once, and they let me watch it on TV. It was more entertaining than ""The Brown Bunny."" And added, in a twist on late UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill's immortal line: ""It is true that I am fat, but one day I will be thin, and he will still be the director of 'The Brown Bunny.'"" Amazingly, the spat ended in a truce. Gallo finished his re-edit and showed ""The Brown Bunny"" at Toronto where Ebert saw it again, this time awarding it three out of a possible four stars. Lars von Trier: 'Ok, I'm a Nazi' In 2011, famously eccentric Danish director Lars von Trier told onlookers at a press conference that he was a Nazi, that he understood Hitler and that his next film could be The Final Solution. ""I understand Hitler. I think he did some wrong things, yes absolutely, but I can see him sitting in his bunker in the end. I think I understand the man,"" said Von Trier while Kirsten Dunst and Charlotte Gainsbourg, stars of his sci-fi drama ""Melancholia,"" looked on in helpless disbelief. ""How do I get out of this? Ok, I'm a Nazi,"" he added shortly after in what could kindly be described as an ill-judged joke. Festival officials condemned his statements, which he retracted shortly after, but officials still took unusual step of banning him from the festival. Von Trier has been a one-man scandal factory since he started showing films at Cannes in the '80s. Incensed at being passed over for the top prize in 1991, he called Jury President Roman Polanski a ""midget,"" while Icelandic musician Bjork, who won Best Actress for her starring role in his 2000 film ""Dancer in the Dark"" said she would never act again. But perhaps his greatest scandal (apart from the Nazi joke) was in 2009 when there were reports that some audience members fainted from shock after watching a scene in his grotesque art-horror ""Antichrist"" in which Charlotte Gainsbourg mutilates her genitals. The ecumenical jury at Cannes called it ""misogynistic"" and awarded it a special anti-prize. 2014 Cannes Film Festival: The red carpet .","Since its inception, Cannes has attracted protests, spats and stunts .

"(CNN) -- Like many parents across the city of Liverpool, the McManamans waited. Twenty-five years ago, it was all they could do. There were no mobile phones to call, no text messages that could be sent to calm the frayed nerves of concerned families. Twitter wasn't on-hand to provide minute-to-minute updates; Facebook statuses couldn't be refreshed to comfort worried relatives. So they waited, hoping to see their son Steve appear at the bottom of the road. ""I was there, so I remember everything about the day,"" recalls the man who was that teenage boy. Now 42, Steve McManaman went on to play more than 250 games for Liverpool Football Club between 1990 and 1999. But back then, he was still making his way as a professional player. ""I traveled along with the Liverpool youth team, the apprentices and the reserves, to watch the game,"" he tells CNN. ""I was always OK because I was with the team and the players' wives, so we were in the main stand. Fortunately I was in the stand watching the incident unfold in front of me. It was a harrowing experience. ""It shouldn't happen when you get up in the morning and go to watch a football match."" It was April 15, 1989. Liverpool's senior team was contesting an FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest 75 miles away at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield. While McManaman was able to return home to his family, others never would. The death of 96 fans on that spring afternoon cast a shadow which still hangs over a sport, a football club and a city. The match kicked off at 15:00 local time but within minutes it had been abandoned, the football becoming irrelevant when framed against the human tragedy unfolding in the Leppings Lane stand. In those days huge banked terraces were commonplace in English football. Metal fences separated the thousands gathered in the stands from the pitch. The fatal crush in such a terrace at Hillsborough sent a jolt through England's Football Association, eventually leading to the introduction of all-seater stadia. ""That was the end of standing in stadiums,"" McManaman says. ""The stadiums are safe now, they're all modernized and better."" It is a tragedy that is not just felt in the red-jersey-wearing half of Liverpool. On that same day, Merseyside's other football club Everton also contested an FA Cup semifinal against Norwich City. The blue half of Liverpool celebrated a 1-0 win and a place in the final, but it wasn't long before that joy was tempered by the realization that their neighbors had just endured their darkest hour. Among the thousands of Evertonians who had ventured 100 miles south to the game at Villa Park, in the city of Birmingham, was a young Jamie Carragher. Carragher went on to become a part of Liverpool folklore, making over 500 appearances for the Reds and helping them to win the European Champions League in 2005 before retiring last year. But before he became a professional footballer, Carragher was an Everton supporter and, like many others, he was unaware of what had unfolded at Hillsborough. ""It was in the days before mobile phones, so it was very difficult to know what was going on, really,"" says Carragher, who spent his entire 16-year playing career with Liverpool. ""We heard reports, stories. It wasn't just a Liverpool tragedy, it was a Liverpool city tragedy. ""The Everton fans and Everton football club have both played a major part in it over the last 25 years and I think the whole city felt it."" And there are many still feeling it today. Relatives of those who died have fought a tireless campaign for justice. After a quarter of a century, the end may finally be in sight. A fresh inquest into the tragedy began last month after the initial verdict of ""accidental death"" verdict that had stood for over two decades was quashed in December 2012 by the High Court. A jury will decide on a range of issues relating to that fateful day, including whether police amended statements to deflect blame away from the force and onto Liverpool fans. The inquest could run until 2015. Later this month Liverpool will pay its respects. The club will stage a charity match on April 21, with a host of former players -- including Carragher and McManaman -- turning out to raise money for the Hillsborough Family Support Group. ""Now I'm not a player I'll still go, former players go back,"" Carragher says. ""We're there to pay our respects to the 96 and also to the families that are there."" Despite Liverpool's rich and proud history -- five European Cups and 18 English championships -- McManaman regrets that the team will always be intrinsically connected to British football's darkest day. ""It's sad really, but certain disasters do shape football teams,"" he says. ""It's just sad that you always refer back to disasters.""","The Hillsborough stadium disaster claimed lives of 96 football fans on April 15, 1989 .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama signed legislation on Wednesday aimed at restoring Americans' faith in the nation's public institutions at a time they rank at record lows in opinion polls. The act bans insider trading by members of Congress and many executive branch employees. In a ceremony at the White House, the president referred to the need to address public skepticism about an uneven system. ""The powerful shouldn't get to create one set of rules for themselves and another set of rules for everybody else,"" Obama said. ""If we expect that to apply to our biggest corporations and to our most successful citizens, it certainly applies to our elected officials, especially at a time when there is a deficit of trust between this city and the rest of the country."" The STOCK Act -- the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act -- is a rare bipartisan measure coming out of a deeply divided Congress. It makes it clear that members of Congress, their aides and many members of the executive branch cannot use inside information they learn on the job to trade stocks or other securities. The law makes such practices criminal and requires public disclosure of any trades within 45 days. It also requires those reports to be made available online in a database that members of the public can search. The new law also limits members of Congress and executive employees to participating only in those initial public stock offerings that are available to the general public. But many public interest groups call the final version weak, because it omitted a provision in the Senate version that would have regulated ""political intelligence,"" the practice of gathering information from lawmakers and Hill aides that could be used to make investment decisions. Obama pledged to work on additional reforms that would ""limit the corrosive influence of money in politics."" He suggested that elected officials should not own stock in industries they can affect in their positions, and those who bundle campaign contributions should be banned from lobbying Congress. Although New York Democratic Rep. Louise Slaughter introduced the legislation six years ago, it didn't have many supporters or much traction on Capitol Hill until a story that aired on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" in November. The report raised questions about whether the access several high-profile members of Congress had to inside information on legislation helped them profit from financial transactions involving companies that were affected. After the report, both House and Senate leaders, mindful of the low public regard for Congress, fast-tracked the measure. Originally, the bill's restrictions applied just to members of Congress and their staffs, but Republicans expanded it to cover many executive agency employees. Despite the overwhelming vote in favor of the bill in both the House and the Senate, none of the top GOP Hill leaders attended the White House bill signing ceremony on Wednesday. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who worked on the final version that was enacted, was invited but had events already scheduled in his Richmond, Virginia, district. Massachusetts Republican Sen. Scott Brown, facing a tough re-election race this fall, was the lone Senate Republican to stand on the stage with Obama as he wielded several pens to enact the new law. Republican Reps. Sean Duffy of Wisconsin, Bob Dold of Illinois and Mike Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania -- all representing districts Democrats are targeting in November -- also attended. The president praised Slaughter for championing the bill, but noted she couldn't witness the signing in person because she had broken her leg. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, whose financial transactions were examined in the ""60 Minutes"" story, did not attend. Her office said she had commitments in New York on Wednesday morning and did not return to Washington in time. Another subject of the CBS investigation was Alabama GOP Rep. Spencer Bachus, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. His office put out a release saying he will attend a bill signing on Thursday on jobs legislation, but he was not among the Republicans who attended the STOCK Act signing. Cantor said the bill was evidence that a divided Congress could work together on other issues. ""Rather than letting our differences divide us, as so often happens in Washington, this bipartisan bill shows that we can come together and deliver results for the American people,"" Cantor said in a written statement. The Sunlight Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that pushes for greater transparency in government, said that while the final measure omitted some stronger provisions it believed would crack down on insider trading, it was an important step forward. But the group's policy director, John Wonderlich, maintained there were plenty of other abuses involving improper behavior by officeholders that had yet to be exposed. ""The STOCK Act was just one vehicle for ethics and transparency reform in Congress, and a response to a particularly objectionable idea -- representatives seeking to make a private profit through their public service. There are 20 more exposÃ©s like the CBS story just waiting to happen,"" Wonderlich wrote Wednesday. The spotlight on Congress' recent string of bipartisan action continues Thursday, when Obama is scheduled to sign a bill making it easier for small businesses to gain access to capital and make public offerings.

"(CNN) -- A woman was found guilty of murder Tuesday for repeatedly stabbing a Texas college professor with the heel of her stiletto. Ana Trujillo showed little emotion as the verdict was announced. She now faces up to life in prison for the June 2013 death of her boyfriend, Alf Stefan Andersson, CNN affiliate KPRC reported. The affiliate said Trujillo stabbed Andersson more than 25 times. The defense argued that prosecutors had failed to show motive and that Trujillo was a victim of domestic violence, KPRC said. Prosecutors reportedly told jurors that she made up the story that she had acted in self defense. According to CNN affiliate KTRK, when police arrived at Andersson's apartment, Trujillo, who had recently worked as a massage therapist, answered the door with blood on her clothes and hands; Andersson was lying in the hallway face up, with a stiletto by his head, KTRK reported, citing court records. Trujillo had recently moved in with Andersson, and she told investigators that he grabbed her, and a struggle followed, said KTRK. Andersson was a full-time research professor at the University of Houston's Center for Nuclear Receptor and Cell Signaling. In a statement last year, the school said it was ""saddened to learn of the tragic death of Professor Stefan Andersson. Our hearts go out to his colleagues, family and friends during this difficult time.""

"Mugello (CNN) -- Their relationship may have become fraught during the 2013 Formula One season, so just how does Ferrari chairman Luca di Montezemolo rate the efforts of his star driver Fernando Alonso? ""A good eight out of 10,"" Di Montezemolo told CNN as he reflected on a season where Ferrari has played second fiddle to the all-conquering Red Bull team. The Ferrari chairman resorted to ""tweaking"" his Spanish driver's ear earlier this season after the double world champion appeared to criticize the team's F138 car at July's Hungarian Grand Prix. But any tension between the two seems to have eased, with Di Montezemolo awarding Alonso the eight mark for his performance this year and comparing him to some of Ferrari's greatest ever drivers. ""I think he's really a very, very good driver,"" Di Montezemolo told CNN ahead of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. ""I've been with drivers like Niki Lauda, Alain Prost and Michael Schumacher -- fantastic -- but Alonso in the races is really fantastic. ""Alonso has been also very good in the races to understand when was necessary to push and when it was necessary to calm down to save the tires."" Managing the tires proved difficult for most of the drivers on the grid in 2013, with the exception being newly-crowned quadruple world champion Sebastian Vettel. With the Red Bull maestro taking the checkered flag at each of the last eight grands prix -- a record-breaking run -- Alonso has been left 145 points adrift of the German driver and in second place with one race left in the season. Alonso's cause has not been helped by a series of events which led to the sport's official tire supplier Pirelli ditching their 2013 rubber and reverting to the set it produced for the 2012 season. However, Di Montezemolo refused to blame the tires for a run which has seen Ferrari fail to win a race since May's Spanish Grand Prix -- ""I never like to use the word 'excuse'"" -- preferring to focus on the success the team enjoyed in the opening rounds of the championship. ""The first half of the season we won two races, so Ferrari was far more competitive,"" explained the 66-year-old. ""This is a fact ... when the tires were changed we paid a big price. ""I don't like the formula in which a driver has to be careful not to destroy the tires."" While happy with the performance of Alonso, who will be partnered by Kimi Raikkonen in 2014 when the Finn returns to the team with which he won the drivers' title in 2007, Di Montezemolo was unable to contain his disappointment with the progress the team has made off the track. ""Why I am not happy this year is that we haven't been able to develop the car after a very good start of the season,"" he said. ""So that was our problem."" The 2014 season will see a raft of rule changes, most significantly the mandatory use of a 1.6 liter turbocharged V6 engine which incorporates energy recovery systems. KERS, which stores up energy created while braking to provide cars with extra power, is an energy recovery system which is already used in the sport. ""I am very happy to change rules, because I don't like formulas which aerodynamic means 90% of the performance,"" said Di Montezemolo, who hopes Ferrari can capitalize on its wealth of automotive design expertise. ""We are not building aeroplanes or satellites, we're building cars. ""Engine, gearbox, suspensions: these are also crucial, particularly for us, because - as we said - our experience in F1 means to transfer technology to our cars.""","Luca di Montezemolo gives Fernando Alonso ""eight out of 10"" for 2013 season .

"(CNN) -- At least six people were killed and more than a dozen others injured when explosions hit a campaign rally for one of Afghanistan's two presidential runoff candidates at a hotel in Kabul on Friday, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. The convoy of candidate Abdullah Abdullah was attacked in Kabul, spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told CNN. Abdullah and his running mates were not hurt, but the candidate's car was severely damaged, Sediqqi said. There were two explosions, Sediqqi said: One was a suicide attack and the other a possible roadside bomb. Video from the scene showed hotel windows blown out and police securing the area. Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani are campaigning for Afghanistan's June 14 runoff election to succeed Hamid Karzai. Abdullah, a former foreign minister, garnered 45% of the vote in the first round, and Ghani, a former finance minister, earned 31%.","Two explosions strike a campaign rally for a presidential candidate .

"(CNN) -- ""It's a woman's world,"" Vogue contributing editor Andre Leon Talley said as he prepared an installation of little black dresses for a new exhibit at the Savannah College of Art and Design. Men don't commonly wear little black dresses, which is why Talley asked some of his favorite female designers -- plus Marc Jacobs, himself known for slipping into a tiny black number -- to help define this iconic piece of clothing in the exhibit's accompanying catalog. Read more: A day in life of a New York Fashion Week model . ""I thought only a woman could define a little black dress,"" he said. But as a SCAD trustee and now curator of a museum exhibit consisting entirely of black dresses, Talley is inarguably an expert on the matter, too. The 81 dresses in his collection represent the glamorous and the practical, the revealing and the forgiving. The exhibit opened September 28 and will remain on display through January 27. Little black dresses, as designer Norma Kamali puts it in the exhibit's catalog, ""take us to parties, job interviews, weddings and funerals. We experience all of life's big events in the little black dress. It can be respectful or empowering, depending upon the design."" Read more: How to dress for any occasion . For Talley, the dresses represent the evolution of design, the achievement of world-class artists, glamour, even bravery. But perhaps just as striking as the elegance of these dresses is the fondness and pride with which Talley views them. Many of his friends either wore or designed the pieces in his exhibit, and in some cases, as with Stella McCartney and L'Wren Scott, it's both. Talley believes that the woman wearing a little black dress can give it special meaning. ""Wearing clothes should be a personal narrative of emotion. I always respond to fashion in an emotional way,"" Talley said. ""I was sitting in Manolo Blahnik's store at Fashion's Night Out last year,"" he said, ""and Sarah Jessica Parker was the first celebrity to breeze into the store."" What stood out to Talley even more than his friend's fluid leather Prabal Gurung skirt or the embellished bodice was the fact that Parker wore white pony-skin stilettos with the ensemble. Read more: 10 key pieces every woman must own . ""She had broken the rules that have been going on in fashion for decades,"" Talley recalled. ""The late Estee Lauder says you can never wear white shoes after Labor Day. But of course, in today's world, that does not exist. And there was Sarah Jessica Parker with white shoes, with a black dress, after Labor Day. And I just said, you know, this is the example of how fashion goes forward."" Designer Scott's black strapless wool cocktail-length dress, with a kick pleat in the back of Chantilly lace, which she wore with black gloves, surprised Talley as well. ""I was at the Golden Globes the year she wore this dress, and she came up the carpet with Mick Jagger, and I thought, 'mmm, this is a Chanel Haute Couture dress.' And I was talking to L'Wren Scott about another dress in the exhibit, and I said, 'Oh, do you remember you wore that fabulous Chanel dress to the Golden Globes? And I thought it was so elegant; I'm sure you picked out the dress for Nicole Kidman and you decided to wear it yourself!' That was not the case. She had designed the dress the night before,"" he said. Read more: Decoding the workplace dress code . Inventiveness and flair make a statement, Talley said, but so does wearability -- something he finds in the designs of McCartney, whose dresses feature prominently in the exhibit. ""Stella McCartney, not only is she a designer, she is a mother of four, and she lives for practicality. She understands what a woman needs to wear to work and what a woman needs to wear when it's time to go out and put on the Ritz!"" Not least, a little black dress allows the wearer to accentuate her physical gifts, Talley said, like supermodel Linda Evangelista in a satin Prada dress. ""The thermometer of Linda Evangelista, in a satin peplum dress, looking every bit as aristocrat as a royal European duchess or princess, is amazing to me,"" he said. ""You know, it just doesn't get any better than that. You see the way the person is wearing the dress, and you see the inherited quality of the design of the dress."" Read more: Look fashionable for less . Rei Kawakubo, of Comme des Garcons, achieved that coup, Talley said, when designer Jacobs wore her black lace shirt dress with nothing but white boxer shorts underneath. The daring look opened the doors to the possibilities of men's fashion. ""I think, in today's America, there is a great leverage and a great sense of liberation"" in men's fashion, Talley said. ""And I chose this dress with great care. I was there when Marc wore it; it was a very shock value moment,"" but it was also a statement of elegance and confidence by a provocative designer. ""There is room in today's world for men to wear dresses,"" Talley said. ""I've seen students on this campus going to classes wearing the most extraordinary kilts I've ever seen."" Talley learned the students were wearing kilts that construction workers wear to hold their tools. ""But it's really a skirt!"" he said. Talley believes that if men are willing to put on utility kilts, sooner or later they'll be putting on black lace dresses, like his friend Jacobs. He said so in all seriousness. ""This was not a frivolous moment here. This was not a moment of slap-dash. This was a moment where he knew what he was doing, was going to send signals around the world that you can, in fact, if you want to, wear a lace dress. If you want to go to the gym and spend hours buffing your body, if you want to be glamorized to the hilt with a lace dress and go to a show party dressed like this, it's fine,"" Talley said.

"(CNN) -- The Pennsylvania minister who was defrocked for officiating his son's same-sex wedding was reinstated Tuesday by the United Methodist Church. Frank Schaefer, pastor at Zion United Methodist Church of Iona in Lebanon, had his credentials restored and is now entitled to lost salary and benefits since his defrocking in December, according to a written decision released by the church. Schaefer was waiting for a phone call to inform him of the church's verdict, when he received the happy news as an e-mail attachment. He opened up the PDF. ""I had to scroll all the way to the bottom to find out what the verdict was, and the verdict was that I am reinstated as an ordained minister of the United Methodist Church,"" he told a group of people. They broke into applause. His suspension . Schaefer was suspended for 30 days following his initial trial, with the condition that after his suspension he was to deliver a written report assuring the judiciary board that going forward he would never officiate another same-sex wedding. When Schaefer refused to do so, he was defrocked. Schaefer told CNN then that he could not commit to a statement like that because he has two more children who are gay. His appeal was heard Friday by a nine-member committee, which upheld the original 30-day suspension that Schaefer had already served. Bishop Peggy Johnson, leader of the church's Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, said in a statement that she will abide by the committee's decision and will return Schaefer to active service as an ordained clergy member. The appellate committee unanimously determined that Schaefer's defrocking was ""unlawful"" because a clergyman can only be punished for what he has been convicted of doing in the past, not for what he may or may not do in the future, the decision read. ""I can't even begin to describe how meaningful this 'refrocking' is to me,"" Schaefer said in a statement immediately following the appeal decision. ""I never did understand the severity of my punishment for an act of love for my son, Tim,"" Schaefer said. The United Methodist Church says it welcomes members regardless of sexual orientation, but same-sex marriages cannot be performed in Methodist churches or by ordained ministers under church policy. How it started . The initial complaint was filed by one of Schaefer's church members who read about his son's wedding in a newspaper, and the church leadership decided to act upon it, Schaefer said. Schaefer was found guilty by a jury of 13 clergy members and suspended for 30 days in November 2013. After his suspension Schaefer told the Board of Ordained Ministry that he could not uphold the church's Book of Discipline in its entirety because it discriminates against gay people. Schaefer was asked to immediately surrender his credentials, but he refused, forcing church officials to defrock him, the statement said. Schaefer previously told CNN's Zoraida Sambolin that his son asked him to officiate his wedding in 2007 and he decided to do it ""out of love for him."" Although he once believed that homosexuality was incompatible with his Christian beliefs, Schaefer said his views on the controversial topic evolved. ""By the time our son came out, I was ready to embrace him,"" Schaefer told Sambolin. A precedent case . In March, the United Methodist Church dropped its case against a New York clergyman, Thomas Ogletree, who had also officiated his son's same-sex wedding. Ogletree was instead ordered to join others from varying perspectives in a public forum that ""shall reflect a variety of different opinions and understandings."" Upon hearing of that decision, Schaefer told CNN in March, ""It doesn't seem fair, two United Methodist minsters are charged with the same exact 'crime' of officiating at their son's same-sex weddings -- one is defrocked, the other one's case is dropped without conditions."" Jimmy Creech, the first United Methodist minister to be defrocked over performing a same-sex marriage ceremony in 1999, acted as an adviser to Schaefer during the trial. ""The decision is a win for Frank Schaefer, for the United Methodist Church, and for the movement toward justice and equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender United Methodists,"" Creech said in a statement. Schaefer said that he is now considering an offer to serve in the ministry of the California-Pacific Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church. ""Today's decision shows that the church is moving toward love over legalism,"" Schaefer said in his statement Tuesday. ""Their movement of love embraced me and together we are moving forward to bring about that day when our denomination no longer excludes any of God's beloved children. And I will continue to work toward that goal,"" he said.","Rev. Frank Schaefer is reinstated following his appeal trial .

"(CNN) -- She's won a new trial. And now, Marissa Alexander may learn Wednesday whether she can get out of prison while she waits for that trial. In a Jacksonville, Florida, court, a judge is expected to decide if Alexander will be released on bond in a case that has drawn national attention. In September an appellate court ordered a new trial for Alexander, who was sentenced to 20 years in prison for firing a gun to scare off her allegedly abusive husband. The case will be retried because the jury had incorrect directions, the court ruled. Alexander's case gained the attention of civil rights leaders, who say nobody was hurt and the sentence for the mother of three was too harsh. The case shined the spotlight on Florida's Stand Your Ground law after she unsuccessfully argued before her 2012 trial that she was immune to prosecution because of the law. But now, Alexander says she's just hoping she can see her children as she waits for her complicated case to be resolved. Alexander ""has not had regular access to her 3-and-a-half year old daughter"" since she was 6 months old, her lawyer said in court documents urging a judge for a pre-trial release. But a lawyer for Alexander's estranged husband, Rico Gray, says he has concerns. ""She had bond once on this case and she went over to my client's house and she gave him a black eye, and got arrested, though she was told to stay away from my client, so I don't think he necessarily wants her to have a bond again,"" said Richard Kuritz, Gray's attorney. A police report from that time shows that Alexander was arrested for a domestic violence offense connected to an altercation with Gray. According to police reports, Alexander had no injuries, but Gray had a bloody swollen eye and told police Alexander had punched him. Alexander's attorney says things are different now. Her client is finalizing a divorce with Gray and they will have no contact with each other. The hearing is set for 4 p.m. ET Wednesday. In the old case, Alexander claimed self-defense, saying she was attempting to flee her husband on August 1, 2010, when she picked up a handgun and fired a shot into a wall. She said her husband had read cell phone text messages that she had written to her ex-husband, got angry and tried to strangle her. State Attorney Angela Corey had said the case deserved to be prosecuted because Alexander fired in the direction of a room where children were standing. Corey had said she offered Alexander a plea bargain that would have resulted in a three-year prison sentence, but Alexander chose to take the case to a jury trial, where a conviction would carry a mandatory sentence under a Florida law known as ""10-20-life."" The law mandates increased penalties for some felonies, including aggravated assault, in which a gun is carried or used.

"(CNN) -- A Tijuana, Mexico, police officer will appear in a U.S. federal court next week after being arrested on a charge of possession with intent to distribute almost 20 pounds of heroin and methamphetamine. Noe Raygoza-Garcia, 33, was indicted Thursday and was scheduled to appear in court Wednesday, but because of ""documentary snafu"" was never transported from a prison in San Bernandino, California, said Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Carlo DiCesare. Raygoza-Garcia's arraignment was rescheduled to April 9. According to an affidavit from U.S. Border Patrol agent Kevin Legg, authorities were conducting anti-smuggling operations on March 17 in Fallbrook, California. They were monitoring Interstate 15, a popular smuggling route, about 70 miles north of the Mexican border when Raygoza-Garcia passed in a red Dodge Neon. ""As the vehicle approached, the agents immediately noticed that the vehicle reduced its speed drastically,"" forcing cars behind it to go around, the affidavit said. The Border Patrol agents pulled alongside the car and noticed a single key in the ignition, which can be a sign that a car contains contraband, the affidavit said. The agents dropped about 10 car lengths behind the Neon, according to the affidavit, and noticed the driver cross over the dividing line. ""The agents believed that (Raygoza-Garcia) was fixated on the position of the marked service vehicle behind (him) instead of focusing on the road ahead of him,"" the affidavit said. The agents pulled closer to the Neon and noticed the driver was driving 45 to 50 mph, ""well below the posted speed limit,"" and Raygoza-Garcia ""appeared to be gripping the steering wheel very tightly"" when he passed a Riverside County police vehicle. Using their laptop to check the vehicle, authorities learned it had crossed into the United States that morning. At the border, records showed, the driver was Eduardo Guadalupe Sanchez-Hernandez, who did not look like Raygoza-Garcia, the affidavit said. They pulled over the vehicle, and when Raygoza-Garcia exited the vehicle, he ""nearly fell to the ground and was shaking excessively,"" according to the affidavit. He told the agents he had a valid visa and was nervous about being pulled over, the affidavit said. Raygoza-Garcia further told agents that he was going to San Bernandino to visit his dying uncle, but when asked the location, he said he didn't know, according to the affidavit. He also told agents that he had driven the car over the border himself and that the vehicle belonged to his friend, whom he knew only as ""Eduardo,"" the affidavit said. When agents told Raygoza-Garcia that records showed he had crossed the border as a pedestrian, he ""started pacing and they noticed a change in the tone of his voice,"" the affidavit said. He then recanted his story and said he borrowed his friend's car after crossing the border. He said he didn't know why he hadn't crossed with his friend, the affidavit said. Asked if there was anything illegal in the car, Raygoza-Garcia said he didn't know and gave the agents permission to search it using a dog, the affidavit said. The dog indicated there were drugs in the car. In the glove compartment, agents found a socket with a star-shaped pattern matching bolts in the rear seat area. They removed the backrest, where they found ""bundles of narcotics,"" six square packages and five ""misshapen, non-compressed packages,"" according to the affidavit. The square ones tested positive for heroin and the misshapen ones tested positive for methamphetamine, the agents said in an affidavit.

"Washington (CNN) -- A key whistle-blower in the intensifying scandal over wait times at veterans hospitals took issue on Sunday with an initial internal review that downplayed the number of people who may have died while waiting for care. The comments came as the embattled Veterans Affairs secretary received tepid support from some critics of the department's handling of a chronic problem across many of the VA's care facilities. VA Secretary Eric Shinseki has been at the center of political debate over accountability since CNN began reporting on delays in medical appointments suffered by veterans across the country, including some who died or were seriously injured. The VA requires its hospitals to provide care to patients in a timely manner, typically within 14 to 30 days. CNN first reported as many as 40 veterans died waiting for appointments at the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care system, according to sources inside the hospital and a doctor who worked there. Many of those veterans were placed on a secret waiting list, the sources said. The department's acting inspector general told a House panel Thursday, ""The number 40 that's been widely quoted in the press does not represent the total numbers of veterans that we're looking at."" ""The initial list that we were given, we have gone through and there are only 17 names on that list,"" said Richard Griffin. ""Our review to date -- and we have more work to do on this because we want to have more than one set of eyes look at all of the records -- but on those 17, we didn't conclude, so far, that the delay caused the death. It's one thing to be on a waiting list, and it's another thing to conclude that as a result of being on the waiting list, that's the cause of death."" It's unclear if any of those 17 names were among the deaths reported by CNN, and Griffin acknowledged that ""multiple lists"" exist. ""But there are also other people who have come through the Congress, who have come through the media, who have come through our hot line, so we have multiple lists, none of them identical,"" Griffin testified Thursday. Dr. Samuel Foote, who made his allegations first to CNN, disputed Griffin's testimony about the department's initial conclusions. ""The original allegation was 40 people died while waiting for care. And they were advertising waiting times of 30 to 55 days when in fact they were more like six to seven months. And we had no way of reviewing these charts,"" said Foote on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""So, we never said they died because of this. We just made the point that at least 40 veterans we felt had died while waiting."" Foote has said the larger problem was the VA lied about it and fudged the numbers. ""They've been cheating about this,"" he said. ""The cheating has gone on for a long time."" The VA has previously admitted that 23 veterans passed away because of delays, and 53 others had adverse health effects at VA facilities across the country. Sources now tell CNN the Office of Inspector General is investigating in six states, including Arizona. Shinseki also testified before a House committee and said he had no intention of stepping down, but a top department official did so a day later. Dr. Robert Petzel, undersecretary for health in the Department of Veterans Affairs, had appeared before the congressional panel alongside the secretary. Foote, among others, applauded that move. But as far as Shinseki's status, Foote said the secretary for now should stay. ""If we switch secretaries then the focus will get away from fixing the problem to who's the new secretary going to be,"" he said. ""And then he'll have three- or six-month or a nine-month grace period because he's the new guy. Our best bet at this point is to keep the (current) secretary on board, but I think the President needs to keep him on a pretty short leash and be sure that he's doing the job."" That was echoed by a leading veterans group. ""We demand swift accountability,"" said Ryan Gallucci, a deputy director at the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""The families who have been affected by these allegations need justice and need it quickly."" Other leading groups have taken a harder stance, reiterating calls for a sweeping change at the top of the department's leadership. ""We called for the secretary and two undersecretaries to step down,"" said Dan Dellinger, national commander of the American Legion, on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" He noted Petzel was already scheduled to retire this year, and a replacement had earlier been nominated. ""This seems to us to be business as usual. We haven't seen that proactive versus reactive culture of change we'd like to see."" Foote told CNN earlier that the Phoenix VA had been keeping secret lists of delayed appointments, while providing top officials with sham figures. ""They wouldn't take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than 14 days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times,"" Foote, who worked at the facility for 24 years, said last month in an exclusive interview. ""So then when they did that, they would report to Washington, 'Oh, yeah. We're making our appointments within 10 days, within the 14-day frame,' when in reality it had been six, nine, in some cases 21 months."" The White House has tried to manage the crisis, repeating in recent days the President's earlier order that Shinseki conduct a review of the Veterans Health Administration's practices at its facilities. ""The President is madder than hell, and I've got the scars to prove it, given the briefings I've given the President, the conversations that we have had on these matters,"" said White House chief of staff Denis McDonough on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" ""At the same time that we're looking at accountability we want to continue to perform to provide our veterans the services that they have earned."" But the American Legion says Obama himself has been missing in action. ""We need the White House, the President to come forward. He needs to make a statement to show the employees of VA that this needs to change now,"" said Dellinger. ""One death is tragic, but when you hide it, that's unforgivable."" Shinseki told lawmakers last week the incidents were ""isolated,"" but CNN sources relate another story -- that the VA inspector general's office has been investigating allegations in at least half a dozen states. Sources have told CNN investigative correspondent Drew Griffin that other whistle-blowers have come forward from across the country, saying their offices manipulate wait times as well. The VA has admitted 23 people in nine states have died because of delayed care -- many of them veterans who were forced to wait too long for simple tests like colonoscopies or endoscopies.

"(CNN) -- A hot air balloon burst into flames and crashed Friday night in Virginia after apparently hitting a power line, prompting a search for the wreckage and the three people believed to have been on board, authorities said. The incident happened over Doswell, 25 miles north of Richmond, around 7:30 p.m., Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said. Preliminary information indicates the balloon apparently struck a power line and then caught fire, according to Bergen. Witnesses reported the balloon ablaze and crashing somewhere northeast of Meadow Event Park, according to Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller. Images from the scene show one balloon well above the ground, with its basket in flames. About two hours later, authorities still didn't know exactly where the balloon ended up. Nor did they know the condition of the one pilot and two passengers thought to be on board, according to Geller. ""We've been actively searching,"" the state police spokeswoman said. ""At this point, we have found no wreckage."" There was no rain at the time, Geller said, though severe storms rolling through could complicate the search. The incident came one day before the scheduled start of the inaugural Mid-Atlantic Balloon Festival, which is set to run through the weekend. On its website, the event's organizers invite people to ""get up close and personal with 20 hot air balloon teams from across the country."" The event has been canceled in light of Friday's incident, according to a post on the festival's Facebook page.

"Caracas, Venezuela (CNN) -- It's been more than 180 years since Venezuelans saw Simon Bolivar's face. But the revolutionary leader's thick sideburns, bushy eyebrows and steely gaze popped out from behind picture frames Tuesday in new 3-D images unveiled by President Hugo Chavez. Researchers used several software programs to reconstruct the face of the man who liberated Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Venezuela from the Spanish crown. Scans of Bolivar's skeletal remains, which investigators exhumed two years ago, factored into their calculations. So did historical paintings, photos of restored uniforms Bolivar wore and images of middle-aged Venezuelans, officials said. ""Bolivar is and will be one of the greatest giants of humanity, of the cause and the human struggle, one of the best of the human species,"" Chavez said as he unveiled the portraits, according to state-run VTV. While computer modeling software played a key role in the reconstruction, Barcelona's VisualForensic laboratory also manually added in details -- like estimations of the former leader's skin color, tissue thickness and bone density, according to a Venezuelan government statement. An investigation into what caused Bolivar's death continues, the Venezuelan government said. Most historical accounts say tuberculosis killed Simon Bolivar, who died in 1830 at the age of 47. But Chavez, who often mentions Bolivar in speeches and describes him as a personal hero, ordered investigators to exhume the body of the former military leader and determine whether he was murdered. A report released this month said the investigation had been inconclusive. The new portraits come two years after state television showed Bolivar's skeletal remains in a dramatic ceremony. With the national anthem playing in the background, a group of scientists wearing white coats rolled up a black cloth, revealing a skeleton on the table below. The broadcast then faded to black, showing Chavez singing along to the national anthem. ""Bolivar is alive. Let us not see him as a dead man and let us not see him as a skeleton. He is like lightning, like a sacred fire,"" Chavez said after the exhumation in 2010. Tuesday was the 229th anniversary of Bolivar's birth. Chavez has credited Bolivar with inspiring him as ""the father of the revolution."" In 1819, Bolivar founded Gran Colombia, a federation of what is now Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador. He is credited with spreading democratic principles in Latin America. A new $116 million mausoleum to house Bolivar's remains is under construction in Caracas, Venezuela's government said in a statement Tuesday.

"(CNN) -- Venture capitalist Tom Perkins is back in the news with a big (and ridiculous) idea: If you pay a million dollars in taxes, you should get a million votes. While some media outlets have since pointed out that Perkins was perhaps courting controversy, his system of wealthier Americans having more say at the ballot box follows an equally bizarre argument this week from Bud Konheim, CEO of luxury retailer Nicole Miller. Konheim took a different tack on the inequality debate, asserting instead that all Americans are wealthy. According to Konheim, ""We've got a country that the poverty level is wealth in 99% of the rest of the world. So we're talking about woe is me, woe is us, woe is this. ... The guy that's making, oh my God, $35,000 a year. ... Why don't we try that out in India or some country we can't even name ... China, anyplace -- that guy is wealthy."" For now, it's safe enough to assume that Perkins' dollar-a-vote initiative is unlikely to take off. But Konheim's argument actually falls into a growing category -- members of the wealthiest income group in the country trying to convince average Americans that they, too, are all very wealthy. Last summer, a commercial funded by the conservative Charles Koch Foundation tried to persuade people that the middle class in America is actually rich by pointing out that someone making over $34,000 -- a decidedly middle-class income -- was part of ""the wealthiest 1% in the world."" Seriously? Let's look more closely at this idea that the poor -- or even the middle class -- in America are actually wealthy. Konheim's argument probably does not hold much weight among millions of Americans who skipped filling a prescription in 2012 because of the costs, according to Commonwealth Fund's Biennial Health Insurance Survey. Nor does it likely ring true for many in the middle class who are trying to buy a home at a time when home prices have doubled since 1970. And let's not forget the cost of a public four-year college education, which has risen by an eye-watering 250% over the past 30 years. The federal poverty level in the United States for a family of four is $23,550, significantly less than estimated living expenses. More than 3 million Americans earn the minimum wage or lower, and today's minimum wage has 30% less buying power in real terms than the minimum wage in 1968. Or put another way, someone on minimum wage would have to work for more than 130 hours to buy the $950 dress that Konheim's company is selling right now at Saks Fifth Avenue. To be sure, Americans do not need to buy luxury dresses. But they do need to buy food. And according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, more than 14% of Americans were food insecure at some point in 2012. In other words, in the wealthiest country on Earth, millions of Americans could not be sure where their next meal was coming from. And poverty is much more prevalent than you might think -- more than half of Americans between the ages of 25 and 64 will spend a year of their lives in or near poverty. As worrisome as these statistics are on U.S. poverty levels, there is also alarming data about the state of the middle class. Median incomes in America are actually lower now than they were in 2000, and household debt levels have skyrocketed. If we look at millennials -- the youngest part of our workforce -- there were 10 million of them who were unemployed or underemployed last summer, more than the entire population of New York City. Comparisons Konheim would have us make with developing countries miss the point. The United States is not a developing country, and it does not serve us well to try to ignore the real difficulties of many Americans. So the question is not whether a full-time retail worker earning $14,000 in Texas is better off than a full-time retail worker in India, or even whether a household with $34,000 in Philadelphia is doing better than many families in China. The question is whether the economic conditions we have now are serving us -- all of us -- well. And the answer to that is: not really. Or, more positively: We can certainly do better. Economic growth in the United States is lagging behind our historical average, and unemployment five years from the Great Recession is still too high. And the American Dream, the notion that if you work hard and play by the rules you can get ahead, is taking a serious knock when economic mobility -- the ability to move from the wealth you were born to another level -- is lower in the United States than in countries like Canada and Germany. Doing better for all Americans is not about creating divisions between income levels. And it's certainly not about trying to convince workers who are struggling to pay their rent that they are actually rich. Simply put, doing better for all Americans -- the wealthiest included -- and growing our economy in a sustainable way requires a growing and vibrant middle class that is contributing to an innovative and entrepreneurial workforce, while providing a stable source of economic demand. In short, we need Americans to be both productive workers and reliable consumers. Acknowledging the very real struggles many of our fellow Americans face is not just a moral imperative, it is also an economic one. And we can't have a constructive conversation about how we improve the country's economy if we ignore the difficult realities facing many Americans today. Konheim and Perkins can disparage their fellow citizens all they want, but the truth is that the American economy will do better when more Americans are doing better. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jennifer Erickson.","Jennifer Erickson: The rich like Tom Perkins and Bud Konheim live in a bubble .

"(CNN) -- America is a less Christian nation than it was 20 years ago, and Christianity is not losing out to other religions, but primarily to a rejection of religion altogether, a survey published Monday found. Survey finds percentage of of Americans identifying themselves as Christian has fallen over two decades. Seventy-five percent of Americans call themselves Christian, according to the American Religious Identification Survey from Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1990, the figure was 86 percent. William Donohue, president of the Catholic League said he thinks a radical shift towards individualism over the last quarter-century has a lot to do it. ""The three most dreaded words are thou shalt not,"" he told Lou Dobbs. ""Notice they are not atheists -- they are saying I don't want to be told what to do with my life."" At the same time there has been an increase in the number of people expressing no religious affiliation. The survey also found that ""born-again"" or ""evangelical"" Christianity is on the rise, while the percentage who belong to ""mainline"" congregations such as the Episcopal or Lutheran churches has fallen. One in three Americans consider themselves evangelical, and the number of people associated with mega-churches has skyrocketed from less than 200,000 in 1990 to more than 8 million in the latest survey.  Watch CNN report on new study » . The rise in evangelical Christianity is contributing to the rejection of religion altogether by some Americans, said Mark Silk of Trinity College. ""In the 1990s, it really sunk in on the American public generally that there was a long-lasting 'religious right' connected to a political party, and that turned a lot of people the other way,"" he said of the link between the Republican Party and groups such as the Moral Majority and Focus on the Family.  Watch author on mixing religion and politics » . ""In an earlier time, people who would have been content to say, 'Well, I'm some kind of a Protestant,' now say 'Hell no, I won't go,'"" he told CNN. Silk also said the revelation that some Catholic priests had sexually abused children -- and senior figures in the church hierarchy had helped to hide it -- drove some Catholics away from religion. And, he said, it is now more socially acceptable than it once was to admit having no religion. ""You're not declaring yourself a total pariah. The culture has changed in a way that makes it easier to say, 'No, I don't have a religion. Even in the past year, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama feel obliged to talk about 'those of no faith,' "" he pointed out. Obama mentioned people without faith in his inaugural address in January, making him the first president to do so. In the survey, one in five Americans said they have no religious identity or did not answer the question, and more than one in four said they do not expect to have a religious funeral. The rise in what the survey authors call ""nones"" is the only trend reflected in every single state in the study, Silk said. ""We don't see anything else in the survey that is nationwide,"" he told CNN. Still, Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, remained hopeful that people will return to their faith, noting there was a less dramatic decline in those affiliating themselves with a religion this decade than in the 1990s. Perkins told Lou Dobbs he sees that decline easing, and he thinks soon religion will be an even greater part of people's lives. ""If this poll is taken next year will the outcome be different?"" he asked. ""As the economy goes downward, I think people are going to be driven to religion."" Other findings include: . • The percentage of Catholics in the United States has remained steady at about one in four since 1990, while the percentage of other Christians has plummeted from 60 percent to 50 percent. • The percentage of Muslims has doubled since 1990, but remains statistically very small, only 0.3 percent in the original survey and 0.6 percent today. • Mormons have remained steady as a percentage of the population, even as the number of people in the United States has grown. They make up 1.4 percent of the population. • The number of Jews in the United States is falling if the category includes only those who define themselves as Jews religiously, but has remained the same if the category includes people who consider themselves ethnically Jewish. The survey polled 54,461 Americans between February and November of last year. Pollsters conducted the research in both English and Spanish. The survey is the third in a series, following polls in 1990 and 2001.","New survey finds Americans less likely to identify themselves as Christian .

"(CNN) -- Police shot and killed eight people who attacked a police station in Xinjiang, a restive region in northwestern China, authorities said Monday. Nine people armed with knives threw explosives at the building and set police cars on fire, the Xinjiang government said on its official news website. One of the people was taken into custody, the statement said, describing the attackers as ""thugs."" The violence took place around 6:30 a.m. in Yarkant County in western Xinjiang and is under investigation, authorities said. It's the latest outbreak of deadly unrest in Xinjiang, a large, resource-rich region that is home to the Uyghurs, a Turkic-speaking, predominantly Muslim ethnic group. Earlier this month, a clash in the region left 14 Uyghurs and two police officers dead, authorities said. Chinese officials said the two police officers came under attack as they were trying to apprehend suspects. The arrival in Xinjiang of waves of Han Chinese people over the decades has fueled tensions with the Uyghurs. Chinese authorities have cracked down heavily on violence involving Uyghurs, deepening resentment. The government statement about Monday's clash didn't specify the ethnicity of the people who fought with police. The details of violent encounters in Xinjiang often remain murky. Uyghur diaspora groups, like the World Uyghur Congress, have criticized the Chinese government for the lack of transparency over such events. Chinese authorities have blamed Uyghurs for a vehicle attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in October that killed five people -- including the three in the vehicle -- and wounded 40 others. Xinjiang's worst violence in decades took place in July 2009, when rioting in the capital, Urumqi, between Uyghurs and Han Chinese killed some 200 people and injured 1,700. That unrest was followed by a crackdown by security forces.","Police officers shoot and kill eight people and arrest one other, authorities say .

"Mugello (CNN) -- Fernando Alonso's reign as the undisputed No. 1 driver at Ferrari is over, according to Ferrari chairman Luca di Montemolo. The double world champion will be partnered at the Italian team in 2014 by Kimi Raikkonen, the Finn who won the last of Ferrari's 15 world championships in 2007. ""I don't like No. 1, No. 2,"" Di Montezemolo told CNN ahead of this weekend's season-ending Brazilian Grand Prix. ""No. 1 is the timing, No.1 and No.2 depends on the timing."" Di Montezemolo praised Alonso's skill -- the Spaniard was the drivers' champion in 2005 and 2006 -- by giving the 32-year-old a ""good eight out of 10"" mark for a 2013 season which has seen him struggle to keep pace with Red Bull's runaway world champion Sebastian Vettel. Di Montezemolo hopes Raikkonen's arrival will spur Alonso on to greater things in 2014. ""Fernando is really a very, very good driver,"" said Di Montezemolo. ""I'm very pleased to have him in the team. I am only frustrated that we haven't been in condition to give really a super car in the last seasons. ""Alonso knows that he drives to win for himself, but also for Ferrari. Ferrari is a team and I want drivers (who) will drive and will act and react as a team member, not only one man. ""I think that both of these drivers have good experience ... I think it's also in the interest of Alonso to have in the team a driver ready to battle his own competitors, Alonso's competitors."" Raikkonen has won 20 grands prix since making his F1 debut in 2001 and returns to Ferrari -- he drove for the Italian team between 2007 and 2009 -- as a replacement for Brazilian Felipe Massa, who is moving to Williams after eight years at the ""Prancing Horse."" Raikkonen has spent the last two years with Lotus, having left the sport in 2009 to pursue a career in rally driving. Di Montezemolo wanted to recruit a driver of Raikkonen's experience given the raft of new regulations set to shake up F1 in 2014. ""I need a driver able to win races or at least to take off points from our main competitors,"" said Di Montezemolo of the 34-year-old. ""I think he will be in condition to do it. ""For a car with completely new rules, in which you have to develop without the previous year's car, you need a driver with experience. ""Don't forget that Kimi was the driver that won our last world championship."" However, doubts have been cast over Ferrari's ability to manage two drivers who will have their eyes set on a title challenge. Alonso famously clashed with Lewis Hamilton while at McLaren, a rivalry which culminated in the Spaniard joining Renault in 2009 before signing with Ferrari in 2010. But Di Montezemolo has no concerns of a similarly personality clash this time around. ""I don't want to say that they are old..."" Di Montezemolo joked when asked if the two drivers will get along.

"(CNN) -- O.J. Simpson is 66 and has spent nearly all of his seventh decade in a Nevada prison after his conviction on kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges for busting into a Las Vegas casino to try to reclaim items he felt were rightfully his. And he's had enough. His nearly five years in custody ""have been somewhat illuminating at times and painful a lot of times,"" Simpson told two Nevada parole board members Thursday via closed-circuit TV from prison. ""I missed my two younger kids who worked hard getting through high school, I missed their college graduations,"" he said, seemingly emotional as he talked. ""I missed my sister's funeral. I missed all the birthdays."" The football legend could learn whether he'll have less time to spend in prison in two weeks, when the parole board comes back with its decision. If a majority of the seven on the parole board vote in his favor, he'll have some hope but won't be free, according to multiple reports, including from CNN affiliates KSNV and KTNV. That's because he'd still have to serve more of his term -- at least four years more, according to these reports. In his worst case scenario, Simpson remains behind bars for decades more. After his 2008 conviction, he was sentenced to up to 33 years in prison. Watch: The rise and fall of O.J. Simpson . Simpson portrayed himself as a model inmate since his arrival, saying he had promised prison officials ""I would be the best prisoner they have ever had here, (and) I think, for the most part, I've kept my word on that."" Recalling conversations with other inmates, specifically the many like him who are incarcerated for trying to rob others, Simpson said his case stands out -- and, because of that, he should have his prison term cut. ""The difference between all of their crimes and mine is that they were trying to steal other people's property, they were trying to steal other people's money,"" the pro football hall-of-famer argued. ""My crime was trying to retrieve, for my family, my own property."" A Nevada jury, however, didn't see it that way. They convicted him on October 3, 2008 -- the 13th anniversary of his controversial acquittal in the 1994 killings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Goldman. The former Heisman Trophy winner, record-setting NFL running back and movie actor had enlisted the help of Clarence ""C.J."" Stewart and four others to get sports memorabilia that Simpson claimed belonged to him from dealers Bruce Fromong and Al Beardsley. The six men confronted the dealers in a room at Las Vegas' Palace Station Hotel and Casino on September 13, 2007, brandishing weapons but not firing them. Four of those men testified against Simpson -- each getting probation in exchange for his testimony -- while Stewart stood trial alongside him. So does Simpson regret what he did? Watch: O.J. Simpson on 2007 conviction: ""I thought I was innocent."" On Thursday, as he did during his trial and has in subsequent appeals, he went on the defensive. Simpson said he'd talked with his kids, his sister and his brother-in-law -- the latter two, he said, ""were originally going to go with me"" -- before going to the hotel. He also talked with two lawyers, one he knew and another he didn't. ""My intent was not to rob from anybody,"" said the onetime University of Southern California and Buffalo Bill great. ""I knew both of these guys who had my stuff. I was a little upset with them, and I think I wasn't as civil as I should have been."" One mistake he admits: Bringing ""some guys with me who I didn't know and one I didn't trust."" ""And that's on me,"" Simpson said. ""For that, I've been here for five years."" Tony Bommarito was one of those who didn't buy similar arguments during Simpson's trial. While Bommarito was an alternate juror, he did agree with the verdict. Talking with CNN earlier this week before Thursday's parole board hearing, Bommarito didn't say specifically whether he thought Simpson should walk free now. But he did say the 33-year maximum sentence ""seems like a lot for what he did in that scenario."" ""I would have thought 10 or 15 years,"" Bommarito said. ""(The longer sentence) made me think that ... was there some bias there, maybe? Maybe they were thinking about the old trial?"" Gallery: The rise and fall of O.J. Simpson .

"(CNN) -- Manchester City took a crucial step towards winning the English Premier League title after coming from behind to beat Everton, move top of the table and pile the pressure on to their championship rivals. An early Ross Barkley wonder goal had given Everton the lead at Goodison Park before Sergio Aguero leveled. Bosnia international Edin Dzeko scored twice alowing City to take control of the match before Romelu Lukaku's goal ensured a tense end to the second half. After Liverpool's capitulation against Chelsea last week, City knew they had to win to keep the destination of the title in their own hands. Both Chelsea and Liverpool had hoped that Everton could do them a favor by taking points from City, and the signs were good when Barkley's early strike gave the home side a first half lead. But City came back strongly and, despite a late Everton rally, held on to victory. At the full time whistle the City players collapsed on the pitch, perhaps knowing that the toughest test of their title race was behind them. With two games to go just two points separate Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool. But City's vastly superior goal difference means that if they win their last two games they will secure the Premier League title. ""That's what we wanted ultimately,"" City captain Vincent Kompany said after the game. ""If we hopefully play like we can we have goals from all over the pitch so that will make the difference."" Earlier in the day, Cardiff City and Fulham tasted the pain and ignominy of Premier League relegation after both teams lost crucial matches. Meanwhile Sunderland, who spent most of the season rooted to the bottom of the table, all but secured survival by improbably defeating Manchester United at Old Trafford. It was an afternoon of high drama across England as promotion and relegation places were being decided in all four professional divisions in warm spring sunshine. But the highest stakes were at play in the Premier League. This was Cardiff City's first ever season in the Premier League, a season that has been defined by defeat, fan unrest and boardroom chaos. Former coach Malky Mackay was controversially fired mid-way through the season by the club's billionaire Malaysian owner Vincent Tan, much to the fans' unhappiness. Mackay's replacement, former Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, could not spark a renaissance as his team fell into the relegation zone for the majority of the rest of the season. Cardiff traveled to Newcastle United, another club engulfed by boardroom and personnel chaos, needing victory. Instead Shola Ameobi, Loic Remy and Stephen Taylor all scored to secure a 3-0 victory for Newcastle and see Cardiff limp back into the Championship, English football's second tier. Fulham, owned by US billionaire Shahid Kahn, headed the same direction after a 4-1 capitulation against Stoke City. Despite a late season revival led by new coach Felix Magath -- Fulham's third of the season -- there was little fight from the West London team as Stoke pushed Fulham towards relegation. Yet both teams were condemned by an unlikely result at Old Trafford. Sunderland, like Fulham and Cardiff, had changed managerial personnel mid-season as Paolo Di Canio was removed and replaced by former Uruguay international Gus Poyet. A late season Sunderland revival led by young striker Connor Wickham -- once tipped at as a future England international who had instead been farmed out on loan -- had raised the unlikely prospect of survival. And a goal midway through the first half by Swedish international Sebastian Larsson was enough to secure a stunning victory for the Black Cats. The only team that can now catch Sunderland is Norwich City, who play league title chasing Chelsea Sunday. Defeat would all but ensure Sunderland's Premier League safety.","Edin Dzeko scores twice as Man City beat Everton 3-2 .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Pentagon report released Tuesday on the military's Dover mortuary finds that not only did some remains of U.S. troops end up in landfills â€” so did remains from the 9/11 attacks. Dover AFB is where the remains of deceased U.S. armed forces first arrive home from overseas. How the Dover Port Mortuary (DPM) handled military remains caused an uproar last November, and the new report says much the same thing happened to remains from the Pentagon attack and the Shanksville, Pennsylvania, crash site of September 11, 2001. Of the nearly 3,000 victims of the 9/11 attacks, 224 were killed at the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. The report says that in 2002, some unidentified and already cremated remains from those attacks were placed in sealed containers, handed over to a biomedical waste contractor and then transported in containers and incinerated a second time. The assumption on the part of the mortuary, the report says, was that nothing was left. But then mortuary management found that some residual material had in fact remained after the second cremation and that the contractor had disposed of it in a landfill. And according to the report, ""The landfill disposition was not disclosed in the contractual disposal agreement."" Confusion over just exactly what the words ""final disposition"" meant was one of the reasons that unidentified 9/11 remains ended up in a landfill. Retired Gen. John Abizaid, who is in charge of the independent review subcommittee investigation, told reporters, ""We think 'final disposition' needs to be the final resting place (of remains)."" Abizaid noted that some states legally define ""final disposition"" of remains as delivering them to the crematorium, and he added, ""we don't agree"" with what many consider to be that sort of final disposition. The report notes that such disposition ceased in 2008 and by 2009 a new policy was in place. Now, unidentified portions of remains are cremated and ""retired at sea."" The White House issued a statement Tuesday night expressing concern ""about the unacceptable handing of remains at Dover."" ""The President has been briefed on the independent review of Dover Port Mortuary and strongly supports the Pentagon's efforts to make needed systemic structural changes so that these types of incidents never happen again,"" the White House statement said. ""The United States has a solemn obligation to compassionately and professionally care for fallen service members and their families, and those we tragically lost on 9/11."" Why 9/11 remains ended up in the Dover Port Mortuary is not explained in the new report and was not the focus of the investigation, said Abizaid. He said the report's purpose is to address how mortuary operations should be reformed and controlled. Abizaid says the real problem with mortuary operations was a failure of command and the command structure. He said the Air Force has very strict regulations that it enforces on the handling of nuclear weapons, and that spirit needs to be adopted in this sphere of operations, too. ""We need to understand that just like the nuclear surety business, this a 100% no-fail mission, and that means the same level of care needs to be taken with regard to the final resting place of our fallen,"" Abizaid said. The issue came up earlier this month in a letter from Rep. Rush Holt, D-New Jersey, to Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in which Holt inquired whether 9/11 victims ended up in the landfill. ""Can the Air Force confirm that no 9/11 victim's remains were incinerated, mixed with medical waste, and sent to a landfill?"" Holt wrote in the letter. ""In her November 2011 correspondence, Acting Undersecretary for Personnel and Readiness Jo Ann Rooney stated to me that the five hijackers responsible for the Pentagon attack were also identified by Dover from DNA samples. How were the remains of the hijackers handled?"" A spokesman for Holt said the secretary of defense has not responded to those questions.","NEW: White House endorses efforts for ""systemic structural changes""

"Beijing (CNN) -- Han Junqian doesn't go outside very often. From 9:30 a.m. until 11 p.m., six days a week, the 50-year-old massage therapist works out of a dingy parlor in Beijing's Xicheng District. There's no commute as Han lives on site. On his day off he spends his time indoors. He goes outside primarily to buy groceries, or visit the bank. ""Sometimes it makes me depressed,"" said Han when reflecting on his condition. Han is blind, and his life is similar to the roughly 120,000 blind massage therapists in China today, according to a 2012 report by Changchun University. After he lost his sight at the age of 15, he didn't have many educational or employment opportunities outside the massage industry. But that may be changing. China's Ministry of Education decided to provide Braille or electronic versions of this June's ""gaokao,"" China's brutally competitive national college entrance exams, effectively opening the door for blind citizens to access higher education. While the move is hailed as a breakthrough by many human rights groups, some critics caution that the proof will only be in its implementation, and that much more needs to be done to improve the lives of the disabled. Stephen Hallett, founder of non-profit organization China Vision, has been working on disability issues in and around China since the 1990s. He was unimpressed by the new blind-friendly exams. ""It's fairly meaningless,"" said Hallett. The root of Hallett's skepticism lies in the spotty record of the Chinese government in enforcing its directives over the entire country. Particularly in China's rural areas, a lack of resources and a lack of political will have often undermined efforts to help blind people in the past. A world apart . China has the largest population of blind people in the world, according to the World Health Organization. When they are educated at all, blind people are shoved into segregated schools that are isolated from the rest of society. Higher education exists only in the form of a few specialized universities where the only majors offered are massage therapy and music. As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, China agreed to the principle of ""an inclusive education system at all levels,"" yet critics on the ground say the situation in practice is profoundly different. The exclusion of the blind from mainstream society, and the social attitudes it has fostered, has resulted in a rippling effect of adverse consequences. ""It's a kind of apartheid,"" said Hallett. Many Chinese who are born blind are simply abandoned by parents unwilling to incur the costs of raising them. For those that lose their vision later in life, the transfer to special schools typically results in the loss of sighted friends and acquaintances. Since the career paths of the students are all but predestined, the curriculum at blind schools are often not as rigorous. ""We're not required to finish everything,"" said Ni Zhen, a former student of the Qingdao School for the Blind. ""I don't really think society has expectations from people with disabilities."" Since the blind have virtually no other employment options, they are often exploited by employers who pay meager wages. One study by the Guangzhou Disabled Career Training Center found that intermediate level blind massage therapists in that city made between RMB 1200 and 3000 a month (around $191 to 479), a figure far lower than sighted counterparts. Zhou Yuewen, a 63-year-old blind therapist from Hebei says he thinks he gives a better massage than a sighted masseur: ""It's very hard for blind people to get a job, so we are more likely to cherish the work we do."" Future vision . China's semi-official organ for dealing with blindness is the China Association of the Blind, and they are forthright about the scale of the problem that blind Chinese face. ""It's not fair that blind people have so few opportunities,"" said an official from the association who requested anonymity. ""The problem is that massage is the quickest way for blind people to get a job."" The association defended the use of blind schools as a matter of practical necessity and insisted that it would be impossible to train teachers in mainstream schools to deal with the volume of China's visually impaired students. They also pointed to the new regulations by the Ministry of Education as proof that they had achieved results. The association, however, offered no solution to the problem of implementation that Hallett and others cited as crucial to the success of the new regulations. Whether it's a success or not, the matter is ultimately moot for many, including Han Junqian. With his best years behind him, Han has no plans to sit for the ""gaokao,"" even if it is made available. ""It's a pity that it didn't come out earlier,"" he said. ""I have forgotten everything.""","Blind people have few opportunities in China and most become massage therapists .
To get into college in China, one must pass the ""gaokao,"" which will be offered in Braille this June .
Critics say the Braille exam is ""fairly meaningless"""
"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Iraqi President Jalal Talabani officially named Nuri al-Maliki to a second term as prime minister in a televised ceremony Thursday. Talabani gave a speech and handed a letter to the prime minister, asking him to form a new government after a months-long political stalemate that drew fears of a resurgence in sectarian and insurgent violence. Al-Maliki has 30 days to work with rival factions and form a government or face the prospect of losing the president's nomination. ""I know very well, as do you, that the task I have been designated with is not an easy one, especially with Iraq's current circumstances,"" al-Maliki said. ""So I urge the great Iraqi people ... and my brothers the politicians to work on getting past all the disputes that had dominated the past stages."" Al-Maliki's nomination came after months of delicate power-sharing negotiations within Iraq's fledgling democracy. Earlier this month, former Iraqi Prime Minister Ayad Allawi offered a grim prediction for the future of Iraq's government after a dramatic walkout staged by Sunni lawmakers in the Iraqiya bloc. ""We think the concept of power-sharing is dead now,"" the secular Shiite said. ""It's finished."" The Iraqiya bloc, led by Allawi, had threatened to shun negotiations on sharing power with Kurds and Shiites. But just days after the walkout, the principal political blocs agreed to establish a committee to negotiate aspects of the deal. Haidar al-Mullah, an Iraqiya member of parliament, said the walk-out was a ""misunderstanding."" His bloc will take a ""real part"" in the government, he said, and will play the role of ""positive opposition"" by monitoring the performance of the government. Mahmoud Othman, an Iraqi Kurdish lawmaker, said mediation efforts by Kurdish officials, Americans and the Arab League began after the walkout. President Obama and other U.S. officials praised the new power-sharing agreement. ""There are still challenges to overcome, but all indications are that the government will be representative, inclusive and reflect the will of the Iraqi people who cast their ballots in the last election,"" Obama said at the G-20 summit in Seoul, South Korea this month. Under the proposed deal, the three major governmental positions were to be filled by three members of the country's largest ethnic groups: the Shiites, the Kurds and the Sunnis. The deal also intended to create a powerful new office -- expected to be headed by Allawi, al-Maliki's rival -- that would serve to check the new prime minister's influence. But Allawi rejected the office, saying he would no longer take up the position. ""I personally have made up my mind. I will not be a part of this theater,"" Allawi said. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report .","Iraqi President Jalal Talabani named Nuri al-Maliki to a second term as prime minister .

"(CNN) -- Hackers have been busy causing service interruptions, breaching databases, and defacing hundreds of Ukrainian and Russian websites, as the crisis between the two countries plays out in cyberwarfare. The attacks have similarities to the resistance movement that sprung up among German-occupied countries during World War II, which took many forms including sabotage, espionage, armed confrontation and counter-propaganda. In addition to that list, today we can add digital or web-based actions including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, which shut down key websites, the defacement of government websites, and breaching government or key industry networks to access sensitive documents and release them to the world. Services like Twitter and Instagram may be used to capture events in real-time, and YouTube may be used for recruitment, training and propaganda purposes. The global networks that enable the incredible global communication and information-sharing applications we have all come to enjoy, all use insecure hardware and software. Just like there's no human cell that is immune to every virus, there's no piece of software that is immune from being exploited. As a result, the most powerful nations in the world today cannot reliably defend their own information and communications infrastructure from targeted attacks, by even a single hacker. To make matters worse, many of today's best hackers aren't employed by their respective governments. While the resistance movement of World War II had fewer skills to bring to combat than members of the armed forces, today we see a ""super-resistance"" composed of elite hackers, for whom cracking a secure network is certainly equal to and in some cases superior to that of a militarized cyberwarfare unit. OpRussia . Shortly after police cracked down on ""Euromaidan"" street protesters, who were calling for closer integration with the EU, in Kiev in November last year, Ukrainian security engineers began discussing the necessity of forming an all-volunteer cyberdefense force. By March 1, 2014, cyberattacks on both sides kicked into high gear. OpRussia, a hacker group formed under the Anonymous umbrella, posted a warning to Russian President Putin that his aggression against Ukraine would not stand on March 1, 2014. Since then, members of OpRussia have been attacking Russian business and government websites on a daily basis, including the website for the Russian Air Force, the website of the Kamchatka region, Russia's narcotics control service, and even a Russian escort service. Russian CyberCommand is another group of hackers, some of whom are Russian, who oppose Putin's annexation of Crimea and have been relentless in their attacks against Russian businesses and agencies such as Rosoboronexport -- Russia's sole agency authorized to sell defense and dual-use products and technologies to foreign entities -- and SearchInform.ru -- a Russian IT security company that provides services to Gazprom, Skolkovo, and other important organizations. Like OpRussia, Russian CyberCommand considers itself part of Anonymous. Anonymous . While the name Anonymous is frequently associated with cyberoperations that support revolutionary movements, that wasn't the case with these next two groups: Anonymous Ukraine and CyberBerkut, both of whom are Pro-Russia groups. Anonymous Ukraine attacked NATO websites on November 7 when Ukraine was considering establishing closer ties with the EU as well as NATO membership. On March 15, CyberBerkut attacked NATO websites again, however those attacks were a small percentage of CyberBerkut's onslaught against several hundred Ukrainian government and commercial websites from March 3 up until the present. The group's logo and name come directly from Ukraine's old special police unit ""Berkut"" and there are rumors that the group is composed of either Ukrainian or Russian former security services personnel. As of March 18, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said that Ukraine would not be seeking NATO membership, a move designed to placate Russia as well as Ukraine's large Russian-speaking population. Yatsenyuk also announced a willingness to maintain political ties with the EU but will delay signing any economic agreements for the time being. 'Russian Cyber Playbook' Some Western pundits have drawn similarities between the current cyberattacks and those that happened during previous conflicts. Most of the Georgian government's communications systems were shut down by Russian hackers during the conflict there in 2008. But in fact there's very little similarity, and no actual evidence linking the Russian government to the current wave of cyberattacks against Ukrainian websites. This is not a page out of the ""Russian Cyber Playbook"" for several reasons: . Firstly, the Nashi, a government-financed Russian youth organization that was responsible for the attacks against Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008 is no more. And secondly, in 2008, Russian hacker forums were actively recruiting volunteers for attacks against Georgia. Not so today. In fact, many Russian hackers are angry with Putin and are supporting an independent Ukraine. Time has not stood still since August 2008. In 2010, Russia published a new military doctrine which acknowledged the ""intensification of the role of information warfare"" and assigned as a task to ""develop forces and resources for information warfare."" Russia and most other nations have been investing hundreds of millions of dollars to improve their capabilities to conduct electronic warfare, information warfare, and cyber warfare via increasingly sophisticated means; and by that I mean techniques that include compromising a nation's electrical grid or GPS navigation system from the canopy of a combat helicopter. Russia, in particular, has spent the last few years developing dual-use technologies that will never be seen or defended against by its target -- for example, malware research that could be used to both defend against malware in peace time and use malware offensively as part of a military operation. But there will always be highly-skilled civilians who can quickly organize online, distribute easy-to-use denial of service tools, and cause mayhem and embarrassment to the enemy, whoever he may be.

"(CNN) -- Zieba Shorish-Shamley's Afghanistan doesn't exist anymore. As recently as the 1970s, Afghan women could be seen wearing miniskirts in Kabul. The tea and fresh fruit her Muslim family shared over laughter with their Jewish friends at home. The female lawmakers who spoke out in Afghanistan's parliament. The tourists who were so enchanted by Kabul, the country's cosmopolitan capital, they called it the ""Paris of Central Asia."" When the Afghan native recently returned home, all of those childhood memories seemed like a mirage. What she saw instead was what many Americans now associate with Afghanistan: destruction. ""When I got off the plane, I cried my eyes out,"" she said. ""Most of Kabul was destroyed."" Shorish-Shamley's memories represent a side of Afghanistan that's easily overlooked. As Afghans prepare to pick a president in their national election Thursday, much of the media has focused on pre-election violence. Afghanistan has often been portrayed as a barbaric country where warfare has been a way of life for centuries. But not long ago, Afghanistan was something else: a politically stable, religiously moderate government that recognized women's rights, Afghan natives and scholars say. Elizabeth Gould, co-author of ""Invisible History: Afghanistan's Untold Story,"" says a U.S. diplomat visiting Afghanistan in the early 1970s said its citizens were so passionate about democracy that he saw them debate their constitutional rights in the streets. ""The years after World War II, in the '50s, '60s and early '70s, were the golden years,"" Gould said. Afghanistan's 'wave of freedom' Afghanistan's earlier stability started at the top. It rested in part on its royal leadership. The country was ruled by a king, Mohammad Zahir Shah, from 1933 to 1973. Though a monarch, some say Zahir Shah tried to spread the power in Afghanistan. In 1964, he convened a council of scholars, religious and tribal leaders to create a constitution that supported more individual freedoms. Critics say, however, that the shah was slow to implement those democratic reforms. ""The king and some of the people who worked for the king believed in democracy and the rights of people,"" said Shorish-Shamley, now founder and director of the Women's Alliance for Peace and Human Rights in Afghanistan. ""It was the '60s, and there was a wave of freedom."" Shorish-Shamley says Afghanistan was, in some ways, ahead of the United States when it came to empowering women. ""We had more women in parliament than the U.S. had in Congress at the time,"" she said. ""We were moving toward democracy. People didn't have much, but they were happy."" That wave of freedom filtered down to ordinary people's lives, says Tanya Amri, an Afghan-American who spent her early childhood in Kabul. Amri remembers an idyllic time. Her mother worked as a journalist, and her father worked at the U.S. Embassy. There was hardly any crime in Kabul, and the government was stable, she says. When she tells some Americans that her mother worked as a journalist in Afghanistan, they can't digest the news. ""They ask me if my mom wore a burka,'' said Amri, who is writing a book about Afghanistan's food and cultural heritage. ""I tell them she wore a miniskirt."" Religious intolerance may be a problem in Afghanistan today, but not as much in the past, Amri says. The country has a history of religious tolerance. Its mixed religious heritage could be seen in two soaring statues of Buddha that were carved into a cliff in central Afghanistan. Buddhist monks lived in the caves behind the cliff, she says. ""At one point, Afghanistan was a Buddhist country,"" Amri said. ""In those caves, 2,000 monks used to meditate."" The Taliban, however, demolished the statues in early 2001 because they deemed them graven images offensive to Islam. Afghanistan's earlier religious tolerance was due in part to geography. It was at the intersection of the ancient world's great civilizations, says Paul Fitzgerald, co-author of ""Invisible History."" Afghanistan was crisscrossed by the Silk Road, an ancient network of routes that linked China to Rome. Wool, gold, silk and spices were dispatched over the roads, and Buddhist and Hindu pilgrims settled into Afghanistan, Fitzgerald says. ""Afghanistan has been called the graveyard of empires, but it's more of a crossroad of cultures,"" Fitzgerald said. The cultural richness is what Shorish-Shamley remembers from her childhood. Though she was a Muslim, she remembered attending Jewish holiday celebrations. Hindus, Sikhs, Shiites and Sunnis lived easily with one another, she says. ""My mother's best friends were Jewish,"" she said. ""My mother had a set of cups and dishes that were kosher that she kept for her friends when they came over for dinner."" Is the past romanticized? Yet there are others who say it is tempting to romanticize Afghanistan's past. Christine Beasley, the program manager in Afghanistan for World Vision, a Christian humanitarian group, says Afghanistan did modernize in the 1960s and the 1970s. But most of the country's rural areas remained conservative in their practice of Islam and treatment of women. ""There was relative stability, but the changes in the '60s and '70s were confined to very small, urban elite, primarily around Kabul,"" Beasley said. Afghanistan's stability started to unravel in 1973. A military coup ousted the king. If he was so just, why would a coup succeed? Fitzgerald says Afghans grew unsatisfied because change wasn't coming quick enough to the impoverished country. ""It was the lack of progress at modernization by the traditional Afghan government that was the source of unrest,"" Fitzgerald said. ""It was not the fact that they were modernizing. They didn't have the economy to absorb all of those educated Afghans."" In the late 1970s under a communist regime, Afghanistan's internal stability worsened. In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded and deposed the country's leader. But Soviet forces ended up getting bogged down in a 10-year-long military conflict. The Soviets were finally driven out by U.S.-backed Afghan resistance fighters. Afghan resistance leaders formed a government but it eventually descended into civil war. In 1996, the Taliban stepped into the power vacuum left by feuding factions and took control. The Taliban, though largely indigenous to Afghanistan, was nurtured by  Pakistan's military and intelligence services. The Taliban ""would have never been able to take over Afghanistan without that support,"" says Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst. ""The Taliban has to be viewed as a creation of Pakistan intelligence with the objective of taking over Afghanistan and putting in a Pakistani-friendly government,"" says Elizabeth Gould , author of ""Invisible History."" Shorish-Shamley, the Afghan women's activist, agrees with Gould and says it is useless to negotiate with the Taliban. ""There is no such thing as a moderate Taliban,"" she said. ""If you will show me a moderate Nazi, I will show you a moderate Taliban."" Perhaps Afghanistan can recover its stability. Afghans and exiles recommend the same solutions: weed out government corruption, oust the Taliban, boost economic development and prevent Pakistan from interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs. Amri, the Afghan-American who is writing a book about her native country's heritage, says nostalgia will not be enough. She and other Afghans must return to Afghanistan to help it recover. ""It's up to the people of my generation to go back and contribute,"" she said. ""I'm very hopeful. Nothing lasts forever. I hope it happens in my lifetime.""","Afghan exile says her world doesn't exist anymore .

"Washington (CNN) -- How much do Republicans fear Hillary Clinton as the likely Democratic presidential nominee in 2016? So much that Karl Rove has her in his sights. The conservative political mastermind credited with orchestrating George W. Bush's two winning presidential campaigns insinuated in a fact-challenged attack last week that Clinton was brain damaged. Condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans came quickly, but Rove achieved his goal of inserting the question of Clinton's health into the national discussion before she has declared if she will run in an election more than two years away. On Wednesday, Former President Bill Clinton came to his wife's defense, joking during a public appearance that if Hillary had brain damage, ""then I must be in really tough shape because she's still quicker than I am."" ""It's just the beginning"" ""It's just the beginning,"" he said of Rove's attack, adding that Republicans ""will still get better at it."" When it comes to playing a political card, few deal better than Rove, who specializes in undermining the perceived strengths of opposing candidates. Recall the 2004 ""swift-boating"" of John Kerry, who saw one of his biggest potential advantages -- his military service in Vietnam compared to Bush's non-participation -- turned into a liability by questions about what he did there. Now Rove takes on a former U.S. senator and secretary of state who is the overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination, if she decides to run. Clinton also polls strongly against all the known potential Republican contenders, a situation that likely prompted Rove to go after her. In comments at a May 8 conference reported by the New York Post's Page Six gossip column, Rove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital in 2012 and wore ""glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury"" when she returned to public life. Both assertions were false -- she spent a few days in the hospital and the glasses help deal with double vision rather than traumatic brain damage. Nevertheless, the comments generated headlines and political chatter, including repeated discussions on CNN programs. Echo chamber . Nick Merrill, a spokesman for Clinton, said Rove lied about Clinton's health but ""he doesn't care, because all he wants to do is inject the issue into the echo chamber, and he's succeeding."" ""It's flagrant and thinly veiled,"" Merrill said, adding that Republicans ""are scared of what she has achieved and what she has to offer."" As for Clinton, he said ""she is 100%, period."" Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a GOP political adversary of the Clintons in the 1990s, blasted Rove's comments as typical of what he called a Republican consulting class that ""wants to be negative, narrow, personal, avoid ideas and not have to wrestle with the big issue."" Rove's tactic not only drew attention, it linked the controversy he started to the dominant Republican attack line against Clinton so far -- her management of the September 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. House Republicans have formed a select committee on Benghazi, a step intended to keep the issue in the public eye, while Democrats oppose the move and have yet to decide if they will take part. Benghazi link . Two months after the Benghazi terror attack, Clinton suffered a blood clot following a fall. She underwent testing in a hospital, then later was admitted for a three-day stay. The health issue prevented her from testifying to Congress about the attack, and some Republicans questioned the validity of her health problem at the time. Rove brought up all that history on Tuesday when he backed away from his factual errors but stressed the overall issue of Clinton's health. ""I didn't say she had brain damage. She had a serious health episode,"" Rove told Fox News before reciting a chronology of what happened in December 2012 and January 2013. ""First she had apparently a serious virus,"" he said. ""They announced then on the 15th of December that she had at some period in the past week fallen. They didn't say when, they didn't say where. She was recovering at home."" Later in December, Rove continued, ""she goes in and turns out to have had a blood clot"" but ""they won't say where."" ""The next day, they say it is between her skull and her brain behind her right ear,"" he noted. When she testified before Congress on Benghazi on January 25, Clinton wore ""special glasses that allow her to deal with the double vision that this episode caused,"" Rove added. In response, Bill Clinton ridiculed Republican efforts to politicize the entire Benghazi issue. ""First they say she faked her concussion,"" he noted Wednesday, and now they have her ""auditioning for a part on the Walking Dead."" If elected in 2016, Clinton would be 69 when she becomes president -- the same age as Ronald Reagan when he moved into the White House in January 1981. Age a campaign issue? Republican commentators repeatedly made that point Wednesday, saying Democrats defending Clinton had questioned the age of Republicans such as Reagan, Vice President Dick Cheney and Sen. John McCain when they ran for higher office. GOP strategist Kevin Madden called Rove's ""erroneous"" remarks an acknowledgment of reality rather than a strategic ploy. ""I think it was a very awkward attempt at making a pretty obvious point, which is that non-candidates, which Hillary Clinton technically is, they don't get a level of scrutiny that official candidates in a 2016 race might get,"" said Madden, a CNN contributor. Shenanigans, responded Democrats. ""It's the McCarthyism of the Internet age where you can put anything out there, make a big lie, make this thing up about 30 days in the hospital, which was patently not true, make this thing up about sunglasses,"" said Richard Socarides, a former adviser to Bill Clinton. ""It was totally fabricated. Then he pulls it back. Now we're having this whole segment on it."" Tracy Sefl, a senior adviser for Ready for Hillary, one of the super PACs formed to back a Clinton candidacy, said Rove's tactic would backfire on Republicans because it boosted support for Clinton.

""The reason that we're talking about this today has less to do with whether or not some of the facts related to Hillary Clinton's health,"" he said. ""It has to do with the fact that now while Hillary Clinton is not an official candidate, her organization and her supporters, they're acting like one.

"(CNN) -- At the 2009 Australian Open, French men's tennis was the talk of the town. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Richard Gasquet, Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon were being dubbed the ""New Musketeers,"" a reference to the ""Four Musketeers"" from the same nation who dominated tennis in the late 1920s and early '30s. Tsonga was the big-hitting, charismatic leader of the bunch; child prodigy Gasquet, with his smooth one-handed backhand, was likened to an artist; Monfils played defensive tennis like no other but also possessed the requisite punch on his strokes; and Simon owned the rare ability to turn defense into offense in an instant. But five years on, that optimism has lessened. Emulating Rene Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Jean Borotra and Jacques Brugnon -- who collected 20 grand slam singles titles, 23 in doubles and helped ""Les Bleus"" win six consecutive Davis Cup trophies -- looks out of the question. In fact, just one grand slam singles title would do -- France's last by a male player came 31 years ago, courtesy of Yannick Noah. Given the grip of the so-called ""Big Four"" on the men's game -- and the performances of Tsonga, Gasquet, Monfils and Simon -- even that appears uncertain, although Stanislas Wawrinka's surprise Australian Open victory gives the quartet hope. In Melbourne in January, some members of the French media lamented a familiar pattern at grand slams recently: Handfuls of French men appear in the singles draw but not many reach the quarterfinals or beyond. None landed in the last eight at that Australian Open, and none made the last 16 at last month's Indian Wells Masters in California -- arguably the most prestigious regular-season tournament outside the four majors. ""I think it's a mix of different feelings in France,"" says Patrice Dominguez, tournament director of a men's event in Montpellier and the former national technical director of the French Tennis Federation. ""Obviously the expectations were big ... big for a while."" When asked if the foursome have lived up to their potential, he replied unequivocally: ""No, not yet. I really feel like they haven't reached their maximum."" And yet, the path of the four might have been completely different. Novak Djokovic faced Tsonga in the 2008 Australian Open final, each bidding for a maiden major. It was Djokovic who prevailed, and the Serb subsequently posted one of the finest campaigns in tennis history in 2011. Andy Murray and Simon share similar, counter-punching styles. Six years ago, they finished three places apart in the rankings and competed at the year-end championships. Murray beefed up and has since amassed two grand slam titles. Pals Rafael Nadal and Gasquet were born 15 days apart in 1986. Gasquet hasn't appeared in a grand slam final -- and Nadal boasts 13 majors. Like Roger Federer, Gael Monfils bagged the Wimbledon junior title. While Federer tallies 17 majors, Monfils seeks a first semifinal berth at a major outside France. ""Gael was probably the most gifted of the four,"" Dominguez told CNN. ""He has everything."" Gasquet's mental toughness has been questioned in the past -- something even he is aware of, though he has improved -- and he lacks an overpowering serve. Since gracing the cover of a French tennis magazine as an adolescent, Gasquet has rarely escaped the eye of the public. ""He's like the baby brother of the country and the people have been babysitting him since he was nine years old,"" Carole Bouchard, a tennis writer with French sports daily L'Equipe, told CNN. ""They love him. And they want him to succeed. At the same time, sometimes he gets on their nerves. ""It's a love-hate relationship but more love than hate."" Gasquet, encouragingly, put together his most consistent season in 2013 and made a second appearance at the year-end World Tour Finals. Tsonga's all-action game is deemed high risk, with Dominguez adding that the world No. 12 doesn't win enough matches when not playing at his best. Injuries have consistently hampered the 27-year-old Monfils, who -- despite often preferring a defensive style -- at times seems more concerned about pleasing fans than winning matches. ""I think the public still waits for a lot from this generation,"" Arnaud Di Pasquale, the national technical director of the French Tennis Federation, admitted to CNN. ""I think they're waiting for a Davis Cup win and they're waiting for a grand slam win. But we're never far away."" Tsonga, Gasquet, Monfils and Simon are four of the dozen French men in the benchmark top 100, so depth isn't an issue for France -- the other three grand slam nations of Australia, Britain and the U.S. have fewer than 12 players combined in the top 100. ""We know how to build players and to reach the top 10,"" said Dominguez. ""After the top 10 and inside that, what is making the difference? Not the federation or coach. It's the real wish, investment you put in -- and that's the individual's desire."" For Patrick Mouratoglou, who runs an academy outside Paris and coaches women's world No. 1 Serena Williams, the lack of a grand slam champion comes down to ""ambition."" ""I always say we are a great country to build the players,"" Mouratoglou told CNN's Open Court. ""The thing maybe we don't have -- there are exceptions -- is the right mentality to raise champions. ""For the French players things are too easy for them. They make a lot of money in tennis quite early and I think we lack ambition. Maybe it's not in the culture of France to have very high ambitions. ""Grand slam winners are people who have very high expectations, who simply have the mentality of champions. I'm not sure too many French players have that mentality."" Di Pasquale paused before reacting to Mouratoglou's comments. ""Is ambition lacking?"" he said. ""I'm not sure. ""Today I think Tsonga wants to win a grand slam, Gasquet is showing more ambition, a more demonstrative side on the court with the crowd -- more rage and enthusiasm. With age, time passes and you become aware of some things. Things move on and you realize there aren't many years left. ""I think all of that will come into play. They're going to have to react and say, 'I don't want to stop here, not having won a grand slam.' ""Lack of ambition related to the system? It's tough to say but it can't just be reduced to not getting the results that people want from the players. ""I think the ambition that we have is to develop a culture of winning. But there is also a side that is very personal."" Gasquet, twice a grand slam semifinalist, told Open Court he would ""fight"" for a first major, and France's Davis Cup captain Arnaud Clement is adamant that one of his charges can break through. Clement and Tsonga are two of the four French men to make a grand slam final since Noah thrilled the home fans at Roland Garros in 1983. ""It's going to be tough because tennis is strong in the top 10,"" Clement told Open Court. ""But we saw Wawrinka won. He worked a lot, he's smart, and he did it. ""I am sure it's possible for all my players, too."" The more realistic target, however, might be to capture the Davis Cup -- it's a major goal for Gasquet and the other leading French players. The drought in the competition isn't 31 years but lengthy nonetheless at 13. France is the favorite against Germany in the quarterfinals at home this weekend, and France versus Federer's Switzerland is a potential blockbuster final in November. ""Beware of this generation -- they're not finished,"" said Di Pasquale, who beat a young Federer to claim bronze at the 2000 Olympics. ""I don't think we can draw conclusions. I cross my fingers.""","France's tennis federation has long been praised for producing players .
Twelve men sit in the top 100, tying Spain and better than the U.S.

"(CNN) -- In 1965 Bill Cosby made TV history and changed the face of television. He co-starred in NBC's ""I Spy,"" becoming the first African-American male to star in a prime-time network drama -- and won three Emmys doing it. In 1984, two decades later, Cosby made another pioneering TV achievement, reviving the then-dormant sitcom form by starring as the patriarch of a loving family called the Huxtables. The Cosby Show soon was TV's No. 1 show, and helped make NBC television's No. 1 network -- all while blasting another programming myth: That white viewers wouldn't embrace an all-black TV show. Now, 30 years after doctor and dad Cliff Huxtable, and almost 50 years after tennis trainer and secret agent Alexander Scott, NBC is returning to the Bill Cosby well one more time -- and hoping his stardom, fan base and legacy can bring some much-needed magic to broadcast television in the 21st century. The Deadline Hollywood website has reported that NBC and Cosby, partnered with producer Tom Werner (part owner of the company that produced ""The Cosby Show""), have reached an agreement to produce a family sitcom starring Cosby. The question is, can lightning strike thrice? Can Cosby make TV history yet again? And is it even fair to expect or ask him to? Remember, first of all, that not every Bill Cosby TV series has been a guaranteed hit. After ""I Spy,"" Cosby scored big in the children's television arena, with the animated ""Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids"" and his playful appearances on ""The Electric Company"" and ""Sesame Street."" But his prime-time series didn't always score as successes. His first NBC series after ""I Spy,"" the 1969 sitcom ""The Bill Cosby Show,"" showcased him as a high-school coach and phys ed teacher. It was a very smart series, and positioned Cosby's Chet Kincaid in a strong position of authority, but it didn't catch on. His next series -- for CBS this time -- came in 1972: a weekly variety series called ""The New Bill Cosby Show."" Its key ingredients, in addition to Cosby's weekly comic monologues, included dancer-actress Lola Falana, pretend drunk Foster Brooks, and bandleader Quincy Jones. But this show, in an era when variety shows were as ubiquitous as reality shows are today, was gone after one season. 1976's ""Cos,"" for ABC, was a variety show aimed at youngsters. It lasted two months. Then came ""The Cosby Show,"" eight seasons of which singlehandedly moved TV from the topical and raw comedy of Norman Lear's sitcoms to an era in which television parents regained control, and family civility returned. After ""The Cosby Show"" were more Cosby series, ones that never captured the same zeitgeist: NBC's ""The Cosby Mysteries"" (1994-95), and CBS's ""Cosby"" sitcom (1996-2000, re-teaming him with ""Cosby Show"" TV spouse Phylicia Rashad), and an ""Art Linkletter's House Party"" sequel of sorts: CBS's ""Kids Say the Darndest Things"" (1998-2000), with Cosby interviewing children. In other words, over his TV career, Bill Cosby has hit as many singles and doubles as home runs. At 76, does Cosby have another long-ball miracle in him? My bet is that he can, indeed, do it again -- provided he swings for the fences, and that NBC does nothing to impede Cosby from following his instincts and doing precisely what he wants. The major warning flag, on NBC right now, is ""The Michael J. Fox Show,"" which has returned another '80s NBC sitcom icon to television -- but not successfully, because the network seemed to think that merely signing Fox and bringing him back was enough. It isn't. You need the right role, the right writers and the right cast, and you have to put them all together at the right time. But Cosby, like a comedy locust, seems amazingly designed to surface every two or three decades and capture the imagination. In the right vehicle, he can do it again. His timing and his jokes were on full, hilarious display in last year's Comedy Central standup special, whose title may prove prophetic: ""Bill Cosby: Far from Finished."" Can his humor still work today, when, as always, he avoids going ""blue""? It certainly worked on Comedy Central. Blue, black -- Bill Cosby never has made color more of a priority than universality. If I were given a vote in designing Cosby's 21st-century sitcom comeback vehicle, I'd craft it as a dual home life/workplace vehicle, like the classic ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" At home, let Cosby be the family grandpa, holding court over a loving, lively, extended family. But let him to go work beyond retirement age, too, as a tenured college professor or a veteran media pundit on a TV talk show. Either way, he'd get to vent about current events, forgotten history and anything else the real William H. Cosby Ph.D. would care to bring to the viewing public via prime-time TV. Including, of course, his observations on family and other parts of his still-funny monologues. More than 50 years after he released his first comedy album, Bill Cosby is a very funny fellow. Right? Riiiiiight... The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Bianculli .","David Bianculli: Bill Cosby made TV history with starring roles in ""I Spy,"" ""The Cosby Show""
He says there's news he'll be, at 76, in a new TV show. Can lightning strike thrice?
He says despite Cosby's two ground-breaking shows, he's had quite a few that have failed .
Bianculli: He can score again, but only if NBC lets him swing for fences. He's still hilarious ."
"Charlotte, N.C. (CNN) -- The fallout over one of the largest coal ash spills in U.S. history continued Tuesday as environmentalists staged a protest at the headquarters of the company responsible for the incident, the federal government launched a criminal investigation, and officials warned residents near the potentially contaminated river to avoid contact with the water until testing Is finished. Residents who live on the Dan River in North Carolina near the retired Duke Energy power plant where millions of gallons of coal ash and wastewater were leaked also were advised to skip eating fish from the water for now. The North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources on Tuesday told Duke Energy it is considering changes to its wastewater permits for coal ash ponds after the February 2 leak at the former plant in Eden. Dozens of demonstrators paraded in front of the corporate headquarters of Duke Energy in Charlotte, demanding answers to what environmentalists believe are many questions in the wake of the spill, which dumped coal ash, the byproduct of burning coal, which is made up of aluminum oxide, iron oxide and silicon oxide. It also contains arsenic, mercury and other metals. The natural resources department said Tuesday it has been testing the water near the plant since the incident and began this week to catch fish for testing. ""This needs to be our last wake-up call. Our last coal ash spill,"" said Mary Anne Hitt of the Sierra Club. ""We are here to say no more. No more coal ash in unlined ponds. No more leaks that seep into our drinking waters. No more stalling. No more excuses. No more hiding behind political allies. We are here to draw the line, Duke,"" Amy Adams of Appalachian Voices told the crowd. Organized by the Sierra Club, the demonstrators held placards and tried to deliver 9,000 petition signatures from Duke Energy customers asking that all coal ash ponds be removed. Two security guards outside the building would not let a leader of the demonstrators deliver the petitions and a spokesman for Duke told CNN's Drew Griffin that building security was to blame. ""We don't own the building,"" the spokesman said. Earlier, a Duke spokesman said no one from the company would accept the petitions in person nor speak on camera to CNN. In an e-mail, the Duke Energy representative said of the leak and the company's response: ""The drinking water has remained safe. The pipe has been permanently plugged. We take responsibility for this event and also are taking another look at the management of our (14 North Carolina) ash basins."" CNN affiliate WRAL reported that state officials have said there is no immediate danger to municipal water supplies even though sediment from the spill is on the river bottom for 70 miles. Pipe springs a leak . On February 2, a leak in a 48-inch stormwater pipe sent coal ash and wastewater pouring into the river. In statements announcing the spill, Duke Energy said up to 82,000 tons of ash had been released and up to 27 million gallons of basin water had flooded into the river. The company has since revised that figure to as much as 39,000 tons. Researchers from Wake Forest University who used cameras on an unmanned aerial aircraft to create a 3-D image of the spill said Tuesday that as many as 35 million gallons of arsenic-contaminated water and ash may have made its way into the river. That would be equivalent to the amount of water in 53 Olympic-sized pools. A week after the spill, the company said it had plugged the broken line and was working with officials on developing a cleanup plan. The utility also apologized for the spill. ""We're committed to the Dan River and the communities that it serves,"" Charlie Gates, the company's senior vice president of power generation operations, said in a statement. ""We are accountable for what has happened and have plenty of work ahead of us."" Environmental groups said they believe the department of natural resources, which regulates power plants, has been lax in regulating Duke Energy. The agency reached a $99,000 settlement with the company earlier this year over two other coal ash storage sites. Frank Holleman of the Southern Environmental Law Center said that settlement is not enough. ""We want the pollution cleaned up, remove it from unlined lagoons and move it to safe storage. We have not focused on the penalty. We want the solution."" Criminal investigation . The federal government has launched an official criminal investigation into the spill. Duke Energy has confirmed to CNN that the company has been served with two subpoenas, but would not characterize them in any way. North Carolina's Department of Environment and Natural Resources provided CNN with copies of the subpoenas it received. Nearly 20 employees of the department have been ordered to testify in front of a grand jury in March. The agency has been ordered to produce documents dating back to 2010, including communications between Duke Energy and department employees. CNN's Suzanne Presto contributed to this report.","Spill happened February 2 near retired power plant along a North Carolina section of Dan River .

"(CNN) -- A self-professed Apple fanatic, Jonathan Zufi was looking for a book of photography profiling the company's products through the years. When he didn't find one, the Atlanta software engineer decided to make one himself. ""Iconic: A Photographic Tribute to Apple Innovation"" is the result. Released last month, the hardcover, coffee-table book contains 350 pages of photos documenting nearly every product the company has ever made. Apple has long been unapologetically focused on design and Zufi, a native of Melbourne, Australia, said he wanted to celebrate that with his images. ""Other companies came up with the guts for a machine and then the engineers would find a way to stuff them into a box,"" said Zufi. ""Steve Jobs started with the box and said, 'You need to find a way to get the guts in.' "" The book, currently available only through its website, sells for $75, or $300 for a special edition which, along with other extras, comes with a custom-fit book case designed in a retro style inspired by Apple products of the 1970s and '80s. It's all an unlikely project for a software engineer with no formal photography training. Zufi bought new equipment and consulted with a professional as he began the project, which was four years in the making. All along, he focused on shooting artistic images that didn't resemble promotional product shots. ""I didn't want to take photos that you could find in marketing material,"" he said. Instead, he said he approached each shot by looking for an image that would ""create that same emotional connection to that product, but maybe doesn't look like something you've seen before."" For example, when shooting the first version of the iPhone, released in 2007, he chose an image of the back of the phone. ""I don't really remember seeing a lot of the photos of the back,"" he said. ""It's little things like that."" Zufi, who began sharing his images on the website Shrine of Apple, said he hasn't had any official communications with Apple about the book. ""I didn't even try to reach out. I knew that it probably wouldn't get anywhere,"" he said. ""I can tell you there's been an enormous outpouring of support and enthusiasm from employees. People at the company are buying the book -- they're buying it for themselves, they're buying it for their friends ... . That feedback is obviously very gratifying."" No less of an authority than Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak wrote a foreword to the book. ""Within these pages, Jonathan presents a thoughtful and artistic gift to Apple fans and employees alike; photographs of Apple products -- from hardware to packaging -- the likes of which I've never seen compiled before,"" he writes.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- After his father's death, a young prince, driven by suspicion, kills his uncle in a web of political intrigue. Sound familiar? The classic Shakespearean drama ""Hamlet"" is scheduled for a performance in North Korea in September 2015 by the Globe Theatre as part of a two-year tour to perform in every country. The parallels of staging a drama about an epic family power struggle in Pyongyang, where the country's young leader Kim Jong Un had his uncle, Jang Song Thaek executed has raised a few eyebrows -- especially from human rights groups. Jang was considered instrumental in Kim's rise to power, but Kim turned his back on his uncle in spectacular fashion late last year as Jang was branded ""a traitor for all ages"" and executed on charges that he had attempted to overthrow the government. Human rights criticism . ""If the Globe Theatre goes to North Korea, they should read up on the reality of the country before they get there,"" said Niall Couper, a spokesperson for Amnesty International. North Korea's human rights record came under heavy scrutiny last month in a 400-page UN Commission of Inquiry report that called the country's stunning catalog of torture and abuse as lacking ""any parallel in the contemporary world."" ""No tragic play could come close to the misery that the 100,000 people trapped in the country's prison camps endure -- where torture, rape, starvation and execution are everyday occurrences,"" Couper said. The Globe defended its decision to visit the country saying that ""a policy of inclusion, rather than exclusion, is more true to the spirit of Shakespeare."" Called a Globe to Globe Hamlet tour, the group intends to travel to all seven continents -- irrespective of political situations. The troupe also plans to visit Syria, Afghanistan, the Central African Republic and Somalia in ""its most ambitious tour yet."" Shakespeare a ""force for good"" ""We have always believed that cultural communication, and different peoples talking to each other through art, is a force for good in the world. In every country, we are going for one single and simple purpose: to play Hamlet there,"" a statement released by the London-based theater said. Its ""Hamlet"" production is described as a ""fresh, pared-down version"" that lasts two hours and 40 minutes, with 12 actors and four stage managers using a portable stage. The theater stated that ""Hamlet"" was first written when England was weathering internal tensions, repression and violence. ""Like all the best works of art, 'Hamlet' instigates discussion and dialogue, and like any theatre, we wish to play to, and interact with, as many people as we possibly can, in as diverse a range of locations as possible. We do not believe that anyone should be excluded from the chance to experience this play,"" according to its statement. The theater group is not the first to get blasted by human rights groups for performing in North Korea. Dennis Rodman, former NBA player, came under blistering criticism for holding a basketball exhibition and singing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kim Jong Un. In 2008, the New York Philarmonic held a controversial concert in Pyongyang, which was aired on North Korea's state-run TV and radio. The lessons of ""Hamlet"" may not extend to the young North Korean leader, said Amnesty's spokesperson. ""There's a dark irony in the fact that Hamlet focuses on a prince wrestling with his conscience,"" Couper said. ""Kim Jong Un is no Hamlet. Sadly he shows no sign of wrestling with his conscience.""","Globe Theatre plans a two-year tour of ""Hamlet"" to every country in the world .

"(CNN) -- A United Nations fact-finding team has found ""massive evidence"" that the highest levels of the Syrian government are responsible for war crimes in the nation's long-running civil war, the U.N.'s human rights chief said Monday. Navi Pillay didn't name President Bashar al-Assad, but she said the evidence collected by the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria implicates the regime's top man. The panel's members have ""outlined their view that the facts point to the commission of very serious crimes, war crimes, crimes against humanity,"" Pillay, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, told reporters in Geneva, Switzerland. ""They point to the fact that the evidence indicates responsibility at the highest level of government, including the head of state."" Still, Pillay declined to say whether al-Assad was named in a list of suspects that the panel produced. The list is confidential -- not to be released until the matter goes from the fact-finding stage to a formal international investigation -- and even she has not read it, she said. Pillay said the evidence also shows that rebels have committed war crimes and pointed to the fact that the majority of deaths -- more than 100,000 since the civil war began in 2011 -- are from unlawful attacks with conventional weapons, not from chemical weapons, which have gotten much of the attention in recent months. A joint Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations team charged with overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons began inspecting sites in October. The U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized the mission set a deadline of mid-2014 for Syria to destroy its chemical weapons or face consequences. The goal is to move the most dangerous chemicals out of the country as quickly as possible, said Sigrid Kaag, head of the joint team. But the presence of chemical weapons inspectors has not stopped the influx of conventional weapons into Syria's civil war. As recently as September, U.S. officials confirmed that they sent artillery described as light weapons, some anti-tank weapons and ammunition to Syrian rebels, and Russia has long supplied arms to the Syria's government. Pillay called on U.N. member states to refer the report to the International Criminal Court, a move that might be blocked by the U.N Security council, where Russia and China have so far blocked efforts that could punish the Assad regime.","Report accuses ""the highest levels of Syria's government"" of war crimes .

"Gallman, Mississippi (CNN) -- A 42-year-old man was charged Wednesday with arson and two counts of murder in connection with the deaths of a woman and her 7-year-old son in Mississippi. Wearing a bulletproof vest, Timothy Burns appeared in Copiah County Justice Court. He said he has no lawyer, so one will be appointed to him. No bond was set. He's being held in the deaths of Atira Hughes-Smith and Jaidon Hill. The boy's stepfather, Laterry Smith, was also killed. There's some question as to whether Smith was killed in a different county, said Copiah County Sheriff Harold Jones, explaining why Burns was charged with two, rather than three, counts of murder. There's no indication the suspect had anything against the three victims, the sheriff noted, nor that he even knew them. ""We don't think there is (a relationship),"" Jones said. ""But we haven't tied that loose end up yet."" The seeming randomness of the crime makes the deaths all the more inexplicable to loved ones, as well as to neighbors in the city of Brandon they called home. As Vinson Jenkins, Hughes-Smith's cousin, said: ""We don't know why anybody would want to do any harm to them."" The family was last seen Friday in a car that was later found flipped and on fire. The Copiah County sheriff says authorities now believe that Burns was driving that car when he got in an accident, then set it ablaze. Was he alone at the time? Jones said he has ""no way of knowing that right now."" After finding the vehicle, investigators found bloody clothes belonging to the victims next to a gas station trash bin. Then their bodies were discovered in a wooded area, all shot to death, said Jones. According to CNN affiliate WAPT, Jaidon was a student at Stonebridge Elementary School in Brandon, a city of some 22,000 people about 15 miles east of Jackson. His teacher Jennifer Owen recalled his omnipresent smile, big eyelashes and how he'd ""concentrate on his work so hard that his little tongue would stick out the whole time."" The boy's great-grandfather Sidney Kersh told WAPT that he and others were heartbroken as they tried to make sense of the deaths, especially that of young Jaidon. ""He was my heart, and he was so innocent,"" Kersh said. ""I just hate for him to have to be caught up in this."" In July: Mysterious Mississippi murder stokes suspicions bred by an ugly past .

"(CNN) -- The Pentagon is set to certify that the U.S. military is prepared to accept openly gay and lesbian service members, and doing so will not harm military readiness, a U.S. official told CNN on Thursday. According to the official, who spoke on condition of not being identified, an announcement of that certification -- which is required to repeal the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy -- is likely to come Friday. Under a bill passed last year that set up a process for repealing the controversial policy, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen, along with President Barack Obama, have to sign a certification that confirms the military's ability to accept the integration of openly gay and lesbian troops. Even after certification, there will be a 60-day waiting period before the repeal is fully implemented. In a statement Thursday, one of the leading groups advocating for repeal, Servicemembers United, said it had expected Panetta to act on certification after assessing the situation since he succeeded Robert Gates as defense secretary on July 1. ""We are glad to see that just three weeks into his tenure as secretary of defense, he (Panetta) is already confident that this policy change can take place with little or no disruption to military readiness,"" said the Servicemembers United statement. Repealing the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy would end a convoluted legal battle led by human rights and gay rights groups. A gay rights group -- the Log Cabin Republicans -- had sued over the 18-year-old ban on openly gay and lesbian members serving in the U.S. armed forces. In September U.S. District Judge Virginia Phillips declared the military's ban to be unconstitutional and demanded the government immediately stop enforcing it. U.S. officials have been moving ahead with dismantling ""don't' ask, don't tell"" but had objected to having the courts force the government to officially repeal it. The case put the Obama administration in an unusual position of supporting a repeal but at the same time filing court motions to prevent it from happening faster than planned. Last week, a federal appeals court temporarily reinstated the policy, but banned the military services from investigating or discharging anyone under the rule. The 9th U.S. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in California issued the order late Friday after the Obama administration asked it to reconsider its recent order temporarily blocking the policy. On Thursday, the Log Cabin Republicans filed a legal challenge to the appellate court's temporary reinstatement of the policy, arguing that the unconstitutional statute would continue to harm the rights of gay and lesbian service members until it was fully repealed.","NEW: A group that sought the repeal praises new Defense Secretary Panetta .

"NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN)  -- The owner of the barge that spilled about 420,000 gallons of industrial fuel in the Mississippi River near New Orleans said Thursday the company was not to blame for the accident, but said it will be responsible for the cleanup. Fuel oil surrounds plants on the banks of the Mississippi River after the collision. Paul Book, vice president of operations facilities for American Commercial Lines Inc., said divers were assessing the barge as it lay against a bridge pier. ""We have reports of oil that is bubbling, coming from the bow and the stern compartments,"" he said at a news conference attended by several government officials. V-shaped booms containing skimmers have been placed below each compartment to collect and siphon off the oil, he said. The operation will be done twice.  Watch scenes from the oil spill » . ""We have high hopes that that will stop the release ... coming from the barge,"" Book said. The spill, which affected 98 miles of one of the nation's busiest waterways, resulted from a collision early Wednesday between the 61-foot barge carrying the fuel and a tanker. The two collided just north of the massive bridges connecting downtown New Orleans to communities across the river.  See a map of where the spill happened » . The tug Mel Oliver, which had been hired to push the barge upriver, had no properly licensed crew on board, Coast Guard officials said. The tugboat pilot had only an apprentice mate's license instead of the required master's license. The oil was being hauled from John W. Stone Oil Distributor in Gretna, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Jaclyn Young. Two investigations are under way -- one by the Coast Guard and the other by the National Transportation Safety Board. Book and Coast Guard Capt. Lincoln Stroh, the port captain in New Orleans, declined to respond to reporters' questions about how an unqualified pilot was hired. ""American Commercial Line has stepped forward as being responsible for the spill cleanup, not responsible for the incident,"" Stroh said. ""The investigation will clearly establish fault at a later date, but that's not a place to go right now."" Book added, ""We were not the operator of the towing vessel nor the operator of the ship."" At least 100 ships were stalled Thursday along the river from just south of New Orleans to the Gulf of Mexico, the Coast Guard said. He said a marine transportation recovery unit will prioritize the ships according to the urgency of their cargo so they can be moved either above the oil spill zone or to the east or west. Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Anastacia Visneski said, ""It's going to take us several days before we can get the river open, and it's going to take weeks before we can clean it all up. ""Right now, our priority is for the safety of the people in the parishes surrounding the river, the safety of the environment, and containing and cleaning up the spill as quickly as possible."" Containment booms have been installed to prevent the oil from spreading to environmentally sensitive areas and seeping into water-supply intake valves in Gretna, St. Bernard, Dalcour, Belle Chasse, Pointe a la Hache, Port Sulphur and Boothville-Venice, Young said. Tom MacKenzie of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said there have been few reports so far of oil-covered wildlife, but much of the shoreline hasn't yet been searched. Plaquemines Parish, which is 100 miles long, shut off its water intake valves after the spill, and was banned from using the ferry to New Orleans, except for emergencies. Parish President Billy Nungesser said he is prepared to truck water in if necessary. ""We're running low on the east bank of Plaquemines. We thought we'd run out today,"" he said late Thursday afternoon. He said the parish was still testing the level of contamination. ""We will not turn on the outtakes until we are 100 percent sure it is safe to drink,"" he said. ""The whole Mississippi has a sheen on it."" The east bank has 1,500 residents, a coal depot, an oil storage facility and other commercial businesses, he said. The west bank of Plaquemines Parish, population 22,000, was using water from Jefferson Parish, whose supply valves are north of the spill, Nungesser said. In southern Plaquemines, Boothville-Venice has ponds that can provide a 20-day water supply, he added. Book said 50,000 feet of boom has been deployed in the river cleaning, with another 50,000 still available. At least 350 people are involved in the cleanup, he said. The oil was being skimmed and sucked into vacuum trucks, then put in temporary storage tanks. He estimated that 140 barrels of oil -- not quite 6,000 gallons -- had been contained. The 590-foot Liberian-flagged tanker Tintomara was not damaged in the collision, but the crash split the barge nearly in half. A swifter-than-normal current quickly drew the slick downstream. Stroh said the oil, widely used as marine fuel, is heavier than diesel but lighter than crude. The spill is much smaller than the ones that followed Hurricane Katrina in 2005, when the Coast Guard estimated that more than 7 million gallons of oil were dumped into the Mississippi and nearby waterways. The Mississippi is the major shipping route from the Midwest to the Gulf of Mexico, and New Orleans is among the largest U.S. ports.","Barge company not to blame in spill, firm's vice president says .

"(CNN) -- What would you do if you had to wait 90 minutes for your pizza to be delivered? Stare out the window with sad, hungry eyes? Call in screaming to cancel your order? Take to Twitter to vent your #waitingforever fury? Or take matters into your hands and launch your own pizza delivery store? Ritesh Doshi, 32, did the latter. Back in 2011, Doshi, an investment banker whose career had taken him to London, New York and Amman, returned to his native country Kenya to visit his parents. One night, he and his family decided to order out. ""We had to wait for about 90 minutes for the pizza to be delivered,"" remembers Doshi. ""We then ordered again another night from another place and it took 75 minutes,"" he adds. ""You just couldn't get a decent pizza in a reasonable amount of time. So I thought, you know what, anywhere in the world that I've lived and worked you can get a pizza in 35 minutes -- so why not in Nairobi?"" Read this: Street vendor builds biz empire . That was it. Soon after, Doshi left his career in banking and set his sights on the pizza industry. After talking to several people, he decided to bring to Nairobi the concept of Naked Pizza, an international franchise thriving on the usage of fresh ingredients. ""If you look at the dictionary definition of naked, natural is one of the definitions that come up,"" says Doshi. ""We have no weird chemicals added to our food, we don't add sugar to any of our products,"" he adds. ""Our meats are all hormone free -- everything that we use is natural."" Naked Pizza was founded in the U.S. in 2006. Outside America, there are five stores in Dubai. Kenya's first outlet was launched about a year ago and since then sales have been growing every month. ""The response from the customers has been fantastic,"" says Doshi. ""We really saw an opportunity to create a healthier product and get it to people quickly."" Tasty success . Inside the Naked Pizza store in Westlands, an affluent Nairobi neighborhood, a group of green-shirted young men line up behind the counter to cut vegetables, shred cheese and prepare the sauce for the day. On slow days, Doshi says, there are between 100 and 150 orders. At busier times, the figure rises to 350-400. The company's menu includes nine options, but Doshi says the most popular ones are the superbiotic -- a mouthful of artichoke, baby spinach, mixed pepper, mushroom, garlic, red onion and coriander -- and the omnivore, a pizza comprised of beef pepperoni, beef hamburger, turkey ham, mixed pepper, mushroom and black olives. Read this: Africa's techies board the StartupBus . Yet, tracing some of these ingredients has not always been an easy task. ""Things like artichokes and jalapenos were hard to source,"" says Doshi. He explains that building a supply chain and navigating Kenya's bureaucratic machine have both been very challenging. ""We need licenses for literally everything,"" he says. ""Our signs, our bikes, for any kind of branding we do and a whole host of other things."" Love of pizza . Despite the challenges, however, the young entrepreneur is determined to ""get Nairobi naked."" He is optimistic about the venture's future, saying that he's already developing a second store and is actively looking for more retail estate. At the heart of this is the brand's appeal to people of all incomes from both the local and expat community in Nairobi. ""The love of pizza is an international thing and we've been able to really transcend economic boundaries, racial boundaries and age boundaries,"" says Doshi. ""There is a great story -- an old lady who had never tried pizza before was visiting her daughter from outside Nairobi; her daughter is a regular customer and this was the first time she tried pizza."" Read this: MyMusic dances to the mobile beat . Doshi says the growing breed of young Kenyan returnees has also been one of the main drivers of Naked Pizza's success. ""There is a large, increasing number of Kenyans coming home,"" he says. ""People who studied and lived all over the world -- a lot of them are coming back and actually a large part of our customers is made up of returning Kenyans."" A repat himself, Doshi says he's not regretted quitting his promising career in investment banking to set up a business in Nairobi, a rising international city and economic market. ""It's great to be here,"" he says. ""It's great to be part of the growth story at home -- for a long time I've reading about it from away, so it was great to participate in that."" Looking ahead, Doshi is aiming to grow the brand while changing people's eating habits in the process. ""We think we can do that by delivering a great product, with great customer service,"" he says. As for the waiting time? ""If you're ordering in the store, you should have that in under 10 minutes,"" says Doshi. ""If it goes out for delivery, you should have that within about 35 minutes -- every single time.""","Ritesh Doshi is an investment banker turned pizza maker in Nairobi, Kenya .

"(CNN) -- A computer-science detective story is playing out on the Internet as security experts try to hunt down a worm called Conficker C and prevent it from damaging millions of computers on April Fool's Day. This piece of computer code tells the worm to activate on April 1, 2009, researchers at CA found. The anti-worm researchers have banded together in a group they call the Conficker Cabal. Members are searching for the malicious software program's author and for ways to do damage control if he or she can't be stopped. They're motivated in part by a $250,000 bounty from Microsoft and also by what seems to be a sort of Dick Tracy ethic. ""We love catching bad guys,"" said Alvin Estevez, CEO of Enigma Software Group, which is one of many companies trying to crack Conficker. ""We're like former hackers who like to catch other hackers. To us, we get almost a feather in our cap to be able to knock out that worm. We slap each other five when we're killing those infections."" The malicious program already is thought to have infected between 5 million and 10 million computers. Those infections haven't spawned many symptoms, but on April 1 a master computer is scheduled to gain control of these zombie machines, said Don DeBolt, director of threat research for CA, a New York-based IT and software company. What happens on April Fool's Day is anyone's guess. The program could delete all of the files on a person's computer, use zombie PCs -- those controlled by a master --  to overwhelm and shut down Web sites or monitor a person's keyboard strokes to collect private information like passwords or bank account information, experts said. More likely, though, said DeBolt, the virus may try to get computer users to buy fake software or spend money on other phony products. Experts said computer hackers largely have moved away from showboating and causing random trouble. They now usually try to make money off their viral programs. DeBolt said Conficker C imbeds itself deep in the computer where it is difficult to track. The program, for instance, stops Windows from conducting automatic updates that could prevent the malware from causing damage. The program's code is also written to evolve over time and its author appears to be making updates to thwart some of the Conficker Cabal's attempts to neuter the worm. ""It is very much a cat and mouse game,"" DeBolt said. It's unclear who wrote the program, but members of the Cabal are looking for clues. First, they know that some recent malware programs have come from Eastern European countries outside the jurisdiction of the European Union, said Patrick Morganelli, senior vice president of technology for Enigma Software. Worm program authors often hide in those countries to stay out of sight from law enforcement, he said. In a way, the Conficker Cabal is also looking for the program author's fingerprints. DeBolt said security researchers are looking through old malware programs to see if their programming styles are similar to that of Conficker C. The prospects for catching the program's author are not good, Morganelli said. ""Unless they open their mouth, they'll never be found,"" he said. So, the most effective counter-assault simply may be damage control. One quick way to see if your computer has been infected is to see if you have gotten automatic updates from Windows in March. If so, your computer likely is fine, DeBolt said. Microsoft released a statement saying the company ""is actively working with the industry to mitigate the spread of the worm."" Users who haven't gotten the latest Windows updates should go to http://safety.live.com if they fear they're infected, the company's statement says. DeBolt said people who use other antivirus software should check to make sure they've received the latest updates, which also could have been disabled by Conficker C. The first version of Conficker -- strain A -- was released in late 2008. That version used 250 Web addresses -- generated daily by the system -- as the means of communication between the master computer and its zombies. The end goal of the first line was to sell computer users fake antivirus software, said Morganelli. Computer security experts largely patched that problem by working with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers to disable or buy the problematic URLs, he said. That process-of-elimination approach isn't likely to be effective with Conficker strain C, Morganelli said. The new version will generate 50,000 URLs per day instead of just 250 when it becomes active, DeBolt said. The first iteration of Conficker is thought to have grown out of a free function for security programs created by Dr. Ronald Rivest, a computer science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""Any technology can be used for good or evil, and this is just an example of that,"" Rivest said. Many viruses have taken pieces of benevolent programs and used them for ill. But overall the ""open source"" environment online promotes computer security far more than it enables hackers, DeBolt said. ""I don't blame the open-source community at all"" for virus attacks, he said. CA said it recently found a piece of code in Conficker C that says the worm will become active on April 1. Previous versions of the malicious software launched on specific dates noted in the program code, so the April Fool's Day launch date is not likely to be a trick, DeBolt said. ""The best minds in the industry are working on this to protect customers,"" he said. ""We're trying to reduce the impact of the April 1 date as best we can. But we know ... this malware will continue to evolve.""","The Conficker C computer worm is expected to activate on April Fool's Day .

"Editor's note: Fareed Zakaria is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" on CNN at 1 and 5 p.m. ET Sundays, and on CNN International 0900, 1600 Buenos Aires l 1300, 2000 London l 2000, 0300 (Mon) HK . Fareed Zakaria says ""no one bought"" Khamenei's ""divine assessment"" of the official election result. (CNN) -- The decisive margin of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's victory in the June 12 election stunned many observers and angered his opponents' supporters, who in the ensuing days took to the streets in protest by the hundreds of thousands. Some experts have called the effect unprecedented: Several powerful figures have openly supported the top challenger, Mir Hossein Moussavi, even as the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has endorsed the official results favoring Ahmadinejad. In the meantime, using online social networking sites such as Twitter, Iranians have been able to get around the government's efforts to restrict media coverage, and the outcry against the election result has intensified. At Friday prayers in Tehran, Khamenei told a partisan audience the ""ruling elites"" would be ""held accountable for all violence and blood and rioting."" CNN spoke with Fareed Zakaria about the significance of the recent protests and the leadership's response: . CNN: As you've seen the situation in Iran develop over the last week, what are your thoughts? Fareed Zakaria: One of the first things that strikes me is we are watching the fall of Islamic theocracy. CNN: Do you mean you think the regime will fall? Zakaria: No, I don't mean the Iranian regime will fall soon. It may -- I certainly hope it will -- but repressive regimes can stick around for a long time. I mean that this is the end of the ideology that lay at the basis of the Iranian regime. The regime's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, laid out his special interpretation of political Islam in a series of lectures in 1970. In this interpretation of Shia Islam, Islamic jurists had divinely ordained powers to rule as guardians of the society, supreme arbiters not only on matters of morality but politics as well. When Khomeini established the Islamic Republic of Iran, this idea was at its heart. Last week, that ideology suffered a fatal wound. CNN: How so? Zakaria: When the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, declared the election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a ""divine assessment,"" he was indicating it was divinely sanctioned. But no one bought it. He was forced to accept the need for an inquiry into the election. The Guardian Council, Iran's supreme constitutional body, met with the candidates and promised to investigate and perhaps recount some votes. Khamenei has subsequently hardened his position but that is now irrelevant. Something very important has been laid bare in Iran today --- legitimacy does not flow from divine authority but from popular support. CNN: There have been protests in Iran before. What makes this different? Zakaria: In the past the protests were always the street against the state, and the clerics all sided with the state. When the reformist president, Mohammed Khatami, was in power, he entertained the possibility of siding with the street, but eventually stuck with the establishment. The street and state are at odds again but this time the clerics are divided. Khatami has openly sided with the challenger, Mir Hossein Moussavi, as has the reformist Grand Ayatollah Montazeri. So has Ali Larijani, the speaker of the parliament and a man with strong family connections to the highest levels of the religious hierarchy. Behind the scenes, the former president, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, now head of the Assembly of Experts, another important constitutional body, is waging a campaign against Ahmadinejad and even the supreme leader himself. If senior clerics dispute Khamenei's divine assessment and argue that the Guardian Council is wrong, it is a death blow to the basic premise behind the Islamic Republic of Iran. It is as if a senior Soviet leader had said in 1980 that Karl Marx was not the right guide to economic policy. CNN: What should the United States do? Zakaria: I would say continue what we have been doing. By reaching out to Iran, publicly and repeatedly, President Obama has made it extremely difficult for the Iranian regime to claim that they are battling an aggressive America bent on attacking Iran. In his inaugural address, his New Year greetings, and his Cairo speech, there is a consistent effort to convey respect and friendship for Iranians. That is why Khamenei reacted so angrily to the New Year greeting. It undermined the image of the Great Satan that he routinely paints in his sermons. In his Friday sermon, Khamenei said that the United States, Israel, and especially the United Kingdom were behind the street protests, an accusation that will surely sound ridiculous to most Iranians. The fact that Obama has been cautious in his reaction makes it all the harder for Khamenei and Ahmadinejad to wrap themselves in a nationalist flag. CNN: But shouldn't the U.S. be more vocal in support for the Iranian protesters? Zakaria: I think a good historic analogy is President George H.W. Bush's cautious response to the cracks in the Soviet empire in 1989. Then, many neo-conservatives were livid with Bush for not loudly supporting those trying to topple the communist regimes in Eastern Europe. But Bush's concern was that the situation was fragile. Those regimes could easily crack down on the protestors and the Soviet Union could send in tanks. Handing the communists reasons to react forcefully would help no one, least of all the protesters. Bush's basic approach was correct and has been vindicated by history. CNN: Finally, do you think the regime will survive? Zakaria: As I said before, repressive regimes can last a long time, and this regime can definitely endure if they are willing to use force, impose a strict crackdown on protests, and arrest the leaders of the opposition. Only time will tell, so we will have see what develops.","""We are watching the fall of Islamic theocracy"" in Iran, Fareed Zakaria tells CNN .

"Washington (CNN) -- A Georgetown University student was charged on Friday with possessing ricin after admitting he made the poison in his campus dorm room, a court document showed. Daniel Harry Milzman, 19, appeared in federal court, where a judge ordered him held pending a hearing next week. Milzman was arrested by the FBI and charged with possessing a biological toxin, according to an FBI affidavit. That submission said he learned how to make ricin on his iPhone and then bought ingredients at retail stores. Ricin is a deadly toxin derived from castor beans that has no known antidote. On Monday, Milzman allegedly showed a bag that he claimed to contain ricin to his dorm adviser, who notified school authorities. They in turn called police, the filing states. Preliminary lab tests confirmed the substance was ricin, it said. Milzman allegedly produced the substance a month earlier in his room, placed it in plastic bags sealed with hockey tape and stored it in his room, according to the document. The amount produced possibly could have been enough to kill someone had it been inhaled or injected, the affidavit said. Milzman is due back in court on Tuesday . His attorney, Danny Onorato, declined comment when contacted by CNN on Friday evening. Georgetown said in a statement on Wednesday that tests on McCarthy Hall for the presence of biological agents were negative, and there had been no reports of anyone being exposed to ricin. The university on Friday said the undergraduate student will not be permitted to return to campus at this time. ""The possession or manufacturing of illegal substances are issues we take very seriously and are violations of the university's student code of conduct,"" said media relations director Rachel Pugh in a statement.

"(CNN) -- The body of a 9-year-old girl believed to have been swept into a culvert during a flash flood in west-central Mississippi was recovered Monday, an official told CNN. Yazoo County Emergency Management Director Joey Ward said the girl's body was identified by her mother. The girl's death came as rain pounded parts of the U.S. Southeast -- storms that flooded areas in Mississippi overnight and threatened more of the same in parts of Alabama, Georgia and Florida on Monday. The girl's mother reported that floodwater had pulled the girl into a channel under a road around 8 p.m. CT Sunday in Yazoo City, which received 4 to 5 inches of rain in a short period, Ward said. Rescuers searched the area and several other rain-swollen drainage ditches, CNN affiliate WJTV reported. A 20-person search-and-rescue team from central Mississippi assisted. Elsewhere, a woman's body was recovered Monday in Georgia after her car was swept away in a rain-swollen creek in Gwinnett County, Lt. Colin Rhoden of the Gwinnett County Fire Department told CNN. Her identity has not been released. Flash flood watches or warnings were in effect Monday morning for parts of southeastern Mississippi, much of Alabama, a large portion of Georgia and the northwestern Florida panhandle. In North Carolina, a tornado touched down in the eastern part of the state, Chief Fred Clingenpeel of the Belhaven Police Department told CNN. He said the tornado struck a very rural area between the towns of Belhaven and Pantego, North Carolina. There were no reports of any deaths. There are possible injuries, but nothing severe at this time, Clingenpeel said. He added that houses were damaged and trees snapped when the tornado hit around 4:30 p.m. ET on Monday.

"(CNN) -- The International Criminal Court on Thursday postponed the beginning of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's trial on charges of crimes against humanity by three months to February 5, accepting a defense request for more preparation time. The trial at the Netherlands-based ICC had been scheduled to begin on November 12. The prosecution agreed that certain issues raised by the defense merited further investigation, the court said. Kenyatta was charged last year with five counts of crimes against humanity, stemming from violence that plagued a disputed 2007 Kenyan presidential election, in which then-incumbent President Mwai Kibaki was declared the winner. More than 1,000 people died and hundreds of thousands were displaced when ethnic groups loyal to leading candidates in the December 2007 election torched homes and hacked rivals to death. The charges accuse Kenyatta, who backed Kibaki in the election, of funding a local militia that conducted reprisal attacks. Kibaki continued to serve as President until this year. Kenyatta, the son of Kenya's founding leader, was elected in March and took office in April. The ICC has also accused Deputy President William Ruto of orchestrating attacks. A third suspect, radio personality Joshua arap Sang, is being tried alongside Ruto on similar charges; the trial of these two began in September. Kenyatta and Ruto have denied accusations that they coordinated violence among their respective ethnic groups after the disputed election. African Union accuses ICC of bias, seeks delay of cases against sitting leaders . The court -- set up in 2002 to try claims of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes -- has ordered Kenyatta to attend opening and closing statements, but has excused him from being at the trial otherwise. The Kenyan parliament voted in September to withdraw from the court's jurisdiction after repeatedly calling on it to drop the cases. But a withdrawal would take a while to implement because it involves steps such as a formal notification to the United Nations, and the ICC said the trials would proceed. Kenyatta has said he and Ruto would cooperate with the court to clear their names. Kenya's previous administration reneged on a deal to set up a special tribunal to try suspects in the post-election violence, prompting the international court to step in. Kenya is the second African nation after Sudan to have a sitting president facing charges at the International Criminal Court. Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has largely shunned an ICC warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes. CNNs Pierre Meilhan, Jason Hanna and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.","Trial of Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta had been scheduled to start on November 12 .
