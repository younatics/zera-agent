"By . Daniel Mills . A Koala was found outside a police station at Victoria with $50 in its mouth . A dead koala with a $50 note stuffed inside its mouth has turned up on the doorstep of a Victorian police station, baffling the officers inside. Police from Heywood station, in the state's south west, stumbled upon the dead koala at the entrance to the station at about 10pm on Saturday without any clue of how it got to be there. A police spokesperson said an officer heard the 'ruffling noise' of the note and went outside to check on what it was, before noticing the koala with money in its mouth. They said the koala was found dead on discovery, and it appeared it was hit by a car before being taken to the police station. The Heywood Police station where the koala was left . 'It was not known how it was killed or why it was left there. At this stage, we are not treating it as suspicious,' the spokesperson said. There was also no CCTV footage of the incident, and police could not explain why there was $50 lodged inside its mouth. He said there seemed no plausible way the koala could have picked the note up on its own, 'unless eucalyptus leaves were being made out of $50 notes now.' 'We don't know if this is a message someone wanted to send to police.'","The koala was found dead on Saturday night at Heywood, Victoria .

"By . Laura Silver for MailOnline . It’s a well-known fact that a dog is a man’s best friend, and one baby girl has got a pretty close bond with her canine companion too. Two-year-old Weiwei plays with her huge pet Tibetan mastiff like he’s a big cuddly toy and despite his daunting appearance, he’s happy to go along with it. Called Simba after the star of the Lion King, the huge dog simply lolls on the floor blissfully while the little girl crawls around in his golden mane, cooing gleefully as this cute video shows. Tibetan mastiffs were originally bred as guard dogs by nomads who wanted to protect their camps in Central Asia, but now they've become a status symbol in China. One man recently paid a whopping £1.2 million for one of the golden-haired beasts - who really must have had a mane of gold to warrant that sum. The puppy went under the hammer at a luxury pet fair in Hangzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang earlier this year and is believed to be the most anyone has ever paid for a pet dog. What's clear here is that this little girl is in the lap of luxury as she plays in her pet's gorgeous fur coat. Don't mind me! Baby Weiwei clambers over Simba while the big dog snoozes, nonplussed by the little girl .","Baby girl treats her giant pet dog like a big cute teddy bear .

"By . Richard Arrowsmith for MailOnline . Despite facing arguably the strongest team in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying game, England can take statistical respite from the fact they are playing Switzerland on a Monday. It may be the hardest day of the week for many of us to wake up, but England have an impressive win percentage of 67.3 per cent from games played on a Monday. The Three Lions have only played nine Monday games since 1966, but prior to that they were a regular occurrence. Happy Mondays: England have won 37 of 55 games (67.3%) they have played on a Monday . Let it begin: England players train in Basle ahead of their opening Euro 2016 qualifier against Switzerland . Staying power: Jack Wilshere is one of only two players who started the last game against the Swiss in 2011 . Between 1880 and 1927, England played Wales alone 33 times on a Monday, which may have influenced statistics that sees them having won 37 of 55 games played while drawing 11 and losing seven. England's game on Monday is a consequence of UEFA spreading out qualification matches as part of their new 'Week of Football' concept, with games taking place from Thursday to Tuesday. That means that 33 per cent of games now take place at weekends as opposed to just 10 per ent during 2012 qualifying. The final set of fixtures in each group, scheduled for October 2015 - will still kick-off simultaneously. Meanwhile, here are all the other facts and figures on games between Switzerland and England ahead of a meeting that will help determine where we finish in our group... Sick note: England will be without Daniel Sturridge after the striker picked up a knock in training . Spot on: Wayne Rooney celebrates after scoring a penalty in the international friendly against Norway . 63.6% - England’s win percentage against Switzerland. They have won 14 of their 22 contests, drawing five and losing just three. They are also unbeaten in their last eight games against the Swiss. 1 - Good news for Roy Hodgson — England have lost just one of their last 13 international matches away from home. 192 - Some bad news for Hodgson. In 192 minutes of football, England have only managed three shots on target with their one goal coming from the penalty spot. 3 - Wayne Rooney looks a good bet to score at any time. The England captain has scored in each of his three appearances against Switzerland. 2 - Only two players have survived from England’s last game against the Swiss — Joe Hart and Jack Wilshere both started that match at Wembley in 2011. 17 - England like playing in Basel. They have won four out of five games in the city and scored 17 goals at an average of 3.4 per game. That includes an 8-1 victory in 1963. 9 - Switzerland have not lost at home for nine matches. Their last defeat on home soil came against Romania in May 2012. Andrew Magee .","England face Switzerland in opening Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday .

"By . MailOnline Reporter . The upstate New York woman accused of kidnapping and sexually abusing two Amish girls with her boyfriend studied the psychology of rape in college — and even wrote a senior thesis on the subject. In her final year at Mercyhurst College, Nicole Vaisey researched whether watching pornography changed perceptions about rape, Syracuse.com reported. Vaisey, who majored in psychology, hypothesized in 2011 that the research participants with more exposure to the images were more likely to blame the victim. She received a $1,500 Psi Chi research grant to help her with the research and eventually graduated with honors, according to Syracuse.com. Vaisey, 25, and boyfriend Stephen Howells Jr., 39, are being held without bail and have a preliminary court appearance scheduled for Thursday. Howells, a registered nurse at . Claxton-Hepburn Medical Center, and Vaisey, a former dog groomer, were . arrested on Friday after voluntarily going to the sheriff's office for . an interview. Scroll down for video . Arrests: Stephen Howells and Nicole Vaisey, both pictured, can expect more charges to be filed against them, the district attorney said. The couple allegedly snatched two Amish girls and sexually abused them . They . were charged with kidnapping with the intent to physically or sexually . abuse the seven-year-old and 12-year-old sisters, who were snatched from . their family's roadside vegetable stand in Oswegatchie on Wednesday . evening. The . father of the girls has said he feels sorry for the couple. The . parents of the girls, aged seven and 12, spoke to the Johnson . Newspapers at their home in Oswegathcie on Sunday, two days after Howells and Vaisey were charged with kidnapping with . the intent to physically or sexually abuse the girls. 'It's . sad,' said the 44-year-old father, who is not being identified to . protect his daughters. 'They must have ruined their whole life.' The . Amish couple, who have 14 children, did not express any anger toward . the suspects, while the girls' 19-year-old sister said her siblings were . not speaking much about their ordeal. Their mother said she is grateful to have her girls back home, but daily life has not yet returned to normal. 'We feel relieved we have them,' the mother said. 'It's still not like it was.' They . spoke out as St Lawyrence County District Attorney Mary Rain revealed . that more charges are expected to be brought against Howells and Vaisey. Authorities collected computer hard drives and other potential evidence from their home on Sunday. Search: On Sunday, investigators continued to collect evidence from their home in Hermon, New York . Home: Three children lived at the upstate New York home with the couple, according to neighbors . Authorities say the couple had prowled . for easy targets and sexually abused the girls before letting them go . after about 24 hours. 'I 100 per cent expect more charges,' Rain told The Associated Press in a telephone interview on Sunday. She . said the new charges, which she would not detail, could come after she . meets with police investigators Monday or at the hearing Thursday. It's also possible prosecutors would have to wait for results from forensic tests. The . sisters were abducted on Wednesday from a farm stand in front of the . family's home in Oswegatchie, near the Canadian border. They were set . free by their captors about 24 hours later and turned up safe at the . door of a house 15 miles from where they were taken. 'Kidnappers': Vaisey, 25 (left), and 39-year-old Howells were arrested on Friday and remain in jail . There was no answer on Sunday at the St. Lawrence County Conflict Defender's Office, which is representing Howells. The . couple were busted after voluntarily coming in for an interview the St. Lawrence County Sheriff’s Office. Rain would not say if the couple . admitted to the crime, but they were arrested around 8:30 p.m. at the . end of questioning. Vaisey's . lawyer, Bradford Riendeau told The New York Times that she was in an . abusive and submissive relationship with Howells. He said she made a . 'voluntary statement' to investigators after her arrest and was . obtaining an order of protection against him. 'She appears to have been the slave and he was the master,' Riendeau told the newspaper. Rain said Vaisey is just as culpable as Howells. Denials: Vaisey, pictured on Friday as she is escorted by a deputy from the St. Lawrence County Sheriff's Department, claimed that she was in an abusive and submissive relationship with Howells . A neighbor said they were boyfriend and girlfriend and that three other children lived in the house. On his Facebook page, Howells appears to be a father to three children. It's uncertain whether his girlfriend, Vaisey, is the mother. St. Lawrence County Sheriff Kevin Wells said the girls were able to provide details to investigators about their time in captivity. The girls are not being identified as they are victims of sexual abuse. The kidnappings touched off a massive search in the family's remote farming community. Searchers scoured the community of about 4,000 people but were hampered by a lack of photos of the girls. Somber: DA Mary Rain, left, said she expected more charges to be filed against the couple. She is pictured with county Sheriff Kevin M. Wells, who has noted just how much the incident has shaken the community . The Amish typically avoid modern . technology, and the family had to work with an artist who spoke their . language, a German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch, to produce a . sketch of the older girl. The girls 'seem to be healthy' after being reunited with family, officials said. Patricia Ritchie, the state senator representing the region, said many families in the area are now reluctant to let their children play outdoors unattended. Ritchie said the Amish are responding in a way that may forever change a familiar feature of the local landscape: Some are taking down their roadside stands. 'This has sent a shockwave through their community,' she said. The couple could face 25 years to life in prison if convicted.","Stephen Howells, 39, and Nicole Vaisey, 25, were arrested for 'snatching the sisters, aged seven and 12, on Wednesday'

"By . Press Association Reporter . New Huddersfield manager Chris Powell wants football's governing bodies to do more to create opportunities for black coaches. The former Charlton boss is currently the only black manger in the top four divisions after replacing Mark Robins at the Terriers helm on Wednesday. In recent seasons Chris Hughton, Paul Ince, Chris Kiwomya, Keith Curle and Terry Connor have all managed in the Football League but none of them are currently a number one. Time for change: Ex-Charlton boss Powell thinks there should be more opportunities for black coaches . Out of work: Paul Ince (left) and Chris Hughton (right) are two black coaches currently out of work . And while Powell believes that any appointments made by clubs should be on merit, he is eager to see more black coaches given the chance to thrive in management. 'It doesn't look great, but all you can do is get your badges and become as qualified as you can,' he told the Sunday Mirror. 'I believe that all the governing bodies should get together to reach agreement about how to move forward. People like myself, Chris Hughton, Chris Kiwomya and Paul Ince, we've all proven that we can manage. We are all role models. 'Only one of us is working in the professional game at the moment. My appointment here, and all our track records, show that we can take positions of responsibility and be successful. 'Chris was successful at Norwich, Birmingham and Newcastle. I was also PFA chairman for five years, so I can lead people. 'I can't answer for people who run football clubs. You can only apply for jobs, then do them to the best of your ability. You have to be good at your job. Rooney rule: Dan Rooney, owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers, has a long-standing history of giving African American's a chance to manage in the NFL, and therefore brought about the Rooney rule . 'But the FA and Premier League and other bodies should try and agree to implement measures that will help.' In American football, the Rooney rule requires teams to interview 'minority' candidates for all head coaching positions and Powell believes it is vital black coaches are given more interview opportunities. 'It ensures that black and minority ethnic coaches are getting interviewed,' he said. 'But it's not a question of whether I want it. It's a question of whether all football's governing bodies can all agree to it. 'It's about giving people a chance to get interviews in the first place but then it's still up to you to prove you are the right person.' He added: 'You always have to prove you are the best. If people reject you for whatever reasons it should never dissuade you from keeping on trying. 'People like Paul Ince, Chris Hughton and Chris Kiwomya are good managers, who happen to be black. I believe football is trying to move forward on this.' VIDEO Scroll down for Felix Magath's view on Chris Hughton sacking .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . Whether you listen in on a teenager or tune into the Kardashians, there's no denying that 'uptalking' has well and truly cemented itself in mainstream English speech. But while TV shows such as Neighbours and Clueless have been blamed for the popularity of the speaking style, one scientist claims that the people to blame are, in fact, the Vikings. Uptalking is a speech trait that involves raising the voice's pitch at the end of a sentence, even if it's not a question. Daniel Hirst, professor of linguistics believes uptalk spread from the west coast of Scotland and Northumbria, the two areas plundered the worst by the Vikings, to other cities in the north . Stephen Fry described uptalk as the ‘language of the Sunny Delight generation’ and said he ‘barely knows anyone under 20 who doesn’t use it’. However, far from being a new development, uptalk has in fact been part of many British dialects for centuries, according to a report by Oliver Moody in The Times. For instance, Liverpudlian, Geordie and Belfast accents often use a rising intonation at the end of their statements. Daniel Hirst, professor of linguistics at the Aix-Marseille University in France, claims there is a strong link between the areas plundered by the Vikings in the 9th Century, and the regions that use uptalk. While TV shows such as Neighbours (pictured) and Clueless have been thought to contribute to the trend of uptalk, scientists claim the people to blame are the Vikings . 'I have observed that the original distribution of these populations,' he said in a recent report. 'They were areas of intense raiding and settlement by Norwegian Vikings in the early 9th century. 'Recent genetic evidence suggests in fact that strong connections between these populations largely antedates the Viking raids.' For instance, West Norwegian is one of the last languages in the world to keep rising intonation in statements. Professor Hirst believes this trend spread from the west coast of Scotland and Northumbria to other cities in the North. These were the two areas plundered the worst by the Vikings. Daniel Hirst, professor of linguistics at the Aix-Marseille University in France, claims there is a strong link between the areas plundered by the Viking in the 9th century, and the regions that use uptalk . There is, however, he says, a key difference between how the characters in Neighbours uses uptalk and its use in regional dialects. 'When a man from Belfast tells you, ""I'm going to smash your face in"" and his voice rises, he's being assertive,' Professor Hirst told the Times. 'But Australian uptalk is the opposite.' There has been a backlash against the trend of uptalk when it isn't part of a regional dialect, according to recent reports. A recent survey of 700 company bosses by publisher Pearson found upspeak could kill off the possibility of a promotion or a pay rise. An overwhelming majority of bosses – 71 per cent – said it was a ‘particularly annoying trait’, while 85 per cent witheringly added that it is a ‘clear indicator of a person’s insecurity or emotional weakness’. More than half said it could damage an employee’s professional credibility by revealing an inability or reluctance to speak their mind. Uptalk is often associated with  Clueless lead character Cher Horowitz (pictured) First men became enamoured with grooming regimes, but now it seems the metrosexual man has started talking in a more feminine way too. A new study has revealed that modern men are starting to ‘uptalk’ by rising in pitch at the ends of sentences. Scientists came across the finding when they were trying to investigate the difference between uptalkers making a statement and asking a question. Uptalkers are stereotypically parodied as insecure, shallow and not very clever females. However, scientists from the University of California, San Diego, who recorded the voices of 24 young southern Californians, found that the 12 men they studied also uptalked and the speakers came from different backgrounds - not just mansions in Beverley Hills. They were given several speech tasks, such as providing directions from a map, or recounting what happened after watching a clip from a popular sitcom. ‘We found use of uptalk in all of our speakers, despite their diverse backgrounds in socio-economic status, ethnicity, bilingualism and gender,’ study leader Dr Amanda Ritchart, a linguist at the university said.","Uptalk is the widespread habit of raising pitch at the end of a sentence .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . An eerie video claiming to show an 'alien' figure walking on the moon went viral earlier this week. Theories ranged from shadows cast by a nearby boulder to an ancient alien statue placed on the lunar surface. Now Nasa has announced the figure is simply 'dust, an eyelash [or] scratch on the negative' of the film that took the image. Scroll down for videos . What is this mystery figure on the moon? The image was spotted on the Google Moon site by web user Jasenko. Nasa announced the shape is simply 'dust, an eyelash [or] scratch on the negative' of the film that took the image . Seeing familiar things in random objects is nothing new. The phenomenon is called . Pareidolia is the psychological response to seeing faces and other . significant and everyday items in random stimulus. It is a form of apophenia, which is when people see patterns or connections in random, unconnected data. Human . eyes can spot faces within their environment and it helps them . recognise friends in a crowd, work out how fast a car is travelling, and . see patterns. Scientists . claim we also tend to use this ability to 'enrich our imagination' and . recognise meaningful shapes, even when they're not there. The video, showing the images, was posted by YouTube user Wowforreel and it has already been viewed more than two million times in less than a month. Noah Petro, a deputy project scientist for the Lunar Renaissance Orbiter (LROC) mission that is currently orbiting the moon, told Pix11 that the image was taken by either the Apollo 15 or 17 manned missions to the moon in 1971 and 1972 respectively. He points out that a current LROC doesn't show any lunar feature that could cause that pattern on the ground. 'My best guess, is that something (dust, an eyelash, scratch on the negative) was on the film,' Dr Petro told Pix11. 'Remember, this was in the pre-digital days when all sorts of nasty things could happen to film.' The popularity of the video can be explained by a psychological phenomenon called Pareidolia, which is the brain's response to seeing faces and other significant objects in random stimulus. Wowforreel said he started investigating the shadow, which can also be seen on Google Moon at 27°34’26.35″N 19°36’4.75″W, after receiving an online tip from another web user named Jasenko. ‘An irregularly shaped dark spot he noticed on Google Moon looks like it could be a cast shadow from a massive standing object, or figure,’ Wowforreeel told UFO Sighting Daily. ‘At first I thought maybe it was something drawn into the picture but after going to Google Moon, whatever it is or isn't…uh, is there.’ 'An irregularly shaped dark spot he noticed on Google Moon looks like it could be a cast shadow from a massive standing object, or figure,' Wowforreeel told UFO Sighting Daily . Tom Rose, a paranormal explainer, wrote in the Examiner the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to what the ancient statue, 'The Colossus of Rhodes', is thought to have looked like before it was felled a massive earthquake in 226 BC. This isn’t the first time that Wowforreel has spotted strange objects after ploughing through Google’s moon series. In January, the user highlighted controversial images which showed what some people believed could be a secret alien base or spaceship on the moon. The triangular anomaly, spotted on Google's map of the moon, had rows of seven light-like dots along its edge. Tom Rose, a paranormal explainer, wrote in the Examiner that the figure bears an uncanny resemblance to what the ancient statue, 'The Colossus of Rhodes', is thought to have looked like before it was felled a massive earthquake in 226 BC . 'Is it just a weird looking crater? or is it something else?,' he asked. 'It is really there, not faked and I have no clue what it is. I found nothing else like it in any of the other craters.' According to website Tech and Gadget News: . 'The gigantic shape actually looks like the leading edge of an immense, . triangular space ship, similar to, so far, super secret stealth . aircraft technology, but is much larger than any airplane ever built on . Earth. 'The regularly spaced, circular . promontory shapes which make up the seven points on the perfectly formed . triangle wedge seem to be intelligently designed. This triangular anomaly with rows of seven light-like dots along its edge has been tracked down on the Google Moon viewer . The two-sided, triangular feature on the lunar surface, was uncovered paranormal researcher WowForReeel. It can be found on the Google Moon viewer at coordinates 22042'38.46N and 142034'44.52E . Google Moon works in a similar way to Google Earth. It was launched in 2009 on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing. The landing site of each of the Apollo . missions is shown on the satellite image, providing more information on . each mission as the user zooms in. The first version of Google Moon only included low-resolution satellite imagery of the entire moon, and when zoomed in too close, a Swiss cheese pattern would appear. 'To date, no other feature has ever been discovered which matches this shape on the moon, or any other planet observed by satellite or exploratory rover. 'The anomaly is so huge, it's possible it is some sort of moon base used as a facility for storing and launching alien UFO spacecraft.' The same YouTube user also claims to have found a similar mystery structure on Earth, nestled under the ice in Antarctica. 'It is also a triangular shape, measuring 125 by 90mtres. 'It is unique in the area,' he said. Tricks of light in space photography have led to a number of excited reports about alien life in our solar system. In November, paranormal researchers found what they believed to be evidence of a  fossilised iguana on the surface of Mars. The mysterious object was spotted by UFO Sightings Daily who uncovered the photograph in Nasa’s archives. Earlier this week a 'human face' was pointed out by the German Aerospace Centre's youth portal, DLR_next, on the Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko . ‘This is not the first animal found on Mars, actually there have been about 10-15 to date,’ Mr Warring told news site agoracosmopolitan.com. ‘I even found a rock that moved four times in four photos...then vanished on the fifth.’ More recently, a 'human face' was pointed out by The German Aerospace Centre's youth portal, DLR_next, on the Rosetta's comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . All life on Earth is said to have come from one common ancestor, a single-celled organism known as life’s Last Universal Common Ancestor (Luca). But what Luca looked like, how it lived, and how humans evolved from it is still a four-billion-year-old mystery. Researchers believe they have now discovered clues that may help tackle this mystery - and it’s all down to the organism’s ‘leaky’ membrane. Using mathematical modelling, researchers claim the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) passed energy through a 'leaky' membrane. This caused it to grow and evolve. As it moved to new surroundings, membranes evolved independently causing bactera and archaea organisms to evolve separately (shown in this illustration) The study, by University College London, claims this membrane may explain why all cells use the same complex mechanism to harvest energy. It may also explain why two types of fundamental single-celled organisms - bacteria and archaea - have different cell membranes. The Last Universal Common Ancestor (Luca) is the name given to a crude organism that is now traceable in all domains of life; plants, animals, fungi, algae, and so. Very little is actually known about this ancestor, and some scientists debate whether it was a cell. A recent study from the University of Illinois suggested LUCA was a more sophisticated organism than presumed, with a complex structure that makes it identifiable as a cell. The research, published in the journal Biology Direct, built on several years of study of a previously overlooked feature of microbial cells. This particular area has a high concentration of polyphosphate, a type of energy in cells. The research argued that this polyphosphate storage site actually represents the first known universal organelle. An organelle is a specialised unit in each cell that carries out a specific function; just as an organ does for the human body. The team of researchers, led by Dr Nick Lane from the university’s Biosciences department, made the discovery using mathematical modelling. They claim that the leaky membrane allowed Luca to harness the energy from its surroundings, which were most likely vents on the ocean floor. The cells were able to allow protons to enter and exit at the same time, causing them to grow at an accelerated rate. Researchers believe Luca lived in an area where ancient seawater, packed with positively charged particles called protons, mixed with warm alkaline vent fluid, which contained fewer protons. The difference in the concentration of protons across these two environments enabled protons to flow into the cell. This drives the production of a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which makes modern-day cells grow, for example. However, scientists believe this was only possible if the membrane was ‘leaky’ as it allows protons to leave and enter the cell spontaneously to power such growth. Dr Lane said: ‘I find this work just beautiful - it constrains a sequence of steps going from the strange cell that seems to have been the ancestor of all life today, right through to the deep division between modern cells. This tree diagram reveals how LUCA eventually split into bacteria, archaea and eucaryota, or eukaryote. Eucaryota includes humans and other animals, plants, and fungi . ‘From a single basic idea, the model can explain the fundamental differences between bacteria and archaea. Is it right? I’d like to think so, but more importantly, it makes some clear predictions that we plan to test in the future.’ Dr Lane added: ‘In these deep sea vents, there is a continuous flow of alkaline fluids, which mix with the ocean waters. ‘When they mix, the fluids neutralise each other, and that stops any build-up of charge which would otherwise prevent protons flowing into the cell. ‘If the first cells had leaky membranes, then protons could enter and then be neutralised, or leave again, almost as if there was no barrier at all. The researchers claim that this evolution process explains why membrane bioenergetics are universal in archaea (pictured) and bacteria - yet ion pumps and membranes are different, which has been the big unknown . ‘What we’ve shown is that the rate at which protons enter and leave is high enough to power the growth of cells via proteins embedded in the membrane. ‘So Luca could have been powered by natural proton gradients in vents, but only if it had a really leaky membrane, completely unlike today’s cells.’ Lead author Victor Sojo, a researcher in UCL’s Biosciences department, added: ‘Exploiting gradients is universal across all life, but understanding how Luca used one to drive growth gave us a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem: Luca wouldn’t make a gradient if it didn’t know how to exploit it, but how could it learn how to exploit a gradient if it didn’t make one in the first place? ‘We propose that natural proton gradients provide a solution because Luca didn’t have to make the gradient; it was already there for free. We show that modern ‘non-leaky’ membranes had to evolve later, and they did so independently in archaea and bacteria. ‘This explains why membrane bioenergetics are universal in archaea and bacteria yet ion pumps and membranes are different, which has been the big unknown.’ The findings are published in the journal PLOS Biology.","Researchers believe they have discovered clues about life’s Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)

"By . Mark Prigg for MailOnline . Tap water in some parts of Maine contains high levels of fluoride that could be lowering resident's IQ, it has been claimed. Residents in the Dedham area rely on private wells. However, a new study found that in 10 communities in the state have wells that have dangerously high levels of fluoride. A recent USGS study showed where the highest concentrations of fluoride were. Now studies in Maine said the supply there could be twice the recommended amount. In Dedham, data from 37 wells indicates that 37.8 percent of that water is above the state’s maximum exposure guideline for fluoride. In Surry, Prospect, Franklin, Sedgwick, Penobscot, York, Harrison and Stockton Springs, more than 10 percent of the wells appear to have fluoride levels higher than the state cutoff. The new data on fluoride levels in Maine water comes from homeowners who voluntarily sent water samples into state labs for testing, according to Scientific American. In some cases, the wells contain more than double the level that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has deemed the acceptable maximum exposure level. A 2012 review article by Harvard examined several studies performed outside the U.S. and found that high fluoride exposures reduce children's IQs by an average of about seven points. Harvard University researchers' review of fluoride/brain studies concludes 'our results support the possibility of adverse effects of fluoride exposures on children's neurodevelopment.' It was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, a US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' journal. 'The children in high fluoride areas had significantly lower IQ than those who lived in low fluoride areas,' write Choi et al. Experts say those in Maine are drinking similar levels. 'The sort of levels we're talking about that are high in China are the sort of levels we see in some private wells,' says Andrew Smith, Maine state toxicologist, told Scientific American. Further, the EPA says fluoride is a chemical 'with substantial evidence of developmental neurotoxicity.' Fluoride (fluosilicic acid) is added to US water supplies at approximately 1 part per million attempting to reduce tooth decay. After reviewing fluoride toxicological data, the NRC reported in 2006, 'It's apparent that fluorides have the ability to interfere with the functions of the brain.' Choi's team wrote ,'Fluoride readily crosses the placenta. 'Fluoride exposure to the developing brain, which is much more susceptible to injury caused by toxicants than is the mature brain, may possibly lead to damage of a permanent nature.' However, earlier this a new study by researchers from the University of Otago in New Zealand claimed fluoride does not lower IQ levels. Drawing data from a large study of 1,000 people born in Dunedin in New Zealand during 1972-1973 - the Dunedin Multidisciplinary Study - researchers from the University of Otago compared the IQs of study participants who grew up in suburbs with and without fluoridated water. They say the results showed 'no significant differences in IQ by fluoride exposure.'","Previous studies have linked fluoride with a lower IQ .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . We might not be quite ready to send humans to Mars, but that hasn’t stopped some bright minds coming up with ideas for what people might live in when they arrive. In a competition for Nasa called the 'Mars Base Challenge', innovators were tasked with designing living space for future astronauts. The winning design is one that intends to give explorers two bedrooms, two bathrooms and other six-sided rooms in a ‘honeycomb’ shape. Michigan-based designer has won a competition to design a home for future astronauts to live in on Mars with his 'Queen B' 3D printed design for a contest run by Nasa and Makerbot . In May this year Nasa's chief scientist Dr Ellen Stofan outlined the space agency's plans for Mars. In a series of talks across the UK she said we'll be there by the 2030s. But she explained there are key developments that must be made first . These include landing on an asteroid and building necessary components . This will ensure the first Mars-walkers survive a return trip to the red planet, she said. The competition was carried out by Nasa in alongside 3D-printing company MakerBot. It took place on Thingiverse, a website where people can share their designs for 3D printers. Contestants were tasked with designing their own abode using a 3D printer that future astronauts might one day live inside. The winning design was by Noah Hornberg from Michigan. Nasa asked entrants to design houses that could tackle Mars’ extremely cold temperature, high radiation levels, lack of oxygen and frequent dust storms. ‘My solution is to use the tessellating hexagon due to its compactness and modular potential,’ Mr Hornberg wrote in his entry. Mr Hornberg's design includes different rooms for people to use such as bedrooms and even a garden . Mr Hornberg says he chose the hexagon shape because it was less likely to break over time than squares . The hexagonal shape also allowed a number of amenities to be fitted into the separate rooms . Most of the time, Mars is clear, dry, cold, and clear. Clouds are very small, wispy and formed by carbon dioxide ice. It never rains on Mars because of the planet has a thin atmosphere and lacks a magnetic shield, the the one that cover Earth. Temperatures at the equator during the day can be as warm as 20°C. But at night, temperatures can drop to -90°C. This dramatic difference in temperature can create huge dust storms that can cover the entire planet for weeks. The maximum wind speeds on Mars recorded by the Viking Landers in the 1970's were about 30 meters per second (60 mph) with an average of 10 m/s (20 mph). ‘I have extrapolated on the idea of a fully functional apartment on Mars with all the modern amenities fit inside 16ft (5 metre) diameter hexagons. 'I think that to present Mars life to people and actually make it appealing to the public, it needs to feel like home and reflect the lifestyle trends of Earth living.’ He says his design, without any appendages sticking out, would be more practical for long-term living. And a hexagonal shape would also be less likely to distort or rupture under pressure than other shapes, such as a square. To stay warm, meanwhile, a large subterranean container would hold water to be heated in an underground electric heater. This would keep the bottom of the house heated, while the creation of steam would allow for steam-powered generators for energy.

"By . Jason Groves, Chief Political Correspondent . David Cameron will leave his political woes behind over Easter by flying off for a break in the sun. The Prime Minister, who spoke on Wednesday of his ‘difficult week’, will head off to Lanzarote for a holiday with his family. The revelation came just hours after he told listeners on BBC Radio Norfolk that he would be spending Easter with his wife Samantha’s family – with no mention of plans to spend a week in the Canary Islands. The Camerons, on a trip to Ibiza last year, are off to Lanzarote for an Easter break this year . Asked about his intentions for the break, he said: ‘I am going to be spending time with my mother-in-law.’ He added: ‘I think I am spending Easter Day with Samantha’s family.’ Downing Street refused to comment on security grounds. Aides are also sensitive about publicity surrounding thePrime Minister’s frequent foreign holidays at a time of continuing austerity at home. But Spanish media quoted police sources on Lanzarote as saying security measures were being put in place for his expected arrival on the island on Saturday, along with Samantha and their children Nancy, Arthur and Florence. Local sources reported the family will be staying in an upmarket hotel in a rural setting, a few miles from the coast. Mr Cameron took his brood on several holidays last year, including one to Ibiza in May and to the Algarve, Portugal, in July. The crowded beach at Playa Blanca Beach in Lanzarote, the island where David Cameron will be spending his Easter holiday . Director of the island’s tourist board Hector Fernandez described the Prime Minister’s choice as an ‘important pat on the back’ for Lanzarote’s reputation, as it shakes off the nickname ‘Lanzagrotty’ it acquired during the early days of package holidays. On their return, the Camerons are expected to travel to the Oxfordshire manor house owned by Samantha’s mother Annabel and her husband Viscount Astor, a former Tory minister. Around 1.6million tourists visit Lanzarote each year – the majority (around 800,000) from the UK. The weather over the next week will be mainly sunny, with temperatures ranging between 21-23C (70-73F). The Prime Minister revealed his Easter plans after he spoke of his Christian faith at a Downing Street reception on Wednesday, saying he believes the ‘Big Society’ project is doing God’s work. A beach near El Papagayo in Lanzarote, where David Cameron will be holidaying . The island was formed 15million years ago from the solidified lava streams and rock formations of a volcanic blast. Tourist beaches have golden sand shipped in from the Sahara – but others retain their volcanic sand which is naturally black. It is 78 miles from the coast of Morocco and is the fourth largest of the Canary Islands at 327 square miles. The outdoor scenes of the 1966 caveman film One Million Years BC, starring Raquel Welch in a fur bikini, were shot there. The sun shines for ten hours a day in summer, while in winter temperatures rarely fall below a balmy 21C (70F). One of the island’s lagoons, formed during a volcanic eruption, is home to a unique species of blind albino crab.","Prime Minster set to head off to Lanzarote with his family for Easter .

"By . Sally Lee . A video allegedly unveiling Subway's deceptive marketing tactics has been mysteriously leaked by an unknown source. It was uploaded on Tuesday by an anonymous user but was allegedly created by former Melbourne franchisee Arun Singhal as part of a suspected $35 million blackmail plot against the sandwich giant. Mr Singhal's initial concerns of Subway's business practices allegedly prompted him to create a number of videos and a website to reveal the franchise's trade secrets, called 'The System', reported The Age. A restrained video allegedly unveiling Subway's deceptive marketing tactics has been mysteriously leaked by an unknown source . The released video may have violated the injunction order obtained by the company in May after Subway made claims about Mr Singhal's intentions, prohibiting certain information from being released. It is unclear whether the leaked video is subject to the court order. It isn't suggested that the 30-year-old breached the court order. Mr Singhal has said his laptop was stolen some time ago. Mr Singhal also denies any plot to blackmail Subway and claims he is the victim of the 'Sandwich Mafia', as he was forced to declare bankruptcy after the company allegedly promised him that if he closed his store he would be able to open a new one elsewhere. No new store became available. 'After they took my authorisation to close the store and I closed the store, then they completely changed their words,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'I was told that they don't have any new location right now and I might have to wait for two to three years for a new location.' He said he lost his lifetime's savings due to Subway's 'as usual' deceptive behaviour'. 'Here a family man lost $350,000 in Subway's investment. They left me with no option then to declare bankruptcy. I told the ""Sandwich Mafia"" that if you don't compensate me for the loss of business, I am going to media to tell everyone about my story.' He said '$35 million' was Subway's estimate of its losses if its trade secrets were revealed. The company claims Mr Singhal wanted to destroy Subway's reputation or cause it loss, reported The Age. 'They lodged a lawsuit against me that I am blackmailing them in the lieu of secret recipe,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Subway systems are the mastermind of the whole plan but they put that accusation on me.' A Subway spokesman told The Age they were disappointed Mr Singhal had 'taken this route' and they would not be commenting any further.","A video was released to reveal the sandwich giant's allegedly deceptive marketing strategy .

She married husband Allen Korth just weeks ago on July 6 . Tragic: Korth learned she had esophageal cancer five years ago . Allen said in a statement to the newspaper 'My wife (I just love saying that) has affected my life in just about every way imaginable. ... So many people enter relationships thinking they have some kind of void to fill, and we weren't like that. 'We already felt complete as individuals, but as spending time together made life even more special, taking the road together felt as natural as the sunrise. Both of us are better for it.' Maid of honor Alexis Cook told The Flint Journal 'I hope that [Jennifer] knows that she has made the world a better place [....] (She taught us) you should appreciate what you have every day.' At the Korths' wedding last month, Jennifer wore a wig and spent most of the ceremony and reception in a wheelchair, the newspaper reported. Photographs revealed the wedding's pink, black and white color scheme. The bride's bouquet included flowers in white and shades of pink. The big day: The Korths' wedding was arranged by group Wish Upon a Wedding, which aims to help couples in which one or both partners are terminally ill or face life-altering conditions . Allen was stunned with his mouth wide open when Jennifer gave him a guitar as a present, the newspaper said. By the time the couple married, Jennifer was already in hospice care. They did not marry earlier because they feared losing her insurance, The Flint Journal reported. Before her wedding, she told the paper 'When there's something you've always wanted and you're faced with death ... it kind of brings peace to you. There's something about changing your last name to the person you love. It's just important to me that I get to do that.' 'We played married already,' she also said.

An incident in Persian Gulf on Tuesday saw the U.S. Coast Guard fire a warning at an Iranian fishing boat, after the small vessel allegedly prepared to fire a machine gun at the American crew. According the Navy, the Coast Guard patrol vessel Monomoy was in international waters when it dispatched a team to conduct a routine query with the Iranian dhow, who initially identified themselves but then broke contact. The team boarded a smaller boat as they moved closer to the dhow, observed it was armed with two .50-caliber machine guns. One the guns was manned during the approach, Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, U.S. 5th Fleet spokesman, told Stars and Stripes. 'Self defense': The US Coast Guard  patrol boat Monomoy - stationed in the Persian Gulf - was conducting a routine query on an Iranian dhow boat when the crew charged a machine gun at them, the Navy said Tuesday . Armed: The Navy said that, upon approaching the dhow, the US small boat crew noticed two .50 caliber machine guns (similar to the one pictured), one of which was manned and allegedly preparing to fire . As the dhow's gunner charged the weapon, the American crew turned away, firing one warning shot, Stephens said. 'This action by the dhow's crew demonstrated hostile intent, which resulted in the defensive fire by the Coast Guardsmen,' Stephens said. The Coast Guard acted in self defense, he said. Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN there was no indication that the dhow was struck by the shot. The dhow then left the scene without incident and without communicating further with the Monomoy. No U.S. personnel were harmed, the Navy said.

And they got more than they bargained for when one formed right beside their minibus and hurled a heavy crop sprayer into the windscreen. The group had been speeding along a lonely highway near the town of McCool, Nebraska, with ominous grey skies hanging over them, trying to reach a tornado they had spotted in the distance. Portentous: George Kourounis and his group of storm-chasing tourists had been speeding down this isolated highway near the town of McCool, Nebraska, when they suddenly got a bigger thrill than they bargained for . It's as they pass the spindly arms of this crop duster that they realise a tornado is forming beside them . Quick thinking: Realising that the tornado is about to pass right over the minibus, Mr Kourounis takes evasive action, steering into the wind to stop the vehicle from being rolled over . Passengers in the minibus must have been horrified to see the incoming crop duster, headed straight for them . It hit the windscreen with a resounding crack, but the toughened glass held despite the heavy impact . Then, without warning, a second tornado began forming in the field next to them. Realising they would be foolish to stop and gawp, Mr Kourounis speeds up in an effort to drive to safety. But with the twister heading straight over them, there's nothing for it but to take evasive action and they turn into the wind - as the storm throws the crop sprayer straight into the front of their minibus. 'I've got to admit it was pretty scary,' said Mr Kourounis. 'We were trying to drive away from a storm when a tornado formed beside the car from nowhere. 'I didn't really know what to do and had to try steer into the wind to prevent the car from flipping.' He added: 'There was just no real opportunity to get out of its way. If we had been going a little slower or a little faster things could have been very different - we were lucky.' Despite having just survived driving through a tornado, the damage to the minibus was actually pretty slight . Mr Kourounis, of Toronto, Canada, quit his engineering job to take up life as an adventurer 16 years ago. Each spring, he leads parties across the U.S. chasing tornadoes. 'The party had all paid to be on the storm chasing trip and I know a lot of them were scared but that's what they pay their money for,' he said. 'That's the beauty of storm chasing - it's unpredictable. You never know what's going to happen next.'","Group had been speeding towards another tornado near McCool, Nebraska .

Gordon Strachan has called for more from his Scotland team, warning that not one of the 90-minute performances from his reign thus far will be good enough to overcome Germany on Sunday. The highlights since he started guiding Scotland in the right direction include back-to-back defeats of Croatia who, when beaten 1-0 in Zagreb in June 2013, were ranked fourth in the world.

When asked to pick one Scotland team display from his tenure that would satisfy his demands for the opening Group D test, Strachan replied: ‘I think I’ll have to pick different bits out of some games. ‘There’s the defensive side in Croatia, the attacking against Nigeria, the attacking and bravery when we played England. If I threw all that in, then I think we’d need that. ‘I don’t think there is a “one performance” that would give us a victory. It’s elements of it all sewn in that would give us the chance. ‘But, even with that, what I can’t plan for is some brilliance from some of the Germany players. Sometimes, if that happens, you’ve just got to stand up and say: “Fair enough”.’ Nothing to lose: Strachan (right) and Darren Fletcher (left) speak ahead of the match at Signal Iduna Park . If it’s a Scotland player who conjures a moment of such brilliance this evening, then a slot in national sporting folklore is guaranteed. Strachan booked his place with a goal against West Germany in Mexico at the 1986 World Cup Finals, albeit Scotland then conceded twice to lose. More recently, Gary Caldwell and James McFadden scored in remarkable home and away performances to see off a world football superpower in France. The stage is there for one of Strachan’s number to record a career highlight as Scotland team up against the brilliant Brazil 2014 winners. Champions: World Cup-winning Germans Benedikt Hoewedes and Thomas Mueller prepare in Dortmund . That defining act of glory will only be possible, though, if Scotland’s dirty work is on a par with that which so frustrated the French twice on those nights in Euro 2008 qualifying. ‘I think people talk about “the goal”, no matter what happens,’ Strachan said. ‘Of course, you want to go into a big game and be the best player on the pitch but as part of a team at the same time and on a winning side. ‘They’ll talk about McFadden’s goal, Gary Caldwell against France. But you’ve got to remember that behind every individual’s moment, the defending was phenomenal. ‘If you remember rightly, especially at Hampden, the bravery and commitment the defenders showed was amazing. I don’t think Scotland had another chance at goal and I think Scotland defended that well the French got bored. They had that much of the ball and ran out of ideas.’ It's not too late to play MailOnline Fantasy Football… There's £1,000 to be won EVERY WEEK by the highest scoring manager .","Scotland play Germany in Dortmund in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday .

"By . Fraser Mackie . Russell Martin is Scotland’s latest defensive concern ahead of the Euro 2016 qualifying opener against Germany on Sunday night. The Norwich City centre-half was forced to watch Saturday evening’s training at the Signal Iduna Park from the sidelines as he nursed a groin problem. And he will need to prove his fitness on the morning of the game to take his place at the heart of Gordon Strachan’s defence to face the World Cup winners. Sidelined: Martin was forced to sit out training on Saturday as Scotland prepared for the World Champions . Down to the wire: The Norwich defender will have a late test to prove his fitness in Dortmund . Strachan, whose squad travelled to Dortmund on Saturday without injured defenders Christophe Berra and Andrew Robertson, expressed confidence in Gordon Greer and Grant Hanley teaming up if that is his chosen pairing. ‘Russell felt it on Friday, so we took him out of training as a precaution,’ said Strachan. ‘He will train in the morning and we’ll find out then because we normally name the team right before training. ‘We have been doing alright at centre-half, though. If you look at Gordon Greer since he came in, the results with Gordon and Hanley together have been OK. Replacement: Grant Hanley (left) and Gordon Greer will start together if Martin is unable to play . ‘But we know how we’re going to play, we know the formation. We’ve been doing it for a year and we have tidied up this week so that everyone, no matter what position they play in, knows exactly what’s needed.’ Scotland have kept a clean sheet the last three times Martin has played — against Poland, Norway and Croatia. Greer and Hanley were in partnership to keep out the United States at Hampden last November, part of a six-match unbeaten streak.

"By . Ronnie Esplin, Press Association . Joachim Low believes Scotland will be a danger to Germany in Sunday's European Championship qualifier in Dortmund because they are on form and 'have nothing to lose'. The Scots go into the Group D opener against the world champions at Signal Iduna Park with few giving them a chance of taking anything from the game even though the German side will be much-changed due to retirement and injury. They also go into the match on the back of a 4-2 friendly defeat at home to Argentina. Stern warning: Joachim Low has called on his players to not underestimate the Scottish national team . Key player: Chelsea midfielder Andre Schurrle will be hoping to start for Germany against Scotland . Tough task: Germany will have to be at their best if they are going to beat Scotland, according to Low . However, Germany boss Low talked up the Scots and noted that Gordon Strachan's rejuvenated side have gone six games unbeaten. 'Scotland have had no problems in their preparations,' he said. 'They have a British mentality but they don't play with a British style these days. 'They try to play good football but are still very well organised. 'They have quality players and have nothing to lose in this match so will play with no fear. 'We know all about their team and their biggest strength is that they are a team. 'They have good players like (Steven) Naismith, (Shaun) Maloney and (Ikechi) Anya. 'Darren Fletcher is the best known player playing for Manchester United. He is also the most experienced player. 'They will be motivated, physical and they will run a lot and they are also very good in one-on-one. 'They have won twice against Croatia and drew again USA and Nigeria and so we know they are a very good team. 'It will be a difficult match for us.' Stretching out: Schurrle could prove to an important player for Germany on Sunday . Vital cog: Low and Schurrle have both heaped praise on Manchester United's Darren Fletcher . Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle has recent knowledge of on-form Naismith who scored his third goal in three games for Everton in the 6-3 defeat by the Stamford Bridge side at Goodison last Saturday. 'Steven Naismith is a very good player, he's very quick and he scored a lot of goals,' he said. 'He played well against us for Everton so he's dangerous and someone we'll have to watch. 'Darren Fletcher also has a lot of quality and experience from his time in England. 'But Scotland have other players who play in England as well so they have a quality squad. 'What we will have to do is make sure our players play well on the night and do enough to get a victory.' World Cup winners Miroslav Klose, Philipp Lahm and Per Mertesacker have retired from international duty while Bastian Schweinsteiger, Mesut Ozil, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira and Julian Draxler are out injured. Honoured: Per Mertesacker, assistant coach Hansi Flick, Miroslav Klose and Philipp Lahm were all handed plaques at the Esprit Arena . Those absences appeared to take their toll last Wednesday night when Germany capitulated against their World Cup final opponents in Dusseldorf. Low, who confirmed that defender Jerome Boateng will return after injury, played the defeat down, saying: 'Yes, there were a few mistakes in defence in the Argentina game but we weren't really that bad. 'It was more about concentration problems and at this level if you make mistakes you will be punished. 'We have to close the space and concentrate over 90 minutes. 'After every tournament you always have to replace players. We have to always look to the future. 'We have to deal with the situation and with the players who have had knocks. 'But now the players are focused and concentrated.' Improvement needed: Low's side were beaten 4-2 by fellow World Cup finalists Argentina on Wednesday . Despite the turnaround in circumstances since his summer triumph in Rio, the German boss warned Scotland and the rest of the group that there will be no problem with self-motivation in this campaign. He said: 'My motivation is there completely. 'Even on holiday I thought about things and analysed situations. 'It is an exciting job and you have to develop, other teams develop and you have to keep up. 'The motivation from me is from the inside and if I thought I wouldn't have the motivation then I would quit this job.'","Joachim Low is wary of the threat posed by the Scottish national team .

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . McLaren racing director Eric Boullier has revealed the team may yet embark on their new partnership with Honda later this year. After a seven-year absence, when Honda ran their own team, they will be back in 2015 as power-unit supplier to McLaren, replacing Mercedes. It reunites one of the most famous partnerships in the history of the sport as McLaren-Honda won four consecutive constructors' titles from 1988-91, as well as four drivers' crowns - three for Ayrton Senna and one for Alain Prost. Relationship: McLaren and Honda will renew their relationship next season . Honda motorsport boss Yasuhisa Arai claimed earlier this week the world would have to wait until the first test in Jerez in February for the new McLaren-Honda to hit the track. But Boullier reckons there is a possibility the car could be seen for the first time at a two-day test in Abu Dhabi in November that follows immediately after the final grand prix of the campaign. Asked as to Arai's comments in Monza ahead of the race in Italy, Boullier replied: 'I am 100 per cent aware. 'There is constant and consistent communication between both companies, so we know exactly where we go. Test: Eric Boullier said that the date the car will be tested is unsure but it will be before Jerez . 'Regarding the first test of the McLaren/Honda-powered car, there is no decision yet about when and where. This is still open. 'It is true there was a comment, but we will not give a definite answer now because we do not know exactly, but it is very likely it will be before Jerez.' Asked whether that could be in Abu Dhabi, Boullier said: 'Yes. 'This is not definite. It is true the safe side is we will be in Jerez with a McLaren-Honda car. 'But we are keeping the door open to run earlier should everything match our schedule.'","McLaren and Honda to restore relationship .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Former disgraced New York Governor Eliot Spitzer was spotted over the weekend attending the Dartmouth reunion of his younger girlfriend Lis Smith. Smith, who is 31, graduated from the Ivy League school in 2005. According to Page Six, Spitzer, who graduated from Princeton in 1981, was apparently seen circulating at a frat party on Friday night too. The former New York Governor was forced to resign from his post in 2008 after spending more than $15,000 on prostitutes. He has also recently finalized a very public and bitter divorce from Silda Wall Spitzer. Public: Former Gov. Eliot Spitzer is standing by his gal pal Lis Smith. The couple were seen at a Dartmouth reunion over the weekend . The once-covert couple have now clearly let go of any attempts to keep their private lives private. Spitzer had a failed political 'comeback' campaign to become New York City's new comptroller last year, masterminded by Smith. She then joined Bill de Blasio's team and was widely considered to be the likely candidate for the mayor's press secretary. Just as the final staffing decision was due to be made, photos were released that showed the former governor, who resigned years ago after admitting to soliciting prostitutes, sneaking in and out of Smith's Soho apartment in December. Back to school: Spitzer, who graduated from Princeton in 1981, was even seen circulating at a Psi Upsilon frat party on Friday . Now after spending the past few months under the radar, Smith is actively trying to restart her consulting career. She is now working for the Democratic Governor's Association, paying close attention to Governor Martin O'Malley of Maryland who is considered a possible 2016 candidate should Hillary Clinton choose not to run for president. Spitzer was introduced to his new girlfriend's family over Christmas and the couple took a romantic trip to Jamaica over the New Year - which reportedly included an amorous session inside an outdoor hot-tub. Spitzer, who was once considered a future presidential candidate, met his wife Silda at Harvard Law School in 1987. The couple had three daughters as Spitzer rose the ranks from successful lawyer to prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office. Silda Wall Spitzer recently received a $7.5million payout and to keep her luxury Fifth Avenue apartment overlooking Central Park in Manhattan as part of her divorce settlement. The ex-New York governor's former wife grimly stood by him when his predilection for expensive call girls came to light in 2008. She will also receive $240,000-a-year maintenance for life. The Spitzers divorce was finalized in February this year and it was agreed that Silda would receive the first $1million within 180 days. Another $1million will follow on the service of their divorce judgement and then at least $500,000 ever year unless the former politician decides to pay his ex a lump sum. The annual $240,000 maintenance payment will come to Silda after her former husband has paid the taxes. It will continue until she either remarries or dies. Shameful: New York Governor Eliot Spitzer addresses the media with his wife Silda Wall Spitzer on March 10, 2008 following revelations that he spent $100,000 on prostitutes . Spitzer became state Attorney General in 1998 and found fame as the 'Sheriff of Wall Street' - going after corrupt financiers. His moral authority and intellect helped catapult him into the governor's office in 2007 - however he resigned in disgrace just a year later after being revealed to have used prostitutes. Infamous as Client 9 of the Emporers Club VIP call-girl ring, he resigned at a public press conference with his wife by his side. He then attempted to rehabilitate his public image with a stint presenting a CNN news show which failed and then eventually made his way back to work for his father .","Spitzer, 54, has been seen out and about as he is dating his 31-year-old former publicist Lis Smith .

"By . Tara Brady . Two teams of cricketers brought a league match to an unexpected halt so they could catch a thief who had been spotted looting the pavilion. The suspect sneaked into the changing rooms to steal 12 iPhones from the jacket pockets of players while a 50 over match was underway. However, he was seen fleeing with his haul from Church and Oswaldtwistle Cricket Club in Accrington, Lancashire, by the wicketkeeper of the home team who alerted an off duty policeman who was waiting to bat for away side Haslingden.

Police dog handlers were called in and - helped by the cricketers - officers arrested a man and recovered all the phones. Yesterday, Lancashire Police said the suspect, aged 29, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, was being held on suspicion of theft. The incident occurred on Sunday as Church were taking on Haslingden in the Lancashire League. Play had already been stopped after a former club chairman was taken ill at the side of the pitch and taken to hospital by ambulance.

However, at 3.30pm, play had to be stopped again when the thief, who was initially assumed to be match official, was spotted prowling around the away team's changing rooms. Sam Tucker wicketkeeper for Church said: 'We were playing cricket and we see this guy was sitting in the players area of pavilion. 'I assumed he was a club official of the away team, but he kept nipping in and out of the changing room. 'Technology is amazing, we couldn't have done it without the GPS tracking. I've never experienced anything like it on a cricket field before' Sam Tucker, wicketkeeper . 'I kept my eye on him and he made an exit. We chased him through the fields. There was tracking on one of the phones, so we were moving around following the GPS. 'Police had arrived and police dogs and eventually we gripped him. He didn't have any phones on him at that time, so we had to pinpoint where he had put them in the field with the tracker. 'Technology is amazing, we couldn't have done it without the GPS tracking. I've never experienced anything like it on a cricket field before.' Graham Knowles, an opening batsman for Haslingden, said: 'One of the Church lads spotted the thief and our lads gave chase and they caught up with him in a field and retrieved the phones. 'They used another phone to track the phones with GPS tracking. One of our teammates is a policeman in Burnley so he led the charge. It was the first time anything like this has happened in 25 years of playing cricket.' Lancashire Police said: 'A man was seen leaving the changing rooms and the cricketers chased after him into woodland. 'Police dog handlers were called to the scene and a man was arrested on suspicion of theft and is in custody. Inquiries are continuing.' The stoppages caused the match to be reduced to 30 overs which Haslingden won by six wickets.","Suspect sneaked into changing rooms at Church and Oswaldtwistle Cricket Club, in Accrington, Lancashire stealing 12 iPhones .

"By . Jennifer Smith for MailOnline . A rare monkey who was snatched from her enclosure with her baby by gangsters in an organised raid has given birth to twins. Mamma, a Cotton-top Tamarin, was stolen from Blackpool Zoo alongside four other monkeys last April by a suspected group of black-market pet thieves. The 15-month-old was discovered days after being abducted, but her baby was never found. Now more than a year later, the animal has given birth to healthy twins which are 'doing well'. Mamma cuddles up with her new born twins which have yet to be named or sexed at Blackpool Zoo . Keepers feared she may never recover from the loss. Mamma is pictured running around the Blackpool Zoo Tamarin enclosure with her two new babies on her back . Mamma was stolen from her enclosure in the dead of the night last April by a group of suspected animal traffickers. The rare monkey was found in a cardboard box three days later alongside three other animals, but her offspring was never found. The cotton-top tamarin is a small New World monkey weighing less than 0.5 kg. One of the smallest primates, it is easily identified by the long white sagittal crest extending from its forehead to its shoulders. Up to 40,000 cotton-top tamarins were caught and exported for use in biomedical research before 1976 when they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned. The wild population is estimated at 6,000 individuals, with 2,000 adults, with the species listed in among the World’s 25 Most Endangered Primates in 2012. Experts say small monkeys like tamarins and macaques are becoming an increasingly popular pet in the US despite a ban by several states ban on owning a primate. Justin Bieber had a pet capuchin for a while, but left the animal in Germany after failing to provide sufficient vetting documents to authorities at Munich Airport . Keepers at Blackpool Zoo feared she may never recover from the sadness of losing her baby when they discovered she was in the early stages of pregnancy. 'Keepers at Blackpool Zoo were devastated earlier this year when five of our monkeys were stolen, as every single animal we have here is considered a member of our zoo family,' said Charlotte Pennie, Senior Primate Keeper. 'We worked very closely with Lancashire Police and following huge media interest four of the five were found days later. 'The two new babies, who are yet to be sexed and named, are doing extremely well and we are delighted for. 'The pair are also vital for the international breeding programme, so it is great news all round.' Lancashire Police feared Mamma and the other monkeys were targeted to be sold onto the black market as pets to wealthy buyers when they were snatched last year. When they returned to the zoo they had to sleep in a separate crate in case the other animals had forgotten what they looked like and decided to attack. Mamma was stolen alongside four other monkeys, including her baby, by gangsters who broke into the zoo last April . The 15-month-old animal hasn’t let her new twin offspring out of her sight since welcoming them three weeks ago . Mamma was sad and quiet when she returned to the enclosure after losing her baby last April, keepers said . The Cotton-top Tamarin was found three days after being stolen in a cardboard box in west Yorkshire. Lancashire Police believed they were targeted to be sold onto the black market as pets for wealthy buyers . Lancashire Police said no one had been arrested in connection with the break-in at Blackpool Zoo (pictured) 'That was a serious concern but with the speedy return we got them back in time and managed to reintegrate them well. 'The female was very quiet when she first came back - that may have been the stress as well as the fact she was missing her baby. 'They had a few marks on them but otherwise they came back healthy. We were all so happy to get them back - to be honest to get any of them back was brilliant. 'But the baby was so dependent on its mother, I think we have come to the conclusion we are not going to see that one again.'

"By . Sean O'hare . The brother of 12-year-old Moors Murders victim Keith Bennett says he has 'compelling new evidence' and knows where his sibling is buried. Alan Bennett, 56, claims the evidence has enabled him to narrow down an area the 'size of two football pitches' on Saddleworth Moor, Greater Manchester. The body of Keith, who was 12 when he was kidnapped and murdered by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley in 1964, has never been found despite numerous searches.

Tragic: Brady's victim Keith Bennett's body has never been found since his murder in 1964 . But Mr Bennett, 56, said he'd gathered 'compelling new evidence' after speaking to David Smith, the chief prosecution witness in the pair's murder trial in 1966, and another source who was close to Brady. He told the Manchester Evening news that photographs of the moor taken by the source 'tied in' with information provided by Smith, who died earlier this year. Mr Bennett, who runs a website forum dedicated to finding Keith, described the area 'as the width of no more than two football pitches'. He added: 'Myself and other forum members - of which there are many - are certain than a new official search using this recent evidence could bring Keith home. 'I cannot describe what this would mean to my family.' Keith mother Winnie, who'd urged Brady to reveal the location of Keith's body, died in August, aged 78.

'They are to be found all over the internet chasing anybody who they think will listen to them.

He added: 'I am and will continue to be offended and angered by these people.' It was also claimed earlier this year . that Brady has passed a letter to his mental health advocate containing . details of the burial spot. Brady is said to have told Jackie Powell that the letter was only to be opened after his death.Police launched an investigation and arrested Powell on suspicion of preventing the lawful burial of a body. But the letter has never been found and detectives believe it may have been a ruse by the killer. Greater Manchester Police renewed their search to find Keith's body in 2003, including scientists, . clinical psychologists, imagery experts, search advisors, geologists, . geophysicists, geochemists, archaeologists and anthropologists. Funeral: Mr Bennett, left, hugs a mourner at his . mother Winnie's funeral after her coffin is carried into St . Chrysostom's Church, in Victoria Park, Manchester . In 2009, it . concluded there was no longer any specific information to identify new . search areas and therefore the investigation entered, and remains, in a . dormant stage. Martin Bottomley, head of Greater Manchester Police's Cold Case Unit, said: 'As a Force, there is nothing we . would have liked more than to draw a close to this dark chapter and of . course we are disappointed we have not located Keith's remains.

'In . the end, only Ian Brady knows the whereabouts of Keith Bennett's body. We have always and will continue to hope that one act of humanity on his . part will give Keith's family some peace.' Brady and Hindley were responsible for the murders of five youngsters in the 1960s, sexually torturing their victims before burying their bodies on Saddleworth Moor. They were jailed for life in 1966 for the murders of Leslie Ann Downey, ten, John Kilbride, 12, and Edward Evans, 17. They didn't admit to killing Keith and another victim Pauline Reade, 16, until 1987.Hindley died in prison in 2002, aged 60.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . A 25-year-old abortion counselor has filmed herself having a surgical abortion and posted the video on YouTube, saying she wants it to help banish stigma surrounding the procedure. Emily Letts, who works at the Cherry Hill Women's Center in New Jersey, explains in an article for Cosmopolitan.com that ironically, despite being a sex educator, she hadn't been using any birth control and 'wound up pregnant' by mistake last November. In her three-minute YouTube video she is seen being wheeled into the operating theater before being filmed from the waist up as doctors remove the embryo from her womb. She remains awake throughout, numbed only by local anesthetic. The video has been watched 36,000 times and has prompted strong reactions from pro-life campaigners as well as those supporting Miss Letts' actions. Scroll down for video . Caught on camera: Emily Letts, an abortion counselor from New Jersey, 25, has filmed herself having a surgical abortion at around three weeks into her pregnancy in a bid to banish stigma surrounding the procedure . Because she was only in the first trimester of pregnancy, Miss Letts says that she could have swallowed an abortion pill instead of going in for surgery. However, she 'wanted to do the one that women were most afraid of.' 'I wanted to show it wasn’t scary - and that there is such a thing as a appositive abortion story. It’s my story,' she continues. She does not state if she was in a relationship at the time, merely stating that the 'guy wasn't involved' in her decision to terminate her pregnancy. 'I knew I wasn't ready to take care of a child,' she notes. During her abortion Miss Letts - dressed in a hospital gown - practices relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and humming. Keeping calm: In her three-minute YouTube video she is seen being wheeled into the operating theater . Eyes wide open: She is then filmed from the waist up as doctors remove the embryo from her womb - she remains awake throughout, numbed only by a local anesthetic . She also talks to a member of staff who stands by the bed holding her hand and supportively rubbing her arm. Once the short procedure is over, she exclaims: 'Yeah, cool, I feel good. I’m done.' 'I don't feel like a bad person. I don't feel sad. I knew that what I was going to do was right - it was right for me and for no one else' About a month after her procedure Miss Letts, a former professional actress, candidly reflects about her experience with viewers. 'I don’t feel like a bad person. I don’t feel sad,' she explains, pointing out that many of the patients at her clinic assume that everyone feels guilty after having an abortion. 'I knew that what I was going to do was right - it was right for me and for no one else.' Her video has been watched more than 36,000 times since it was uploaded on March 14 and the comments panel has been disabled. 'I don't feel like a bad person. I don't feel sad. I knew that what I was going to do was right - it was right for me and for no one else,' Miss Letts said after her procedure . Miss Letts . said after she went public with the footage and posted it to Facebook . women started sharing their own stories with her. 'I had one women who messaged me saying she'd had an abortion that week and she was plagued with guilt. 'Her boyfriend called her a killer, but she said she was recovering well and appreciated the video.' 'I feel in awe of the fact that I can make a baby. I can make a life, I just want to tell my story' However, along with the positive remarks there were also a lot of angry reactions. 'I got... ""You deserve to die"", ""you killed your baby,""' Miss Letts recalled. According to the National abortion Federation 1.3 million abortions are performed in the U.S. every year, with 20 to 24 year olds accounting for the bulk of procedures. Like Miss Letts, most abortions (88 per cent) are carried out in the first trimester of pregnancy and fewer than two per cent occur at 21 weeks or later.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan For The Daily Mail . Gordon Strachan praised the courage of his Scotland side after they came close to matching world champions Germany in their own backyard. For four minutes the Scots dared to believe after Ikechi Anya's superb solo goal cancelled out Thomas Muller's first half opener. Sloppy defending allowed Muller to add a second – his 25th for his country – in the 70th minute. proud: Gordon Strachan said he felt Scotland performed well and could have won the game . But the Germans ended the 2-1 win in Dortmund's Signal Iduna Arena clinging to three Euro 2016 qualifying points – despite a bizarre red card to Charlie Mulgrew for time wasting when the Scots were desperately chasing an equaliser. 'The Germans are always going to have more of the ball, and more chances,' said Strachan, 'that goes without saying. At 1-1 I genuinely believed we could win the game. I saw the players playing with no fear. 'The first 20 minutes, it wasn't fear. We just asked the players to look out for passes, but they rushed these passes and we lost the ball quite a lot. That gave the Germans easy possession. 'So we had to adjust after 20 minutes and then we settled down a bit. In the second half we played with no fear and, as I say, at 1-1 I genuinely believed we were going to win the game.' The Scots succumbed to a preventable winner from Muller despite crafting a raft of second half chances against a much changed Germany side. Opener: Thomas Muller scored the opening goal for Germany with a looping header in the first half . Declining to criticise the quality of the defending Strachan added: 'If you can find me someone who is 6ft 4in and can head the ball for miles and jump about 8ft like Muller can then it's avoidable. 'But we don't have anybody like that and I think most countries in the world are the same. When you are delaing with an exceptional machine like Muller then you'll have a problem. That's always going to be the difference.' Goalkeeper David Marshall kept the Scots in the game during a backs to the wall first half before the team improved significantly in the second, substitute Steven Fletcher making a big impact by sending Anya in for his cool finish. Picked over Allan McGregor and Craig Gordon Strachan said of Marshall: 'I think if you look at our substitutes and how well they played you can see I can big decisions all over the place. 'Everybody has their strengths so you pick a team with the strengths to play the team you're playing. 'I could actually have picked another team and it would have given us the same performance. That is how good our squad is getting. Equaliser: Ikechi Anya beat offside trap to equalise for Scotland in the second half . 'But I did the easy bit, I just had to sit there and tick things off on my sheet and write notes. The players should be proud of how they played. 'I think in the first 20 minutes we could have done things better as a group. 'But once we got that sort out we had no fear of the game, which I thought was great. And the longer the game went on the more a threat we became. 'So the players really should be proud of their performance. 'All we have to do is work on how we play in the first 20 minutes and when we get that sorted out we'll be fine, we'll be good.' The only sour note came after Scotland players thronged Norwegian referee Svein Oddvar Moen over a series of dubious decisions in the closing stages. The official sent off Charlie Mulgrew for a second bookable offence for time wasting when the Scots were chasing an equaliser. Scotland also believed they should have had a penalty for handball and were angered the final whistle went as they won a corner. Winner: Scotland's joy was short-lived as Thomas Muller scored the winner just four minutes later . 'I went onto the pitch to make sure my coaching staff didn't overstep the mark and to congratulate the lads,' said Strachan, restraining himself afterwards. 'I think we try our best not to speak about referees but I would love to see the referee's assessment of that performance. That's all I've got to say about it. 'I'd like to see the referee's assessment of the game. Unfortunately we don't get to see them though.' Ultimately Scotland were undone by a world class finisher, with Muller – and the Scots – earning praise from Joachim Low afterwards. 'Nothing Thomas Muller does astonishes me. He is always clinical in front of goal and is always there when you need him. That's what he does. 'Scotland hasn't lost for a year now and won two times against Croatia and in Poland so we knew they would be a very difficult opponent. 'We did make a few mistakes at the back and they capitalised on that but I always believed we had it in us to score a second goal and in the end we did.'

"By . Press Association Reporter . Club England Managing Director at the Football Association Adrian Bevington believes it is 'embarrassing' that Chris Powell is the only black manager in the Football League and has called on the FA to generate more opportunities for ethnic minorities. Powell took charge of Huddersfield earlier this week but his appointment only served to highlight the lack of diversity in the top four divisions of English football. In recent seasons Chris Hughton, Paul Ince, Chris Kiwomya, Keith Curle and Terry Connor have all managed in the Football League but none of them are currently a number one. Back in the game: Chris Powell is now Huddersfield Town manager after a spell out of the game . Changes afoot: Club England Managing Director Adrian Bevington wants more opportunities out there . And former FA spokesman Bevington has pointed out that the current record is not good enough and has urged the national governing body to do more. 'I think for the game it’s embarrassing that we have only Chris Powell as the only black manager in the four divisions,' he said on BBC Radio 5 live. 'The fact is from an FA point of view we’ve got to be more proactive in this way. We’ve recently had (former Tottenham assistant) Chris Ramsay, Chris Powell and (former Aston Villa and Middlesbrough defender) Ugo Ehiogu spending certain time with our development teams but we’ve got to get better than this. No laughing matter: Powell is the only black manager in the Football League after recent changes . 'As an industry you can’t have such a high percentage of black players and that’s without looking at other ethnic groups as well - they need to be on boards, on senior management of organisations and they certainly need to be very visible within the coaching staff and the backroom staff of our national teams.' Bevington has also given his backing to Roy Hodgson despite a chastening last few months for the England manager, who oversaw a woeful World Cup campaign before his side toiled against Norway in front of a half-empty Wembley. Hodgson himself has admitted he has plenty to do to get England fans back onside and Bevington believes the former Fulham and West Brom boss should not shoulder the burden on his own. Helping hand: Bevington says Roy Hodgson should not carry England's burden alone . 'We went through the last qualifying campaign unbeaten, we topped the group, I think we were one of the highest goalscorers across the qualification campaign,' Bevington added. 'Obviously we are disappointed with the World Cup, there’s no getting away from that, but Roy has a contract to 2016 and it’s his job now, and with our support, to take us forward. 'The challenge is with us as a collective, not just with Roy.' Support: Bevington has worked with Hodgson since he started his job at the FA .

The revolutionary idea allows fans to buy either a five or 10 match ticket, appealing to fans who cannot commit to a full season ticket. After receiving feedback, the club determined that fans were unable to attend games due to work commitments and various other issues. Passionate: Motherwell are hoping to bring in more fans with the new Flexi-Ticker initiative . Affordable: Motherwell are making ticket prices very reasonable to their supporters . At £150 for 10 games, which works out to just £15 per game, the Flexi-Ticket ensures fans who can’t make every game get the same cost-per-game value as full-time season ticket holders. Motherwell have launched initiatives like this before, such as ‘bring a friend along for free’ schemes to league games, boosting both attendances and relationships with fans.

"By . Sudipto Ganguly, Reuters . Not playing the Indian Premier League is the reason behind England's struggles in the shorter formats, former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram said, a day after England great Ian Botham called for the rich Twenty20 competition to be scrapped. England were thumped 4-1 in Australia in their one-day international series at the beginning of the year and also lost recent series at home against Sri Lanka and India. Critics have flayed England's strategy and selections for the shorter formats, with some suggesting that the team does not care about anything other than test cricket. Struggling: England's lack of involvement in the IPL is hurting them in limited overs formats, says Wasim Akram . 'England may pretend as much as they can, but they do get affected by losses in ODI cricket,' the 48-year-old Akram, one of the all-time best pace bowlers of the world, wrote in a column published in Friday's Times of India newspaper. 'They just pretend to be not interested in the 50-over format. The only reason they are not good in one-day cricket right now is because they have a limited talent pool for the format.' England are currently ranked fifth in the world in ODIs and few would back them to win next year's World Cup in Australia and New Zealand, a trophy the country has never won. Cause: Former Pakistan captain Akram says England have a limited talent pool in the 50-over format . While former England all-rounder Botham believes the franchise-based IPL has become too powerful and could be fuelling corruption in the game, Akram thinks not playing in the tournament is hurting England. India, Australia, South Africa and Sri Lanka - the teams ranked above England in the ODI ranking - all have players featuring in the IPL. Meanwhile, Kevin Pietersen, who was sacked from the national set-up, was the only England international in the tournament earlier this year. Some English players made themselves unavailable to prepare for the summer's Test matches but others went unsold, being unable to commit for the full duration of the April-May tournament due to the clash with the county season. Loner: Kevin Pietersen, here in action for Surrey, was the only Englishman in the most recent IPL . Former England captain Pietersen recently said that 50-over world champions India had benefited from the tournament as their younger players were given the opportunity to play with and against the world's best. Akram, one of Pakistan's main architects during their World Cup triumph in 1992, agreed. 'Australia, India and South Africa play all year around in the shorter formats. Also all these players play IPL,' Akram added. 'That has helped their cause. 'England used to have a few players in IPL, but even that has stopped. That is the reason why they are struggling big time in the shorter formats.'

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association . Felipe Massa was surprised Nico Rosberg was not penalised by the stewards at the Belgian Grand Prix for 'destroying' the race of Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton. Rosberg has been given support since his collision with Hamilton at Spa at the end of last month by Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso, both of whom claimed what unfolded was 'a racing incident'. Of all the people to fight Hamilton's corner, Massa would likely be last on many people's list given the duo had a magnetic attraction to one another during a turbulent 2011 campaign when they often clashed on track, and occasionally off it, when the Briton was at McLaren and Brazilian with Ferrari. Surprise: Felipe Massa believes Nico Rosberg was fortunate to escape the Belgian GP without punishment . But Massa feels the stewards were wrong for not looking into the lap-two collision in Belgium which saw Rosberg puncture a tyre on Hamilton's car after clipping it with his front wing. Hamilton was forced to retire late on due to damage sustained to the car courtesy of his long drive back to the pits, whilst Rosberg went on to finish second to open up a 29-point gap. Assessing the incident, Williams driver Massa said: 'What I saw in the last race was not so correct from Nico, to be honest. 'I don't understand why they (the stewards) didn't give him a penalty because it was impossible to pass Lewis at that place (Les Combes). He needed to brake. Collision course: Nico Rosberg (right) collided with Mercedes team-mate Lewis Hamilton in Spa, picking up front wing damage but giving the Brit a rear puncture which wrecked his race . 'He didn't brake, they touched, Nico was behind, so Nico destroyed Lewis' race. 'I don't understand why the FIA, the stewards, didn't give him a penalty.' Earlier this season race stewards were informed to be more lenient in looking at incidents rather than reviewing every single indiscretion. Massa has suggested they have now gone too far the other way, adding: 'If you are the team and you have both drivers fighting for the championship, it's fantastic for the team. Points: Rosberg (left) went to to finish second to Daniel Ricciardo (centre) while Hamilton retired from the race . 'They are not fighting another team, they are going to be champions anyway, so they need to allow them to fight. 'But for me, Nico should have had a penalty for what he did as he destroyed the race of another guy fighting for the championship. 'I think maybe the stewards are losing a little bit of direction. They need to carry on doing what is inside the rules.' Given Rosberg's advantage in the championship, and despite double points available at the final race in Abu Dhabi in November, Massa is in no doubt as to who has the advantage. 'Nico - he has more points so it's easier for him. I'd put my money on him now,' Massa added.","Felipe Massa surprised FIA stewards didn't penalise Nico Rosberg .

Putin, according to the Kremlin. Following an extraordinary meeting of the Ukrainian government in Kiev yesterday, Yatsenyuk announced that he will fly to the United States this week for high-level talks on 'resolution of the situation in Ukraine,' the Interfax news agency reported. 'Our country and our people are facing the biggest challenges in the history of modern independent Ukraine,' the prime minister said earlier in the day. Demonstrators gather outside the Russian Embassy in Vilnius, Lithuania, to protest against Russian intervention in Ukraine . As separatists in Crimea kept up pressure for unification with Moscow, Ukraine solemnly commemorated the 200th anniversary of the birth of its greatest poet writer and nationalist Taras Shevchenko . Russia's occupation of Crimea will prove a 'big miscalculation' in the long-term, William Hague said as he sought to keep up pressure for a diplomatic solution. The Foreign Secretary conceded that none of the sanctions being threatened by the West could remove Moscow's military forces from the Ukrainian peninsula. But he said there would be 'very significant' consequences for Russia's future global influence if it refused to enter talks with Kiev over the stand-off. The population of the key strategic region is due to vote in a referendum on becoming part of Russia in a week's time after pro-Russian forces seized control of key military and other facilities. 'It would be wrong to conclude that Russia has won in some sense. I think this will turn out over time to be quite a big miscalculation,' he told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show. 'The long-term consequences will be very significant for Russia.' 'Will we be able to deal with these challenges? There should only be one answer to this question and that is: yes.' Crimea, a strategic peninsula in southern Ukraine, has become the flashpoint in the battle for Ukraine, where three months of protests sparked by President Victor Yanukovych's decision to ditch a significant treaty with the 28-nation European Union after strong pressure from Russia led to his downfall. A majority of people in Crimea identify with Russia, and Moscow's Black Sea Fleet is based in Sevastopol, as is Ukraine's. This weekend, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ruled out any dialogue with Ukraine's new authorities, whom he dismissed as the puppets of extremists. Senior lawmakers in Moscow have said they will support Ukraine's March 16 referendum, ignoring sanctions threats and warnings from President Barack Obama that the vote would violate international law. In Simferopol, the Crimean capital, a crowd of more than 4,000 people turned out Sunday to endorse unification with Russia. On Lenin Square, a naval band played World War II songs as old women sang along, and dozens of tricolor Russian flags fluttered in the cold wind. Meanwhile, it was announced that U.S. President Barack Obama will meet with Ukraine's prime minister, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, at the White House on Wednesday. Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken said the president would consult with Yatsenyuk and that the meeting demonstrated U.S. support for Ukraine. Blinken says the White House strategy is to mobilize the international community behind Ukraine, isolate Russia for its actions and reassure U.S. allies and partners.

"By . Jim Van Wijk, Press Association . Osi Umenyiora still has unfinished business in the NFL with the Atlanta Falcons, but would one day relish the opportunity to be at the forefront of any permanent expansion into London. Umenyiora, brought up in Golders Green before moving with his parents back to Nigeria, is hoping to again be involved when the Falcons take part in NFL International Series, which for the first time will see three regular-season matches played at Wembley. Oakland will 'host' the Miami Dolphins on September 28, before the Detroit Lions against the Atlanta Falcons in October followed by the Dallas Cowboys facing the Jacksonville Jaguars at the start of November. Brit of all right: Umenyiora (left) lines up with fellow NFL players at Wembley on Wednesday . It has been suggested the NFL is considering the viability of a franchise in Europe, with London the most likely hub city given the huge success of the sell-out games at Wembley, where the Jaguars have signed up for one 'home' fixture through to 2016. However, the logistics of getting players across the Atlantic on a regular basis and the physical toll that would take remains a subject for debate, but it is a future scenario Umenyiora, a two-time Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants, would welcome. 'There would be some complaints at first, but they (players) would get over that. They (NFL) would make it work - this is what we love to do, play football and we are getting paid extremely well to do it,' Umenyiora said. Success story: The Jacksonville Jaguars run out to take on the San Francisco 49ers at Wembley last year . 'I see what the NFL is doing, and they are not going to leave me behind, I am going to be on the forefront of coming out here, broadcasting and bringing the game to the audience out here, with the fact I was born here in London and have been doing some of the things I have been able to do in the NFL.' Umenyiora may turn 33 later this year and have also played in the Pro Bowl twice, but for now at least, his only focus is on more game time as the Falcons look to mount a push for the play-offs in 2014 after a hugely disappointing 4-12 record last season. 'Sometimes you do think about that (why continue on), but then there are still some things you need to accomplish,' said Umenyiora, who played at Wembley for the Giants against the Dolphins in 2007. Having a ball: Detroit Lions linebacker Stephen Tulloch (left) and Umenyiora pose for a photo at Wembley . 'That is the only thing which keeps me going, because I feel I can get better, so that is what I am going to try to do. 'I think we have a good chance this year. 'In the NFL, the difference can be just 10 seconds worth of plays, that is all it is, one missed step here or a catch there, the games are so close. 'Any team can go from being bad one season to good, and from being good to bad - and that is something which makes the NFL so dramatic.' Reaching out: The NFL are looking to gain more support from across the globe . Umenyiora intends to make the most of a welcome break from the rigours of pre-season training. 'I left London when I was really young, so I don't have too many concrete memories here, but coming back has been great,' said Umenyiora, now in his second season at the Falcons. 'My sister is going to school out here, so I will be seeing her, along with some friends I grew up with in London and Nigeria. 'Nobody knows anything about you here, which in a way is great, so you can just show up and enjoy yourself.'","Wembley to host three NFL games for the first time this season .

"By . Pa Reporter . Steve Ballmer has officially completed his purchase of the Los Angeles Clippers from the Sterling Family, a process which began in the wake of Donald Sterling's life ban for making racist remarks. Ballmer, a billionaire businessman who made his fortune with Microsoft, has paid a reported $2billion (£1.19bn) fee for the team. ‘The transaction in which Steve Ballmer purchased the Los Angeles Clippers closed today following the entry of an order by a California court confirming the authority of Shelly Sterling, on behalf of the Sterling Family Trust, to sell the team,"" an NBA statement said. Purchase: Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has completed the deal to own the NBA side the LA Clippers . ‘The NBA Board of Governors previously approved the sale and Ballmer is now the Clippers Governor.’ In late July, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Michael Levanas ruled that Sterling's wife Shelly had the authority to sell the NBA franchise to the former Microsoft CEO. Donald Sterling had attempted to block the sale, claiming that any transaction would need his approval. Lost: Donald Sterling (above) failed to halt the sale of the LA Clippers, claiming the sale needed his approval . Done deal: Shelly Sterling (right) completed the deal with Steve Ballmer (left) after a court ruling in July . But Judge Levanas put paid to his attempts to prevent the sale to Ballmer going ahead when he sided with his estranged wife. Donald Sterling was given a life ban by NBA commissioner Adam Silver, as well as a $2.5million (£1.49m) fine, after a tape emerged of him making derogatory remarks about African-Americans in April. The sale obliterates the previous high for an NBA franchise, the $550m (£328m) sale of the Milwaukee Bucks in April. It is only slightly less than the biggest ever sale involving an American sports team which was the 2012 $2.1bn (£1.25bn) sale of baseball team the Los Angeles Dodgers. Success?

"By . Jon Krawczynski . The San Antonio Spurs hired WNBA star Becky Hammon on Tuesday, making her the first full-time, paid female assistant on an NBA coaching staff. Hammon, who plans to retire from the San Antonio Stars after this season, spent time working with coach Gregg Popovich and the Spurs last season and made a strong impression on an organization with a history of forward-thinking moves. During the 2001-02 season, Cleveland Cavaliers coach John Lucas brought Lisa Boyer into the team's practices and some games. Boyer, now an assistant at South Carolina, was not paid by the Cavaliers and did not travel with the team, but did work with the players and coaches that season. Scroll down for video... Girl power: Beck Hammon has become the first full-time female assistant coach in the NBA . Game plan: The WBNA star speaks to Tom James, Director of Communicatios at the Spurs . Last season, Hammon attended Spurs practices, film sessions and sat behind the bench for the NBA champions at home game this season. She's been friends with Spurs teammates Tony Parker and Tim Duncan since competing in an NBA All-Star shooting competition in 2008. Switch: US born Hammon became a naturalised Russian citizen in 2008 and played for them in two Olympics . 'I very much look forward to the addition of Becky Hammon to our staff,' Popovich said. 'Having observed her working with our team this past season, I'm confident her basketball IQ, work ethic and interpersonal skills will be a great benefit to the Spurs.' It's the latest trailblazing move for the Spurs, who hired European coaching legend Ettore Messina to join Popovich's staff earlier this summer and have been the leaders in bringing international players to the NBA for almost two decades. The Spurs are coming off of their fifth NBA title, a decisive victory over the Miami Heat in June. The organization's stature as the league's gold standard, along with Popovich and GM RC Buford being viewed as two of the very best in the business, led other women who have long dreamed of coaching in the NBA to hope that this is the first major step toward bringing more women into the league.","Becky Hammon has become the first full-time female NBA assistant coach .

Cricket United, which supports the game’s major charities — Lord’s Taverners, Chance to Shine and the PCA benevolent fund — dressed The Oval in light blue on Saturday to promote the causes. But Botham, who ironically was knighted mainly for his huge contribution in raising money for charity, was the one regular Sky commentator on screen not wearing a light blue tie on the day. Cricket United gave ties the day before to Sky cricket producer Brian Henderson for his commentary team to wear. But Botham preferred to sport the colours of Scunthorpe United, the Football League team for whom he made 11 appearances. Charity figure: Sir Ian Botham, right, pictured in December with Shane Warne, chose to wear a tie with colours supporting football team Scunthorpe United at The Oval on Saturday, rather than one for Cricket United . Meanwhile, Indian motorcycle firm Hero were the only company with a perimeter advertising board at The Oval for the Test who did not change to a light blue colour on Saturday. A Cricket United spokesman said: ‘We had a tie for Sir Ian but it’s entirely up to him whether he chooses to wear it on screen and we were very grateful when he did so last year. As for Hero, they gave us no reason why they didn’t want the change.’ The row simmers on between senior Rabbi Yisroel Fine and ECB chairman Giles Clarke as to who said what about England all-rounder Moeen Ali wearing ‘Save Gaza’ and ‘Free Palestine’ wristbands during the third Test against India. Rabbi Fine remains furious with Clarke’s version of their conversation — claiming he never threatened to resign from the MCC. He also berated Clarke, a fluent Arabic speaker who went to university in Damascus, for politicising the issue by criticising Israel’s prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Fine said: ‘Giles Clarke has forfeited any credibility as an unbiased chairman of the ECB by portraying his political prejudices.’ Clarke said: ‘There are two sides to every ghastly story and Rabbi Fine launched a tirade at me about Gaza.

World cricket’s ruling body have controversially split the live rights for the 50-over World Cup, Champions Trophy and T20 World Cup between television and digital in the next contract, starting in 2015. This would mean a far greater viewing reach for the sport, especially in India and North America. But the strategy has upset both BT and Sky, who wanted the opportunity to bid for both rights and not have exclusivity diluted by worldwide online availability. Star: Yahoo and Google are interested in covering international games with players like Chris Gayle in demand . It will certainly affect the British TV companies’ bids for the competitions and the money that trickles down to the English counties as a result of the revamped ICC governance. The England Cricket Board’s attempts to promote women’s cricket have not been helped by Edgbaston’s hosting of a T20 double-header. England men play India on September 7 on the final day of their dismal tour, after the England women’s team have taken on South Africa. Yet the women’s match has not been mentioned on the tickets. Warwickshire blame the omission on uncertainty about the opponents, although the ECB say the women’s match was first discussed in February. Explanation: Friends of Ray Wilkins say his slurred commentary during Arsenal's win against Crystal Palace was due to medicine he takes to help him fight ulcerative colitis and depression . Ray Wilkins's slurred speech during his co-commentary stint for talkSPORT on Arsenal’s late win against Crystal Palace sparked social media claims that the former England star was the worse for wear. Wilkins, following previous allegations about his drink troubles, revealed in Sportsmail last February that he was fighting ulcerative colitis and bouts of depression. And it is the medicines he takes to combat those serious ailments that make him slur his words. Friends say that was the problem Wilkins had to contend with at the Emirates Stadium.","England's greatest all-round cricketer sported the colours of his former football club Scunthorpe United rather than those of Cricket United .

"By . Graeme Yorke . England Women's captain Casey Stoney is hoping to make it easier for more people to come out after speaking at length for the first time about being gay. The Arsenal ladies defender is the latest sportsperson to speak openly about their sexuality after former Aston Villa midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger came out as gay and Olympic diver Tom Daley revealed he was in a relationship with a man. Stoney, who has 116 caps for England, was delighted by the positive response Daley got to his announcement, and is hoping that revelations about sexuality will eventually not be seen as important. Speaking out: England women's captain Casey Stoney insists her sexuality is accepted in football . 'I feel it's really important for me to speak out as a gay player because there are so many young people struggling with being gay,' she told BBC Sport. 'You hear about people taking their own lives because they're homosexual, now that should never happen. They should never feel those pressures. 'How can I expect other people to come out and speak about themselves if I'm not willing to do that myself? Stuck in: Stoney, capped 116 times by her country, hopes future revelations won't be regarded as important . 'Now is the time because I'm in a loving relationship where I feel strong, I feel safe and I don't care what other people think any more.' Stoney's sexuality was not a secret within the game and she is now hoping that the wider world will become more accepting of gay athletes. 'I've never hidden it within football circles because it is accepted,' she said. 'But to the outside world where I've been employed or I've gone to meals and I've gone and met people, I've never spoken about my sexuality.' Helping hand: Stoney says Tom Daley's announcement was positive for sport, as was Thomas Hitzlsperger (R) The 31-year-old said: 'If I can help other people in some way shape or form feel more comfortable or feel at ease with themselves then this is what this is all about, this is the bigger picture. 'It's not about me. I'm comfortable now, it's about making sure we live in a world where it's accepted, we live in a world where it's not news anymore. 'I looked at the response that Tom Daley got and the incredible positive response that he got and I thought ""wow, the world is changing"" and it's time for me to stand up and tell my side of the story.' Meanwhile, Stoney has slammed FIFA’s decision to hold World Cups in Russia and Qatar. She said it was ‘incredible’ the countries will host the tournament in 2018 and 2022 despite their attitudes towards homosexuality. Stoney added: ‘ I can’t imagine how frightened gay people must feel going out there and competing. ‘I won’t be going to Russia or Qatar to watch a World Cup because I wouldn’t be accepted there. It seriously worries me. It’s about educating the people at the top, all the way down.’","England Women's captain speaks out over her sexuality .

"By . David Kent . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has cast doubt over the possibility of a Premier League player being able to reveal they are gay during their playing career.

Coming out: Thomas Hitzlsperger (right) waited until the end of his playing career before revealing he was gay . Wenger says the inevitable scrutiny that would be put on an active player if they came out might discourage them from doing so. 'Because of media interest, maybe no-one will come out,' Wenger told Arsenal magazine. 'He (Hitzlsperger) could not come out during his career which means we still have some progress to make in our game. 'Hitzlsperger should not have had to wait until the end. Debate: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says football still has progress to make on the issue . 'But overall he should not have to come out at all because it should just be considered like anything else. 'It would be good if four, five, six people come out and after that nobody speaks about it anymore because they just think it is people who live their life like they want to live it. 'I think football is there to provoke moments of happiness, excitement and positive experiences in people, no matter where they come from, what colour skin they have, what religion they are or what their preferred sexuality is. 'It's very sad that some people think that this sport should only be reserved for those who have certain characteristics.'","Thomas Hitzlsperger waited until the end of his playing career before revealing he was gay .

Following the deluge of criticism of his facial hair after Saturday’s programme the 53-year-old said he would shave it off, but Danielle Lineker says she is 'wrestling the razor from him'.

But his 35-year-old wife Danielle may have other ideas about him removing the beard and told a friend: ‘Currently wresting the razor from him. Like the Robin Hood look.’ When the former Spurs and Barcelona striker grew a moustache after being dared to by his children a few years ago, it caused an outcry, with one TV viewer saying it made him look ‘like he’s eaten a bowl of iron filings without using his hands’.

"By . Pa Reporter . Craig Gordon insists he has no intention of acting as understudy to Allan McGregor and David Marshall after finally winning back his Scotland place. The Celtic goalkeeper saw his two-year injury nightmare finally come to an end this summer when he signed for the Hoops. And the 40-cap stopper was handed an immediate recall to the Dark Blues set-up when Scots boss Gordon Strachan named him in his squad for Sunday's opening Euro 2016 qualifier with Germany. Ambition: Craig Gordon is fighting for a starting spot after the Celtic keeper was recalled to the Scotland squad . The 31-year-old, however, is at the back of the queue to face the new world champions in Dortmund as Hull's McGregor and Marshall of Cardiff battle it out to be the nation's number one. But former Hearts and Sunderland keeper Gordon is determined to make up for lost time and force his way back into a Scotland jersey. He told the Celtic View: 'It's good competition (with Allan and David) and I enjoy meeting up with the squad. Competition: Gordon is up against Allan McGregor and David Marshall for a starting spot in goal . 'The standard of training among the keepers is fantastic. It's been great to be involved in it and it improves my game as well. 'The next stage is to go there and try to show up well in training and demonstrate that I'm more than capable of holding my own and pushing for a start. 'I don't want to just go along there looking to make up the numbers now that I have been included in the squad. 'I want to put pressure on the other two goalkeepers and try to force myself into contention for a starting spot. 'I wanted to get back in as soon as possible and (the Germany game) was the very first opportunity. I hadn't set myself a goal to try and be in this squad. I wanted to get back in however long it took. 'Now that I have managed to get called up the next goal is to force myself on the park and getting a game.' Gordon is Celtic's new first-choice stopper after Englishman Fraser Forster sealed a £10million switch to Southampton. But he admits his recall to the Scotland squad - which will be without Ipswich's Christophe Berra after the defender withdrew through injury - has come earlier than he thought possible. 'It was a nice to be called back into the squad,' he said. 'I wasn't totally expecting it as I thought it might be a bit early as I have only played a few games but, nevertheless, I have done well enough in those few games to show I am back at a level that could be considered for the Scotland squad.' Strachan's men will have the chance to emulate the famous 1967 team - which included Jim Baxter, Denis Law and Billy Bremner - that defeated England at Wembley if they can become the first side to topple the World Cup winners on Sunday. Germany boss Joachim Low, however, is without former skipper Philipp Lahm, record-breaking frontman Miroslav Klose and Arsenal defender Per Mertesacker after the trio retired following their triumph in Brazil. Depleted: World Cup winning coach Joachim Low will be without key players when they take on Scotland . Gordon said: 'It's a fantastic opportunity to become the unofficial world champions - we have previous for that, beating the World Cup winners straight after the tournament, and hopefully it will be a chance for us to do the same. 'It will be difficult as Germany will want to put on a big show for all their fans after coming back from the World Cup. 'There will be a few new faces to come into their side and a few will have retired, so there will be a few changes there. 'It probably won't cause them too many problems as they have such great strength in depth but it could be something for us to hold on to . 'They have had a pretty settled squad for the last wee while so it will give us a chance to go over there and acquit ourselves well.' Berra, meanwhile, has been forced to pull out of Strachan's group after sustaining a knee injury in the Tractor Boys' 1-1 draw at Derby on Saturday. Strachan has already called up Aberdeen's Mark Reynolds as cover after Berra was kept behind by Ipswich's medical team for further treatment.

Arsenal, Tottenham, Newcastle and Marseille have all registered their interest in signing Nastasic and City want to strike a permanent deal rather than a loan. Moving on?: Matija Nastasic could leave the Etihad with interest from several European clubs . Meanwhile, Micah Richards’s move to Fiorentina depends on the City defender giving his blessing to the deal after the two clubs agreed terms for him to go to Italy on loan until next summer when his contract runs out. Richards flew into Florence on Monday morning. City are also asking for a £1million loan fee which caused West Ham to withdrawn their interest. While the transfer to Fiorentina is only temporary, there is a view to a permanent move.

Vincent Kompany believes Frank Lampard is motivated to end his career in England by helping Manchester City win some silverware this season. The former England midfielder was released by Chelsea after 13 years at Stamford Bridge at the end of last season and joined City on a short-term deal before joining MLS side New York City next year. And Kompany says Lampard – who won three Premier League titles, four FA Cups, two League Cups as well as the Champions League and Europa League at Chelsea – is up for the challenge of helping City retain their title.

I’ve seen so many players go from big clubs in England to Man City. ‘He’s settled in so well and been one of the outstanding players in training.

He added: ‘We like to think we’ve improved. That should be the main thing for us. ‘Every single day I see very successful and talented players still wanting to improve and as long as we keep that mindset the sky is the limit for us!’ City rivals Manchester United had a disappointing season last year finishing outside the Champions League places for the first time in over 20 years. But they have tried to address their problems by appointing Louis van Gaal as manager and spending £160millon on players such as Angel di Maria, Ramadel Falcao, Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw.

"By . Nick Mashiter, Press Association . Gary McAllister believes Coventry's Ricoh return can give them a platform for a Barclays Premier League comeback. The former Sky Blues manager wants the club to unite ahead of their homecoming against Gillingham on Friday. It will end a 13-month exile in Northampton after a rent dispute with the stadium's owners, Arena Coventry Limited, saw them to play 35 miles away. But McAllister, who also made 200 appearances for the club in two spells, thinks the return can provide a catalyst for success. 'It's a one-club city and they don't want to get ahead of themselves but Coventry have a proud history in the Premier League,' he told Press Association Sport. 'It was a club who were established in the Premier League, there were flirtations with relegation but they managed to stave it off until they went down (in 2001). I remember one particular escape at Tottenham (in 1997). 'I hope this pulls everyone together and I'm sure they will get some proper attendances now. There's a good hardcore fanbase in Coventry and they can use that to push back up to where they should be.' Captain: McAllister (right) is embedded in Coventry's history after two spells as a player and one as manager . Hopeful: McAllister (left) alongside David Batty (right) of Leeds United during their playing days . Manager: McAllister (left) was not only a player - he managed the club between 2002-2004 . McAllister was boss at Highfield Road while plans for the Ricoh were put in place but left a year before they moved in during the 2005-06 season. But he can recall the anticipation around the club as they prepared to move from their home of 106 years. 'It's been quite sad seeing the Sky Blues fans up on that bank at Sixfields. I was a fan of Highfield Road, I liked the atmosphere but it was an old stadium,' said the ex-Leeds and Liverpool midfielder, who was in charge of Coventry between 2002 and 2004. 'It was exciting, Highfield Road had served them well but the club needed to move forwards yet it sent them into a downward spiral. With the way it was structured it became very messy and difficult to understand from the outside. 'I'd gone by the time the team went there but I've been invited back and it's a magnificent stadium. 'I know how passionate the Coventry fans are and I had good years there; we had a fantastic side which played nice football and it's good too see they are home.' The Sky Blues are 15th in Sky Bet League One after finishing 18th last season, following a 10 point deduction for exiting administration without agreeing a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Pressley had been heavily linked with the Huddersfield job before Chris Powell was appointed and McAllister knows his fellow Scot has not gone unnoticed. 'It's no surprise when a job comes up Steven's name is mentioned and that's going to continue to happen,' he said. 'People are aware of what he's done under very difficult circumstances.' Home: The Sky Blues will make a triumphant return to the Ricoh Arena this week, after 13 months away . Legend: Coventry hero Darren Huckerby (right) with Arsenal's Matthew Upson (left) And former Highfield Road favourite Darren Huckerby agreed. Huckerby, who made 109 appearances and scored 34 goals during three years with the Sky Blues, also feels they must escape the third tier. 'The manger has done a good job under difficult circumstances and a lot would not have had it,' said the 38-year-old. 'They have to try to get out of League One and back into the Championship because a club of their stature and history should not be knocking around League One. 'And bringing players in now will be more attractive. I don't know what their financial situation is, I'm sure they will be reserved, but showing players around the Ricoh is better than 35 miles away.

Oil and energy magnate Mammadov, who also owns Azerbaijan side FC Baku and French club Lens, exchanged contracts with Wednesday chairman Milan Mandaric on a £40million club takeover in June. Manadaric warned he was ready to pull the plug on the deal last month and the former Portsmouth and Leicester owner has now stated that Mammadov, who is also a sponsor of Spanish champions Atletico Madrid, has been unable to complete a purchase of the club's shares. Disappointed: Milan Mandaric has seen his deal to sell Sheffield Wednesday fall through . Failed bid: Lens owner Hafiz Mammadov was close to taking control  of the Championship club . Mandaric said in a club statement: 'Unfortunately despite working hard with both Mr Mammadov and his representatives since the agreement was signed he has not been able to meet the obligations set out in the contract for either the purchase of the shares or the sponsorship arrangements. 'Our supporters were extremely excited when the takeover was announced, like me they believed that Mr Mammadov offered a great opportunity for the club, in hindsight my desire to please our supporters probably clouded my decision to grant further time for him to complete the process. 'During this period I have continued to manage the business and to fund the ongoing financial requirements of the club as I have always done and will continue to do so. 'As supporters will have seen, we have fully committed to the sponsorship agreement, we are proudly wearing our new shirts with the 'Azerbaijan Land of Fire' logo and this alongside the other advertising inventory will give worldwide coverage to the country. Mixed start: Sheffield Wednesday have claimed eight points from five league games so far this season . 'Whilst I hope that Mr Mammadov will very quickly overcome his difficulties in Azerbaijan, I cannot allow this continued speculation to continue and have asked my legal advisors to take such legal action as they consider necessary. 'The club as always will attract people who are interested in acquiring a top English football club. 'Accordingly, I will explore every serious possibility and if I believe that there is someone who can accelerate our plans to return this club to the Premier League then I will do all in my power to welcome them to Sheffield. 'I believe the legacy I left behind at my previous clubs should give supporters every confidence, if any is needed.' Mammadov, founder of Azerbaijan-based Baghlan Group, vehemently denied reports that he had been held in custody in his homeland due to financial difficulties earlier in the summer. His French club Lens, whose promotion to the top flight was temporarily suspended at the end of last season due to a lack of funds promised by Mammadov, were unable to strengthen their squad before the transfer window closed.

"By . Julian Robinson . and Jack Crone for MailOnline . Surveillance footage is said to prove that John Crawford, pictured,  was holding a toy gun when police shot him dead at a Walmart store . A man shot dead by police in a U.S. supermarket was killed while facing away from officers after he had picked up a toy gun, according to surveillance footage seen by his family and attorney. John Crawford was gunned down on August 5 at a Walmart store in Beavercreek, Ohio, after a shopper contacted police to report that he was waving an A5-15 rifle at customers, including children. But footage of the 22-year-old proves he was in fact holding an unpackaged MK-177 BB rifle he had picked up in the store's toy department. Police claim Mr Crawford ignored their commands to drop what they thought was a weapon, and the former Marine who called the police at the time said Crawford 'looked like he was going to go violently'. But Mr Crawford's family attorney, Michael Wright, claims surveillance footage from the incident, which Ohio's attorney general allowed him to watch with Crawford's family, contradicted those accounts, The Raw Story reports. He said: 'John was doing nothing wrong in Walmart, nothing more, nothing less than shopping.' He added that the surveillance video showed Mr Crawford facing away from officers, talking on the phone, and leaning on the BB gun like a cane when he was 'shot on sight' in 'militaristic' fashion. This appears to fit with in with the account of LeeCee Johnson, who claims to be the mother of Mr Crawford's two children. She said she was speaking to him on the phone when the incident occurred. She told Dayton Daily News: 'We was just talking. He said he was at the video games playing videos and he went over there by the toy section where the toy guns were. 'And the next thing I know, he said ""It's not real"", and the police start shooting and they said ""Get on the ground"", but he was already on the ground because they had shot him. 'And I could hear him just crying and screaming. I feel like they shot him down like he was not even human.' Ohio Attorney General, Mike DeWine, announced yesterday that the case will now be handed to a special prosecutor to present to a grand jury on September 22. Beavercreek Police and Ohio Attorney General's Office initially insisted officers at the scene acted appropriately. After the shooting, Chief Dennis Evers, said: 'Officers confronted the subject inside the store area near the pet supplies holding a rifle. The officers gave verbal command to the subject to drop the weapon. 'The subject later identified as John Crawford was shot after failing to comply with the officer's commands.' John Crawford was shopping in Wal-Mart (shown in a file image) in Beavercreek, Ohio when he was shot dead . Sergeant David Darkow, one of the officers involved in the shooting, has already been allowed to resume his duties while another officer, Sean Williams, remains on administrative leave. Mr Crawford's cousin Lamon Brown says the family has contacted human rights group the NAACP as well as National Action Network. The family has also asked the U.S. Justice Department to open a civil rights investigation and assess whether the shooting was justified and whether race played a factor. Tasha Thomas, who has said she was Mr Crawford's current girlfriend, confirmed he was not armed when he walked into the store and that she was in another aisle when the incident happened. In a recorded call made to police, a voice says: 'There is a gentleman walking around with a gun in the store. ... He's, like, pointing it at people.' Later in the call, sounds like gunshots can be heard, followed by someone screaming for people to leave. Authorities say another customer also died after suffering a medical problem during the evacuation of the store. Police identified her as Angela Williams, 37, of Fairborn. Wal-Mart spokesman Brooke Buchanan say the company is working with investigators and is 'deeply saddened about the loss of life'.","John Crawford was shot dead by police at Walmart in Beavercreek, Ohio .

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Lance Armstrong has admitted that he would still be lying about doping if a federal investigation had never found him out. The disgraced cyclist, who used performance-enhancing drugs to cheat his way to a record seven successive Tour de France titles after recovering from cancer, said that his lies would still be spiralling if the truth had not been uncovered two years ago. He told CNN in a phone interview: 'Once you say ""no"" you have to keep saying ""no"". If this stuff hadn’t taken place with the federal investigation, I’d probably still be saying ""no"" with the same conviction and tone as before. But that gig is up.' 'I'd probably still be saying ""no""': Lance Armstrong has admitted that he would still be lying about doping if he had not been found out by a federal investigation in 2012 . He went on to say that he would not has confessed even to his children: 'Well, that’s a conversation for my kids. But there was a lot of stuff in that lie, not simply me saying, ""no"". I couldn’t change the story.' Armstrong is serving a lifetime ban from sport, and said he is surprised at how he is able to go about his daily life without being taunted or heckled for what he did. 'I never get crap, not once, and I'm surprised by that,' he said. 'Sure, I sometimes get the vibe that someone wants to say something but it's never happened.' A cancer survivor and once hero to millions, Armstrong was stripped of his seven Tour de France victories and banned for life from racing in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sporting history. Toughing it up: He admits to having an 'f-you' attitude, but the disgraced cyclist insists he 'never gets crap' from people following his long-awaited admission of long-term doping . The investigation and later admission to doping destroyed Armstrong's reputation and career. He admitted that he has to accept that he has lost all credibility from the revelations. 'I don’t blame anyone for thinking, ""I don’t trust this guy with all his bulls*** for ten years"",' he said. However, he still feels harshly done by in his punishments when compared with other riders who have also been caught doping. 'I think most people are smart enough to say: ""That doesn’t make any sense"",' he said. 'What stands out in a lot of people’s minds is that we all know what happened in those other years, but those [results] still stand.' Armstrong and his team of lawyers are about to face several civil lawsuits that could drain his huge fortune. Bleak outlook: There's no hope of him ever riding competitively again and he is facing civil lawsuits to the tune of tens of millions of dollars . In June a federal judge rejected Armstrong's bid to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit claiming that he and his former cycling team, which the U.S. Postal Service had sponsored, defrauded the government in a scheme to use banned, performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong claims the U.S. Postal Service benefited hugely from the exposure it got from its sponsorship and that the lawsuit had been brought too late. The lawsuit has potential $100 million ramifications for a man who was previously one of the world's wealthiest sports stars. 'I'm very confident that that`s a winner for us,' said Armstrong. 'I don't think anyone can truly argue the U.S. Postal Service was damaged. 'They made a lot of money in the deal and got what they bargained for. 'I worked my ass off for them and I'm proud of it. Furthermore there wasn't a technical relationship between myself and the U.S. Postal Service.' Reboot: Armstrong hopes to restart his charity work, undergo a course of therapy and says he is planning on writing a book where he will 'put it all out there' Armstrong has said he now plans to write another book, which unlike his last effort, 'It's Not About the Bike', will be totally honest. 'I need to write a book and it needs to be pretty raw. I need to put it out there and let it sit. The sooner the better. It has to be the right book, the right tone and there has to be totally no b-s,' he said. He added that he sees writing as a kind of therapy that will help see him through the next few years, and that he is 'fully committed to putting it all out there.' Asked about seeking actual therapy, the 42-year-old said: 'My therapy is riding my bike, playing golf and having a beer. I haven’t gotten around to it. I get it totally, but it’s not something that’s taken place yet.' Armstrong relishes a good fight, and claims it is this spirit that made him the cyclist he was. 'I definitely have an 'f-you' attitude,' he said. 'I fight in training, I fight to win races, I fight to motivate the guys in the team.'

A number have asked whether his public mea culpa on Oprah was genuine and if he needs to do more. 'That's a difficult one for me to answer,' he said. 'You can't do justice in a one-hour conversation. It was a situation for a lot of people that it was too much information, but for other people - cycling fans, sports fans, for other parts of the population - it wasn't enough, I didn't go far enough.'

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . and Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie is again in the spotlight after she refused to apologise for warning of a Chinese invasion of Australia. Ms Lambie says she will not say sorry over her comments despite her leader, Billionaire MP Clive Palmer making an apology for his bizarre anti-China rant. Mr Palmer was forced to say sorry to the 'Chinese people everywhere' for last week describing China's government as 'mongrels' and 'b***ards' who shoot their own people. PUP Senator Jacqui Lambie speaks during a public hearing at Parliament House in Canberra . Leader of the Palmer United Party (PUP) Clive Palmer (pictured centre) poses with his PUP senators Dio Wang (far left), Jacqui Lambie (left) and Glenn Lazarus (far right) along with Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party (AMEP) senator Ricky Muir (right) after a press conference . The Tasmanian Senator, Ms Lambie said the PUP leader had little choice because, 'people are still quite irate about his comments'. However, a simple apology was not on the cards, in which she said Australia needed to double the size of it military to 'stop our grandchildren from becoming slaves to an aggressive, anti-democratic totalitarian foreign power'. 'I'm not backing down'. she said. 'I don't see why I would offer an apology when I'm actually speaking about the Chinese communist regime and not the Chinese people,' she told ABC Radio. 'I'm very grateful to the Chinese people and having them as trading partners, and I certainly know my Tasmania is'. After coming under increasing fire for his bizarre rant last Monday night, Clive Palmer has delivered a letter to the Chinese Ambassador 'His Excellency Mr MA Zhaoxu'. In it he says: 'I most sincerely apologise for any insult to the Chinese people caused by any of the language I used during my appearance on the ABC television program Q&A. Scroll down for video . 'I regret any hurt or anguish such comments may have caused any party and I look forward to greater understanding for peace and cooperation in the future.' He went on to say that 'we always must have an open mind' and that 'I now come to the realisation that what I said on Q&A was an insult to Chinese people everywhere and I wish to assure them they have my most genuine and sincerely apology, that I am sorry that I said the things I said on the program.' Clive Palmer had said about the Chinese that 'they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country', now he says sorry and that 'it is in the interest of the whole world that Australia and China have good relations'. Clive Palmer in the middle of THAT rant on ABC television against the Chinese. Today he's done a complete backflip, apologising in a letter to the Chinese Ambassador, conceding he had insulted ""Chinese people everywhere' Friends again.  This is a picture from back in 2009 where Clive Palmer and Junhua Wu of Metallurgical Corporation of China celebrated the China First mining venture. He also added that 'it is in the interest of the whole world that Australia and China have good relations'. Mr Palmer had been roundly criticised for the rant and his comments labelled 'racist'. Several community leaders and Coalition MPs said the tirade could hurt Australia's trade relationship with China. The Palmer United Party leader tried to appease those critics by suggesting his comments were directed against CITIC Pacific, with whom he's locked in a series of legal disputes, even going as far as tweeting his position. On Lambie's comment, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped the senator would follow Mr Palmer's belated apology. 'I hope that Senator Lambie likewise reflects on the comments that she's made and the potential for harm with one of our largest trading partners,' she told ABC radio. Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce is travelling to China next week and expects to be quizzed about the 'unhelpful' comments. Mr Joyce hoped Australia's trade talks with China would not be affected. Clive Palmer tried to fend off claims he was racist after the rant last Monday by saying on Twitter that the comments were aimed at a Chinese company only . CITIC has accused Mr Palmer of using $12 million to fund his election campaign in 2013. The verbal spray included him calling Chinese people 'bastards' and 'mongrels' who 'shoot their own people'. 'The Chinese government wants to bring workers here to destroy our wage system ... they want to take over our ports and get our resources for free. So far they've shifted $200 million worth of iron ore out of this country without paying for it. I don't mind standing up against the Chinese bastards and stop them from doing it,' he said. He then claimed he was owed 'about $500 million by the Communist Chinese government.' 'We'll be suing them and they'll be answering the questions. We've had... an arbitration against these Chinese mongrels - I'm saying that because they're Communist, they shoot their own people, they haven't got a justice system and they want to take over this country. And we're not going to let them,' he said. In an attempt to smooth things over, foreign Minister Julie Bishop told the Chinese embassy that 'these were the comments of one Member of Parliament and not representative'. The PM also chimed in by calling them 'over the top, shrill and wrong'. Mr Palmer will hope his letter of apology will bring to an end a forgettable fortnight for his party with his problems exacerbated by star Senate recruit Glenn Lazarus being forced to fend off plagiarism claims and Jacqui Lambie's suggestions Australia needed to significantly boost its military presence or risk 'letting our grandchildren become slaves'.","Palmer United Party Senator has refused to apologise for warning of a Chinese invasion of Australia .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard for MailOnline . Seven specks of stardust from outside the solar system have been brought back to Earth for the first time. These tiny grains, some of which are a millionth of a millionth of a gram, could help scientists explain how solar systems form. Scientists believe they were created in a supernova explosion millions of years ago and altered by eons of exposure to the extremes of space. The largest interstellar dust track found in the Stardust spacecraft collectors was this 35 micron-long hole produced by a tiny speck of stardust that was probably travelling so fast that it vaporised upon impact . 'No one has caught stuff from outside the solar system and returned it to Earth before,' Anton Kearsley, microanalyst at the Natural History Museum told MailOnline. Their tiny size, meant they took six years to find. 'For perspective, you can fit a billion of these in a grain of sand,' he said. Interstellar dust thrown out by exploding stars is believed to scatter the heavy elements necessary for life - such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen - across the galaxy. After a life cycle of millions of years, the dust can lead to planetary formation and acts as a key component in the evolution of the galaxy, researchers claim. The left image shows on the interstellar dust impacts in the foil aboard the Stardust spacecraft. The crater is about 280 nanometres across; 400 of these craters would span the width of a human hair. The right image shows one of the specs of stardust with crystalline mineral olivine (pink), made from magnesium . In this sense, everyone on Earth is partly made from stardust. 'They are very precious particles,' said lead researcher Dr Andrew Westphal, from the University of California at Berkeley. Interstellar dust thrown out by exploding stars is believed to scatter the heavy elements necessary for life - such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen - across the galaxy. After a life cycle of millions of years, the dust can lead to planetary formation and acts as a key component in the evolution of the galaxy, researchers claim. These tiny grains, some of which are a millionth of a millionth of a gram, could help scientists explain how dust clouds collapse to create solar systems. 'Fundamentally, the solar system and everything in it was ultimately derived from a cloud of interstellar gas and dust. 'We're looking at material that's very similar to what made our solar system.' These particles, collected by the Stardust spacecraft, are much more diverse in terms of chemical composition and structure than first thought. For instance, some of the larger ones had a snowflake-like 'fluffy' structure, said the researchers, writing in the journal Science. 'The fact that the two largest fluffy particles have crystalline material - a magnesium-iron-silicate mineral called olivine - may imply that these are particles that came from the disks around other stars and were modified in the interstellar medium,' said Dr Westphal. 'We seem to be getting our first glimpse of the surprising diversity of interstellar dust particles, which is impossible to explore through astronomical observations alone.' Nasa's Stardust spacecraft (artist's impression pictured) was launched in 1999 to fly through the coma - the envelope of gas and dust - surrounding comet Wild-2. Using a 'fly paper' technique, it was designed to catch cometary dust in tiles of soft aerogel separated by pieces of aluminium foil . Mr Kearsley said knowing what the dust is made from, and its structure, could will help understand some of the fundamental mysteries of how dust and gas lead to star and planet formation. 'Our solar system is ramming its way through interstellar space. As it's going, it collecting these grains,' said Mr Kearsley. The dust coughed up by stars during their death throes has always been a mystery to scientists. But trying to analyse the behaviour of this interstellar material involves going into deep space - and up until now that has hindered efforts to understand it. Earlier this year researchers at Nasa found a way around this problem by designing a machine that can create interstellar dust from scratch here on Earth. The device, dubbed Cosmic, could help astronomers better understand the types of grains that form around stars. Along with the latest discovery, scientists hope they can understand more about interstellar dust and how it forms into planet and other cosmic bodies. 'For me, the most interesting thing is that some of these little grains may tell us whether any of the dust we are seeing came directly from supernova explosions outside our solar system,' Mr Kearsley told MailOnline. 'Knowing the structure and composition of the particle will help us calculate the temperatures of giant dust clouds. This is important because it lets you know what kinds of reactions go inside them – how they evolve, collapse, and how solar systems can form.' Nasa's Stardust spacecraft was launched in 1999 to fly through the coma - the envelope of gas and dust - surrounding comet Wild-2. Using a 'fly paper' technique, it was designed to catch cometary dust in tiles of soft aerogel separated by pieces of aluminium foil. A similar collector was placed on the rear of the probe to collect particles from streams of interstellar dust flowing through the galaxy. Both collectors were dropped by parachute and recovered after Stardust returned to Earth in 2006. Volunteers with home computers, who called themselves 'dusters', were invited to help the professionals scan more than a million dust-track images. The citizen science project, dubbed Stardust@home, proved critical to the needle-in-a-haystack search. Dust grains that form around dying stars and are thrown out into the cosmos can lead to the formation of planets and are a key component of the universe's evolution. Stars are pictured here in the Orion Nebula . Scientists identified just seven particles that were likely to have had an interstellar origin. Three either lodged or left traces within the aerogel while the remains of four others were found in pits in the aluminium foil. These particles were a tenth of the size of comet dust, measuring up to two thousandths of a millimetre across, and varied in composition. Three particles from in the search contained sulphur compounds which some astronomers argue should not be found in interstellar dust. Describing the dust residues discovered in the foil, Dr Rhonda Stroud from the US Naval Research Laboratory said: 'They were splatted a bit but the majority of the particles were still there at the bottom of the crater. 'Their diversity was a surprise, but also these fluffy particles, sort of like a tossed salad, were complex, an agglomeration of other particles, rather than one dense particle suggested by the simplest models of interstellar particles.' 'The key thing is this is just the start,' said Mr Kearsley. 'We didn't really know for certain we were going to find this material…it really is breaking completely new ground.'","Seven grains of cosmic dust have been captured by Stardust spacecraft .

"By . Lizzie Parry for MailOnline . A teenager plagued by bullies over a dip in his chest claims he nearly died when doctors found his heart had started to grow around a metal bar inserted to disguise his sunken chest. Euan Russell opted for the cosmetic procedure to have the bar fitted when he was 15 years old. But when his heart started to beat 'like a slush machine', Euan claims doctors found his heart was growing around the metal and was just one centimetre away from killing him. Euan said he underwent the first ever emergency surgery to remove a metal bar from the heart, miraculously surviving the 16-hour heart bypass operation. Euan Russell, 18, was bullied over a severe dip in his breastbone. Determined to beat the bullies he opted for a cosmetic procedure to have a metal bar fitted to correct the dip. But he claims after noticing an irregular heartbeat, doctors told him his heart had started to grow around the metal bar leaving him close to death . Euan, now 18, said: 'When I woke up from the surgery I screamed ""I'm alive"". 'I didn't think I was going to come through it. Nobody expected me to come through it. 'It had never happened in medical history. I had eight consultants during the operation. 'I felt unlucky but also lucky at the same time. I felt lucky to be alive but unlucky that this had happened to me.' Euan was born with pectus excavatum - an abnormal development of the rib cage where the breastbone caves in, resulting in a sunken chest wall deformity. The teenager, from Cresswell in Northumberland, first started to research the operation to raise his swollen chest condition in 2011. 'The condition started to get on my nerves,' he said. 'It affected my confidence hugely because in PE all the lads would stare and point at me. 'Girls would be put off by it which felt awful. So I started to look into the operation.' Euan underwent the 'Nuss' procedure at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle on the NHS, to insert the bar and correct the position of his ribs on September 23, 2011. But months later in February 2012, Euan was found to be suffering an inflammation of his heart sac, as a result of the previous operation. The bar put pressure on his heart causing it to inflame and he needed a further operation to remove fluid. When Euan was 15 he went into the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle to have the cosmetic operation. But months later in February 2012 he was found to be suffering inflammation of the heart sac . A year after his first operation, Euan said he noticed his heart making a strange noise. He said: 'The doctor said ""the bar has flipped around and gone into your heart""... My heart was growing around the bar and if it moved a centimetre to the right or to the left it could have killed me' He said: 'I knew something wasn't right. My heart was beating at 212 beats per minute. It is only supposed to beat between 60 and 80 per minute. 'I was admitted to hospital again with peritonitis and I underwent a second operation to reposition the bar. 'After the surgery I had to have a little bucket of heart juice next to me or three days while fluid was drained from my heart. 'I started to feel really down. Everything was going wrong and I thought the whole world was coming down around me.' Pectus excavatum is a condition in which a person's breastbone is sunken into his or her chest. In severe cases, it can look as though the centre of the chest has been scooped out, leaving a deep dent. While the sunken breastbone is often noticeable shortly after birth, it worsens as the child enters adolescent. It is more common in boys than girls and severe cases can eventually interfere with the function of the heart and lungs. Even in mild cases, the condition can make young people feel self-conscious about their appearance. Surgery can help correct the deformity. Source: Mayo Clinic . Within time Euan's health began to improve and he started to visit the gym and put on weight. But his condition went downhill in September 2013 when Euan started to notice his heart making a strange noise. Euan, who has two sisters Louise, 21, and Alice, 23, said: 'The day before I was due to go back to school after summer I heard my heart beating and it was not a normal sound. 'It sounded like a slush machine. I went downstairs and told my step-dad Richard, who is a doctor, and he told me it was a heart murmur and I should get it checked out. 'I booked an appointment for  September 7 and what should have only been a five or 10-minute check up lasted half an hour. 'I was kept in hospital for two or three days before anybody told me what was going on. 'The doctor said ""the bar has flipped around and gone into your heart"". 'It didn't feel real. It was a surprise as I thought I was in the best health I had ever been. 'My heart was growing around the bar and if it moved a centimetre to the right or to the left it could have killed me. 'I had to go for an emergency heart bypass operation. My mum didn't think I was going to come through it.' Euan survived the dramatic surgery and the bar was removed from his chest. One year on, he is looking forward to studying photographic journalism at Leeds Metropolitan University. He said: 'It's been a hell of a journey and I am absolutely over the moon to be able to start the next stage of my life. 'I still have a dint in my chest but I cannot care less what it looks like now as I am lucky to be here.' Sasha Stamenkovic, consultant thoracic surgeon at the Freeman Hospital, said: 'Mr Russell had a routine operation placing a rib bar for a chest wall deformity in December 2011. 'He was kept under review and in September 2013 unfortunately succumbed to a known complication of bar “migration”, whereby the bar is enveloped by the growing heart immediately behind it (it is for this reason that the bar is removed between two and three years post-operatively). 'As a result of this complication he had an urgent (not emergency) operation to remove the bar which took place following a multi-disciplinary team discussion. 'After surgery he made a quick recovery and was seen again in clinic to monitor his progress.'","Euan Russell was born with pectus excavatum - an abnormal development of the rib cage where the breastbone caves in .

"By . Binky Felstead . Have you ladies ever spent ages perfecting your make-up before a night out only to find that when the photos emerge on Facebook the next day, your face looks washed out and greasy? Very annoying and happens to me all the time! Flashing camera lights can really wash you out, so make-up for camera needs to be amped up so  it's a lot bolder and the colours more vivid. I recently shot the images for my official 2015 calendar, and as I knew I was going to be posing up in sexy Bluebella lingerie, I opted for high-octane glamour: sultry, smokey eyes, chiseled cheekbones and cascading curls. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This week Binky shows you how to get the high glamour look from her calender shoot . So this week I thought I'd take you through the make-up look I wore for the shoot. If you're off to a ball or special event, give this look a go and you'll look equally as fabulous in the photos as you did on the night. Here's how to do it: . Step 1 – Flawless Face . The base is the key component to a picture-perfect make-up look, so always start proceedings with a good quality primer like Daniel Sandler Retexturising Face Primer. This will reduce the appearance of pores and provide a velvety smooth canvas for the rest of your make-up. A full-coverage foundation is a photoshoot essential, and so my make-up artist applied DiorSkin Forever Foundation using the Real Techniques Buffing Brush. Binky says it can be hard to achieve a heavy makeup look on a shoot  without looking washed out by camera flashes . The long-wearing formula makes it the ideal foundation for a special event or night out. If necessary, conceal any dark circles under your eyes with Clarins Instant Light Brush-On Perfector. Set your flawless complexion in place with a translucent powder such as Vichy Dermablend Setting Powder, which will give your base a matte yet natural-looking finish and significantly prolong its wear. The camera will definitely be your friend with this grease-proof complexion combo! Step 2 – Crafty Contouring . Thanks to the glorious beauty invention that is contouring, we can all fake razor-sharp cheekbones like Kate Moss'. My go-to contour product is Daniel Sandler's Sculpt and Slim Contour Kit, which I wore on the shoot. Using an angled brush, gently brush the darker contour colour just below your cheekbones – suck your cheeks in and apply the colour to the hollowed area, following the natural downward line. Binky used heavy contouring to fake razor-sharp cheek bones . A good tip is to use the centre of your eye as a guide to where you should stop the contour, and make sure you blend the lines out with a fluffy brush for a natural finish. You can also sweep the colour across your temples and along your jawline for a supermodel-style chiselled effect, or down the sides of your nose to slim it down. Next, highlight the high points of your face – your cheekbones, brow bones and the centre of your nose – with the shimmery champagne shade in the Daniel Sandler palette. Binky says it is important to set your foundation with a translucent powder . Step 3 – Alluring Eyes . The make-up artist opted to enhance my green eyes with some smokey shadow in a similar emerald hue, using the Dior 5 Couleurs Eyeshadow Palette in Royal Kaki. Pack the colour onto a fluffy brush and gently dab it atop your eyelid – apply as many layers as you need for a vivid wash of colour before smoothing it out with a blending brush. Then, for a seductive stare, define the outer corners of your eyes with a slightly darker shade and blend out again. Wearing colour on your lids can make your peepers pop in a way mascara alone cannot, so if you tend to stick to neutral eyeshadow tones I suggest you grab a palette and have a play around; you may be surprised with the results! Binky went for a sultry smoky-eye look to pair with her lingerie themed calender . Next, carefully line your upper and lower lash lines with a black liquid or gel liner like Guerlain Liquid Eyeliner, extending the line slightly outwards from your upper lash line for a sultry feline effect. Finally, for full, flirtatious lashes, apply a couple of coats of Too Faced Lash Injection Mascara. Step 4 – Luscious Lips . Too much colour on both the lids and lips can sometimes look a tad extreme, especially if you're off to a formal event, so I usually advise teaming a smokey eye with a failsafe yet super-sexy nude lip. Line your lips first with a pencil in a shade similar to the lip colour you're using – I used Daniel Sandler Automatic Long-Lasting Lip Liner in Taffy – then apply your lipstick with a small lip brush in layers for a full, pronounced pout. Binky recommends applying a couple of coats of mascara in order to achieve flirtatious lashes . For the shoot, I opted for Clarins Rouge Eclat lipstick in Nude Rose – it's one of my favourite lipsticks, offering intense, highly pigmented colour that lasts for hours. And there you have it - say goodbye to being camera-shy and hello to turning heads all night long! You can get all the products I used from online beauty boutique Escentual.com. My official 2015 calendar is out in September and I can't wait for you all to see it. If you can't wait until then, though, make sure you check back here next week for some exclusive snaps and behind-the-scenes footage from the shoot! Lots of love, .

"By . Kate Lyons for Daily Mail Australia . With the average Australian wedding now costing around $36,000, it pays to shop around. An undercover investigation by Choice has discovered that brides are routinely charged more for services than other customers, with vendors charging up to $8,000 more if they know the event they're catering was a wedding. Despite the price discrepancies discovered in the investigation, the situation has improved somewhat for brides, compared to five years ago, when Choice last conducted an investigation into wedding costs.  This has been put down to increased competition in the industry as more ‘hobbyists' enter the wedding business. To test the added charges attracted by weddings, Choice hired two shadow shoppers to source quotes from venues, photographers, florists, hire car companies, cake companies and photo booth hire companies across a range of demographics in both Sydney and Melbourne. Vendors charge considerably more if they know the event they are catering for is a wedding rather than another gathering . Caitlyn approached vendors telling them she was planning a low-key wedding for 80 people and asking them how much each item would cost. Nikki then approached the same vendors a week later asking them for a quote on the same item on the same day, but telling them she was hosting a 40th birthday party for her partner. The wedding-shopper was quoted prices significantly higher than the woman shopping for a party, across almost all categories. Venue . Both women approached venues, asking them for a quote on a three-course, sit-down dinner. Three of the six venues approached by the shoppers charged Caitlyn more when they discovered she was planning a wedding. One quoted her $9,600 compared to $7,200 quoted to Nikki for the party; another quoted $1,700 for the wedding and $1,300 for the party. A third venue told Caitlyn they could not do a price-per-head for her wedding, but would instead charge her between $12,000 and $18,000 for the event. But when the same venue was approached by Nikki a week later they said they could cater her event for $125 per person, a total cost of $10,000 for 80 people, thousands of dollars cheaper than the quote offered to Caitlyn. One cake company quoted Caitlyn $590 for a wedding cake and Nikki $220 for an identical 'birthday cake' Cake . Both women approached six cake companies and asked the price of a white chocolate mud cake to feed 80 people with flowers on top to be delivered on the same day. In two cases the bride was quoted significantly more than the other woman: Caitlyn was quoted $590 compared to $220 for Nikki and another shop quoted Caitlyn $670, whereas Nikki was told the same cake would cost her between $500 and $600. Hire car companies approached by the two women also charged extra if they knew the event was a wedding. Hire car . Six hire car companies were approached and were asked how much it would cost to pick them up at an inner-city suburb and drop off an hour away. Three of those six companies told Caitlyn, the wedding-shopper, that they did not do one-hour call-outs and so only provided her with quotes for three-hour call-outs, despite her insistence she only wanted the car for one hour. But those same companies were happy to provide a one-hour quote to Nikki, the party-shopper. One company quoted Caitlyn  $1,500 compared to $650 for Nikki; another quoted Caitlyn $990 compared to $300 for Nikki; and the third company quoted Caitlyn $1,000 and Nikki $450, meaning that Caitlyn was quoted up to $850 more because she wanted the cars for a wedding rather than a 40th birthday party. The graph shows the average difference in the amount brides are charged for elements of their wedding, compared to the amount charged to someone throwing a non-wedding event . Venues charged people dramatically different prices depending whether or not the event was a wedding . Photographer . Like the hire car companies, some photographers were unwilling to be flexible when it came to a wedding package, whereas they were more willing to be flexible for a birthday party. Because wedding photographers often spend the whole day with a couple, in order to make the comparison fair, Caitlyn, the wedding-shopper told photographers she was having a very informal wedding and that a photographer was only required at the reception to capture the festivities and some semi-formal photos of friends and family with the bride and groom for two hours. Nikki then approached the same photographers to ask if they would attend the birthday party for two hours to capture photos of the festivities and some semi-formal shots of family and friends. Two photographers told both women that they would not accept a booking for just two hours. One photographer quoted $400 to the bride without a confirmed venue, yet told the party girl he wouldn't provide a quote until she confirmed the venue. One Sydney  photographer quoted Nikki, the party-shopper $1495 for two hours, but quoted Caitlyn $4750 for a five-hour package, despite her insistence that she only needed someone for two hours. This photographer tried to put emotional pressure on Caitlyn to accept the five-hour package, being told ‘this is the most amazing day of your life – we capture that emotion, we tell that story. You can go back and relive the whole day through the photos'. Photo booth . Photo booth vendors were generally fair to brides, with all of them quoting the same prices to both Caitlyn and Nikki, with the exception of one Photo booth company, which added an extra $50 fee onto the quote for the wedding. Flowers . To make the comparison fair, the florists were presented with identical requests - white flowers to decorate the tables, with Caitlyn telling the florists a friend would be making her bouquet. So that the quotes were comparable, Caitlyn would approach a florist and ask for recommendations of white flowers and when Nikki would approach the same florist a week later, she would request arrangements using the same flowers, to account for seasonal variation. The overall cost of white flowers to decorate eight tables ranged from $600 to $1,200 and florists quoted the same prices to both Caitlyn and Nikki. The investigation found that flowers were generally exempt from a 'wedding' premium .","Vendors charge more for the same services if they know the event they are catering is a wedding .

"By . James Andrew for the Daily Mail . There is a new game being played at Fulham this season and it’s called ‘Felix bingo’. The concept is simple, guess the starting XI before boss Felix Magath names his side for the game. And with 25 players used already this season it’s easy to see why it’s a game with no winners, which includes the German manager. VIDEO Scroll down for Magath: Players not committed are welcome to leave (Archive) Changes: Felix Magath has used 25 players so far this season... it's no wonder Fulham haven't won yet . Not clicking: The draw against Cardiff compounded Magath's misery at Craven Cottage on Saturday . He has made multiple changes in every game this season — but is yet to find a winning formula. Players have started matches one week and not made the bench the next. And after Saturday’s 1-1 draw with Cardiff, Magath admitted he is waiting for Monday's transfer deadline to pass before he can know for sure which players he will have to work with and from there he can figure out his best XI. So it is easy to see why Fulham remain second bottom of the SkyBet Championship after five games. The former Bayern Munich boss is quick to point to the major overhaul of his squad this summer, with 13 new arrivals and 17 players departing, leaving Scott Parker as the only survivor who played regularly last season. And the changes do not stop there, with Magath targeting three additions to his squad in the final hours of the transfer window, after failed £12million experiment Kostas Mitroglou went back to Olympiacos on loan. Despite Magath believing promotion is still possible, their slow start to the season could cost Fulham a quick return to the top flight. Leader of men: Scott Parker is the only man who played regularly last season who has featured so far . Delight: Cardiff players celebrate with Kenwyne Jones after his equaliser . Changes to the squad were long overdue and the promotion of six players from last season’s FA Youth Cup final side has to be applauded. But at the moment whichever 11 players are handed a starting place, the team does not seem to be gelling. There were glimpses in the first 45 minutes on Saturday that things were coming together and a lot of the football was easy on the eye as Tim Hoogland gave Fulham the lead. But they remain vulnerable to being outmuscled and they lacked the strength and experience to see the game through as Kenwyne Jones scored his fourth goal of the campaign to earn Cardiff a point. Only Parker and big-money signing Ross McCormack have experience of playing in the Championship and that lack of knowhow in a demanding division is costing Fulham. Championship experience: But £11m man Ross McCormack still hasn't scored this season in the league . Magath remains defiant and insists he is not just the right man for Fulham — but also the only man. But poor results inevitably lead to unrest in the stands and the fans are not happy with the way things are going. Magath was met with a chorus of boos — not for the first time this season — from pockets of the Craven Cottage faithful at the final whistle. As a Fulham fan myself, the decline in the last 18 months has been very difficult to watch. In the end relegation was almost a relief as we were put out of our misery. Four years is a very long time in football, and the days when European heavyweights such as Juventus, Shakhtar Donetsk and Hamburg were put to the sword by Roy Hodgson’s side as Fulham reached the 2010 Europa League final are now just a memory. Struggling to adapt: A slide down the divisions isn't off the cards... Reality for Fulham is a side that is struggling to adapt to life outside the top tier and the only joy this season has come from beating Brentford in the Capital One Cup. The feeling is things could get worse before they get better at Craven Cottage. Magath cannot be blamed for relegation last season, but now this is his squad and he cannot hide from the position Fulham are in. Whether he is the right man to lead Fulham into this new era remains to be seen. But his first job must be to settle on his best side or the slide down the divisions will continue quicker than their rapid assent 17 years ago. PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Nottingham Forest's win over Sheffield Wednesday kept Stuart Pearce’s side top of the Championship. Any pre-season disagreements between Pearce and owner Fawaz al-Hasawi over the sales of Jamaal Lascelles and Karl Darlow to Newcastle have been put to one side. And Henri Lansbury’s goal gave Forest a 1-0 win at Hillsborough against a Wednesday side who had not lost in the league this season. Top performers: Nottingham Forest kept up their unbeaten start  with a 1-0 win against Sheffield Wednesday . WHAT'S CAUGHT MY EYE . Andre Gray scored 30 goals for Luton to fire them into the Football League and he proved his class by scoring his first Championship goal for new side Brentford as they beat Rotherham for their second win of the season. Peterborough maintained their unbeaten away record in the league at Colchester with an impressive 3-1 win. Posh lost Britt Assombalonga to Nottingham Forest but are doing OK without him. MK Dons like playing the Red Devils. Having shocked Manchester United with a 4-0 win in the Capital One Cup midweek, Karl Robinson’s side beat Crawley, a team with the same nickname, 2-0.","Fulham have used 25 players so far this season... they can't gel .

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . It's a staple dairy substitute and increasingly said to be a 'superfood' able to cure an array of ailments from heart disease to Altzheimers. And as well as coconut water, milk, yoghurt, sugar, flesh and oil, new coconut-based food and beauty products are popping up every day in supermarkets and health food shops. Hoping to deliver simplified, science-based analysis, weight and health management website vavista.com have enlisted their expert to cautiously debunk or back up claims about this tropical ingredient. Here, registered dietician Sophie Classens explains the pros and cons of including various coconut products in your shopping basket. Scroll down for video . New coconut-based food and beauty products are popping up every day . The juice found in the middle of a cracked coconut is now marketed as a highly hydrating fluid. It has less sugar than fruit juices and more minerals such as potassium, sodium, magnesium and calcium. These properties are great as a post-workout drink if you've only been doing moderate exercise, but there isn't enough protein or carbohydrate if you're undergoing vigorous exercise of over 1 hour. Ultimately, coconut water contains calories - do you need these? If you're drinking purely for hydration, water is always the better choice. You can get the minerals from a well-balanced diet so I wouldn't drink this religiously, but if you enjoy it, have one occasionally. Rebel Kitchen Matcha green tea mylk, £1.89, one of the newest coconut-milk based health drinks . This is becoming more and more popular and can be bought from supermarkets now. It can be used for roasting and baking. It has a similar nutritional profile to butter in that it has a high saturated fat content which is currently being discovered to be less harmful to health than initially thought, particularly the type of saturated fats which are found in coconut oil: Lauric acid and Myristic acid. Coconut oil also contains some poly and mono-unsaturated fats which bring additional health benefits. It is still an energy-dense food so should be used in moderation. This can be used instead of sugar in baking. It has a lower GI than standard granulated sugar, however a similar kcal content per gram. It may be a healthier alternative to traditional granulated sugar, however it is still an energy-dense food-type which should only be used on special occasions. This is a fairly new dairy-free alternative, great for those who are lactose-intolerant and who fancy a change from the soya varieties! It is much higher in fat than both natural dairy yoghurt and soya yoghurts, but also much lower in carbohydrates; research is now beginning to find that a diet higher in fat than carbohydrate can aid weight loss efforts. Steer clear of the flavoured varieties, as with all yoghurt types in fact, as they're packed with lots of sugar. A 150g serving can provide you with a good, filling 200kcal snack which should keep you feeling full due to the high fat percentage. Black Sheep Coffee in north London are pioneering the oil and butter-packed coffee trend, controversially said to help with weight management and raise IQ. A serving costs £3.50, and contains two to six tablespoons of Kerrygold unsalted grass-fed butter, two tablespoons of MCT coconut oil, and two cups of hot coffee brewed with low-toxin beans, all blended until they are frothy like a foamy latte. Just one cup can contain 50g of fat, (more than 40g of that saturated) and 450 calories. It's full of brain power-boosting vitamin K2-dense butter and metabolism-boosting oil - but lacks other essential nutrients. Coconut oil contains poly and mono-unsaturated fats which bring health benefits . Fresh coconut flesh is delicious and full of vitamins and minerals. Plus it goes well in smoothies . Fresh coconut flesh is delicious, full of vitamins and minerals and goes really well in a smoothie. Enjoy as a snack but go easy on your portion sizes - a typical snack pack (100g) of fresh coconut pieces contains 271kcal compared to just 50kcal in a 100g fresh fruit pot. Just a few pieces should be enough to get you through to the next meal. There are two types of coconut milk widely available - one is about 8 per cent coconut cream mixed with water, sugar and preservatives, the other is mixed with rice milk without the need for sugar and requires less preservatives. Both have a similar kcal content to soya milk (about 1/2 that of semi-skimmed milk) but a much lower protein content than both soya and semi-skimmed milk. I would suggest going for the no added sugar option; ensure that if opting for coconut milk you choose one with added calcium and vitamin D which cannot be naturally found in this product.","Coconut is a staple dairy substitute and said to cure array of ailments .

"By . Lucy Waterlow for MailOnline . A mother-of-two has spent a year training hard and eating clean to achieve a body like her idol Jodie Marsh. Amy Humble, 26, from West Hull, East Yorks, wanted to banish her post baby belly and become as toned as the former glamour model. She said: 'Jodie Marsh inspired me. She looks great - just like her I wanted to have a great physique and still look feminine. I really admire her.' Scroll down for video . Super toned: Amy Humble, 26, trained six days a week and ate 'clean' to transform her figure . Role model: Amy was inspired by former glamour model Jodie Marsh, pictured, who has taken up bodybuilding . Amy emulated Jodie's figure by weight training six days a week under the guidance of personal trainer Dan Welburn. She also started eating more healthily. The mother to Lily, eight, and Brooklyn, six, said: 'Before I started weight training I hated the gym and my belly wasn't toned because I was eating the wrong foods and the weight was just going on my stomach. 'I have always been inspired by Jodie Marsh but I'd never trained using weights so was a bit intimidated.' She added: 'Once I got started, I realised how out of shape I had looked. I started eating ""clean"", so lots of chicken, fish and steak with vegetables and plain carbs like rice and potatoes. But I'd also have a cheat day and enjoy a full Sunday roast dinner.' Amy was an 'out of shape' size ten, left, before she started working out. Now she's a muscular size 8, right . Amy used to work as a usher at Hull Magistrates' Court but gave up her job to have more time to train. She has now gone from being an 'out of shape' size 10 to a super toned size 8 and was recently delighted to win a National Amateur Body Builders Association competition after she was named Miss Toned Figure. She said: 'I was stunned when I won. My dream was to come in the top six but I could not believe it when I came joint first. It didn't sink in for ages and, once I was back at home, I just kept looking at the photographs.' Miss Toned Figure: She was delighted to win a National Amateur Body Builders Association competition . Her biggest fans: Lily, eight, and Brooklyn, six, are proud of their mother . She said her parter, Craig, 28, has been there for her '24/7' to help her achieve her goals. But not everyone has been fully supportive. She explained: 'I did face criticism when I first started weight training. People have this idea that you will get big and look like a man if you train with weights but it's not been like that at all.' But she has since received many compliments about her new look. 'I've had so many mums stop me in the playground about how I've changed the way I look and how determined I've been to find the time to do this. I wouldn't change my lifestyle for anything now,' she said. Team work: Amy emulated Jodie's figure by weight training six days a week under the guidance of personal trainer Dan Welburn .

She said: 'I would love to inspire other women and show them there's nothing to be afraid of by toning up.' She added that she is already inspiring her children to keep fit. 'My kids love it and they like to say how their mum is training weights and they would like to do it when they are older. I'm really happy with where I am now and what I have achieved.

"By . William Turvill . Russia's foreign minister has demanded more autonomy for Ukraine’s regions as his country's military builds up on its neighbour's territory. Sergei Lavrov met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Andriy Deshchytsia, yesterday, making the demands while an under pressure Ukraine ordered its troops out from Crimea after the Russian seizure of military bases there. The demand came before NATO today expressed concern over the Russian military build-up on Ukraine’s borders. Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO has all plans in place to defend members of the alliance. Scroll down for video . Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister (pictured, right, with President Vladimir Putin), has demanded more autonomy for Ukraine's regions as his country's military build up on its neighbour's territory . This photograph shows Russian navy ships preparing to make their way into the bay of Sevastopol, Crimea . Mr Lavrov unexpectedly agreed to the . highest level meeting yet between the Russian government and a . representative of the new Ukrainian government that Moscow has opposed . vociferously over the past month. The meeting took place on the sidelines of a nuclear security summit in the Hague, Netherlands. Mr . Lavrov told Mr Deshchytsia that Russia continues to want constitutional . changes in Ukraine that would give more autonomy to all regions of . Ukraine. Meanwhile, . NATO’s Mr Rasmussen said: ‘We are very much concerned about the Russian . military build-up along the borders of Ukraine. ‘All NATO allies can be assured of our determination to provide effective defence... We have all plans in place to provide effective defence of our allies,’ he said, adding that the Western military alliance was discussing with Kiev how it could enhance its support for non-NATO member Ukraine. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen today expressed concern over the Russian military build-up on Ukraine's borders . Russia is eager to retain its influence in Ukraine's Russian-speaking eastern regions and prevent Ukraine from joining NATO. It has pushed for the new Ukraine to become a loose federation - demands the new Ukrainian government has rejected. Before the meeting, Mr Deshchytsia said his government fears a Russian military build-up near Ukraine's border. ‘The possibility of a military invasion is very high. We are very much worried about this concentration of troops on our eastern border,’ he said. The concerns have deepened under the intense military pressure Russia has applied in Crimea since Russian President Vladimir Putin formally annexed the peninsula last week. Russian forces have commandeered ships and broken into walled military installations with armored personnel carriers. In the bay of Donuzlav in western Crimea, dozens of Ukrainian sailors marooned on the Konstantin Olshanskiy navy landing vessel abandoned ship Monday after weeks of tension and uncertainty. The Olshanskiy and two other warships have been trapped in the bay since Russian forces scuttled mothballed ships at the bay's inlet. The sailors, using a small rubber boat that needed several trips to ferry them to land, were greeted by hecklers on the shore. One man shouted they were deserting ‘rats', while another man blasted the Russian national anthem from his car. ‘We aren't rats, we aren't running,’ said one sailor, who only gave his first name of Yevgeny to discuss a sensitive subject. ‘Why should we have stayed, what would we have accomplished?’ Russian navy sailors stand still during a ceremony on their ship, which is moored in the bay of Sevastopol . NATO's Mr Rasmussen said: 'We are very much concerned about the Russian military build-up along the borders of Ukraine' Twenty of the estimated 60 sailors originally on board remained on the ship, which was later in the day stormed by armed men, presumed to be Russian forces. Defence Ministry spokesman Vladislav Seleznyov said the crew, which barricaded itself in the bulkhead, heard stun grenades and rifle fire. At a naval base near the eastern Crimean . port of Feodosia, two injured servicemen were taken captive earlier in . the day and as many as 80 were detained at the site, Ukrainian officials . said. With the storming of at least three . military facilities in Crimea over the past three days - and the . decision by some Ukrainian troops to stay employed by switching to the . Russian side - it wasn't clear how many Ukrainian troops remained on the . peninsula. The former . chief of Ukraine's navy, who was charged with treason after he swore . allegiance to Crimea's pro-Russian authorities and urged others to . defect, was named a deputy chief of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine's . acting president, Oleksandr Turchnynov, whose new government in Kiev . has struggled to maintain control and cohesion, signed a decree Monday . ordering the withdrawal of all servicemen in Crimea to Ukraine's mainland. Meanwhile, in Kiev, Mikhail Koval was today named defence minister of Ukraine following a parliamentary session. He replaces Ihor Tenyukh, who was sacked by parliament on Tuesday over his handling of the crisis, after it emerged that less than a quarter of soldiers in Crimea plan to stay in the military. Mr Tenyukh, appointed a month ago under an interim government that took power after the overthrow of President Viktor Yanukovich, offered his resignation in a speech to parliament following criticism of the way Ukraine pulled its military out of Crimea. Lawmakers initially rejected the offer but, after consultations between party faction leaders and parliament speaker and acting Ukrainian president Oleksander Turchinov, voted to remove him. Vitali Klitschko is pictured here shaking hands with Mikhail Koval, who was today named defence minister of Ukraine during a parliamentary session in Kiev . Mr Rasmussen said the Western military alliance was discussing with Kiev how it could enhance its support for non-NATO member Ukraine . Elsewhere, ultra-nationalist leader Oleksandr Muzychko has been shot dead by police. In an apparent effort to consolidate control from Kiev, Ukrainian police forces trying to detain the key in recent anti-government demonstrations killed him after he opened fire, the Interior Ministry said. Right Sector's Oleksandr Muzychko, balso known as Sashko Bily, had become a recurring figure in Russian attempts to portray Ukraine's interim government as dominated by radical nationalists.

"A student battling a life-threatening heart condition has turned to pole-dancing in a bid to stay fighting fit. Tess Dunn, 23, from Tiptree in Essex, was 17 when she collapsed with chest pain and was first diagnosed with a hole in her heart. She was told that her heart was a 'ticking time bomb' and that she probably wouldn't reach her 30th birthday. Doctors also warned that sport was out of the question because any sudden movement could kill her, but Tess has found that pole dancing is one form of exercise she can practise because the activity involves controlled movements which do not shock her heart. A student battling a life-threatening heart condition has turned to pole-dancing in a bid to stay fighting fit . The Cambridge student claims that spinning around poles has actually strengthened the muscles around her heart and next year she is set to feature on billboards and posters across the UK as the face of the British Heart Foundation. Tess said her new hobby helps her fight the serious health battle she is faced with every day. She said: 'I can't run or jog or do most forms of exercise so I thought the best thing was for me to tone up. 'So I looked on the internet and I found pole fitness looked like my best option. 'It's a great hobby for me and I love it, I realised it was right for me straight away. 'I have to sit out if I get too breathless but I manage two hours a week and it's great exercise. 'I hope I can keep it up in the future. I may look healthy on the outside, but I fight a serious health battle every day.' Tess Dunn, 23, from Tiptree in Essex, was 17 when she collapsed with chest pain and was first diagnosed with a hole in her heart. Tess was born in the Philippines and underwent an operation to remove two thirds of her right lung after inhaling volcanic ash as a toddler. She was adopted by her British parents Val and Chris Dunn, who are both in their 60s, when she was just three. Growing up, she suffered breathing difficulties which doctors put down to asthma as a result of the inhalation of volcanic ash as a child. It wasn't until she collapsed while studying for her A Levels and was rushed to London's Royal Brompton Hospital that the seriousness of her condition emerged. Doctors warned that sport was out of the question because any sudden movement could kill her . Tess has found that pole dancing is one form of exercise she can practise because the activity involves controlled movements which do not shock her heart . Her pulmonary hypertension is a result of Eisenmenger syndrome, a type of heart defect caused by a large hole between the two lower heart chambers. It causes blood to circulate abnormally in the heart and return to the lungs instead of going to the rest of the body. This dangerously increases blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries to a point where the heart struggles to keep up. Tess said: 'When I was told I was worried and panicky. I was angry and upset and just thought 'I'm going to die'. 'I fixated on the fact doctors told me I could die and I thought 'oh god, what if I don't even reach my 18th birthday'. It really wasn't far away for me.' Tess was born in the Philippines and underwent an operation to remove two thirds of her right lung after inhaling volcanic ash as a toddler . The talented musician was forced to give up playing the trumpet because it could be too strenuous and was told that physical exercise could be fatal. She will be faced with a constant battle against breathlessness, fatigue, chest pain, feeling faint and dizzy and even leg swelling for the rest of her life. But she has not let her condition hold her back and achieved As at college and went on to achieve a second class honours in music at Southampton University in 2012. After a stint teaching music in the UK and Middle East, she is set to study music therapy in Cambridge. She said: 'Now I focus on the future, I don't let it pull me back, life goes on. Tess has not let her condition hold her back and gained a second class honours in music at Southampton University in 2012 . 'I've done a lot more than other people with my condition. I got a music degree, travelled to Qatar to teach music and I'm now determined to become a music therapist.' Next year she will become a familiar face across the UK as she stars in an advertising campaign for the British Heart Foundation. Tess, from Tiptree, Essex, said: 'I am really happy to be doing it because it is very important to raise awareness. 'Not many people really know about the condition and it is about showing people that even if you have a heart condition you can still do things.' Tess said: She said: 'Now I focus on the future, I don't let it pull me back, life goes on.'","Tess Dunn was diagnosed with heart defect aged 17 .

"By . Chris Kitching . British Airways has temporarily suspended its flights to Sierra Leone and Liberia for the rest of the month amid an Ebola outbreak that has killed more than 880 people. The airline confirmed today that it is grounding the flights until 31 August because of ‘the deteriorating public health situation in both countries.’ A British Airways spokesman said: ‘The safety of our customers, crew and ground teams is always our top priority and we will keep the route under constant review in the coming weeks. Scroll down for video . British Airways has stopped flying to Monrovia, Liberia and Freetown, Sierra Leone until the end of August . ‘Customers with tickets on those routes are being offered a range of options including a full refund and the ability to rebook their flights to a later date.’ British Airways, the national flag carrier for the UK, operates four flights a week between London’s Heathrow Airport and Monrovia, Liberia, with a stopover in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It is not the first airline to ground flights over concerns about the epidemic in West Africa, where more than 1,600 people have been infected with the virus in recent months. Late last week, Emirates became the first major international airline to cancel flights to Ebola-hit countries. The Dubai-based carrier followed the lead of African carriers Arik and ASKY by halting flights to Guinea. The West African nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are dealing with the Ebola epidemic . At the time, British Airways said it would continue to operate its flights between Heathrow and Liberia as it monitored the situation. Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is assuring the British public that it is taking the appropriate steps to stop the Ebola threat should an infected traveller arrive at the border. The FCO has issued a statement on its website, telling the public: ‘Border Force has been working closely with Public Health England and other agencies to ensure staff are prepared to deal with the threat of the Ebola virus. ‘As part of this planning, guidance has been issued to front line staff on how to identify and safely deal with suspected cases of Ebola that makes clear what steps need to be taken should a passenger arrive at the border unwell. ‘If a person is identified at the border as being a potential carrier of Ebola they will be immediately referred by a Border Force officer to a specialist medical care provider and reported to the Public Health England.’ The FCO is encouraging people to refer to the National Travel Health Network and Centre’s website before travelling to the affected countries but it has not implemented any travel restrictions. More than 880 people have died in West Africa during the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded . The West African nations of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia are dealing with the worst Ebola outbreak ever recorded since the virus was first detected in 1976. A handful of cases have been reported in Nigeria. Ebola is spread by close contact with organs or bodily fluids from an infected person or animal – living or dead – and there is no cure. The highly transmissible virus causes haemorrhagic fever that kills as many as 60 per cent to 80 per cent of the people it infects in Africa. Public Health England (PHE) advises that the risk to tourists, visitors or expatriate residents in affected areas is considered very low as long as they take the correct precautions. The highest risks of infection are associated with caring for infected patients, particularly in hospital settings, unprotected exposure to contaminated bodily fluids, and unsafe medical procedures, including exposure to contaminated medical devices, such as needles and syringes. It is recommended that travellers: .","BA will not resume its flights to Freetown and Monrovia until 31 August .

"By . Claire Bates . Archaeologists have discovered the remains of a Roman theatre - dating back 2,000 years. Dr Paul Wilkinson, founder of the Kent Archaeological Field School, believes it is the first of its kind to be found in Britain. The theatre with a nearly circular cockpit-style orchestra, which would have seated 12,000 people. It  was found in Faversham, Kent - just behind Dr Wilkinson's back garden where his field school is based. Roman remains: Excavations at the site where archaeologists have discovered the remains of a Bronze Age cockpit theatre . Theatres were unheard of in Britain before the arrival of the Romans. This illustration depicts a theatre near St Albans that would have been used around the same time as the Faversham cockpit theatre . The site shows activity dating back to the Bronze Age, but it is the Roman theatre - which would have been used for religious occasions - that has really excited history buffs. Dr Wilkinson is fighting to preserve the unique find for future generations and has applied for it to become an ancient monument site. He said: 'It really is an amazing find, the first one in Britain, and it is just beyond my garden. This is a unique and wonderful discovery, not only for Faversham but for all of Britain. 'The theatre could have held 12,000 people and we are going to request for it to become an ancient monument site because it is so important and we can preserve it for future generations. 'It would have been a religious sanctuary for the Romans. They would have held religious festivals there. It is called a cockpit theatre. 'There are 150 of them in northern Europe, but none in Britain until now. We were not expecting it.' Dr Wilkinson (right) has led archaeological digs in Kent for more than a decade. One of his recent surveys (left) unearthed the remains of a cockpit theatre . Investigations began on the land back in 2007, but the results have only just been released. A cockpit theatre had a large nearly circular orchestra with a narrow stage set much further back than in traditional theatres. Dr Wilkinson believes the site is the only known example in Britain of a Roman rural religious sanctuary, with a theatre actually built into the hillside. Two temple enclosures were found near by as well as a sacred spring. Durolevum was the name the Romans gave to Faversham, and means 'the stronghold by the clear stream.' English Heritage spokesman Debbie Hickman said: 'If the full analysis of the results does confirm that the site on the outskirts of Faversham is a Roman rural theatre, it would be a most remarkable find.' Dr Wilkinson has led archaeological digs in Kent for more than a decade. In September he led a team that found an ancient ceremonial site the size of Stonehenge on the North Downs. The purpose of the neolithic 'henge' near Hollingbourne is shrouded in mystery, however a large amount of burnt bone and pottery discovered suggested it was used for some sort of ritual. The researchers also found antles and cattle shoulder blades, which they think were used as pick axes and shovels by workers who first dug out the henge. The 50metre-wide henge was discovered after a circular mark was spotted in satellite images of the area.","Roman remains reveal first British example of ancient cockpit-style theatre .

"By . Sarah Griffiths for MailOnline . Whale song, wolf howls, frog croaks and bird chirps are complex forms of communication - just like human speech, according to new research. These creatures may not be able to master advanced language techniques, but their unique calls are much more than just random noises, a study shows. The 'speech' of seven different species of birds and mammals found they appear to be generated by processes similar to how we speak. Monkey business: Oranguatans may not be able to master advanced language techniques, but their unique calls are much more than just random noises, a study shows . The mockingbird, for example, can mimic more than 100 distinct song types of different species, and the long string of wails and snorts of the from a rock hyrax - a type of badger - signify male territory. The study . suggests there may be a ‘missing link’ on the path from animal . communication to human language that has not yet been found. ‘Multiple . studies are finding more and more stepping stones that seem to bridge . this gap,’ said Dr Arik Kershenbaum, from the National Institute for . Mathematical and Biological Synthesis in Knoxville, Tennessee. Dr Kershenbaum said uncovering the process could help scientists understand the origin of human language. Love birds: Scientists conducting the study looked for evidence of Markovian noises in the noises made by seven creatures - chickadees, finches (pictured), bats, orangutans, killer whales, pilot whales, and hyraxes . But while the vocalisations suggest language-like characteristics, scientists have found it difficult to figure out the complexity. Typically, they have assumed the sequence of animal calls is generated by a simple event called a ‘Markov process’, named after a Russian mathematician eighty years ago, which is dependent on what happened last. Earlier . this year a BBC documentary called ‘Talk To The Animals’ investigated . how creatures, ranging from fireflies to hippos, talk to one another. Presenter . Lucy Cooke, an Oxford zoologist, said: ‘Ever since I was a kid I have . longed to be a real life Dr Doolittle and talk to animals. I think it is . something we would all love to be able to do.’ She . believes that communication is key to understanding the secret lives of . animals and said that huge scientific advances have been made in . cracking this animal code in recent years. ‘I . roared, croaked, squeaked and bellowed my way across three continents . to talk with creatures great and small; from flirting with fireflies to . saying hello in hippo,’ she said. ‘I . was blown away by how sophisticated animal speak is. I discovered that . dolphins have names, horses know who their friends are and I even met a . bird that speaks meerkat. ‘And then there were the chimpanzees with a language so similar to ours it gave me goose bumps to watch.’ Animal calls are said to be restricted by rigid Markovian rules of ‘regular’ grammar that have a set sequence. Human language, in contrast, uses what are called ‘context-free grammars’ that apply the same set of rules in different ways, making it much less predictable. Scientists conducting the study looked for evidence of Markovian noises in the noises made by seven creatures - chickadees, finches, bats, orangutans, killer whales, pilot whales, and hyraxes. They found little evidence of Markovian processes in animal calls. Instead, the sounds made by animals were more like human language. The findings suggests there may be an intermediate step on the evolutionary path between the regular grammar of animal communication and the context-free grammar of the human form that has not yet been identified and explored. Pictured are a family of hyraxes, a species included in the study .","Bird song and bat calls are complex forms of communication, study claims .

"By . Charlotte Kemp . For years they’ve been a trusted cure for aches and pains. But thanks to Gwyneth Paltrow, Victoria Beckham and Elle Macpherson, Epsom salts are fast becoming a beauty staple. Costing a fraction of the price of designer potions - you can pick up a tub for £1.25 at your local chemist - they’re being hailed as a miracle fix for everything from greasy hair to a bloated stomach and lacklustre skin. The salts’ healing properties were discovered in the early 17th century when a farmer living near Epsom, Surrey, discovered a spring rich in magnesium sulphate. Slimming secret: Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham swear by Epsom salts for a flatter stomach . It wasn’t long before the great and the good were flocking to ‘take the waters’ - and now they’re back on the beauty radar. Here’s our guide to an Epsom salts makeover... Bathing in Epsom salts helps to reduce water retention and tummy bloating, says life coach Janey Holliday of Making Life Easy. She recommends a bath three times a week in a dilution of two mugs of Epsom salts per bath. ‘When you have an Epsom salts bath, magnesium and sulphate are absorbed through the skin,’ she says. ‘Because our skin is porous, reverse osmosis takes place, which means toxins and excess fluids are drawn out of the skin as the goodness goes in.’ The end result is a flattened tummy. No wonder, then, that an Epsom salts bath is popular with models the night before a bikini or lingerie photoshoot. Victoria Beckham reportedly takes such baths to streamline her figure. ‘I love Epsom salts baths to detox, revive muscles and de-puff my skin,’ says Gwyneth Paltrow. Celebrity trainer James Duigan, who works with Elle Macpherson, recommends using a body brush to stimulate the skin and open the pores before a 20-minute soak in an Epsom salts bath. Beauty staple: Bathing in Epsom salts can revive skin and make hair less frizzy . though it’s hard to imagine clean-living Gwyneth with a hangover, she recommends an Epsom salts bath after a night of over-indulgence. Hangovers are caused by the toxicity of the alcohol breaking down in the body. The byproducts of this - and dehyratation - trigger a throbbing headache, fatigue and nausea. The sulphates in Epsoms salt help flush out toxins and ease muscle pain. Epsom salts will soak up excess oil from the hair. Just add a handful when you shampoo and wash as normal. The Epsom Salt Council recommends making a volumising mask by mixing one part hair conditioner with one part Epsom salts. Warm this mixture in a pan and work it through the hair. Leave on for 20 minutes and then rinse. Hair will look fuller and feel softer, and the minerals will help to repair and strengthen heat-damaged ends. It’s particularly good for smoothing frizz out of curls. Perfect pedicure: A soak in bath salts can soothe aching feet . For even-toned, summer-ready legs, you can lessen the appearance of bruises by applying an Epsom salts compress. Soak a flannel in a cupful of cold water mixed with 2 tbsp Epsom salts and apply directly to the skin. Exfoliate and deep cleanse the skin by mixing ½ tsp Epsom salts with your usual cleanser. Massage on to the skin, then rinse with cool water and dry. ‘This will boost your skin’s magnesium level,’ says therapist Philip Steward of Hands on Clinic, North Devon. ‘Epsom salts are a natural cleanser,’ he says. ‘They rejuvenate and rehydrate skin as well as removing toxins. Because the minerals are being absorbed through the skin, you can’t overdose on it.’ Got tired, hot feet? Not only will Epsom salts soothe aches and pains after a day in heels, they are an anti-inflammatory and will also help to reduce swelling and puffiness. Add half a cup of Epsom salts to a large bowl of warm water and soak your feet for ten to  20 minutes. The salt will remove odours and soften dry skin, which can then be removed easily with a pumice stone or foot file. Soaking in an Epsom salts bath after a long-haul flight has a sedative effect on the body. The minerals help muscles and joints to relax and this leads to a more restful sleep, giving the body a chance to re-energise. Magnesium sulphate activates the body’s healing mechanisms and many athletes take a soak the night before a race. A long soak will also help with aches, stiffness, tightness and soreness after exercise. Rub achy areas with a flannel before getting in the bath. Don’t rinse off afterwards. Granny knew best: Epsom salt has been cherished for decades . Rubbing the skin with Epsom salts removes dead skin cells and promotes healing and rejuvenation. Massage handfuls of Epsom salts over wet skin, starting with the feet and working upwards towards the face. Then have a bath to rinse. The magnesium can also help reduce cellulite as it draws toxins and fluids from the skin. Celebrity skincare guru Ole Henriksen recommends a shower smoothie: half-a-cup of Epsom salts, half-a-cup coffee grounds, 1 tsp eucalyptus oil and enough sesame oil to form a smooth paste. Mix together and work into the skin. ‘Epsom salts have amazing detoxifying properties,’ he says. Post-scrub, your skin will look luminous, smooth and soft and will better absorb skincare products.spot blitz . Epsom salts are also hailed as a budget treatment for skin prone to spots. Rich in minerals, they can be used as an exfoliator to remove dead skin and decrease the depth of acne scars. Ease an overloaded or poorly functioning digestive system with Epsom salts. Magnesium sulphate works as a laxative, drawing water into the bowel to soften stools, making them easier to pass. Epsom salts taken internally must be food grade and it’s best to take them before breakfast in a powder form that can be mixed with water. There are possible side-effects, including gastro-intestinal irritation, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting, so the advice is to speak to your doctor before taking Epsom salts.","Gwyneth Paltrow and Victoria Beckham bathe in Epsom salts for flat stomach .

War hero: Frank Stone demonstrates using a trolley at the entrance to a recreation of the famous 'Harry' escape tunnel originally built by RAF airmen at a prisoner of war camp, for a Channel 4 programme in 2011 . Of the 76 men who attempted to make a break for freedom using the tunnel, known as Harry, 50 were later shot after being recaptured - and only three managed to get away successfully. Mr Stone - finally freed towards the end of the war - returned in 2009 to the camp in Poland, which was originally German territory and held about 10,000 RAF crew at the height of its occupation. The escape from the camp was the single greatest freedom attempt by POWs in the war. Among the 50 who were shot was Roger Bushell, the mastermind of the plot which hoped to free over 200 men. Some 26 of the 76 who tried to escape were returned to the camp while three made ‘home runs’ to Britain. All 29 have since died. Mr Stone helped the escape committee draw up the tunnel plans. Digging for victory: Frank Stone is pictured second right at Stalag Luft III in Zagan, where he was taken as a teenager during the Second World War after his bomber crashed in Mannheim in 1940 . The original plan was for three tunnels, codenamed Tom, Dick and Harry.  But Tom was discovered soon after it was started, and it was decided to use Dick to store the spoil from Harry as it was dug. 'The tension was electric the night of the escape. And then around dawn I heard a shot and barking and I knew it was all over' Frank Stone . 'I was given a chance to go on the escape but the priority was given to those men who had the best chance - German speakers and the like. It was a lottery and my number didn’t come up,' Mr Stone said in an interview in 2011. 'The tension was electric the night of the escape. And then around dawn I heard a shot and barking and I knew it was all over.' He said the character of Archie Ives in the film - the Scotsman played by Angus Lenny who was machine-gunned by the watchtower guards - was based on his real-life friend Jimmy Kiddel. Also there at the visit in March 2009 was . Alfie ‘Bill’ Fripp, 95, who was married one month before he was shot . down in October 1939, and remained a prisoner of the Germans until May . 1945. Historic visit: British veterans (from left to right) Andrew Wiseman, Alfie Fripp, Frank Stone (circled) and Reg Clever returned to the Stalag Luft III camp in Poland in March 2009 - 64 years after the war ended . Mr Stone’s widow, Jane, 69, said: ‘He gave lots of talks about the escape and always said he was doing it in memory of those 50. 'Frank could never understand why people where so interested in him, but they were' Jane Stone, his widow . ‘Frank could never understand . why people where so interested in him, but they were.  We often had to . put extra talks on so more people could come.’ In . 1947, 18 soldiers who shot those who were recaptured, were put before . the English Military Tribunal in Hamburg. Thirteen of them were . executed, with the rest receiving long prison sentences. The story of the escape was made into a . film in 1963, starring actors Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Donald . Pleasence. Decades later, the 2000 film Chicken Run was based on the . movie. On a later visit in 2011, the efforts of the airmen who inspired the film were recreated by a historian. Lighting a candle: Mr Stone - finally freed towards the end of the war - returned in 2009 to the camp in Poland, which was originally German territory and held about 10,000 RAF crew at the height of its occupation . The tunnel used by POWs for their . escape - made from 4,000 bed boards and dug with thousands of pieces of . cutlery - was rebuilt using the same makeshift tools and materials used . by the inmates. Other . materials used by the prisoners included 90 double bunk beds, 635 . mattresses, 3,424 towels - and also about 1,400 milk cans to create an . ingenious ventilation system. The . PoWs should not have succeeded in their escape because the camp was . deliberately built on a type of sandy soil that was meant to make it . impossible for them to build such a tunnel. Cambridge . University historian Dr Hugh Hunt went back to the site to build a 33ft . imitation along with a team of experts, archaeologists, veterans and . modern-day RAF personnel. Mr . Stone then demonstrated using a trolley at the entrance to the escape . tunnel’s recreation, which was documented in Channel 4 programme Digging . the Great Escape in November 2011. The airman, who died on Tuesday in a Hathersage nursing home, was born in . the village of Quarndon, near Derby, and volunteered to join the RAF . when was 18. Keeping fit: Mr Stone, second left, plays football with airmen at the Zagan camp during the Second World War . He . was posted to 83 Squadron at Scampton under the command of Dambusters . hero Guy Gibson, who asked him to volunteer for the mission when his . Handley Page Hampden bomber was shot down. Mrs Stone said: ‘Frank was an orderly to the engineer who drew . up the escape plans so he had full knowledge of what was going on. ‘It . was decided the first 50 to escape would be the ones who had the best . chance of reaching freedom, those who could speak German or had some . knowledge of German. ‘Frank's . name went into the hat for the order of escape. A total of 200 were to . go out first followed by a second 200 the following night. Frank was no . 215 so he never got a chance.’ Mr . Stone, who was promoted to Warrant Officer while in the camp, survived . the 'Long March' which claimed 300 lives when the Germans evacuated . prisoners with the Russians approaching. He was later finally freed and returned home. The couple, who have a daughter and three grandchildren, married in 1969. The Great Escape: The story of the escape was made into a film in 1963, starring actor Steve McQueen . Mr Stone carved out a career as a civil servant, retiring when he was 62. He was a member of the RAF's Ex-POW Association and Bomber Command Association. He was playing golf and gardening just a few weeks before his death. Mrs Stone added: ‘He gave talks wherever and whenever people wanted him and it was an emotional time for him when returned to Germany to the site of the camp. ‘He saw The Great Escape and always used to say what was shown on the camp in the film was the truth but everything filmed outside the camp was pure Hollywood. ‘But he said if the film had never been made then no one would ever have heard the story of the great escape and it was a story that should never be forgotten.’ The funeral service will be next Friday at St Michael and All Angels Church in Hathersage, before the burial in the village cemetery.","RAF gunner Frank Stone taken prisoner in Zagan as a teenager .

"By . Robert Hardman . From up on high, it looks stunning: an inland sea dotted with the occasional ancient church tower and hill settlement. It probably looked much like this when Alfred the Great was burning his cakes and outsmarting the Danes on a little hillock called Athelney, a mile or so from where I am standing. Back then, it was called the Isle of Athelney. Today, it is cut off by the waters once more. But there’s nothing pretty or enchanting about all this down at ground level. When the breeze falters, you catch a whiff of uncorked septic tank. The high water mark is lined with grime. Scroll down for video . Swamped: Farmer Julian Temperley shows Robert Hardman his father's home in Thornley, Somerset yesterday where the ground floor rooms have been ruined by muddy water . ‘Make sure you wash your hands before you eat anything,’ says the fireman driving the emergency ferry from the ‘mainland’ to the medieval villages of Muchelney and Thorney. The one thing these firemen are unlikely to encounter is a fire. This 65million cubic tons of filthy water is barely moving. ‘We’ve seen it all washed up outside – condoms, syringes, worse ...’ says James Winslade of Winslade Farm, eight miles to the west. ‘I can’t let the children out in the garden because of what’s out there.’ It is a grim but neat symbol of the chaos afflicting this historic swathe of Somerset: for this is not a natural phenomenon. Nearly 30,000 acres are submerged, but this is a man-made problem with man-made symptoms and it will require man-made solutions. No one in this part of the world seems in any doubt about who is to blame: the elusive quangocrats of the Environment Agency. Their new orthodoxy is that everyone should stop interfering and let things take their natural course. It’s an attractive idea if you are . ticking environmental boxes in Whitehall – or if you are a water vole. If you are watching your home, your family business, your children’s . birthright sink before your eyes, it is a disgrace. Making do: Residents are ferried from Thornley to Muchelney by farmer Graham Walker. 20 per cent of the entire county of Somerset is submerged by floodwater . Isolated: A police boat carries residents of the village of Muchelney, seen in the background which has been cut off for weeks by the flooding . Surrounded: An aerial view shows how the Somerset village of Thorney has been transformed by the floods into an island . There . is nothing new about flooding on the great plains known as the Somerset . Levels – as King Alfred would testify. From the Romans to medieval . monks to 17th century Dutch engineers to Second World War prisoners, . people have been building banks, ditches and sluices to drain this part . of the countryside and grow things. Every . winter it would flood for a bit and then drain away. Once in a . lifetime, the flooding would be very bad indeed and over-run a few . homes. That was simply the risk you took when you lived on the Levels. The trouble is, there was a ‘once in a lifetime’ flood last winter, in November 2012. And now this one’s even worse. The people of Somerset are unanimous in what has needs to be done. They point out that the Environment Agency stopped dredging the rivers and flogged off the dredging machinery 20 years ago. Now it’s payback time. ‘Start dredging again!,’ says every single person I meet from one end of this 20-mile lake place to the other. ‘If your bathplug is clogged with hair, then you unclog it,’ says Julian Temperley, farmer and father of leading fashion designer Alice, as he takes me by tractor to the home of his 98-year-old father (now safely evacuated). The water is black and knee-deep in the kitchen. It’s uninhabitable. We had dredging for generations and houses didn’t flood. Then they stopped dredging and look what happens!’ He points out that it took military expertise to resolve that ghastly epidemic of foot and mouth disease in 2001. ‘I’d have greater faith in the Environment Agency if there was a brigadier in charge of it.’ ‘If you let your gutters get blocked, you get trouble,’ says a regular at the bar of the King Alfred Inn at Burrowbridge. Just outside, an extraordinary hill called the Burrow Mump offers a superb panoramic view of the problem. Landlady Sally Taylor makes a telling observation. Flood water is pumped into the River Parrott by the Environment Agency in Moorland, Somerset, England. Environment Agency Chairman Lord Smith, the chairman admits dredging is likely to be part of the plan to reclaim flooded land . Struggle: A resident of Thorney village makes her way along a flooded street. The people of Somerset are unanimous in what has needs to be done. Treading carefully: A couple approach flood water on the road at Burrow Bridge in Somerset. The Environment Agency stopped dredging the rivers and sold the dredging machinery 20 years ago . In the old days, when the waterways dried out, they used to be U-shaped thanks to dredging work. Now, they are V-shaped. By the Environment Agency’s own admission, the capacity of the River Parrett, a few yards away, is down by 40 per cent. The water is seeping up through the flagstones below the pool table, but it’s business as usual. In fact, the place is buzzing. On an adjacent table, I meet three other members of the Temperley family. ‘We’ve always had flooding, but not like this,’ says Diana Temperley, Julian’s wife. It’s a birthday pub lunch for elder daughter, Mary, 36, a mother of two, but the talk is of ruined apple crops and marooned sheep. Younger daughter Matilda, 32, a photographer, has been capturing images of these floods for weeks. ‘The Environment Agency are trying to blame all this on extreme weather, but the weather is not that unusual,’ she explains. ‘It’s just the water has nowhere to go.’ Another group of locals walk in with matching sweatshirts. They all say: ‘Start dredging.’ I contact the Environment Agency ,where a spokesman reiterates the official line: ‘Increased dredging of rivers on the Somerset Levels would not have prevented the recent widespread flooding because of the sheer volume of rainfall.’ Yesterday, we heard the head of the Environment Agency, Lord [Chris] Smith, a former Labour minister, argue that these floods are a complex issue and, thus, there are no easy answers. Widespread: Flood waters surround farm buildings in Moorland, Somerset. An area the size of 40 sq miles of the Somerset Levels remains flooded . Left behind: Debris washed up by flood water is seen at James Winslade's farm in Moorland, Somerset . Almost knee-deep: Farmer James Winslade stands in front of bales of animal feed as he surveys flooded land at his farm in Moorland, Somerset . Getting through: A Land Rover splashes into flood waters surrounding farm buildings in Moorland, Somerset . Around here, the mere mention of his . name invokes snorts of derision. ‘Inner city MP, wasn’t he?’ says farmer . Graham Walker, giving me a lift on the tractor ferry with which he has . been taking people in and out of Thorney. Graham . has another bone to pick with officialdom. The county council has just . told schools that children may no longer travel to class by tractor . trailer. ‘It’s so ridiculous it defies belief,’ he says. Presumably, on . that basis, all carnival floats are henceforth illegal. These . are people who know the ways of these ancient and complex water . courses. And, in their view, that knowledge has been completely ignored . by officialdom and yet they are the ones left to suffer the . consequences. Little . wonder the Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson, had such a hostile . reception when he dropped in earlier this week. It didn’t help that it . had taken three weeks for him to come and that he failed to visit a . single flooded home. Perhaps his greatest sin was to arrive in a pair of black shoes. ‘Where were his Wellington boots?’ asks Julian Temperley. Vow: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson promised a new plan to deal with flooding in Somerset in six weeks after facing their anger on a visit yesterday . ‘He was a man walking into a storm and he does seem to have had a good kicking,’ says Charlie Vaughan-Johnson, the good-humoured, unofficial ‘harbourmaster’ of Muchelney – on the grounds that the ‘ferry terminal’ is next to his garden gate. None of these people is moaning about flooding per se. It is the needless extent of the problem which upsets them – and the fact that this is the second time this has happened in 14 months. James Winslade’s family have farmed this patch of the Somerset Levels for 150 years. But now, for the first time, his parents are homeless, driven out by the floods. ‘My father’s 88 with dementia, so it’s very important to keep things familiar. But how can you do that in this?’ For three weeks now, 790 of the family’s 840 acres have been underwater. The last flood cost him £163,000. This one will cost the same again and may even put the farm out of business. In which case, Winslade Farm will be without Winslades for the first time since Queen Victoria.Still, at least the water voles should be alright.",Environment Agency stopped dredging the rivers and sold off the dredging machinery 20 years ago .
"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . Deaths linked to ‘legal highs’ could overtake those linked to heroin by 2016, according to experts on addiction. The Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) claims hospital admissions are soaring and forecasts that deaths linked to the drugs, sold with names such as Clockwork Orange’, ‘Bliss’ and ‘Mary Jane’, could be higher than heroin in just two years. The CSJ says many legal highs are sold in 'head shops', of which there are close to 250 in the UK. It wants to see the introduction of a scheme similar to one in Ireland which made it easier for police and courts to close down head shops that were thought to be selling NPS. This resulted in the number of the shops dropping from more than 100 to less than 10. Scroll down for video . A think-tank says deaths from legal highs will quadruple by 2016. Pictured is mephedrone, a legal high, known as meow meow, white magic, drone, bubble and MCAT, which was legal until April 2010 . Despite small reductions in the number of people using heroin and those drinking every week, the think-tank says the costs of addiction are rising, with alcohol-related admissions to hospital doubling in a decade. The rise of 'legal highs' – or new psychoactive substances (NPS) – were linked to 97 deaths in 2012. Hospital admissions due to legal highs rose by 56 per cent between 2009-12, according to new CSJ data. The think-tank forecasts that on current trends deaths related to the drugs could be higher than heroin by 2016 – at around 400 deaths per year. The report also calls for greater investment in the clampdown of online ‘legal high’ sales. The problem was highlighted in August last year when Adam Hunt, 18, died after taking the psychoactive substance AMT at his home in Southampton, Hampshire, after purchasing it from a website. An inquest heard how the keen football fan had told a friend he planned to take the drug, which he believed had the same effects as ecstasy, but died four days later. A 'treatment tax' should be added to the cost of alcohol in shops to fund a new generation of rehabilitation centres and stem the tide of Britain's addiction problem, the report recommends. The CSJ says many legal highs are sold in 'head shops', of which there are close to 250 in the UK. File picture of a head shop in Dublin . It is also highly critical of the Government’s flagship drug and alcohol prevention programme, FRANK, which it describes as ‘shamefully inadequate’, noting that a recent survey found that only one in ten children would call the ‘FRANK’ helpline to talk about drugs. The CSJ also says the NHS, Public Health England and local authorities risk 'giving up' on many addicts. 'Addiction rips into families, makes communities less safe and entrenches poverty,' said CSJ Director Christian Guy. 'For years full recovery has been the preserve of the wealthy – closed off to the poorest people and to those with problems who need to rely on a public system. We want to break this injustice wide open.' The report says 300,000 people in England are addicted to opiates and/or crack, 1.6 million are dependent on alcohol and one in seven children under the age of one live with a substance-abusing parent. Every year drugs cost society around £15 billion and alcohol £21 billion. Researchers say residential treatment - the most effective form of abstinence-based treatment - has been continually cut and are calling for this to be reversed. A 'treatment tax' should be added to off-licence alcohol sales to fund rehab for people with alcohol and drug addictions, the CSJ said. Under the scheme, a levy of a penny per unit would be added by the end of the next Parliament to fund recovery services to the tune of £1.1billion over the five years. It would be spent solely on setting up a network of abstinence-based rehabilitation centres and funding sessions within them. Last month ministers called the rise in the use of legal highs a 'national emergency'. Loss: 18-year-old Adam Hunt who died after taking a so-called 'legal high' he bought off the internet . MPs spoke out after several leading UK festivals, including Glastonbury and Bestival, banned the sale of the drugs, and called for more action to be taken against a problem blighting communities around the country. Democratic Unionist Jim Shannon described the festivals' involvement as proof that there is concern 'at every level' about the consequences of new manufactured chemical highs that have not been banned. He told a Westminster Hall debate: 'There is concern at every level about what legal highs do. It's fantastic to see such influential festivals getting involved in the campaign to rid our country of these potentially fatal substances, but more is required.' Meanwhile, Labour frontbencher Toby Perkins described how legal highs had made a part of his Chesterfield constituency town centre a 'no-go area' as they fuel anti-social behaviour among teenagers who use the drugs. Mr Perkins claimed that head shops are 'mocking the law' and called for councils to be given more power to deal with problems in their areas. He described the problem as a 'national emergency', saying: 'The truth is that some retailers are mocking the law, laughing at powerless regulators, while visiting misery and mayhem on our communities.'","UK’s youth 'legal high' use is the highest in Europe .

"By . Pa Reporter . FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein maintains it is important to award World Cups to countries that have not hosted them before despite the controversy surrounding the decision to stage the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. FIFA awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively in 2010, but a report was commissioned amid allegations by the Sunday Times that disgraced former FIFA executive committee member Mohamed Bin Hammam had made payments to football officials in return for votes for Qatar. FIFA ethics investigator Michael Garcia submitted his report into the bidding contests in May and, while he would not be drawn on speculation that the 2022 World Cup could be hosted elsewhere if evidence of corruption was uncovered, Prince Ali insists it is essential for all the world's regions to experience staging a World Cup. Reason: FIFA vice-president Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein insists it's vital that the World Cup has new hosts . Concern: There are fears that Qatar was the wrong choice for the 2022 World Cup and won't deliver the goods . Project: Qatar plan to accomodate all the visitors for the World Cup with state of the art facilities . Finished product: The stadium proposals have state of the art designs to make their facilities excellent . 'I was not there at the time that these bids were made so I can't really comment on that (the 2022 World Cup being moved). I think the important thing is that we have two wonderful World Cups coming up in the future,' he told BBC Radio 5 Live's Sportsweek programme. 'It's very important to take it to different parts of the world, I'm a firm believer in that, so let's just hope that if it's done in the right way and everything is satisfactory in order to kick off then let's go for it, whatever the decisions are that come up.' Prince Ali, who is also president of the Jordan Football Association, went on to speak of his pride over the World Cup coming to his continent in eight years' time - provided everything is above board. He said: 'It's always a good thing when a World Cup is hosted in your continent. Having said that, we're very proud to be hosting in Jordan the Under-17 Women's World Cup in 2016, so I'm very happy if it comes to our region as long as it's done in the proper and correct way and hopefully things will go in the direction we want.'","Prince Ali Bin Al-Hussein believes Qatar should not deter FIFA from picking new countries to the host the World Cup .

"By . Becky Evans . Brazilian football hero Ronaldo is to move to Britain to become a student, it was revealed today. The World Cup winner will come to live in London next month and plans to study advertising, according to Brazil's Veja magazine. It is believed the former Real Madrid striker will stay for at least two years and take up a work placement with London-based communications company WPP, under the guidance of Sir Martin Sorrell. Write caption here . Known as The Phenomenon in Brazil, Ronaldo has run his own sports marketing agency 9ine for the past two years. The star, who has houses in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro and a private island off the Rio coast, is also on the organising committees for the 2014 Brazil World Cup and the 2016 Rio Olympics. His spokesman recently confirmed Ronaldo's plans to learn the tricks of the trade with WPP's founder Martin Sorrell. He said: 'He intends to go to England, which he will receive advice and guidance from Mr Sorrell, who's the head of the world's largest advertising company.' WPP is the world's largest communications services group, employing 162,000 people, in 3,000 offices in 110 countries. Multi-millionaire Sir Martin built the business up after taking a stake in Wire and Plastic Products Plc in 1985 and transforming it into an international communications group. The company moved its headquarters to Dublin in 2008 but announced last month that it will now pay its taxes in Britain from January 2 this year. Ronaldo, 36, said in an interview that he could not wait to become a student again. He told Brazil's Meio e Mensagem newspaper: 'Eighteen years have passed and I've hardly studied at all. I feel a great need to become a student again. 'I've learned a lot in life, travelling, living abroad, just in the school of life. The Phenomenon: Ronaldo (centre) scored two goals to help his side to the 2002 World Cup . 'But I also have to immerse myself in something. Learning from Martin Sorrell will be perfect. 'I won't leave him alone, I'll be asking him questions the whole day, just like a striker. He's going to have to tell me everything.' Ronaldo, full name Ronaldo Nazario de Lima, retired from football last year after a glittering career.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Updated: . 17:32 EST, 22 July 2011 . Even a Chinese breeding expert couldn't help giant panda Mei Xiang conceive. She kept people guessing for months, but US National Zoo veterinarians determined on Friday that the bear had failed to become pregnant for the fifth year in a row. Vets announced Mei Xiang was experiencing a pseudopregnancy over the past several months, which means she ovulated but did not conceive. Animal keepers had high hopes and closely watching her behaviour and monitoring her hormone levels because she had been eating less, staying in her den and cradling objects the way she did before she gave birth once before, in 2005. Everyone had hoped that Mei Xiang, who lives in the panda enclosure at the National Zoo in Washington DC, was pregnant . It is difficult to determine when a panda is pregnant as panda foetuses don't start developing until the final weeks of a gestation period. Mei Xiang stopped allowing animal keepers to perform ultrasound exams on her in early July. The zoo was hopeful because a Chinese panda breeding expert helped zoo scientists artificially inseminate Mei Xiang in January. She and male panda Tian Tian had attempted to mate but weren't successful. Zoo scientists are now concerned Mei Xiang may be infertile, said David Wildt, a senior scientist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, Washington, which has studied panda breeding with Chinese experts. Records from pandas worldwide dating back to 1985 show that pseudopregnancies are not rare, but consecutive ones are. 'It seems to be showing that if a giant panda has multiple years of pseudopregnancies, there's a high likelihood she will never succeed,' he said. Happier times: Mei Xiang in December 2005 with her son Tai Shan, on his first trip outside at the National Zoo. He was conceived with artificial insemination . Here the cub, nicknamed Butterstick, plays in snow for the first time in February 2006 with his mom. He was sent back to China in February 2010 . Because of that, the zoo may seek to swap Mei Xiang out for another female. Smithsonian officials likely will begin talking with the Chinese within weeks about whether to continue trying to breed the current Washington pair - Mei Xiang and male panda Tian Tian - or perhaps move animals around within the Chinese panda programme. Mr Wildt said the zoo needs healthy, reproductively viable animals to be able to contribute knowledge about the species. The current pair has never been able to breed naturally and only once with an artificial insemination. 'We are going to do something different,' he said. 'We don't intend to just let these animals go through this particular situation every year without trying to figure out what the issues are.' In January, the Smithsonian Institution signed new $2.5million, five-year agreement with the Chinese to keep the beloved pandas in Washington. They are in a sense leased to the U.S. but remain the property of China. FLASHBACK: On December 5, 2000, the day before leaving to fly to the United States, the perhaps infertile Tian Tian (L) and Mei Xiang played together at the China Research and Conservation Center for the Giant Panda . The agreement, announced during a lavish state visit by China's president, came with the caveat that one or both of the pandas could be switched out for others from China if they aren't able to breed. It is difficult to determine when a panda is pregnant. Scientists say panda foetuses don't start developing until the final weeks of a gestation period. Mei Xiang stopped allowing animal keepers to perform ultrasound exams on her in early July. The zoo was hopeful because a Chinese panda breeding expert helped zoo scientists artificially inseminate Mei Xiang in January. She and male panda Tian Tian had attempted to mate but weren't successful. Their only other cub, Tai Shan, was born July 9, 2005, and was sent to China in February 2010. Pandas have a long history intertwined with diplomacy between Washington and Beijing. The first panda couple, Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing, arrived in 1972 as a gift to the American people after President Richard Nixon's historic visit to China. Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing produced five cubs, but none survived.","Her only cub, born in 2005 after artificial insemination, has moved to China .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . The FA have scored an own goal in their anti-discrimination campaign by discriminating against their own inclusion advisory board. Minutes published ahead of the last council meeting revealed that inclusion chairman Heather Rabbatts asked for her board to be given Wembley Suite VIP hospitality before matches. Yet despite anti-discrimination measures supposedly being a priority for the FA, the protocol committee ruled that the inclusion directors should only be invited to the FA Community Shield, one of the least important fixtures. Snubbed: FA made an error in snubbing Heather Rabbatts . Lord Herman Ouseley, chair of Kick It Out, called the decision ‘too stupid for words’ and a member of the inclusion board said: ‘It beggars belief. There are only seven of us and the Royal Box area has room for 400. You wonder what goes through the minds of these people, but it’s certainly not fighting injustices of all kinds.’ This snub came before Rabbatts’ committee had made clear to the FA board how concerned they were about FA referees’ chief David Elleray escaping proper punishment for making a racist comment. Yet, Elleray and chosen guests are  regulars in the Wembley suite for every match. An FA spokesman said: ‘All independent committees of this type are treated the same.’ There is plenty of angst among those campaigning for UK Sport to return proper funding to basketball that Minister of Sport Helen Grant has not spoken out on the subject. Basketball, despite failing UK Sport’s zero tolerance over Olympic medal potential, is a hugely popular team sport with a diverse following and Grant was expected to embrace the cause. But, despite a number of requests, her public support has not materialised. Ironically, Grant has also been criticised on Tory blog site Conservative Home for pursuing tokenism targets but remaining silent on England’s World Cup debacle — despite travelling to Brazil on an official trip. Advocate: Basketball star Luol Deng played for Team GB at London 2012 . The FA’s ludicrous protocol committee showed once again that they care more about having their faces in the trough than anything else. FA minutes report that before the FA Trophy final between Cambridge and Gosport ‘lunch commenced slightly later than scheduled’. No wonder FA  chairman Greg Dyke wants root and branch reform of the ‘increasingly irrelevant’ council body. It was noticeable at the Test yesterday how little time Hampshire chairman and Rosebowl benefactor Rod Bransgrove spent with ECB chairman Giles Clarke despite a strong desire to host an Ashes Test in 2019. Bransgrove has a dislike for Clarke, preferring even to host lunch with the awful Piers Morgan instead. Coe ‘no’ to BBC role . Lord Coe is putting his beloved track and field before Government wishes that he becomes the next chairman of the BBC Trust. Coe, PM David Cameron’s preferred candidate, did apply for the top BBC post but has decided to withdraw before the interview stage as he wants to prioritise his bid to succeed Lamine Diack as President of the IAAF in August 2015. No: Lord Coe will not take a role at the BBC Trust . Coe, in Glasgow to watch the Commonwealth Games, said : ‘I did allow my name to go forward to give myself time to properly analyse whether I had enough time to do the job to the best of my abilities. On reflection, I haven’t the capacity and I now want to concentrate on my current  commitments and the IAAF election. As everyone knows athletics is in my DNA.’ Royal brothers Prince Andrew and Edward failed to make much of an impression on the Commonwealth Games. The live BBC feed of the squash online name-checked Prince Andrew when the camera panned on to Edward and his family yesterday. When Edward arrived at the weightlifting on Sunday, the PA announcer welcomed Prince Andrew. There is optimism that a Diamond League meeting in 2015 can take place in London’s Olympic Stadium next summer after a new roof has been installed. The running track has been buried under nearly a metre of gravel during the major building works. Inspections show it has survived unscathed, although whether it is still suitable for top competition will not become clear until it is fully uncovered next Spring.

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . I'm getting to know Stuart Pearce at this World Cup while working with him for talkSPORT. In his autobiography he confessed to not being a huge fan of the press and detailed how they had stitched him up as a player. In his coaching role with the England Under 21s the press regularly laid into him and that appears to have left its mark on Pearce. I’m not sure if his view of the media will ever recover from the pounding it took when he left David Beckham out of the GB squad for the Olympics. Back in the day: Stuart Pearce was in charge of the England Under 21 side for six years until 2013 . So in my position, embarking on any conversation with Pearce feels like a non-starter – if you’re a member of the media you have to prove something to him before he starts to trust you. It’s hard for him I guess but he should shake off those pre-conceived notions of people just because of the industry they work in, especially when judging people he hasn’t previously met. It’s been hard work at times, talking to Pearce, but it’s been worth it in the end. I couldn’t care less if he likes me or not, as long as we work well together that’s my priority. I don’t need any Christmas cards off him. But I do want to learn from his vast experience. He played in semi finals of major tournaments so of course there are a million questions to ask him. And as time has gone on, he’s eased down the drawbridge and I’ve been happy to listen to his football knowledge and ask questions. I admired Stuart greatly as a player, and now I’ve found him to be a good laugh at times. It’s fair to say I don’t always agree with him on everything though. After watching Germany’s World Cup win this week he made a fantastic point that I’m going to throw out there, to see what you think. Safe hands: Manuel Neuer has established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in the world . Defensive duties: Jerome Boateng (left) and Mats Hummels both came through the Under 21 set-up . The Germany team that beat Portugal 4-0 . featured six players who started for their Under 21 side in the European Championships final in Sweden back in 2009. Manuel Neuer, Jerome . Boateng, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira, Mesut Ozil and Benedikt Howedes . were all victors over Pearce’s England that night in Malmo. Others from . that young Germany side in 2009 switched allegiance: Fabian Johnson . played for their USA in their win over Ghana on Monday; Sebastian . Boenisch played for Poland at Euro 2012. So let’s get this right – eight of the 11 who started for Germany in their Euro under 21 final win over England in 2009 have gone on to play at a major, senior international tournament and six of them started for Germany against Portugal on Monday and won 4-0. That is how it should be – the junior side feeding the talent to the senior side. The England side from back in 2009 may have lost heavily, but at least made it to the final. Of that starting line up only James Milner is at this World Cup. Joe Hart would have started but he was suspended for the final in Sweden. Chance: Mesut Ozil played for Real Madrid before joining Arsenal for £42million last summer . Progression: Sami Khedira (left) and Benedikt Howedes (right with Thomas Muller) also played in 2009 . So what of . the rest? Fabrice Muamba’s career ended in near-tragic circumstances. Scott Loach, Lee Cattermole, Mark Noble, Nedum Onouha and Martin Crainie . never went on to play for England. Adam Johnson and Micah Richards have . massively under-achieved in their careers so far and need to work much . harder. Kieran Gibbs has talent, but needs to do more to convince Arsene . Wenger he’s Arsenal’s first choice left-back. And the other was Theo . Walcott who but for injury would have been at this World Cup. So . only two England players from that Under 21 side have progressed to . become England regulars in the starting line-up – Walcott and Hart while . Milner is a squad regular. Compared to the German side that is . pathetic. For . Pearce, players and clubs not taking junior international football . seriously is a major issue, and those six German players prove his . point. Only a year ago Phil Jones and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain both . thought they were too good for the Under 21s. Pulling out of the Under 21s has been a feature of English football for years now; who can forget the farce in the summer of 2011 when both Andy Carroll and Jack Wilshere withdrew from Pearce’s squad. By now Wilshere should be a certain starter for England when fit, but his development has been restricted – just ask Paul Scholes. As for Carroll, well a talent that looked effective at Euro 2012 now looks like a spent force. Another one who needs to work harder. Lone survivors: Only James Milner (left) and Joe Hart remain from England's 2009 Under 21 side . Who knows . if a bigger commitment to the Under 21s and below would have turned . England into more of a force at World Cups and European Championships . over the years? Pearce clearly believes it’s a major factor in our lack of success. Last . week David Bentley announced his retirement aged just 29, he even . started crying over it. Back in 2007 Bentley thought he was too good for . the England Under 21s and pulled out of the European Championships . squad. An extremely talented player, but without the mental strength to . realise how to make a success of being a top level footballer, who could . make an impact at World Cups. Back in 2007, Bentley said: 'We need strong characters in the England team'. He should have pointed that high-powered perception at himself. What a waste of talent. Whether . you like him or not, whether you think he’s a good manager or not, . Stuart Pearce is absolutely right to point out how the commitment to the . Under 21s in Germany has helped their senior side. Not pushed on: Andy Carroll failed to make the England squad while Jack Wilshere has yet to establish himself .","Germany fielded six players from their 2009 European Championship winning side against Portugal .

"By . Sam Peters . Graeme McDowell faces an anxious wait on Sunday to find out if he will be denied automatic Ryder Cup selection by Steven Gallacher’s late charge in the final round of the Italian Open. Gallacher carded a 69 on Saturday to finish his third round on 10 under par, four shots off the second place he needs to beat McDowell to the last guaranteed spot in Europe’s team. The 39-year-old Scot began the tournament in 10th place in the European standings but has shown remarkable resilience to battle back from a disappointing opening round. Anxious: Graeme McDowell will have to wait until Sunday evening to see if he has an automatic Ryder Cup spot . Chasing: Scot Steven Gallacher is one round away in Turin from displacing McDowell but needs a top-two finish . If he can overhaul fellow Scot Richie Ramsay, who shot a brilliant 66 yesterday to finish on 14-under, or even beat overnight leader Hennie Otto on 16- under, European captain Paul McGinley will have to choose three wildcards from four of his heavyweights: McDowell, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Luke Donald. ‘I would hate to be the person to deny him a place on the Ryder Cup but I know if it comes down to it, he plays to win and that’s the same attitude I have to have,’ said Ramsay, who holed from 40 feet for birdie on the 18th to complete a flawless 66. ‘Stevie is a fantastic player, as he has shown to get into contention. He will perform on Sunday and I wish him the best in getting (the Ryder Cup place) but I have to accomplish my job of getting into the mix and picking up win number three.’ Tough: Richie Ramsay admits he would hate to be the man to deny Stephen Gallacher a place at Gleneagles . Friends: Gallacher and Ramsay know each other well and both practise at Kingsfield quite often . McGinley and US captain Tom Watson will name their three wild cards on Tuesday, and it is widely assumed the Irishman would prefer the experience of McDowell, who holed the winning putt at Celtic Manor in 2010, over the untried Scot. ‘Paul’s going to have a tough decision to make,’ said Rory McIlroy this week at the Deutsche Bank Championship. ‘There’s a few guys that in previous years would have been able to make the team on merit and haven’t. Do you go with experience or with form?’ However, Gallacher, who lives just 35 miles from Gleneagles, where the tournament gets underway on September 26, knows the course and two-time Ryder Cup player and former Open champion Paul Lawrie believes his compatriot should still make the team even if he fails to secure a top two finish in Turin on Sunday. Choices: US captain Tom Watson and European counterpart Paul McGinley will name wild cards on Tuesday . ‘If Stephen gets in, he’ll just have the best week of his life,’ Lawrie said. ‘It’s the best tournament there is in golf, there’s no question about that. ‘Poulter, Westwood and Gallacher would be the three that people are talking about. I’m not sure the course suits Donald all that much but, again, he’s hugely experienced. He’s been a world No 1, it would be harsh to leave him out. For me, I think the course sets up better for a Gallacher than it does for a Donald.’ Gallacher, the nephew of three-time Ryder Cup captain Bernard, carded four birdies and a bogey in a solid three under-par round yesterday that leaves him well-placed for a final day charge. He said: ‘It’s all to play for. You never know what happens in this game and guys have won from further back than this. I’ll just go out and try and get as many birdies as possible and see what happens. It’s a tough week obviously. I have done my day job and done it well but it is a long week and will take a lot out of me mentally but I have two weeks off after this and one round to go, so will give it my best shot. This is the only time in my career that I would be happy not to win a golf tournament. Second will do me fine on Sunday.’","Stephen Gallacher needs to finish in top two in Italian Open to beat Graeme McDowell from the final automatic qualifying place for European team .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . and Martin Keown . Follow @@martinkeown5 . Any changes from the Italy game? Martin Keown: I’d be quite happy . to go with the same team. Yes there’s debate over Rooney but they are . only starting positions on paper. It’s good to have somebody starting . wide who wants to play more centrally. You just shouldn’t restrict him. Give him and Sterling freedom to roam relative to each other. Jamie Redknapp: I’m fed up with it and Wayne Rooney must be fed up with it: there should be no debate over where he plays, he’s got to play through the middle. Uruguay will have a second-string right back (Jorge Facile replacing the suspended Maxi Pereira) so put Raheem Sterling out wide, tell him to fill his boots and let Wayne play in his best position. Tricky: Raheem Sterling should target the replacement right-back when England play Uruguay on Thursday . How will this game be won? Martin Keown: Wayne Rooney holds the key, but I’d like to see more inspiration from him. He makes good contributions but has become a bit conservative. I want him to unleash that brilliance because it’s there bubbling under the surface. Jamie Redknapp: It’s going to be very tight. Uruguay can’t play any worse but can England play any better than they did against Italy? Uruguay are weak at the back and will sit deeper than Italy did. England will have to be patient because I don’t think Uruguay will leave much space in behind. Pivot: Wayne Rooney holds they key for the crucial World Cup game... wherever he plays . How do they stop Suarez? Jamie Redknapp: When a player is as unpredictable as he is, it’s hard to know the answer! If you stick tight, he turns you, if you stand off, he runs through you and if you double up, that  leaves Edinson Cavani spare. You’ve just got to stay on your feet and not give him a chance to go over. Don’t be surprised if he’s at the heart of some controversy. Martin Keown: Sitting on the bench against Costa Rica, his knee still looked puffy so he can’t be 100 per cent fit. But you always have to expect the unexpected with him. He gets through seemingly impossible gaps so, as a defender, you have to concentrate. We’ve listened all season to how good he is. Now is their chance to stop him. Master: Luis Suarez is difficult to stop... but it is by no means impossible . Unfit: Suarez is coming back from knee surgery... as his scar here shows . Biggest lesson from Italy? Martin Keown: England played well but there is a lot to be learned from the Italians about how to take the sting out of games. They very professionally saw the game out and England need to show a similar calmness and not get anxious. Jamie Redknapp: I don’t think there are any major lessons but you have to play players in their best positions. I think Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson could do a bit more to orchestrate the game in the middle and make us play. Disappointing: Steven Gerrard and Jordan Henderson need to improve from their Italy performance . Advice for the players in a do-or-die game? Jamie Redknapp: There’s so much experience in that dressing room. I wouldn’t want to tell them to do this or that. But they have to be patient. Martin Keown: The pressure is huge but the England players still need to enjoy themselves. You can’t play the occasion, you have to play the man in front of you. Pass and move: England need to keep calm and play their natural game . Where will you watch? Martin Keown: By kick-off I think that I will have travelled about 10,000 miles around Brazil! But I’ll be in Natal watching on. Jamie Redknapp: I’ll be at home with my two boys cheering on England from the sofa. What does the word ‘Uruguay’ mean to you? Jamie Redknapp: Technically good but extremely volatile. They can get spiteful and it would be no surprise to see plenty of cards in the game. Martin Keown: Footballing pedigree. They won the first ever World Cup and upset Brazil in the final at the Maracana in 1950. For such a small country, they have a rich football history. Pedigree: Uruguay stunned Brazil in the Maracana in 1950 . Who is your all-time favourite Uruguay star? Martin Keown: I’m not sure about a favourite but Diego Forlan certainly wasn’t in my good books in 2004 when he won a penalty off me in the Battle of Old Trafford! Jamie Redknapp: I remember watching Enzo Francescoli at the World Cup in 1986 and he was a brilliant playmaker. He became a bit of a midfield idol for me. Foul? Diego Forlan wasn't in Martin Keown's good books after the Battle of Old Trafford in 2004... In one word, why should England be optimistic? Jamie Redknapp: Defence. Not ours, theirs. It’s a weak point that can be exploited. Martin Keown: Superiority. We are better than them. Simple. Hope: Roy Hodgson needs to believe England are better than Uruguay . Prediction? Martin Keown: It won’t be easy but England have the quality – 2-0. Jamie Redknapp: I’m expecting a real battle and it will be very tight, but England to win 2-1.","Rooney could return to the centre against Uruguay, Sterling out wide .

The 31-year-old double Olympic and world champion - who had previously been admitted to hospital with abdominal pains - was due to go for gold over 5,000 and 10,000 metres in Glasgow. Team England said he had made good progress on his recovery from a recent illness, but withdrew to focus on getting back to full fitness in time for next month's European Championships in Zurich. Scroll down for video . He's out: Team England announced that Mo Farah, 31, had withdrawn to focus on getting back to full fitness in time for next month's European Championships in Zurich . The news is a major blow to the Games, . coming the morning after they launched with a spectacular opening . ceremony at Celtic Park. Farah said: ‘I have taken the tough decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games. The sickness I had two weeks ago was a big setback for me.' The Londoner, who was set to be one of the biggest stars in Glasgow, pulled out of his last two races - the Sainsbury's Glasgow Grand Prix at Hampden Park and last Sunday's Anniversary Games - after being admitted to hospital in the United States with abdominal pains. He has been training hard at his altitude base in Font Romeu in a bid to be fit for the Games, but they have come too soon. The 5,000m final takes place on the first evening of the athletics programme on Sunday. Olympic celebrations: The 31-year-old Londoner was set to be one of the biggest stars in Glasgow . Farah added: ‘Training is getting better here in Font Romeu but I need another few weeks to get back to the level I was at in 2012 & 2013. 'I have taken the tough decision to withdraw from the Commonwealth Games.

"By . Hamish Mackay for MailOnline . Follow @@H_Mackay . Rory McIlroy catapulted himself into contention at the Deutsche Bank Championship with a flawless seven-under 64 that leaves him just two shots off the lead. The in-form world No 1 was in sublime touch and seven birdies in his penultimate round carried him into a tie for third on 10 under overall, with American Russell Henley leading the way. Having won three of his last four tournaments, at the Open Championship, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the US PGA Championship in recent weeks, McIlroy will now fancy his chances of adding to his haul on Monday in this second of four FedEx Cup play-off events. Form: Rory McIlroy carded a sublime 64 in the penultimate round of the Deutsche Bank Championship . Speaking after his round, he said on Sky Sports 4: 'I converted some more of the chances that I gave myself today. I was pretty frustrated coming off the golf course in the last couple of days because I felt like I left a lot of shots out there. 'Even today, I felt like I might have left a couple out there, especially on the last. But I'm happy with how I converted those chances and I'm going to need to do the same tomorrow if I'm going to win.' McIlroy made an excellent start with birdies at two and three before driving a 132-yard approach to nine feet at the seventh, with a nerveless putt moving him to three under for his round. Two more excellent up and downs at the 13th and 15th left him with simple putts, while he was inches away from acing the 16th, consoling himself by tapping in for his seventh birdie of the day. He passed up a chance to close his round with a flourish after finding the rough with his approach on his final hole, but he saved managed to save par and now sits alongside American Chris Kirk and Australia's Jason Day, who was on 12 under after a birdie at the 13th but back-to-back bogeys dropped him back. Leaderboard: Rory McIlroy is now tied in second place with Chris Kirk (above) and Russell Henley . Success: McIlroy has won Open Championship, the WGC Invitational and US PGA Championship recently . Henley tops the standings following a six-under round that contained seven birdies and just a solitary blemish at the par-four sixth. The 25-year-old is now finely placed, on 12 under for the tournament, to claim the third PGA Tour title of his career, and the second this year following his success at the Honda Classic in March, when McIlroy was among the runners-up. Billy Horschel is one shot adrift of his United States compatriot after finishing his round with three successive birdies to card a fine 67. Scotland's Russell Knox is seven shots off the lead after failing to advance his five-under score for the tournament, Ian Poulter is three shots behind after matching Knox's Sunday score, while fellow Englishman Luke Donald is on four-over after his second successive 74 in Boston.","Rory McIlroy carded brilliant seven-under 64 in Boston .

"By . Jamie Redknapp . Before we get to the nostalgia and respect that I have for my cousin’s England career, can I just say what an embarrassment it is that no England manager got the best out of Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard playing together. Add Paul Scholes - all three have been masters of their art at club level. With their talent, they should have won a European Championship to supplement their honours for Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United. Or at least have made a major final. They have won 38 trophies for their clubs (so far), none for their country. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Frank Lampard on what it means to wear the England shirt . Beginnings: Lampard on his England debut - against Belgium at the Stadium of Light in October 1999 . Think about that for a moment. It was October 10, 1999 when Frank first pulled on an England shirt in a team including Tony Adams, Gareth Southgate, Alan Shearer, Paul Ince, Kieron Dyer, Steve Guppy, Martin Keown, now my Sportsmail colleague… and my cousin and I. It was the first time we had played together since family kick-arounds in Grandad Harry’s back garden as schoolboys. It was a momentous occasion in my family; our parents were at the Stadium of Light, although grandad couldn’t make it up from the south coast in time. The team had only been named that morning and we didn’t expect to play together. Frank Lampard, a 21-year-old uncapped West Ham midfielder, was selected by Kevin Keegan for his debut against Belgium in Sunderland and I was there next to him. After the Cloughs and the Easthams, the Lampards became only the third father and son combination to play for England. It was a big day for his mum and dad, Frank Senior and Pat. Keeping it in the family: Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp (right) lined alongisde cousin Lampard for England . Our elation was obvious, although there was a minute’s silence before the game for 31 people who died in the Paddington rail disaster five days earlier, when 520 people were also injured. The team wore black armbands and paid its respects before we set about beating Belgium 2-1. I thought we played OK. I scored a screamer (with my left foot) and, though Keegan bizarrely later claimed to the press he’d been angry with us, I don’t recall that. He said: ‘It was a great start and you think, “Let’s go and play”, but for the first time I had to get angry with a few players. The two I got into were Redknapp and Lampard. They responded really well so maybe I should get angry again.’ It meant we were back page news in the Daily Mail for the wrong reasons! Frank enjoyed a glorious international career, winning 106 caps. I have always been proud of him and I hope we will look back on that debut with pride in years to come. Proud: Redknapp hopes Lampard, who won 106 caps, looks back on his England debut with pride . VIDEO Lampard announces England retirement . Frank improved with age. He possessed wonderful drive and a hungry appetite. Frank Senior was a huge influence on him and pushed him. His dad could be ferocious at times, but Frank handled that and improved. My dad tells stories of him running alone at West Ham’s training ground, where Harry and Frank were the management team, forcing himself to improve his stamina. It was that stamina, the timing of his runs, his finishing and his power that turned him into a Premier League star. I look at him now, signing for Manchester City and refusing to accept the time has caught him up, and I admire his determination. He doesn’t care what people think and don’t be surprised if he makes a difference to Manchester City at some point before he heads for New York and his next adventure. Still going strong: Lampard joined Manchester City this summer following his release from Chelsea . He has enjoyed a momentous career. It’s the right time for him to retire from international football. It is 5,435 days since we pulled on the red shirt of England together - 14 years, 10 months, and 17 days - but I remember it like it was on Tuesday. I was proud to be there at the start and to be writing this tribute at the end. 106 caps – equal sixth with Charlton and behind Cole, Moore, Gerrard, Beckham and Shilton – with 89 starts . 14 years and 257 days as an England player . 13 World Cup qualifier goals . 40 World Cup shots without a goal (although THAT goal should have counted against Germany in 2010). 3 goals in four games at Euro 2004, his only Euros. 7,644 minutes for England. 1999 debut against Belgium in October friendly aged 21 years, 111 days . 9 penalties converted from 11. 191 tackles won out of 261 . 62 games won . 5 yellow cards but no reds. 29 goals - the ninth most .","Frank Lampard announced international retirement on Tuesday .

You can send in your questions for next week by tweeting @MailSport and using the hashtag #tacklekeown or emailing us at tacklekeown@mailonline.co.uk . I think Arsenal now have to do some business with Giroud’s injury and Manchester United have to perform some serious surgery on that team. You always look to make one or two changes but they are in need of quite a few players. Sam Allardyce is talking about new signings at West Ham and you wonder if Neil Warnock will do something at Crystal Palace because they need to get cracking. But Tony Pulis left as a result of their transfer policy so it will be interesting to see what happens here. But you have to invest to stay in this league and every manager will probably still be hoping to squeeze in a few more deals between now and Monday. I think it was a good signing and I think there was a real momentum at Anfield last year with the emotion and belief they had. Just when they might have been looking at their signings and thinking 'is there one that will catch the imagination', this transfer certainly does. He wasn’t quite so good at the World Cup but he is clearly a very dangerous. Coming back to England he’ll be able to live very close to where he did before and I think he is adored by the fans over here. Before the season started it was probably Alexis Sanchez, but he has not started the season on fire. But in terms of starting well, I think Gylfi Sigurdsson has slotted back in seamlessly at Swansea and he’s a better player than a lot of people give him credit for. He’s started well and that was good business by Swansea. Then I think few people could have had such a promising start as Calum Chambers. He went from playing at right back to Southampton, to centre back at Arsenal and now a call-up for the full England squad. It’s always hard to tell at these early stages but those two have impressed me. Well you talk about goalkeepers becoming a third centre half these days to play out from the back – I guess he took it to the next level! Goalkeepers are becoming more technically gifted so who knows what will happen in future. I never actually ended up in goal but there’s always some player who fancies himself as a goalkeeper. In training we’d play a lot of small-sided games so one goalkeeper would be there and then a player might join in, but these days that’s rare with so many top goalkeepers in squads. The odd player might go in goal for shooting practice – they always enjoy diving and think they can do better than the keeper! I played against Grobbelaar and he was lovely off the field – he was nothing like what you saw on it. He used to give plenty to his defenders if he thought they were at fault but he was a real character and you have to admire goalkeepers who try something a little bit different to put the opposition off. You always see something like that as a great challenge. You would welcome him to the Premier League and I'd certainly let him know that even if I was playing for an unfashionable club and was a lesser known player, he'd certainly know about me by the end of 90 minutes! What it does do is make you play at your absolute best. He will raise the quality of those around him in his team but as the opposition you try a bit harder and you're more conscious of getting tight to him, even if that means getting quite physical. I'd be getting the first chance to impact on him so I don't want this to be a game thinking he's done especially well on his debut! I think a lot of the criticism of Sir Alex Ferguson has been harsh. He brought such success to the club and also brought in players who he thought would succeed right until the end. Even when he bought Robin van Persie and people suspected it might be the end, he won the league. But when you look at the likes of Smalling and Jones, I don't think they were quite nurtured in the same way as Vidic and Ferdinand were. Those two are now almost a problem for the club because they haven’t trained on and done as well as expected – if they had you would say it's good management by Ferguson. But they have not developed. I do think the one area where Ferguson was guilty of not securing the future was in midfield. He relied so heavily on Paul Scholes and maybe he should have got the cheque book out sooner. I certainly think he can be. He brings a different set of problems for the opposition to cope with. He's got phenomenal pace. I don't think I've ever seen anyone with the same tenacity to win the ball back for his team. That work rate he has, you see more of that in central positions than out wide. When he gets the ball and links with team-mates, sometimes he needs to slow things down a bit and think things through. When you look at someone like Thierry Henry, he wasn't involved as often, but he picked and chose his moments to make a telling contribution. I think that's what Sanchez has to do if he plays through the middle. But the fans love him because of his willingness to run and to take on much bigger men – you can't bully him. Really good question! Looking at the players there is such an uncertainty in their play. If you're on the training pitch every day and there is only one lone voice talking you through the system, you don’t really take ownership of it. Certainly out of position they don't seem to know where they are supposed to be on the pitch and it looks like there’s almost an information overload. Sometimes the players need to make the decisions for themselves, but playing that system is not coming naturally to them. The overall philosophy and method of learning is not working, but they have bought a new defender in Marcos Rojo so I think they will be looking at a central midfielder. But you can't keep buying your way out of trouble and maybe even Rooney can come into midfield as a creative option. But with Javier Hernandez losing his golden touch and Danny Welbeck being told he can go, they might also need a striker with genuine pace at this rate! One hundred per cent no! But it does show you if you don't know where to be on a pitch, it doesn't matter how quick or mobile you are, you're not going to make it. I have some sympathy with Chris Smalling and Phil Jones who have been moved from pillar to post at United and they don’t look like serious first team contenders. I might know where to be at the pitch and be able to read the game, but I'm not sure I'd have the athleticism to cope! Roy has clearly had so few options that he's had to turn to the youth. I'm pleased to see Andros Townsend back but it seesm that if you are in the team for a top four team - like Calum Chambers - you get straight in the England squad. It might be early for him to get in there but when you look at the other options, there aren't many! Roy is probably looking at players who have a good chance of featuring over the next two years. It's very early in their club careers for the likes of Chambers and John Stones but there are not many players out there and they will be a part of England's future. I think Chambers or Stones could even end up playing at right back as utility men, which is indicative of where we are but I was surprised than Nathaniel Clyne did not make it in there. Roy also has to look at some new candidates in midfield. Maybe it's time for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to claim that central position he covets or maybe James Milner would be a safe pair of hands in there. I think it has to be one of the proudest moments of any Englishman's career, both for him and his whole family. He was the obvious candidate among an inexperienced squad - you've lost three players with more than 100 caps in the last 12 months. I haven't been in his compnay behind the scenes but I think he's a very visual captain leading by example but he has to be wary overdoing that. He will need help from both Louis van Gaal at Manchester United and Roy Hodgson in dealing with that. He's certainly maturing with his discipline but you don't want to take anything away from his game and he needs to find that balance and I'm sure he can do it. They're good players but I think the question is where do they play? Everton are very settled as a team. Maybe if they had made the Champions League Kagawa might have been a good option, particularly with Ross Barkley out. But I'm not sure about Holtby, I don't think he's progressed as he migth have liked. Both have also suffered a loss of form, so I don't know. I thought I'd see more from Kagawa at the World Cup but he seems to have gone backwards as a player. and welcome to this week's Tackle Keown.

In response, presenter Nich Richardson introduced the animation which showed Tony Abbot in a shirt that read: 'I love the earth' while walking into his mother's bedroom in 1966 after hearing suspicious noises. 'Mum, what's that noise? Mum, what's happening? Who's that next to you. Solar panel!' The solar panel, emerging from the sheets, then stated: 'I'm your new daddy, get used to it.' Fast forwarding to the 'present day', the animation showed Mr Abbott sitting at a desk while a voice asked 'Prime Minister, what are we going to do with all these solar panels?' 'Destroy them all!

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Peter Moores has defended England’s much-derided approach to the one-day game — and Alastair Cook’s role — but refused to rule out changes before the World Cup. The fourth one-day international at Edgbaston today provides England with their last chance to avoid losing a series against India that represented their first step in another attempt to conquer the world in 50-over cricket. So far it could not have gone much worse, two heavy defeats allowing India to turn the tables after their Test embarrassment, while leaving England fighting to counter accusations that they are playing a different, outdated game. Work to do: England coach Peter Moores has admitted his side must improve before the World Cup . Preparation: England train at Edgbaston on the eve of the fourth one-day international against India . Relaxed: Ian Bell, Ben Stokes, James Tredwell, Eoin Morgan and Jimmy Anderson laugh during practice . Moores, the England coach, remains convinced Cook is the best man to lead England towards the World Cup while the search for the right formula and personnel for a tilt at an elusive first World Cup triumph goes on. ‘We’re going to find out as we go along,’ said Moores on whether England have their balance right, providing hope to James Taylor, Ravi Bopara, Jason Roy and James Vince. ‘Alastair is hungry and his form is starting to come back. We saw it in the Test series and now we’re starting to see it in the one-dayers. ‘It doesn’t mean he’s where he wants to be, and neither are we as a side, but when Alastair’s in form he’s got his way of playing that can be effective in one-day cricket. His record matches a lot of other people’s and his conversion rate is pretty high, with five hundreds and 19 half-centuries in 80-odd games.’ Decisions: England coach Moores said there could be changes as the World Cup approaches . Glum: England trail India 2-0 in the Royal London one-day international series with two games to play . Dominant: India followed up their huge win in Cardiff with another thrashing at Trent Bridge . But unless England show signs of genuine improvement in the last two matches of this series — and in Sri Lanka in November — time will be running out for the World Cup. The main accusation is that England are too old-fashioned in trying to build a platform before leaving acceleration to the likes of Eoin Morgan and Jos Buttler. Moores said: ‘We know we have to get the right score when we bat in one-day games but there are different ways of reaching it. We have people in our squad who can score at a very high rate, Alex Hales at the top and people like Morgan and Buttler. ‘But you still have to get in and build. Each side is made up of players who strike faster and some who are solid. We’ve got to get the balance right, but we’ve got to work fast. We’re not going to hide.

Fast and fearsome: Steven Finn impressed on his return to the international scene after a year away . ‘When people say, “You’re going back to how England played in the past”, that’s not our view. We’re clear on our strategy but we have to find the right people to put that in place. One-day cricket is not as simple as people going out and whacking it. Even the best sides don’t just do that.’ For now, the best England can do is give chances to Gary Ballance, who averages more than 50 in domestic one-day cricket, and Moeen Ali to try to give their batting a much-needed boost against India.","England trail India 2-0 in Royal London one-day international series .

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Jason Roy suffered an injury on Sunday but should still be fit to inject some dynamism into the top of England’s order for the one-off Twenty20 international at Edgbaston that will complete India’s up-and-down tour. It looked as if the hard-hitting batsman’s international debut would be delayed when Roy had to retire hurt after being struck on the right thumb by Hamish Bennett during Surrey’s match against New Zealand A. Yet an X-ray revealed only bruising and Roy should be ready to play next Sunday. And with England batting so badly thus far in the Royal London one-day series, that match may yet prove to be an audition for a late World Cup call-up. Scare: Jason Roy has been in superb form for Surrey during this year's Natwest T20 blast . And... relax: Jason Roy posted a message on Twitter to assure fans he would be fit for his England debut . Eoin Morgan (captain), Moeen Ali, Ravi Bopara, Tim Bresnan, Jos Buttler (wkt), Steven Finn, Harry Gurney, Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, Joe Root, Jason Roy , James Taylor, James Tredwell, Chris Woakes. Roy explained: ‘I tried to bat on after I got hit but then got a bit worried and shot off to get an X-ray for my peace of mind. Everything was fine and it should be fully healed in a couple of days. ‘It’s been a dream to play for England since I was a pup. This is a huge opportunity for me and I’m very excited.’ Those who believe England’s 50-over squad lacks flair will welcome a Twenty20 party which also includes James Taylor, the most unlucky of current players not to play more for England, and the recalled Ravi Bopara. There was also a surprise call for Tim Bresnan, whose England days seemed to be over after World Twenty20 defeat by Bangladesh. His participation is in doubt, however, as he played no part in yesterday’s Roses match after suffering a chest injury. It is Roy’s selection, though, that will draw most attention with England’s inability to post big limited-overs scores becoming acute, as demonstrated in their latest crushing defeat at Trent Bridge on Saturday. Dynamic: The opener blasted 677 runs in the competition, earning him a first call-up to the England squad . Return: James Taylor's excellent limited overs form has earned him a place back in the England reckoning . There is no question that Roy, top scorer in this year’s NatWest Twenty20 Blast with 677 runs at a strike-rate of 157, can score quickly and aggressively. The question is whether his technique will stand up to the highest scrutiny. Alec Stewart, Surrey’s director of cricket, said that Roy, 24, hits the ball ‘harder than anyone I’ve played with or seen’ as he showed when striking five sixes in an over for England Lions this season. ‘It’s not brute strength that creates the power because it’s the same when he strikes a rugby ball or football,’ said Stewart, England’s most capped player. ‘It’s timing. I’ve seen him stun a ball for six. He doesn’t follow through, he checks it.’ Those who worry about England’s identity will note that Roy was born overseas, but he learnt his cricket at Surrey after emigrating with his parents from Durban to England when he was nine. Firepower: Ravi Bopara's big hitting, clever shotmaking and canny bowling is useful in T20 cricket . Roy’s path to the top has not always been smooth but he has settled down under the guidance of Surrey coach Graham Ford. England will be captained by Eoin Morgan in the absence of Stuart Broad, who has an operation on his right knee on Wednesday that will rule him out until the triangular series against Australia and India that precedes the World Cup. Morgan, among the best limited-overs batsmen in the world, has been one of the biggest disappointments in England’s woeful 50-over cricket that sees them 2-0 down against India after Saturday’s six-wicket defeat with just tomorrow’s match and Friday’s at Headingley to come.

"By . Paul Newman for The Mail on Sunday . 1st ODI, Bristol - Match abandoned . 2nd ODI, Cardiff - India won by 133 runs (D/L) 3rd ODI, Trent Bridge - India won by 6 wickets . 4th ODI, Edgbaston - September 2 . 5th ODI, Headingley - September 5 . England look about as likely to win the World Cup as Manchester United do the Premier League after another abject performance at Trent Bridge which advertised their long-standing one-day weaknesses in all their infamy. An England team that were so dominant by the end of the Test series have been made to look like limited-overs novices in two thrashings by a rejuvenated India who have simply come alive in coloured clothing. How can a change of format herald such a transformation of fortunes for an England side who once again looked out-dated, devoid of imagination and flair and unable to force the pace against even a moderately spinning ball? It is a mystery which leaves Alastair Cook with much to ponder at the start of an intensive run of 50-over matches which is supposed to provide the perfect preparation for a tilt at a World Cup which England have never won. VIDEO Scroll down for Alastair Cook: England need to improve on run-scoring vs India . Cruise: India romped to a six-wicket victory over England in the third ODI at Trent Bridge . On top: India lead the Royal London one-day series 2-0 with two matches to play . Knock: Ambati Rayudu, who replaced Rohit Sharma, scored 64 to anchor India's chase . Glum: England captain Alastair Cook watches on from the dressing room balcony . ‘It’s not a question of our strategy,’ insisted Cook. ‘It’s the fact that there are some good players there who are not showing it. It’s frustrating that we’re not playing to the standards we’re capable of. ‘Everyone keeps talking about more power at the top but we’re getting good starts. The problem is our top scores have been in the 40s and we need bigger runs than that at the top of the order.’ The one consolation from a six-wicket defeat that India completed with 42 balls to spare is that conditions at Trent Bridge, not to mention much of the support, were far more Mumbai than what awaits them in Melbourne. India, who looked spent after being thrashed 3-1 in the Test series, were made to feel right at home by at least 60 per cent of spectators supporting them, the loud booing of Jimmy Anderson whenever he went near the ball and a pitch which again raises questions. Notts groundsman Steve Birks was under pressure after his lifeless surface for the first Test last month but here he produced another slow turner which did little to provide either entertainment or ‘home’ conditions. Yet the pitch is no excuse for an England side capable of losing one-day games anywhere, not least when the world champions are in such irresistible form six months before their title defence in Australia and New Zealand. England’s collapse from the bright start provided by Cook and Alex Hales to a woefully under par 227 all out as soon as they faced spin could have happened at any time in the last 20 years, so perennial are their limited-overs limitations. All MS Dhoni, who has looked a different captain in the one-day arena, seemingly had to do was throw the ball to part-time spinners Suresh Raina and Ambati Rayudu and England’s decline was on. Once the occasional bowlers had claimed a wicket each, Dhoni threw the ball to Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja and that decline became terminal, England crashing from 82 without loss to 182 for seven. Nothing sums up the feeble nature of England’s batting than the fact that only one four was hit between the 18th and the 44th overs while the form of their key one-day batsman Eoin Morgan is one of the biggest causes for concern. Add Joe Root’s wretched one-day form and it is clear the batting mountain England must climb now resembles Kilimanjaro. Decisions: Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and elected to bowl first for India . Intent: England captain  Cook put on 82 runs for the first wicket with Alex Hales . Breakthrough: Hales was the first man to fall when he was caught by Dhoni off Suresh Raina for 42 . Looking back with anger: Captain Cook was stumped for 44 by India captain Dhoni as England lost their way . England are expected to include Jason Roy and Chris Wood for their squad for the one-off Twenty20 international against India at Edgbaston next Sunday. Hard-hitting Surrey batsman Roy and Hampshire left-arm seamer Wood look likely to be handed their debuts in an England side that will be captained by Eoin Morgan. At a time when 300 has become little more than par in one-day cricket England have reached those lofty heights no more than four times in their last 37 internationals, the most damning statistic of all. Neither spin nor pace posed many problems for India, with Steven Finn struggling to make an impact in his first appearance for England in just under a year. It was largely plain sailing for India but there was a reminder of the acrimony that goes back to the incident between Anderson and Jadeja during the first Test when Virat Kohli was given a send-off by England and responded by pointing his bat at Anderson and Ben Stokes. Umpires Paul Reiffel and Michael Gough had words with both Stokes and captain Cook. Whipped off: Joe Root feel for just two runs as he was stumped by Dhoni from Ravi Jadeja's bowling . Snick: Eoin Morgan was gone for 10 when he edged behind off Ravi Ashwin to leave England 120-4 . Short: Ian Bell (left) was run out with a direct hit from the deep by Mohit Sharma (right) Direct hit: Raina celebrates after Sharma's throw from the deep crashed into the stumps and left Bell short . Otherwise there was little to be excited about, Rayudu completing his perfect day with an unbeaten 64 as India took a 2-0 lead with two to play in a series which has brought England back to earth with a thud. ‘We can turn this round quickly but it starts with individual responsibility,’ added Cook. ‘It will take someone to score a hundred and everyone will jump on the back of that, we will score 330 and things will change.’ That will take some doing as, to coin a phrase beloved of Graeme Swann, England would not appear to have a ‘cat in hell’s chance’ of emerging with even a share of this series, let alone a stab at the biggest prize in one-day cricket next February. They need a huge improvement at Edgbaston on Tuesday. Inspiration: Raina pulled off a stunning low catch at slip to dismiss Ben Stokes for just two runs . Delight: Raina celebrates his catch with Dhoni to leave England in trouble at 149-6 . Cameo: Jos Buttler's 42 down the order helped England limp past 200 at Trent Bridge . The end: Steven Finn was run out off the last ball as England scored just 227 . First blow: Chris Woakes dismissed Shikhar Dhawan early when the Indian cut straight to Morgan at point . In the wickets: Finn returned to the team and ended Ajinkya Rahane's steady innings of 45 . Exchange: Virat Kohli looks back in anger after being dismissed by Ben Stokes for 40 .

He refused to say how much money he got - but said ‘it was considerably less’ than a £600,000 claim he entered. 'It is over. I have closed the book on that episode of my life.

"By . Ted Thornhill for MailOnline . and Reuters . A crowd of protesters stormed Pakistan's state television channel, PTV, on Monday and took the channel off air, with a news anchor claiming that some working journalists were beaten up. Pakistani soldiers and paramilitary forces entered the headquarters in Islamabad and restored order. Protesters led by opposition leaders Imran Khan, a hero cricket player turned politician, and Tahir ul-Qadri, a firebrand cleric, have been on the streets for weeks trying to bring down the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. Scroll down for video . Pakistani supporters of Canadian cleric Tahir ul Qadri and cricket-turned politician Imran Khan shout anti-government slogans after storming the headquarters of the state-owned Pakistani Television (PTV) building . Imran Khan addressed his supporters in Islamabad during an anti-government march on the same day as hundreds of his backers seized the state broadcaster's television offices and allegedly beat its journalists . Protests in Islamabad turned increasing towards violence today as police clashed with demonstrators. As street battles erupted one officer who was separated from the main force was attacked with sticks . Pakistani protesters beat the portrait of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif with shoes at the main entry gate of the state television building in Islamabad . Sharif, who easily won an election in May last year, has refused to step down. Qadri and Khan allege widespread fraud in the country's May 2013 election, in which Sharif's party won by a landslide. The demonstrations descended into deadly chaos on Saturday, with at least three people killed in clashes with police. Clashes broke out early on Monday and the state PTV channel and its English-language PTV World service were taken off the air after protesters stormed its headquarters in Islamabad. 'They have stormed the PTV office,' a news anchor said just before the screen went blank. 'PTV staff performing their journalistic duties are being beaten up.' A PTV source told Reuters the protesters had occupied the main control room and smashed some equipment. Later, television pictures showed uniformed members of a paramilitary force and soldiers walking calmly into the building. A Reuters witness said the soldiers escorted protesters out and placed the building under their protection. There were no signs of violence and the protesters were seen leaving the building peacefully. The station later came back on the air. Pakistani soldiers stand guard outside the headquarters of PTV . Pakistani police run from opposition protesters during clashes near the prime minister's residence in Islamabad on Monday . Hundreds of rounds of tear gas have been used by police against protesters in Islamabad who are responding to his call to remove the current government. His supporters gathered cannisters today to show the scale of the non-lethal weapon's use. In the nuclear-armed nation where power has often changed hands through military coups rather than elections, the army is bound to play a key role in how the conflict unfolds but it has not directly intervened, apart from talking to the protagonists and calling on them to show restraint. If the protests get out of control and there is major violence, the army could step in decisively, imposing a curfew or even martial law. Alternatively it could side with the protesters and put pressure on Sharif to resign, in which case an interim government would have be put in place and early parliamentary elections held to elect a new government. However, few observers believe at this stage that the army is bent on seizing power again. A weakened Sharif would allow the army to remain firmly in charge of key issues such as relations with India and Afghanistan while allowing the civilian government to deal with day-to-day economic issues in which it has little interest. On Monday, despite heavy rain, crowds of protesters fought running battles with retreating police after breaking the main gate into the Pakistan Secretariat area which houses government ministries as well as Sharif's official residence. The protesters could be seen beating motorcycles and cars with their sticks as they advanced closer to their target. They had tried to storm Sharif's house on Saturday night but were beaten back by police. The head of Islamabad police and another senior police officer were lightly wounded in the clashes, media reported. Supporters of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf political party block the road with burning tires in Lahore, Pakistan, on August 31 . Sharif, who was prime minister twice in the 1990s, swept to office last year in Pakistan's first democratic transition of power. He is due to address both houses of parliament on Tuesday in an apparent effort to show that he is firmly in control. But Sharif looks increasingly cornered in the conflict, and even if he survives the crisis he is likely to remain significantly weakened for the rest of his tenure. The protesters out on Monday appeared to be from Qadri's camp. Khan, who has refused to hold negotiations, says he would not call off the protests until Sharif resigns, calling on his people to avoid any form of violence. 'I call upon my workers to remain peaceful,' Khan said from atop a shipping container at the main rally site. 'Do not carry out any acts of violence. God has given us victory.' Pakistani army soliders stop protestors after clashes with anti-government demonstrators and police near the prime minister's residence in Islamabad . In a warning to police, the military said any further use of force to resolve an escalating political crisis would only worsen the situation. But it has also said the crisis had to be solved through talks, in a clear message to Khan and Qadri. As protesters charged towards police lines in the so-called Red zone - home to the prime minister's house, parliament and many foreign embassies - security forces could be seen retreating, with police huddled in groups and avoiding direct confrontation. Reflecting concern about security in the capital, all schools were closed on Monday, the start of a new academic year.","Protesters are being led by Imran Khan and Tahir ul-Qadri, a firebrand cleric .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan for MailOnline . Sickness caused by wind turbines is not a real illness, a controversial new report has claimed. Instead, symptoms such as nausea, dizziness and migraines are simply imagined by those living nearby, say US scientists. Compiled by the Energy and Policy . Institute in Washington DC, the report says ill-health blamed on  turbines is merely the result of the ‘nocebo’ effect. A report has found that claims of sickness being caused by wind turbines (stock image shown) are not being upheld by courts around the world. The study carried out by the Energy and Policy Institute in Washington DC found that evidence was not strong enough to support the claims . 'Wind Turbine Syndrome' refers to an alleged medical disorder in which people who live in close proximity to turbines begin experiencing a wide array of symptoms, such as tinnitus, dizziness, migraines and insomnia. The name was coined by Dr Nina Pierpont, a pediatrician from Johns Hopkins Hospital whose husband has been lobbying against the proliferation of wind energy. In 2009, Pierpont self-published the book 'Wind Turbine Syndrome,' which included case studies of people who reportedly got sick as a result of their proximity to wind farms. The wind turbine syndrome, dubbed by Pierpont the green energy industry's 'dirty little secret,' is not recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Piepront's research has come under fire from industry experts, who accused her of possibly skewing the data by looking at a small sample size without a control group and failing to submit her results for an impartial peer review. This . is a term for something that creates a negative reaction in a person, . despite there actually being nothing to affect their health or . well-being. As it’s name suggests it is the opposite of a placebo. Experiments . relating to the nocebo effect in the past have found that people will . perceive themselves to be sick if they are told that something could . have an adverse effect on them. For example, a German scientist once gathered a group of volunteers and asked half to watch a video on the ‘dangers’ of Wi-Fi. When . both groups were then seated near a fake Wi-Fi amplifier they believed to be real, only the group that had watched the video reported . any adverse effects. The new US report reveals how court cases . against wind turbines in five Western countries have been regularly . dismissed. In 49 cases brought to court in the US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia and the UK, 48 were dismissed as having no basis to their claims. And the only winning case, in Falmouth, Massachusetts, related to noise caused early in a turbine’s operation that apparently caused grievance to some nearby residents. ‘These claims about wind turbines causing health impacts are not being upheld, which means there isn’t sufficient evidence to prove that wind turbines cause any problems with human health,’ said Gabe Elsner, the nonprofit’s executive director, according to Climate Central. ‘That’s a big deal, because claims about that are used across the globe by anti-wind advocates to try to slow the development of wind farms.’ And the paper adds: 'The courts have spoken. Wind farms do not cause health problems.' The belief that wind turbines can cause sickness, known as ‘wind turbine syndrome’, was made popular in 2009 by American paediatrician Dr Nina Pierpont. But Jennifer Webber, RenewableUK’s Director of External Affairs, told MailOnline: 'Dozens of independent, peer-reviewed scientific studies carried out both here in the UK and around the world have consistently proved that there’s absolutely no credible evidence that wind turbines have any adverse effect on anyone’s health.' However, despite these claims MPs in the UK are warning homeowners that a nearby wind farm could cut the value of their houses by up to a third. Angela Kelly, the chairwoman of the anti-wind farm campaign group Country Guardian, says she has seen the value of a number of properties slashed thanks to the presence of a nearby turbine. Some people have reported having 'wind turbine syndrome', an alleged disorder where people who live near turbines suffer from symptoms like tinnitus and migraines. However it is not recognised as a medical condition by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .","Claims of sickness caused by turbines not upheld by worldwide courts .

"By . Nigel Colborn . One of the delights, on a recent Italian holiday, was strolling among lemon trees in the hotel garden. They grew in huge antique pots that lined the pathways so guests could enjoy their perfume. Britain is too cold for citrus trees to live outdoors permanently, but we've nurtured them here for 300 years. In Georgian times, potted oranges were set out for display each summer. In autumn, they were crammed into glazed orangeries or greenhouses. An orange drizzle cake will taste fantastic when flavoured with home-grown juice and zest . Few of us have orangeries, but anyone can grow citrus plants. You could manage a kumquat on a windowsill while a city balcony might be mild enough for a nearhardy calamondin orange or even a lemon, if temperatures stay above 2c. You might pick only two lemons a year, but a drizzle cake will taste fantastic when flavoured with home-grown juice and zest. You can buy citrus trees in any season. Try The Citrus Centre at Pulborough, West Sussex (citrus centre.co.uk), or Kent's Victoriana Nursery (victoriananursery.co.uk). Mail order suppliers Unwins and Thompson & Morgan also sell them. PIP IT UP . For citrus bushes on the cheap, plant the pips. It's great fun — children love growing them — and they make attractive plants with aromatic leaves and fragrant flowers. But unlike named or grafted varieties, they are unlikely to bear edible fruit. The procedure couldn't be simpler. Save pips from an orange, mandarin, grapefruit or lemon. If you find a pip showing some green, treasure it — this will grow more quickly than a dormant seed. Fill a 7cm pot with compost, firm it gently, water thoroughly and let it drain. Then insert up to five pips into the damp compost, making sure they're just covered. Put the pots somewhere warm — a heated propagator is ideal, but a windowsill is nearly as good — and keep the soil moist, but not saturated. When the seedlings have grown large enough to handle, pot them up individually. Citrus trees prefer slightly acid soils, so grow them in specially formulated citrus compost — ericaceous compost is the next best thing. The leaves on young plants are attractive and aromatic from the start. But blossom may not appear for a year or two and the growth habits of such seedlings are unpredictable. JUICY CHOICES . If you want fruit as well as beauty, the calamondin orange is the best entry level variety. If happy, they produce flowers and fruit constantly, and though these are too sharp to eat raw, they're brilliant for marmalade. Among lemons, the thinskinned, uber-juicy Meyer is prized, but it's not the easiest to grow. So, if you're a novice, try the rugged Ponderosa instead. Its huge, thick-skinned fruit are ideal for making candied peel. Four Seasons lives up to its name, providing flowers and fruit for much of the year. Orange trees are less successful as they need Mediterranean sun to make the fruit sweet and juicy. But they're pretty. And if you grow grapefruit, limes or clementines from pips, you can enjoy the leaf aromas even if they never bear decent fruit. Kumquats, though, are highly productive as well as pretty. They need constant warmth, so are best kept indoors all year round. The small oval fruits can be eaten whole — soft peel and all. To experience citrus heaven, dipa kumquat into molten chocolate. Mmmmm! You can buy a collection of six heleniums for £8.99 or 12 for £17.98 and receive a further six free. Each collection comprises two each of Helena Red, Helena Gold and Helena Orange.

"By . Lindsay Nicholson . The little boy lolls listlessly in his father’s arms, a feeding tube leading from his nose to some kind of apparatus on the bedside table. Not in pain apparently but clearly not well either. By contrast, the child’s father seems animated, positive even. Believing he has given both NHS officials and Hampshire police the slip. You can hear – heartbreakingly – in his voice the relief that at last he is doing something. In the social media video he released, Brett King even refers to his son Ashya as ‘healthy’, and says he is doing better than he was in hospital. After months of watching, waiting and praying, this loving father has taken matters into his own hands, believing that against all odds, in defiance of the most expert of medical advice, that he is saving his son. Scroll down for video . In this video, which was posted on YouTube, Brett King, the father of terminally-ill Ashya, explained why he had gone on the run with his five-year-old son and his family . In the video, Mr King called for police to stop the 'ridiculous chase', saying his son was 'perfectly healthy' Mr King said of his son that they just wanted to get on with his treatment, saying they would not come back to England if they could not get the treatment he wanted . The story of five-year-old cancer sufferer Ashya King – taken by his parents from Southampton General Hospital last Thursday and found in Spain on Saturday night – has bitterly divided opinion. Now Ashya is back under formal medical care while his parents Brett, 51, and Nagmeh, 45, are expected to fight an extradition order which would return the family to England and subject their son – the youngest of their seven children – to medical protocols in which they no longer have any faith. The Spanish judge who will hear their case faces a real-life judgment of Solomon. On the one hand, the parents say they are attempting to take their son to treatment centres in Europe to hopefully cure him with a form of therapy which they claim is being denied by the NHS on the grounds of cost. On the other hand, the specialists at Southampton say that in the case of Ashya, who suffers from a brain tumour known as medulloblastoma, the targeted form of radiation therapy won’t do any good and that removing the boy from their care has endangered him further. On first glance this sounds like an open-and-shut medical decision: either the British doctors or Ashya’s parents are right. But, as anyone who has sat by the bedside of a gravely ill child knows, the truth is that there is nothing on earth more likely to make you become unhinged than to see your child suffer and be unable to prevent it. And that is a truth complicated by the fact that medicine – when it concerns the cutting-edge treatment of terminally-ill children – is as much an art as a science, with issues rarely being straightforwardly black or white. Or as one of the consultants told me when my elder daughter Ellie was treated for leukaemia: ‘Being a good doctor is as much like being a good cook as anything. You have to feel your way.’ When a child is diagnosed with something as serious as cancer, the usual procedure is to start with the treatment protocols agreed by specialists all over the world. Some children respond well straight away. Others don’t. Cancer is not just one disease but many hundreds of diseases under one heading, and something that looks like other similar cases may respond very differently. I have been that parent, the one repeatedly called in to hear the consultant say: ‘It hasn’t turned out as we hoped,’ which is how they tell you when treatment hasn’t worked and they are thinking of trying something else. So you return to the ward, where other children may be packing their bags to go home and your child is getting sicker for reasons you can’t fully understand without years of medical training and maybe not even then. Not only that but, without a full understanding of what is happening, you are required to sign consent forms for operations that don’t seem to be helping and, worse, calm your child while they have injections and painful procedures which they beg you to stop. When every fibre of your being is telling you to protect your child, the medical world orders you to over-ride those feelings over and over again in the interests of something that doesn’t appear to be having much effect. And, to compound this nightmarish scenario, you are probably sleeping – if it can be called that – on a fold-up bed next to your child; washing in the hospital’s visitors’ loos and living on a diet of chips from the canteen, not having breathed fresh air or had a night off since the dreadful day of diagnosis. If you have other children, they will be distraught, missing both their unwell sibling and you. And if you have a partner, your relationship will almost certainly be suffering as you take your understandable anxiety out on each other. Asyha, who underwent an operation on a brain tumour last month, in hospital with his mother Naghmeh in a photo posted on Facebook by a relative . It’s a recipe for disaster and to me the only surprise is that runaways like this don’t happen more often. I spent eight months with Ellie in hospital before she died aged nine. And at 3am every night, every other parent there was, like me, awake but face-down on the pillow, shoulders shaking with sobs that couldn’t be shed during the day. Any of us who said that in those wee small hours we didn’t contemplate doing something desperate would be lying. But, thankfully, in the cold light of day, sanity would return. Looking back, I regard those months on the ward as a form of well-intentioned torture. Little Ashya had apparently only recently had another operation and I wonder if perhaps his parents – who had been keeping a bedside vigil – are suffering from a form of post-traumatic stress. During my time at London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital, one of the fathers became obsessed with the idea that his daughter had developed leukaemia due to supposed – and entirely imaginary – radioactive water in the water supply. He persisted with his mania for three weeks before anyone could convince him otherwise. And, of course, parents can become obsessed with the idea that they know more than their doctors. In the area of childhood cancers, the NHS is rightly regarded as world-beating. The fact that treatment is free is a reason for its brilliance because countries with paid-for medical services rarely have the incentive to tackle hard-to-treat cases in children, preferring to develop cures for ailments suffered by older, richer patients. Even so, very occasionally a second, third or fourth opinion overseas can throw a lifeline to children with cancer and wealthy parents who can effectively shop the world for treatment options (with the permission of their own doctors) are popularly regarded as heroic. The sort of desperate action taken by Ashya King’s family is just that – desperate. Anyone who has balked at taking their toddler for a little jab or who has abandoned a course of drug treatment halfway through due to unpleasant side-effects has no right to criticise Ashya’s parents for their admittedly dramatic and possibly foolhardy reaction to what they believed they had discovered online. The fact that the stakes are so high for Ashya should only serve to make it clear how much mental turmoil his parents are suffering. It would have been better all round, particularly for little Ashya, if the medical staff in Southampton had managed to keep his parents on-side as they investigated – no doubt with a great deal of expertise and care – all the treatment options. From my knowledge of that father in Great Ormond Street who was convinced about radiation in the water supply, I suspect that may have been no easy task. Even so, it is for the paid professionals, who sleep in their own beds each night without the sword of fate hanging over their children, to be the ones who communicate well and patiently and who make good decisions. Because, what is undeniably true is that the Kings may have become misguided in their distress but they are adoring parents who have risked everything for their child. Criminalising them by arresting them was an abhorrently cruel over-reaction.

"By . Melissa Hills For Daily Mail Australia . and Aap . The family of one of four young men who died installing roof insulation is considering suing the federal government over Labor's botched home insulation scheme. Mitchell Sweeney, 22, was electrocuted when working in a roof in a house at Millaa Millaa, in far north Queensland in early 2010. A royal commission into the former Rudd Labor government's scheme delivered its findings on Monday, saying it was a fatally flawed program that was rushed out and sacrificed planning for speed in a scramble to boost the economy. Scroll down for video . Mitchell Scott Sweeney, 22, was the fourth person to die in the insulation scheme. He was electrocuted on February 2, 2010. His mum Wendy (pictured) and his family  say government 'should pay for its mistakes' The Federal Government established the inquiry soon after Tony Abbott became Prime Minister. It has cost $16 million and taken eight months to complete. Commission head Ian Hanger, QC, found the deaths of installers Mitchell Sweeney, Matthew Fuller, Rueben Barnes and Marcus Wilson were all avoidable. Matthew Fuller was the first victim of The Labor Government's insulation scheme. His dad Kevin Fuller told the inquiry the the fight for justice had 'consumed' his life . Lawyer Peter Koutsoukis has told ABC radio the Sweeney family is already suing Mitchell's employer, Titan Insulations, and that the government should also pay for its mistakes. 'We will, as a result of these findings, be considering adding the government as a defendant to the litigation we are pursuing on behalf of the Sweeney family,' he said. But he suggested families should not be forced to go through the courts. Marcus Wilson died installing insulation bats in Sydney suburb St Clair in NSW . 'We were also hoping that there would be some recommendation for compensation ... that's not in the report. 'But it's quite clear from the report that the government is liable so we do call on the government to compensate the families.' About 120 insulation companies that purportedly lost around $200 million when the scheme was axed have also joined a class action seeking compensation. Death of a teenager: Rueben Barnes was just 16 years old and was three weeks into his first job with a home insulation company when he was electrocuted laying batts in the ceiling cavity of a house in Stanwell, Queensland . 'Our clients had no choice to participate (in the scheme) ... after all how could you sell insulation when the government is giving it away for free?' lawyer Mark Farrell told ABC radio. The Australian Council of Trade Unions said the royal commission's recommendations to improve industry safety don't go far enough and has called on the government to further tighten regulations by introducing new protective legislation. 'The ACTU had hoped the royal commission would recommend the introduction of industrial manslaughter laws which have the potential to change community attitudes around criminally reckless negligence at work and ultimately reduce workplace deaths,' ACTU assistant secretary Michael Borowick said. Mr Abbott said the failures arose from 'a dysfunctional culture'. 'The government will carefully consider the findings and the recommendations of this report, which is a timely reminder of what can happen if government acts with undue haste,' Mr Abbott said. 'The government's response will focus on ensuring that such a catastrophic policy failure never happens again,' Mr Abbott added. The inquiry was told of serious program flaws, limited training for workers and a lack of system of checks. In May, former prime minister Kevin Rudd told the commission he accepted ultimate responsibility for the program's failings. Former Labor environment minister Peter Garrett, parliamentary secretary Mark Arbib and numerous public servants all had duties to monitor certain issues, Mr Rudd said, although he did not directly implicate anyone. The inquiry started soon after Tony Abbott became Prime Minister and lasted eight months . Former Labor environment minister Peter Garrett, parliamentary secretary Mark Arbib and numerous public servants all had duties to monitor certain issues, Mr Rudd said, although he did not directly implicate anyone. During his testimony, Mr Garrett said he accepted ultimate responsibility, as the person charged with rolling out the scheme. 'We share responsibilities with those other institutions that equally have them, such as state regulatory bodies, employers, ultimately employees as well,' Mr Garrett told the Commission. But he too said others should share the blame. The roles of both former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (left) and his former Environment Minister Peter Garrett (right) in the Home Insulation Program, came under close scrutiny during the eight-month Royal Commission . On 29 March, Royal Commissioner Ian Hanger QC made a request for additional time to produce his report into the Home Insulation Program. October 14, 2009: Matthew Fuller, 25, is electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a house in Meadowbrook (Qld). He had started work with company 12 days earlier. November 18, 2009: Rueben Barnes, 16, electrocuted laying batts in the ceiling cavity of a house at Stanwell (Qld). He had started with the company 21 days earlier. November 21, 2009: Marcus Wilson, 19, dies from hyperthermia complications after installing batts in a St Clair (NSW) home in 40C heat. February 4, 2010: Mitchell Sweeney, 22, is electrocuted laying insulation sheeting in the ceiling cavity of a home at Millaa Millaa (Qld). He had started at a new company a week earlier. The Royal Commission stated that 'this additional two months will enable Commissioner Hanger to thoroughly consider the large volume of evidence that has been received'. Since it was established on 12 December last year, the Royal Commission held 37 days of public hearings, where it heard from more than 50 witnesses, undertook over 120 interviews and issued 125 summons to produce documents. The Royal Commission also received 70,000 relevant documents in response to summonses, and further documents are still being received by the Commission. AAP reports that the inquiry heard former prime minister Kevin Rudd and his former minister Peter Garrett accepted 'ultimate responsibility' for the program, but said public servants failed to advise of safety risks. Bureaucrats were warned five months before the program's roll-out that three New Zealanders had been electrocuted using metal staples to secure foil. After the first death, industry advice that foil should be banned wasn't heeded. Senior bureaucrats said they were given two days to cost the scheme. Public servants believed the July 1, 2009 roll-out deadline denied them time to consider safety risks, but Mr Rudd said they should have asked for an extension. Plans to train all installers were abandoned, allowing workers to enter roof cavities after undergoing a general safety induction provided they were supervised. But the government had no way of guaranteeing on-site supervision. Mr Rudd controversially used details of secret cabinet proceedings to reveal that even after people started dying, bureaucrats advised the scheme was reportedly 'on track'. The program had attracted so-called 'shonky' operators who failed to supervise inexperienced installers and claimed payments for work that had never taken place. But the scheme's early termination also led to the financial ruin of established insulation companies, with some losing millions of dollars.","Relatives of Mitchell Sweeney, who died in 2010, may sue federal government .

"By . Lydia Warren . and MailOnline Reporter . Killer: Mathew Hodgkinson, 36, allegedly shot dead his lover before trying to take his own life . The British host of a U.S. TV show who left England after he was accused of sexually abusing boys at a dance school he owned has been shot dead by his son-in-law lover. Scott . Rogers, 52, was allegedly killed by 36-year-old Mathew Hodgkinson, who is also British, in a murder-suicide attempt at their Baton Rouge, Louisiana . home last Wednesday, according to local police. Hodgkinson survived the suicide attempt and is in a coma. He was a former student of Rogers' in the U.K. and his lover, and he had married Rogers' daughter Kimmy in order to be able to stay in the U.S., WBRZ reported. Rogers, who was well-known locally as the host of the feel-good weekend show 'Around Town', was found dead under covers in bed. Beside him was a suicide note apparently written by Hodgkinson, reading: 'They broke our happy loving home. They do not get to take Scott too.' The note was an apparent reference to troubles they had been experiencing with authorities in regards to Rogers' children earlier this month. He was under investigation for fraud and the state had taken custody of his . two kids - a 10-year-old adopted son and a two-year-old boy he was . in the process of adopting - The Advocate reported. His show had also been canceled on Monday, WBRZ reported. Shot: Louisiana . TV personality Scott Rogers, 52, was shot and killed at his Baton Rouge . home on Wednesday by Hodgkinson, a British man who had married his daughter to be able to stay in the country . 'Suicide note': The . Iberville Parish Sheriff's Office said this suspected suicide note was found in the home. It apparently references the recent struggles the couple had had with authorities over Rogers' children . Scott Rogers, who was known as Richard Scott-Rogers in the UK, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds in 1983. But the school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council in 1995, and they warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their children there. According to the Bury Free Press, Rogers was acquitted of child molestation charges involving a 13-year-old boy in 1993. Parents also told the paper about 'sleepovers' Rogers would have with some of his young students, during which he would 'cuddle them in their sleeping bags.' In 1995, Suffolk County Council voiced concerns about 'a senior member' of the academy following a High Court case in 1993. In a statement released at the time, the council warned parents of an 'unhealthy atmosphere' at the academy and compared it to that of 'a religious or supposedly religious cult' . It said: 'There was also considerable anxiety felt as to levels of intimacy that existed between the senior member and pupils.' But at the time head teacher Rachel Richards denied the claims of 'cult-style brainwashing classes', she said: 'We are just a school teaching the performing arts.' Rogers left the UK and moved to the U.S. in the mid-90s. Iberville . Parish Sheriff Brett Stassi told the Times-Picayune . that the marriage between Hodgkinson and Rogers' daughter was a sham to . keep him in the country. She was reportedly testifying before a federal . grand jury when her father was killed. As a result, Stassi said Rogers' home had been the scene of a 'bunch of stress' in the past several . weeks. 'It . looked like a murder and failed attempted suicide,' Stassi said. 'It's . been topsy-turvy at this residence... We responded to a couple of calls. It's been a high stress environment for this family and looks like it . culminated in this.' Rogers . had been involved in three child molestation cases before he moved to . the U.S. in the 90s, Stassi said. He was cleared in one, but two others . are still pending overseas, he said. 'There . were some other accusations that come up that were not totally resolved . when he left England,' Stassi told WBRZ. 'I think the past history was . catching up.' Rogers, . then known as Richard Scott-Rogers, founded the Academy of Dancing and Performing Arts in Bury St Edmunds, . Suffolk in 1983. The . school was likened to a 'religious cult' by Suffolk County Council . bosses, who in 1995 warned parents of the 'perceived risk' of sending their . children to the school. On Thursday . two men, appearing anonymously on a Louisiana radio show, alleged that . Scott Rogers had sexually . abused them as young boys in the UK. One . of the alleged victims, who said he met Rogers at the dance academy, . claimed to have been intimately involved with Rogers from the age of 13. He said that the encounters 'increased in frequency' until he was 18. The other alleged victim described him as a 'monster'.

"By . Frank Coletta for Daily Mail Australia . The nation's students are set to launch the next stage in their angry campaign against the tertiary overhaul, as laid out in the Budget. While the decision to provide support for the US mission in northern Iraq has diverted attention, albeit briefly, from stalled Budgetary measures in the Senate, they will shortly take centre stage again. With more than $1 billion ripped out of higher education funding, universities have been offered a sweetener, effectively giving them the opportunity to charge what they feel is a market competitive price for courses. University students have vowed to step up their campaign against the planned overhaul of tertiary education . Once upon a time. The PM (left), Treasurer (centre) and Education Minister (right) in their younger days. Collectively their university courses cost about $6000, according to the NUS. Students say the planned reforms to tertiary education means just one of the courses they undertook could cost upwards of $100,000 in future . The three men in the middle of the education brawl with university students. Education Minister Christopher Pyne (left), Prime Minister Tony Abbott (centre) and Joe Hockey (right) Then and now. The marked difference between the fees when the Prime Minister, his Treasurer and Education Minister undertook tertiary studies and what those same courses cost today. The National Union of Students says law and medicine will top $100,000, if Budget measures on education get through . In essence, universities will need to recoup those losses by bumping up course costs by as much as 30 per cent by 2016. Ultimately, that means the most popular courses will be driven up, pricing many out of tertiary education, according to National Union of Students (NUS) President Deanna Taylor. 'The government has made it clear that they intend to massively deregulate the higher education system and move towards a United States-style system, which would inevitably lead to fee hikes,' Ms Taylor said. 'It's not an exaggeration to say you won't get much change out of $100,000 for the most popular.' National Union of Students president Deanna Taylor (left) says future student protests against Budget measures to overhaul higher education will focus on Treasurer Joe Hockey's time as a campaigner against increased university fees and charges . She said those from lower socio-economic or disadvantaged backgrounds will find it almost impossible to 'follow their dreams'. 'Universities across the country which have the most market power, those with prestige and reputation on their side will be able to send what they charge for certain courses, through the roof,' she said. The National Union of Students president added that those proposing fee deregulation have short memories. 'Just stop and look at what our decision-makers paid for their degrees and what we are asked to pay now and what we will have to pay in the future, with no guarantees of a job or support after graduating.' The NUS has accused the Treasurer in particular of 'hypocrisy', referring to the then Arts and Law student leading protests in 1987 against the proposed $250 administration fee. Ms Taylor said that back-flip by the one-time pro-student campaigner will be highlighted in the lead-up to the next national day of action on October 16. 'This is a massive overhaul they are proposing. It's not just the deregulation of fees, the huge cuts in funding, it's also the impact of interest rates and changes to the Newstart allowance,' she said. Education Minister Christopher Pyne took offence when protesters burned effigies during the August 20 demonstrations . Education Minister Christopher Pyne said tertiary students were in fact 'the big winners'. He said Budget measures would ensure that there will be 80,000 more student places by 2018. 'They'll benefit by more revenue for universities leading to more research and better quality teaching. 'In return the government is asking on behalf of the taxpayers that students contribute 50 per cent of the cost of their education when they're currently contributing 40 per cent. 'We are asking for a 50/50 split, when currently it is 60/40 in favour of the student.' The Education Minister has been a constant target of student anger since the plans for a tertiary overhaul were announced in the May Budget . But Ms Taylor said the Education Minister has missed the point. 'How is it right that anyone and everyone aspiring to be a lawyer or doctor, taking on those traditional degrees of law, medicine, dentistry and the like should have to pay off a debt effectively the size of a second mortgage, just to get an education?' 'These are people who will one day provide a vital service to the community and they're being punished for it, twice. If they can't find a job in the legal professions, they don't get any support from the government once they have finished studying, that's grossly unfair.'","National Union of Students says with planned caps on fees to be removed, the cost of popular courses will soar .
'Some will top $100,000' says NUS president Deanna Taylor .
The campaign against an education overhaul as announced in the Budget will go into over-drive with October 16 set down as a national day of action .

"By . Aap . Across Australia one million people suffer from eating disorders and many don't seek help for years, while funding for health programs is threadbare . Twelve-hour stints at the dinner table supervising a loved one's every bite. That's the reality for people like Melbourne mother Belinda Caldwell, whose daughter developed anorexia nervosa at 16. Ms Caldwell had to give up work to be a full-time carer. 'I slept in the same bed as her for five months to stop her from compulsively exercising and doing star jumps and sit-ups,' she told AAP. Three years later her daughter is recovering well. But at the worst point her health rapidly declined and she had to have emergency hospital treatment. The family lives in the federal seat of Melbourne, the top electorate for reported eating disorders among young people between five and 25 years old. Five of the top 10 anorexia hotspots are in Victoria, two in Queensland and one each in the ACT, NSW and WA. * Melbourne, Vic - 3174* Fraser, ACT - 2911* Lalor, Vic - 2843* Holt, Vic - 2606* Ryan, Qld - 2606* Gorton, Vic - 2536* Rankin, Qld - 2432 . A Butterfly Foundation forum at Parliament House in Canberra was told one million Australians suffer from eating disorders, and many are wasting away in silence. Some take up to 15 years to get help because they feel deep shame, and this reduces their chances of recovery. Mental health expert Patrick McGorry said health funding for eating disorders in Australia was threadbare. The forum heard one in five sufferers of anorexia commits suicide. Sydney mother Judy Goldsmith lost her daughter Alana, 23, in 2011. She urged parents to look out for early warning signs, such as children talking about feeling fat, avoiding family meals, undertaking extreme exercise and returning full school lunch boxes.

"By . Lillian Radulova for Daily Mail Australia . As dwelling values across the country continue to rise while rental rates struggle to keep up, RP Data has revealed how the capital cities compare with their rental yields for both houses and units. The property analytics provider has predicted a continued compression in rental yields across the major cities, as the last 12 months have seen the average typical gross yield for houses fall from 4.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent. RP Data reports that the only two cities where the rental yield has risen in the last year are Hobart and Adelaide, with 5.2 per cent and 4.2 per cent recorded respectively. Scroll down for video . Darwin recorded the highest rental yields for both houses, 5.9 per cent, and units, 5.8 per cent . The city with the top rental yield, of 5.9 per cent, was Darwin. Brisbane came in third place with 4.5 per cent, while Perth and Canberra had 4.1 per cent each. Sydney and Melbourne, which are suffering from the greatest yield compression, recorded the lowest rental yields of 3.6 per cent and 3.2 per cent. 'Over the past year we have seen Sydney's gross rental yields fall by 47 basis points from 4.1 per cent to 3.6 per cent,' RP Data research director Tim Lawless said. 'In Melbourne, where rental yields are even lower, we have seen gross yields fall by 32 basis points over the year to reach 3.2 per cent gross. Hobart had the second highest rental yield for houses at 5.2 per cent, and the third highest for units, also 5.2 per cent . 'Given the current rate of value growth and moderate rental growth, it wont be long before Sydney yields have moved below Melbourne. 'With yields so low in the cities where values are seeing the largest capital gains, it is clear that investors remain very much focussed on value growth rather than yields.' Darwin also recorded the highest rental yield for units at 5.8 per cent, followed closely by Brisbane with 5.4 per cent. Sydney and Melbourne were again at the bottom of the list, recording 4.5 per cent and 4.2 per cent. This comes as the figures also showed house prices in Australian capital cities recorded their strongest gains in winter since 2007, increasing by 4.2 percent in the three months to the end of August. The lift in capital gains was driven by Melbourne which recorded a 6.4 percent increase, beating Sydney which recorded a 5 percent increase. Melbourne and Sydney were the only capital cities to record double-digit dwelling value growth over the past year. Melbourne outperformed Sydney over winter but Sydney was the leader year-on-year, with house prices increasing 16.2 percent in Sydney compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne. All other capital cities trailed behind with Adelaide recording a 5.9 percent rise year-on-year, followed by Brisbane with 5.4 percent, Darwin with 5.4 percent, Perth with 3.5 percent, Hobart 2.8 percent and Canberra with 1.4 percent. The best suburbs for capital growth in each capital city, the median house price, and average capital growth over the past 10 years . RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were driving these two tier conditions. He added that he expected dwelling values to increase again this Spring. 'Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months,' Mr Lawless said. 'Consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter.'","Darwin recorded the highest rental yields for both houses, 5.9 per cent, and units, 5.8 per cent .

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . It was once a 5-star resort swarming with happy guests but now the former Hyatt Regency has been transformed into a Clive Palmer shrine, with pictures of himself covering the walls, several in-house Palmer TV channels and more dinosaurs then guests. When purchasing the hotel in 2011 for an estimated $6.5 million, billionaire Clive Palmer promised his newly renovated seaside resort would lure cashed-up Chinese visitors and make for a better economy, The Courier Mail reported. Now, nearly three years on Palmer Coolum Resort would be seeing minimum return on his self-claimed $2 billion injection into the property, producing nothing but a ghost town, according to Channel Nine's program, A Current Affair.

"By . Corey Charlton for MailOnline . Social media rumours of a planned terrorist attack on the London Underground have today been quashed by police. Last night hoax emails and texts warning London commuters to avoid the Tube today because of a specific terrorist threat snowballed on social media. They appeared to have been triggered by the recent decision to raise the terrorist threat alert to its highest state in three years. The hoax message read: 'In case you have anyone in London. Don't travel on the tubes tomorrow. 'Every . single police officer in the Met has been called into work from 4am . onwards, even people on holiday are being told to catch the next flight . home. Paul Brogden, from the British Transport Police, quickly dispelled the rumours with his own tweet . Battersea Sargent Nathan Shickle also dispelled the rumours, clearly stating they were a 'hoax' The hoax was spread widely before police confirmed rumours of a specific threat were 'completely untrue' Police have reassured commuters there is no need to be alarmed and asked they 'keep calm and carry on' It goes on: 'They think there's a terror threat and that it will happen on the tubes tomorrow around the west end area. So don't go travelling on tubes. It's better to be safe than sorry.' Police moved quickly to dispel the misinformation, with a Met Police spokesman saying the rumour was 'completely untrue'. Several senior officers also responded via Twitter. Nathan Shickle, Battersea Sector Sargent, tweeted: 'Rumour control: The ""alert"" doing the rounds on social about all Met officers being called in for 4am tomorrow is a hoax.' And Paul Brogden, British Transport Police Divisional Commander for London, posted: 'Social media contains lots of rumours regarding threats to tube network tomorrow. There is no specific threat so keep calm & carry on.' While there has been an increased police presence at some stations, police say there is no specific threat . The rumours spread quickly over Twitter last night as they were shared and retweeted . Although there was concern caused by the hoax, police told everyone the rumour was 'completely untrue' The rumour was likely to have started after the Home Office raised the terror threat alert to 'severe' On Friday Home Secretary Theresa May raised the terror threat level from 'substantial' to 'severe'. Despite stating there was no 'specific' threat when raising it, this appears to have been overlooked in last night's social media panic. Prime Minster David Cameron has said the public can expect to see an increase in high-profile police patrols, including the greater use of armed officers, particularly at airports and major railway stations. He called for the public to be vigilant but added they should not panic, saying Britain had shown ‘resolve’ in the face of terror before.","Hoax message spread on social media claiming the Tube is under threat .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . George Osborne believes Britain’s exit from the European Union is ‘no longer unthinkable’ and is backed by more than ‘just the crazies and the bores’, a new book claims. The revelation comes as the Tory party threatens to tear itself apart over Europe in the wake of the dramatic defection of MP Douglas Carswell to UKIP. An updated biography of Mr Osborne claims the Chancellor’s view of the EU has ‘hardened’ since coming to power in 2010 and he could now see how the UK could sever ties with Brussels. Chancellor George Osborne is said to have 'hardened' his views on Europe since taking office, and now takes seriously the prospect of Britain severing ties with Brussels . David Cameron is under growing pressure to set out a tougher stance on Europe, with up to 100 Tory MPs set to defy the Prime Minister by pledging to vote to leave the EU no matter how much power he manages to claw back from Brussels. Such a move would be widely seen as a vote of no confidence in the Prime Minister’s ability to win a good deal for Britain as part of his plans for a renegotiation of powers before an in-out referendum. Mr Carswell, the former Tory MP who defected to Ukip last week, claimed that that Mr Cameron was not ‘serious’ about EU reform and wanted to recommend an ‘in’ vote. There is speculation that Mr Cameron will use his speech to the Conservative conference next month to say he will back an exit from the EU if he fails to overhaul Britain’s membership. Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured at a Brussels summit at the weekend, is under intense pressure from Tory MPs to go further in his demands to return powers to the UK . Mr Osborne, who is expected to play a key role in the renegotiation, is now said to consider leaving the EU a possibility, according to an updated version of George Osborne: The Austerity Chancellor, by Janan Ganesh. Mr Osborne also fears the two-speed EU, with some countries inside the Eurozone and others like Britain on the outside, might not last. According to extracts of the book published by The Times, Mr Ganesh writes that Mr Osborne’s views on Europe have hardened since becoming Chancellor. ‘He remained a supporter of British membership and shook his head at the casualness with which some colleagues talked of exit.’ The Conservative party has been rocked by the dramatic defection of Douglas Carswell (right) to join Nigel Farage's UKIP . However he has arrived at two conclusions. ‘The first was that exit was no longer unthinkable: a sequence of events leading to that end could be imagined, and it was not just the crazies and the bores who were enthused by this.’ The second conclusion was that the countries outside the Eurozone were suffering. ‘The currency bloc was becoming the real decision-making crucible and voting weights were shifting in its favour on matters of vital British interest, such as banking.’ In speech in January, Mr Osborne said the Tory plan for renegotiation was is to ‘change the EU and to change Britain’s relationship with it, and then to place the decision in the hands of the British people: do you want to stay in a reformed Europe, or would you prefer to leave?’ But at the time he stressed that his preference was to remain in the EU.","Osborne believes exit is no longer just backed by 'the crazies and the bores'

"By . Adam Lee Potter . No man is happy without an instruction manual, be it for a widescreen TV or a Black & Decker drill. And the heir to  the throne is apparently no exception. Prince William – ever the military man –  is preparing for impending fatherhood with a no-nonsense guide by former Commando and father-of-three Neil Sinclair. The Prince is working his way through Commando Dad – Basic Training, a handbook in the style of Basic Battle Skills, the Army bible given to new recruits. No-nonsense: Adam Lee Potter puts the book to the test with 11-month-old Bert Thompson . Described by the author as ‘accessible basic training for dads’, the book uses military terminology throughout. Babies are referred to as BTs (baby troopers), toddlers as MTs (mobile troopers). Home is referred to as ‘Base Camp’, the emptying of dirty nappies as ‘Bomb Disposal’ and holidays are ‘long-term major deployments’. Armed with the tome, I ‘borrowed’ my neighbours’ 11-month-old son Bert Thompson to put the advice to the test. The training is certainly basic: Gina Ford à la Pippa Middleton. But the Prince, who admits he has never changed a nappy, will no doubt have absorbed the fail-safe, ten-point plan, which sits neatly in a chapter entitled New Recruits: Surviving The First 24 Hours, accompanied by four illustrations. Army training: Prince William, a military man, looked macho showing off to the Duchess of Cambridge this week . Relaxed father-to-be: Prince William seems at ease with his forthcoming responsibilities, seen laughing with the Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry this week at The Making of Harry Potter tour . Bert and I just about got through it, though I had entirely forgotten that boys invariably wee in your eye. Chapter 12 meanwhile is, frankly, frightening. Dealing With Hostilities explores such tricky subjects as ‘establishing boundaries’, ‘unit regulations’ and ‘age-appropriate sanctions’. I read all this aloud to Bert, who promptly responded by taking off his beret and jabbing me in the eye with a sticky finger.","Reporter Adam Lee Potter worked through  Commando Dad – Basic Training .

"By . Melissa Hills . Connie the condom dress was made by Illawarra youngsters . It looks like something Lady Gaga might wear. The neon coloured crazy latex creation made from 300 condoms was created 6 months ago and is now touring the shores of NSW. It was originally created by Brazillian artist Adriana Bertini who creates dresses from expired or defective condoms to promote safe sex amongst youngsters. Now the blueprint is being used in NSW and neighbourhood groups are making their very own Connie the condom dresses. This is the fifth time a Connie frock has been created by a group of youngsters. Not everyone is in favour of the dress with Shoalhaven City Councillor Andrew Guile and mayor Joanna Gash clashing over the issue. Mr Guile told Daily Mail Australia he did not like Connie being displayed at 'family friendly venues'. 'They (children) are already bombarded with sexualisation every day and it just creates confusion,' he said. 'There is also no evidence the dress raises sexual health awareness among young people.' But Mayor Gash hit back at the negative comments telling Daily Mail Australia she was 'pleased that it is back' even though Connie 'does create differences of opinion'. 'We have high STI rates and anything we can do to draw attention to that is a good thing,' she said. 'I am well aware how difficult it is for adults to talk to kids about this and at least this is creating the conversation.' The latest Connie was made by 174 people, aged from just 11 to 24, at Thirroul Neighbourhood Centre on the NSW south coast between April and June this year. The project took so long because the youngsters could not find a glue that would stick the condoms onto the mannequin. Scroll down for video . Connie the condom dress was made by 174 youngsters aged between 11 and 24 on the NSW south coast . Emily Messieh, youth and community services co-ordinator at the centre where the dress was made, said at first some of the youngsters called Connie 'gross' but the project 'started the conversation' about condoms and safe sex. Mrs Messieh, 25, told Daily Mail Australia her centre created their first Connie in 2011 but the new one was 'much better'. She said: 'Last time we had quite a positive reaction when she toured in NSW. 'We had a number of parents saying they wished their children had learnt about condoms when they were younger, as they had children very young or discovered they had an STI later in life. The idea for the dresses came from Brazillian artist Adriana Bertini who runs the Condom Couture campaign . 'We had one or two negative comments and complaints, but generally Connie was received very positively. 'I think we got chosen a second time because we did a good job. 'Statistics for young people with sexually transmitted diseases is high in Australia and something like this gives us the opportunity to we chat to young people and we can tell them happen if you don't have a condom. 'At first the kids were saying they were not interested and that's gross but that's where the questions start. 'Some will say why is it only the boy that has to use it and if a girl kisses her boyfriend is she going to get pregnant? 'Making Connie helps them show that we are open to questions and we have better conversations when they are being creative. The aim of the dress is to start conversations in young people about sexually related diseases . Emily Messieh says Connie has generally received a positive response in NSW . 'Some youngsters don't actually think STIs are problematic and can be really painful. 'They don't realise it can be so serious, but we show them appropriate pictures of things like genital warts to show them what can happen.' Youth projects all over NSW can put together their own proposals to HIV/AIDS and Related Programs Unit (HARP) for funding to make their very own Connie. The group used expired or defective condoms for the project . It took the youth project three months to create Connie . Colette McGrath, HIV and Related Programs Manager for south eastern Sydney Local Health District, which rolls out the project, told Daily Mail Australia: 'There has been an increase in chlamydia in recent years and most of the increases have been with young people. 'Connie raises awareness in young people and something like chlamydia is easy to treat and people often do not know they have got it.'","Connie the condom dress made by 174 youngsters at a neighbourhood centre on the NSW south coast .

And as the festival grows increasingly popular with young wealthy tech entrepreneurs from San Francisco, reports suggest the city's upmarket Mission district has been virtually deserted for the past week.

"By . Mark Duell for MailOnline . Mother-of-three: Julie Sillitoe, 49, was crushed by large pieces of masonry which fell from a building . The widower of a taxi driver killed by falling building debris asked her to stay off work due to high winds - but she refused so she could buy him a birthday present, an inquest heard today. Mother-of-three Julie Sillitoe, 49, of Finsbury, central London, was crushed by large pieces of masonry which fell from a building in High Holborn on Valentine’s Day. Her two passengers - one of whom was Kylie Minogue's guitarist Luke Fitton - narrowly escaped with their lives after the chunks of cement fell just inches from their heads. Mr Fitton said he and his girlfriend, fashion blogger girlfriend Bo Houtenbos, had enjoyed a romantic dinner at Gordon Ramsay's Bread Street Kitchen restaurant - but a building fell ‘out of the sky’ while they were in the taxi. A large chunk of debris landed on his chest just inches from his face. Mrs Sillitoe was hit by the cement and killed almost instantly in the accident, which happened at around 11pm. Steve Sillitoe told her inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court that he had pleaded with her to stay off work because of the bad weather, but she refused so she could buy him a birthday present. The security consultant choked back tears as he said: ‘She came up and said “I'm going to go to work now”. 'It was very windy outside, it was bad weather. I said to her “Do you have to go to work? Why don't you take the night off?” She said “I have to go to work, I have to buy your birthday present”.’ Mr Sillitoe later sent his wife a text saying he loved her, and she complained that it was very windy. Scene: A photograph from February 15 this year of workmen clearing debris near Holborn Underground station in central London, after Mrs Sillitoe was killed when large chunks of masonry fell on her car . Passenger Mr Fitton said of the accident: ‘Quite . instantly, I felt I had a huge piece of concrete on me, and it just . seemed to go from absolute silence and normality to the complete . opposite. 'I didn't understand what was going on. I . was conscious, I was screaming and screaming because the pain was so . blinding.’ A large piece of concrete landed on his chest, crushing him, . the inquest heard. He said . that he was overwhelmed by dizziness and confusion, and spent what . seemed ‘like an eternity’ calling out to his girlfriend to check she was . okay. He said: ‘People were . trying to see what was going on and help, and I remember screaming to . them to get this piece off me. Some piece of concrete. ‘I'm . not sure how much time was actually passing, but it felt like an . eternity. Eventually, I got some kind of response from my girlfriend who . was speaking to the people in the street. ‘I was screaming, shouting, trying to . get whatever was on me off. It just felt like it was not stopping going . down, it was crushing, crushing, crushing.’ Widower: Steve Fitton told his wife's inquest how the evening turned into a tragedy he would never forget . Paramedics, police and an air ambulance rushed to the scene and he was cut out of the wreckage of the Skoda Octavia and treated. But Mrs Sillitoe suffered ‘devastating’ head injuries which killed her. London had seen bad weather and high winds that night and the days immediately before. Mr Fitton said he had been ‘discussing how horrendous the wind had been that evening’ with Mrs Sillitoe. He paused several times and spoke very quietly as he told of the impact the tragedy had on him and his girlfriend - and said more could have been done to check the building's safety given the stormy weather. He said: ‘For myself and my girlfriend, it has changed our lives so much in terms of appreciation that we were lucky in that situation. ‘It makes you reflect and we are saddened that all three of us weren't able to come away from this experience.’ Mr Fitton, who has only just stopped . using crutches because of his injuries, added: ‘Having no way of . rationalising how something like this can happen. ‘You . are not expecting to be worried about travelling home and buildings . falling out of the sky.’  He said he was still waiting for answers about . why the accident happened. Mr Fitton said: ‘People seemed to . initially respond saying it was an”'act of God”. I feel that is a bit of . “We can't explain what happened”. I feel there could have been a lot . more done. ‘This is the UK. That was the last of a recurrence of a few days of bad weather. If you . were concerned with your building it should be checked and maintained.’ 'People seemed to initially respond saying it was an”'act of God”. I feel that is a bit of “We can't explain what happened”. I feel there could have been a lot more done' Luke Fitton, passenger . According . to his website, Mr Fitton joined Minogue's live band as lead guitarist . in October 2010 and performed with her on the Kylie Aphrodite Les Folies . world tour. Mrs Sillitoe . had to be cut from the wreckage of her car, but attempts to resuscitate . her failed and she died at the scene from a massive head injury. Mr Sillitoe paid tribute to his ‘fun-loving’ wife, who was looking forward to becoming a grandmother for the second time. He . said: ‘She was extremely family orientated - with her granddaughter and . her sons. Shortly before she learnt that (her son) Ben's partner was . pregnant again with a girl, which she was overjoyed at.’ Kylie Minogue's guitarist: Luke Fitton had earlier enjoyed a romantic dinner with his girlfriend . He added: ‘It is a number of months since Julie was killed, and every single day I miss her very much.’ Later, the inquest heard that the masonry which fell from the roof of a six-storey Victorian building, killing Mrs Sillitoe, was 6ft long and weighed a tonne and a half. Building expert Philip Deane, who inspected the site the next day, said very high winds probably caused the debris to dislodge and crash down. A large Crossrail site being dug nearby which reportedly caused vibrations ‘could be a contributory factor’ to the building falling. Mr Deane, a chartered structural engineer from Ellis & Moore Consulting Engineers, said he thought high winds caused the accident. He said: ‘That wind-force hit it with sufficient force that the wall would have tilted at the point of restraint. ‘It would have tilted, the brickwork inside would have failed and the wall would have fallen over. If you subject it to a high enough force, that would have happened. ‘There was nothing that I have seen in looking at the remainder of the building to suggest that it was a badly maintained building.’ He added: ‘In the final instance, it was the wind that brought it down. Over the years vibrations from HGVs could have weakened it.’ Asked if the Victorian building would pass current building regulations, he told the inquest it was ‘close to its limit’, given wind estimates. Mr Deane said the building's design meant there were ‘inherent possibilities of things going wrong’ and the 6ft parapet which fell was exceptionally large. Coroner Mary Hassell suggested London could be facing a spate of Victorian and Edwardian building collapses. 'It is a number of months since Julie was killed, and every single day I miss her very much' Steven Sillitoe, widower . She said: 'One function, an ancillary function of an inquest, is that the Coroner has the power and indeed the duty to report to any person or organisation in the community if evidence comes to light that may prevent loss of life in the future. ‘And what I have in my mind is - when is this going to happen again? When is this going to happen again, not just anywhere in the country, but here in London? 'How do were predict what building is going to lose its parapet? We will have high winds again.' Mr Deane replied: 'We would have to inspect each building'. The inquest continues.","Julie Sillitoe was crushed by masonry on Valentine's Day in central London .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . A woman needed hospital treatment after screaming so hard doing the ice bucket challenge she dislocated her jaw. Isabelle Roberts, 20, was taken to A&E to have her jaw put back into place when the internet craze for tipping cold water over yourself went painfully wrong last week. Her video has now been shared more than 1,000 times on Facebook after the challenge left her in agony. Scroll down for video . Isabelle Roberts dislocated her jaw by screaming so hard when she undertook the ice bucket challenge . Her step-father poured the bucket of water over her after she accepted the challenge during a birthday party . Isabelle, from Tipton, West Midlands, said: 'The water was so cold so I screamed but as I did it my jaw just started to stick. 'I tried to close my mouth but it would not close, it was locked, and then I came to the realisation that something was up. 'Then my mum and sister came to the realisation and they started laughing, but I had to be rushed to hospital.' The shop worker had been celebrating her mother's birthday before deciding to take on the challenge. Isabelle's 47-second video shows her thanking a friend for nominating her before nominating several friends and family. Her step-father, John Kelley, 44, then pours the bucket over her. Isabelle screams twice after she is splashed with the icy water and then realises that her jaw won't move. As she approaches the camera, the extent of the dislocation can be seen, as her face appears to have be stuck in a painful position. Two doctors later managed to click her jaw back into place. Like millions of others around the world, she accepted the challenge to raise money for a Motor Neuron Disease charity . Isabelle's mother, Joanna Kelley, 44, who filmed the challenge, said: 'We were in the waiting room and everyone was laughing, they thought it was hilarious. 'The two doctors who put it back in place had heard about her before they saw her, and then when we went up to X-ray they were already laughing about it as well. 'Isabelle has taken it so well. At the time when it happened even I was laughing because you just don't expect anything bad to happen when you are doing something light hearted like that. 'But I think people should know that it can be quite dangerous.' Isabelle added: 'Everyone has been saying it is really funny and it has been shared more than 1,000 times on Facebook. 'As soon as it was clicked back into place it felt fine. It could have been a lot worse I guess.' But after she was doused in cold water, was walked away in pain having dislocated her jaw by screaming . The 20-year-old sees the funny side though and says she is glad she has helped raise money for good cause . She added: 'You see all these videos all over Facebook and stuff but you would never in a million years think something like that would happen. The next morning when I woke up it was a bit sore but other than that it has been fine. 'I've been told I've got to only have liquid food for two weeks though, so it's a lot of soup for me at the moment.' The Ice Bucket Challenge trend was started to raise awareness for ALS - the American abbreviation for Motor Neuron Disease. It sees participants pour ice and water over themselves before asking other friends to do the same and encouraging them to donate to charity. Isabelle donated £5 to the ALS Association after she was nominated and the charity announced on Friday that it has raised an amazing £75million in the last month through the online initiative.","Isabelle Roberts took on the ice bucket challenge after birthday party .

"By . Sarah Michael for Daily Mail Australia . A dilapidated cottage with rotting walls covered in graffiti is set to sell for more than $2 million when it goes to auction next week. The property in trendy, inner-city Melbourne suburb Richmond comes with a planning permit for the construction of four townhouses, one of which will have to incorporate the rundown cottage because it is protected by a heritage overlay. This comes as new figures show house prices in Australian capital cities have recorded their strongest gains in winter since 2007, increasing by 4.2 percent in the three months to the end of August. This rotting cottage at 336 Burnley Street in Richmond, inner-city Melbourne is set to sell for more than $2 million . The lift in capital gains was driven by Melbourne which recorded a 6.4 percent increase, beating Sydney which recorded a 5 percent increase. Biggin & Scott property marketing agent Allan Cove, who is in charge of the Richmond property at 336 Burnley St, said it had attracted a lot of interest - mainly from builders and developers. 'We're expecting bidding to start at the $2 million mark,' Mr Cove told Daily Mail Australia. 'I know I've got interest over into the early $2 million area, but I don't know if it would get as much as $2.5 million. 'Whether it does or not the auction will tell the story there.' The planning permit will allow developers to build three three-bedroom townhouses and one four-bedroom townhouse, ranging in size from 175 to 249 square metres. The property comes with a planning permit for the construction of four townhouses . One of the townhouses will have to incorporate the rundown cottage because it is protected by a heritage overlay . The property will go to auction at 1pm on September 12. Meanwhile, RP Data figures showed Melbourne and Sydney were the only capital cities to record double-digit dwelling value growth over the past year. Melbourne outperformed Sydney over winter but Sydney was the leader year-on-year, with house prices increasing 16.2 percent in Sydney compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne. All other capital cities trailed behind with Adelaide recording a 5.9 percent rise year-on-year, followed by Brisbane with 5.4 percent, Darwin with 5.4 percent, Perth with 3.5 percent, Hobart 2.8 percent and Canberra with 1.4 percent. Biggin & Scott property marketing agent Allan Cove, who is in charge of the Richmond property, said it had attracted a lot of interest - mainly from builders and developers . Mr Cove said bidding for the property on September 12 could go as high as $2.5 million . RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were driving these two tier conditions. He added that he expected dwelling values to increase again this Spring. 'Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months,' Mr Lawless said. 'Consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter.' The planning permit will allow developers to build three three-bedroom townhouses and one four-bedroom townhouse, ranging in size from 175 to 249 square metres . The property comprises a generally rectangular 771 square metre site zoned R1Z General Residential Zone with a Burnley Street frontage of 13.5 square metres, a depth of 57.5 metres and frontage to Canterbury Street providing access at the rear .","Cottage in Richmond, inner-city Melbourne will go to auction next week .

"By . Mia De Graaf for MailOnline . A man who beat his partner for two hours until she was lying unconscious in a pool of blood has been spared jail. Gary Parker, 26, dragged his 37-year-old girlfriend Melanie Adams around their home while her children cowered in fear upstairs. The vicious attack was only stopped when Ms Adams' 12-year-old son managed to find a phone to call the police. Scroll down for video . 'Injustice': Melanie Adams, 37, has blasted the legal system after her partner was spared jail. She was left unconscious and covered in bruises when Gary Parker, 26, dragged and beat her around their home . Together: Gary Parker, 26, moved in with Ms Adams and her three children two months into their relationship . Parker was arrested at the property in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after Ms Adams was found unconscious, covered in bruises with a suspected fractured wrist on the living room floor. But today, the mother-of-three has hit out at the justice system as a court handed her attacker a 22-week sentence, suspended for 12 months. Speaking outside court, Ms Adams said she has been denied justice. She said: 'He thumped me and dragged me around. I was bruised from head-to-toe. 'Before the attack I was a happy, outgoing mother with a successful business and I was a very loving and loyal girlfriend to Gary. 'But there are no words to describe the pain and suffering I have gone through, physically, and emotionally since the assault. 'Gary Parker has broken me completely and some days I can't even string together a sentence. 'I truly believe anything less than jail is just not justice after what he put me and my children through. 'I just don't know what the future holds for me. My life will never be the same again.' Parker, a chef, had been seeing Ms Adams for two months when he moved into the home she shares with her sons, aged 17 and 12, and daughter, six. But on June 15 this year, they saw a different side to him when he accused Ms Adams of being in love with her ex. Spared jail: Parker, a chef, was handed a 22-week sentence, suspended for 12 months under supervision . Melanie explained: 'He started accusing me of being in love with my ex. 'We were arguing about it for hours. 'Eventually he went to bed, but he stole my phone without me knowing and found something he didn't like. 'It was completely innocent but he just went mad. 'He beat me and knocked me unconscious. I was sick and there was blood everywhere. 'When the police came Gary stole my car keys and drove off to try and get away. 'I just couldn't believe what had just happened. 'I was so battered and in complete shock that the person I loved beyond words had done this to me. 'If it wasn't for my son who knows what could have happened.' Defending Parker at North Staffordshire Justice Centre, John Kidney said: 'He's a young man of 26. He has no history of violence at all. 'He accepts the court ruling although he is disappointed. He is working extremely hard at his job as a chef. 'His relationship has gone and he's now been convicted of an offence of violence. His job is his only anchor to the future. 'He's aware he could be sent into custody and for him that would be catastrophic.' He was ordered to complete a domestic violence workbook, carry out 120 hours of unpaid work and pay his victim £500 in compensation. Shock: Ms Adams said she was so shocked she couldn't do anything until her 12-year-old son called the police . Sandra Horley CBE, chief executive of charity Refuge, said domestic violence was as serious as any other violent crime. She added: 'My thoughts go out to Melanie as she starts to rebuild her life in the wake of this horrific assault. 'It takes a huge amount of courage to testify against a violent partner or ex-partner, and it is crucial that victims feel protected by having the full weight of the law behind them when they find the strength to take their abuser to court. 'Domestic violence must be treated just as seriously as any other violent crime. 'Gary Parker now needs to accept responsibility for his violence and take steps to change his behaviour. Using violence is a choice - there is no excuse.' Polly Neate, chief executive of domestic abuse charity Women's Aid added: 'Domestic violence has a significant impact on the women who experience it: often leaving significant mental or physical health problems. 'This is because domestic violence is rarely a one-off incident of violence, and is usually part of a pattern of ongoing coercive and controlling behaviour. 'An abusive relationship can totally destroy a woman's self-confidence and sense of independence. 'Sentences for domestic violence must take into account this context of ongoing abuse, and should send the message that this kind of violence is never acceptable or a trivial thing.'","Gary Parker, 26, beat Melanie Adams, 37, as her two sons cowered upstairs .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . Sandra McDonald spent a lifetime searching for the mother who gave her up for adoption at only a few days old, only tragically to find that she was too late, and her mother had died in 2002. Despite this devastating news, Sandra, from Edinburgh, gained two half-sisters and an aunt through her quest to find the mother who left a hole in her childhood. ‘Even at a young age I felt there was something missing,’ Sandra explains, ‘I was only able five or six and I remember going out into the street and shouting for my real mum. Reunited: Sandra (c) with her newly found half-sisters Loraine Rennie (l) and Elizabeth Hall (r) ‘It’s like something is missing in my heart and soul. I just want a cuddle from her.’ Adopted in 1961, Sandra was the only child of her adoptive parents, Jemima and Donald. Growing up Sandra felt she was treated coldly by her adoptive parents. Despite doing anything she could to gain their acceptance, she always felt she simply didn’t belong. From a young age Sandra pined for her birth mother. As a teenager the strain on the relationship with her adoptive parents only grew and at fifteen Sandra decided that she needed to find her biological mum. ‘it was a very cold relationship, but I think as a child you try your best to think “this will help them to love me more”. You do well at school, your room is clean, you do as your told and everything but it doesn’t work like that. At age just 15 and struggling with her adoptive parents, Sandra began her search for her birth mother, knowing only that she had been in the care of a church-run mother and baby home. ‘I went to the offices and I thought because they were religious there would be some compassion there. The man was so rude it was unbelievable, saying “your mother sinned abominably and she doesn’t want to be reminded of the sins she’s committed and she has to move forward” ‘I felt so sorry for my mum. I thought if he’s like that with me what an earth has he been like with her. Id never felt anger like that in my life before- it made me more determined to find my mum.’ Unhappy with her adoptive parents, Sandra began the long search for her mother at just 15 (stock photo) At age 18 Sandra gained access to her adoption file and discovered her mother was called Mrs Elizabeth Blair, recording a maiden name of Anderson. Sandra spent years searching, contacting hundreds of women with her mother’s name but to no avail. ‘I’ve always felt there was that strong connection between us from the heart and that’s what‘s kept me going.’ When ITV’s Long Lost Family took on the search they discovered that Sandra’s mother had died in 2002. They did however discover two daughters – and Sandra’s half sisters- Elizabeth Hall and Loraine Rennie. ‘I’m glad she was happy and went on to have more children. But it’s a shock finding out my mum is dead and now I have all these siblings , having been an only child.’ The two girls had never been told about Sandra growing up and it was only after their mother’s death that the secret came out when their aunt, Ina Haque, told them. The trio et for the first time at the Wallace monument in Stirling – one of their mother’s favourite places. ‘I felt my heart flip. That is really my sisters sitting there.’ Two weeks later, Sandra traveled to Mansfield and, in an emotional meeting is reunited with her aunt. Ina Haque, who lives in Mansfield recounts the pain that her sister experienced when she gave up her daughter for adoption. ‘Me and my mother went to visit her in the home, and she came to the window and held the baby up for us to see, and her face was all red from crying. I just knew she was going through an awful, awful time,' Ina recalls. Despite not being able to meet her mother, being reunited with her aunt and half-sisters has given Sandra a sense of comfort. ‘I felt we had all just connected like a chain that had been broken and we were all back together again.’ Long Lost Families, tonight at 9pm on ITV .","Sandra has been looking for her birth mother since she was 15 .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Details regarding James Packer's $2 billion Sydney casino have been kept secret in a NSW Government report outlining how it  will be run. Twelve pages and one key stakeholder agreement have been kept confidential by the author - The NSW Independent Liquor and Gaming Authority- which claim their disclosure would be 'commercially damaging' to the operations of the casino licence. Contained in the report are agreements between Packer's Crown Resorts and the NSW government, and the rules set out for the casino including who may enter, the types of games which may be played, minimum bet limits and tax rates. James Packer's Barangaroo casino is set to open in November 2019 . Eight of the agreements between the parties were to be 'executed contemporaneously' when the casino licence was issued on July 8, but only seven of those have been made public in the 'VIP Gaming Management Agreement.' A considerable number of pages of the report have also been redacted or blacked-out. Greens Upper House MP John Kaye has accused the NSW Government of 'moving into very dangerous territory' considering the latest ICAC investigations which resulted in the resignations of a number NSW Liberal MPs. He said this latest report was another example of the Liberals doing 'doing more back-room deals with corporate donors and mates.' The Greens will move to subpoena the redacted information  during a sitting of parliament next week. Greens Upper House MP John Kaye, left,  will move to make the 'hidden' documents public during parliament next week . The NSW Government has decided to keep casino details public citing their disclosure would damage its license . 'Next week, the Greens will be moving to subpoena the missing documents, using the upper House call-for-papers process,' he said. 'It will be up to the Labor Party and Fred Nile’s Christian Democrats to decide whether they support an open and accountable process or are happy to let the government cut side deals with an anonymous corporate entity.' A NSW Independent Office Of Gaming spokesman has defended the confidential information, citing a lack of public interest. He said its disclosure would subject the related parties to 'potential harm.' 'The information redacted in the VIP Gaming Management Agreement document would, in the view of the Authority, not promote the objects of the relevant Act and be commercially damaging to the licensee or related entities if released,' he said. 'It was the Authority’s view the public interest in its disclosure did not outweigh that potential harm.' In July, Crown Resorts was granted a licence to operate a VIP-only restricted gaming facility, without poker machines, at Barangaro in Sydney. It will begin operating on November 15, 2019 after the NSW government backed its proposal.","Information has been redacted from a report into Crown Resorts business .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A former Miss Belgium is planning a Jamie Oliver-style campaign to get all British children to sit GCSE exams in sex education. Sex therapist and TV presenter Goedele Liekens believes the way sex education is handled in British schools is 'hopelessly out of date'. Now, in a bid to get British children better informed, she is hoping to follow in the footsteps of TV chef Oliver who used a television series to campaign for better school dinners. Belgian TV presenter Goedele Liekens is hoping to follow in the footsteps of TV chef Oliver who used a television series to campaign for better school dinners . Liekens' hour-long one-off Channel 4 show, Sex in Class, will argue for a GCSE in sex education when it airs and the channel hope a series will follow, it was reported today. The programme will feature Liekens, who is also a UN Goodwill Ambassador, visiting the classrooms and homes of British schoolchildren, working with 15 and 16-year-olds. Liam Humphreys, Channel 4's head of factual entertainment, said: 'The way she looks at the world and sex education is going to be the most marvellous culture clash with even the most liberally minded British teacher. 'Some of the things acceptable [in other countries] – teaching 10-year-olds all about masturbation – is obviously going to stretch the boundaries of what is acceptable over here, but if you analyse what she is saying it makes complete sense.' Liekens told a Belgian newspaper the UK has been 'too prudish for too long' about sex education. 'England has just about the highest teenage pregnancy rate in Europe,' she said. 'Now they have finally realised that it is best to teach youngsters about feelings, relationships and sex.' Goedele Liekens (right) attends an aftershow party following the European Gala performance of The Vagina Monologues in Brussels, Belgium . But the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children said sex education should be left to parents. The society's Safe at School campaign national coordinator Antonia Tully told MailOnline: 'They don't need to spin this out over a GCSE! What are they going to cover? 'It's horrifying. Where are the parents in all this? 'The big myth is that you need to give children sex education like this to protect them from sexual abuse, but there is no research that shows there is a link between lack of sex education and abuse. TV chef Jamie Oliver used his Channel 4 programme to campaign for better school dinners in Britain's primaries . 'It's just playing on parental fears. For a former Miss Belgium to come in and say this is not helpful. We don't need lessons to titillate teenagers. This is not the best approach to ensuring children are protected. 'Parents are the best people to talk to children about these intimate details. Sex isn't an academic subject, it is a personal matter.' The society also warned that much of the teaching in schools already uses explicit material that is inappropriate for young children. Most state comprehensives already offer sex education as part of the national curriculum. But thousands of academies, free and faith schools are not required to teach the national curriculum, meaning they are free to drop the subject. Provision in primary schools is also patchy, with most not teaching anything until the final years. Last week the Liberal Democrats announced plans to force all state schools, including primaries,  to teach sex education. Nick Clegg’s Schools Minister David Laws committed the party to introducing sex education for all children aged seven and over to help them become ‘good citizens’. The move, backed by Labour but opposed by the Conservatives, would force thousands of schools to increase the amount of sex education on offer. Countries such as the Netherlands and Sweden have been held up as examples of a more liberal and open attitude to sex education than the UK. In the Netherlands, sex and relationship education begins in primary schools for children as young as six. It has one of the lowest teenage pregnancy rates in the world. British parents retain the right to withdraw their children from sex education classes, and surveys have frequently shown that many oppose school sex education for young children.","Sex therapist and TV presenter Goedele Liekens believes Brits are 'prudish'

"By . Lucy Osborne for the Daily Mail . 'Ugly': Research showed that 46 per cent of 16-year-old girls enjoy being active - but say they are put off physical exercise simply because they hate what they have to wear. (File picture) Plenty of youngsters will admit that PE is their least favourite part of the school day. But for the girls, it seems this reluctance has little to do with exercise – and everything to do with their outfits. Nearly half of teenage girls would be happy to play more sport if their school PE kits weren’t so ‘ugly’, a poll has found. The research showed that 46 per cent of 16-year-old girls enjoy being active – but say they are put off physical exercise simply because they hate what they have to wear. And 39 per cent of younger girls, aged eight to 16, said the same thing. One pupil told researchers: ‘My PE kit’s uncomfortable and a little bit small – I don’t like myself in it.’ Another said: ‘If you’ve got something you don’t like wearing, or you think doesn’t look nice, you don’t really want to do any sport in it.’ Nearly half of girls also admitted to making up excuses to get out of doing sports classes, and more than a quarter of 16-year-olds said they feel ugly when they play sport, according to the study by health club chain Virgin Active. Youth inactivity is a major problem in the UK, particularly among young girls. A separate study recently found that nearly four out of ten 16-year-old girls never take any strenuous activity in school. In response to the research, Virgin Active and the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation challenged young girls to design a PE kit that they would be happy to wear. The winner, 13-year-old Emily Marshall, swapped the traditional PE kit – with its low-cut V-necked polo shirts, unflattering skirts and uncomfortable materials – for a more modern design featuring leggings, high-necked collars and dark colours that hide sweat patches. Emily said: ‘I enjoy exercise and know it is good for me but sometimes my school PE kit made me feel very self-conscious.’ One pupil who tried the winning design said: ‘You just feel more confident about your body and I think that’s really important because you don’t want to be worrying about what other people are thinking of you.’ Matt Merrick, managing director of Virgin Active, said: ‘This winning PE kit design is just the starting point, showing what makes girls feel confident. ‘Virgin Active is now calling for schools, politicians and PE kit manufacturers to listen to these findings and consider incorporating them into the PE kits of the future, so that more young girls feel engaged with being active in their everyday lives.’ Old-fashioned: Young girls said they disliked the low-cut V-necked polo shirts and uncomfortable materials of traditional PE kits - instead they wanted a more modern design featuring leggings and dark colours .","Research showed that 46% of 16-year-old girls enjoy being active .

The first day of spring has cleared to be a typically crisp and sunny day for the beginning of the blooming season but not before the misty blanket covered the city's famous skyline on Monday. The Opera House was barely visible across the foggy harbour while Sydney Harbour bridge was poking out through the morning haze. One image shows a thick fog stretching across the horizon behind a ferry in the harbour. Scroll down for video . Sydney Opera House was lost in a hazy fog on Monday morning . A rolling fog stretches across the horizon behind a ferry on the harbour . The fog creates a mystique over the harbour bridge . Bureau of Meterology's meteorologist Sarah Chadwick said Sydney airport experienced more of a mist than a fog with visibility reducing to 8,000 metres. The airport was predicted on average to only have a fog in the area no more than twice this month. An airport spokeswoman said there was low visibility between 4.55am and 6.45am on Monday but the airport did not close. 'Sydney airport has made a multi-million dollar investment to be upgraded from a category 1 to a category 2, so the majority of planes can operate as normal during fog,' she said. However, some domestic airlines decided to cancel or delay flights. Richmond in Sydney's north-west suffered from the most fog which came through at about 12.50am and didn't clear until 8.30 this morning with visibility below 1,000 metres. The suburb was expected on average to experience as many as six foggy periods this month. Ms Chadwick said fog was caused from clear skies overnight allowing the surface temperatures to cool down for the fog droplets to form. 'The air needs to be a little bit moist rather than dry conditions,' she said. 'When the temperature cools down to what we call the fog point it then condenses into liquid form instead of being clear invisible gas form to become clouds.' Parts of the bridge disappear into the fog . The opera house is more visible as the fog starts to clear . Locals were prompted to capture the atmospheric shots and share the images on social media . This comes just three days after a thick blanket of heavy fog created travel chaos for people heading into Melbourne Airport. Visibility was reduced to about 150 metres at the airport and across the city. Photos of the city show its skyscrapers barely visible and the wings of planes just poking through the fog at the airport. Bouts of the fog had been causing trouble in Victoria's capital city over the past couple of weeks. Covered: The planes at Melbourne airport are barely visible through the fog that set in on Friday . Disruption: Melbourne's skyline has been covered in a thick blanket of fog on and off for weeks. On August 16 this picture was taken, with visibility reported at just 150m in some areas . Melbourne Airport spokeswoman Anna Gillett said the fog had forced some international flights to divert to other cities and some incoming domestic flights had been delayed but, at this stage, departures were not badly affected. 'We're advising people to jump on to their airline's website and check for updates to their schedules but at this stage come to the airport as normal,' Ms Gillett said. Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster Terry Ryan said the fog should begin to lift later on Friday morning. Disappearing: The tip of a skyscraper can just be seen above the fog in Melbourne . Planes were grounded on Friday morning at Melbourne airport . Bemused: 'Melbourne covered in fog for the third morning in a row, starting to feel like Gotham City,' Kieran Jones said on Twitter on Friday . 'It should begin to lift at the airport around 10-ish but generally it will take a while to clear from the city area and the suburbs because it takes a while for the sun to heat things up,' he said. The fog should clear Melbourne by lunchtime, he said. Mr Ryan said a slow moving weather pattern with a high pressure ridge over Victoria and light winds had caused this week's foggy conditions. 'It's a very unusual weather pattern for this time of year,' he said. 'A pattern like this is normally associated with autumn.' Melbourne is expecting a sunny top of 18C on Friday, with sunshine and temperatures into the low 20C range over the weekend ahead of showers and a cooler change on Monday.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . A Tory MP allegedly reduced to tears by David Cameron after rebelling on Europe has announced he will not stand at the next general election. Dudley South MP Chris Kelly is the ninth member of the 2010 intake of MPs to quit the Commons after a single term – sparking accusations that many are ‘giving up’ on the Prime Minister. It comes just days after rebel MP Douglas Carswell announced he was leaving the Tories for UKIP. Mr Kelly denied reports in 2010 that he had burst into tears after a showdown with Mr Cameron over a vote on Europe. The MP was accused of being more scared of upsetting his millionaire father than Mr Cameron. Scroll down for video . Businessman Chris Kelly (left) with his son Chris D Kelly (right), the Tory MP for Dudley . Veteran Tory MP Sir Tony Baldry will stand down at the next election, he announced today. The North Oxfordshire MP, who represents the Church of England in the Commons, blamed the decision to fix the length of each Parliament. He said: 'If I succeed in being re-elected at the forthcoming general election, given my age, most people will assume that Parliament will be my last. 'I think this creates a danger that I may be unable to be as effective as I would wish to be; and that the constituency will be distracted from more important issues by the need to choose my successor.' Announcing his decision to step down last night, Mr Kelly said: 'I would like to thank all those who have supported me since I was selected for Dudley South in September 2007. 'I would especially like to thank all those who voted for me at the general election in May 2010 and all of the friends and supporters who helped me for that election, as well as those who have supported my efforts since. 'I am proud to have served the good people of Dudley South for the past five years.' The Eurosceptic MP won Dudley South from Labour in 2010 with a majority of 3,856. Fellow Tory MP Conor Burns said: 'Very disappointed my colleague Chris Kelly will not contest his Dudley seat at the next election. We are losing the wrong people.' Michael Dugher, Labour’s Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Kelly was ‘another Tory MP giving up on David Cameron’. He said: ‘Confidence in the Prime Minister is collapsing even inside his own party, with MPs formerly loyal to David Cameron throwing in the towel rather than fighting on. ‘Hardworking people desperately need a government which will deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Instead we have a weak Prime Minister and a divided Tory Party turning in on itself.’ In 2010 Mr Kelly was among several anti-EU Tories subjected to a four-letter onslaught by Mr Cameron as he battled to contain a rebellion over Europe. But the Tory MP insisted he did not cry. He told his local newspaper the Dudley News: ‘Man’s inhumanity to man and genocide is what makes me cry, not Prime Ministers. ‘There’s footage of me in the chamber completely dry eyed sat close to Bill Cash MP listening to his – and other members’ contributions – at precisely the time I was supposedly in tears or close to tears.’ Chris Kelly only entered Parliament in 2010, but has decided not to fight for re-election in 2015 . Mr Kelly was among 27 Conservative MPs who defied Mr Cameron  amid reports that he was more terrified of upsetting his father, Tory donor Chris Kelly senior – a leading Thatcherite with robust views on Brussels – than his party leader. Mr Kelly junior was being paid about £4,000 a month  for eight hours of work for his father’s truck dealership. It topped up his MP’s pay of £65,000 and helped him acquire a £30,000 BMW coupe, with his initials CDK on the number plate. Mr Kelly joined the family firm Keltruck soon after finishing his studies and has carried on as a non-executive director after becoming MP for Dudley South at the last Election. He resigned as a director of Keltruck Limited in April 2013. Mr Kelly was allegedly in a highly emotional state after he was summoned to Mr Cameron’s Commons office before the vote. The Prime Minister told him: ‘You are making a bloody terrible mistake, Chris, it will do your career and reputation no good at all. 'And you can bloody well forget about being a Minister.’ One MP said: ‘Cameron was effing and blinding at Chris and several others. 'Chris took it badly. We thought he was going to defect to the Government – then he joined the rebels. The talk in the tea room was that he was more worried about upsetting his dad.’ Mr Kelly junior refused to reveal if Mr Cameron had sworn at him. He said: ‘I was not close to tears at any stage.’ Asked if his father had intervened, he said: ‘What’s my father got to do with anything? I cast my vote according to my conscience and what is best for my constituency. That is the only thing I take into account.’ He added that it was ‘categorically untrue’ his father had made any threats, financial or otherwise. When Mr Kelly senior was asked if he had urged his son to defy Mr Cameron in the EU vote, he said: ‘No. He is his own man and makes his own decisions.’","Chris Kelly is the ninth member of the 2010 intake  to quit the Commons .

"By . Freya Noble . and Emily Crane . and Louise Cheer for Daily Mail Australia . The former husband of high-class escort Samantha X has described the shame he feels over his ex-wife’s decision to reveal her double life. Sydney banker David Basha told the Daily Mail Australia: ‘It’s a disgrace. I have had to explain to my kids what’s going on’. Mr Basha described the anguish the tell-all interview with his former wife, Amanda Goff, on Channel Seven’s Sunday Night had caused for him and his family. Scroll down for video . The ex-husband of Amanda Goff, David Basha, has broken his silence on his former wife's tell-all interview . Ms Goff revealed she worked as a $800 a night sex worker one week, and in her children’s tuck shop the next. She also said her children were aware of her profession. ‘I’m a good dad. I want to leave my kids out of this,’ Mr Basha said. ‘I’m worried about my family, I just really want to leave my kids out of this.’ Ms Goff, a mother-of-two defended her decision to open up about her job as a high-class escort following the interview, and said her work is empowering for women. She said going public about her career and making her children, aged five and seven, vulnerable to school yard bullying was no different to children of gay parents who faced the same hardships. 'Children are teased mercilessly every day and their mother does not have to be working in the sex industry,' the 40-year-old said. 'I think the world is changing. My kids are in classes with kids that have gay parents, lesbian mothers, they’re not ridiculed.' She talked candidly about her profession as a sex worker to spruik her novel, Hooked - Secrets of a High-Class Escort, on Channel Seven's Sunday Night. High-class escort Samantha X was identified as former magazine journalist Amanda Goff . She spends one week as a full-time mother and the next at a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD as Samantha X . Ms Goff has two children under the age of seven who she shares custody with her former partner . Ms Goff told the program she volunteered at the tuckshop of her children's school and most of the parents there knew what she did for a living. A former colleague of Ms Goff told Daily Mail Australia they were not surprised to learn of the woman's double life. 'I'm not shocked at all - she's always been a bit close to the edge. She follows her own rules. 'And I'm not surprised she's going on TV and saying it's her - I think she's always secretly wanted to be famous,' the colleague said. 'I think she's always wanted a life that's bigger than what she had. To be famous and rich. And using something to catapult her into the limelight. 'She's always been very bold and goes for what she wants. She's very single-minded. I always thought she used her looks and her boldness to get what she wants.' Ms Goff said despite what many may think, her work as an escort wasn't all about sex . The 40-year-old believes her decision to come out as an escort was not a 'big bloody deal' when it came to affecting her children . After visiting a brothel in 2012 during her lunch break while she was still a beauty editor for a magazine, she started in the industry . She has worked as a journalist at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines, but now she charges $800 an hour for her services or $5,000 for an entire night. Ms Goff spends one week as a full-time mother to her children - who she shares custody with her former partner - and the next in a luxury apartment in Sydney's CBD where she carries out her life as Samantha X. 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff said. Ms Goff said despite what many may think, her work as an escort wasn't all about sex. 'I haven’t had sex for ages actually... I’m like a naked therapist,' she told Kyle and Jackie O's radio program Kiis on Monday. 'A lot of men have told me about putting their dogs down and I’ve wiped away a lot of tears. They’re paying for my time, so what they do in that time is really up to them. 'I have champagne and beer but they often want a cup of tea. 'It is an empowered job for a woman and I think we all have the right… as long as we’re not hurting anyone.' Ms Goff (pictured here three years ago) used to work at InStyle, Prevention and New Idea magazines but is now a private escort . The 40-year-old is a mother-of-two and started escorting in 2012, two days after she visited a brothel . Ms Goff (left in 2010 and pictured right in the front row, far right in 2009) said most of the parents at her children's school know what she does for a living and are supportive . The escort recalled one incident where she was rushing to pick up her children at school and was sitting outside in her car when a client with a foot fetish messaged her, asking for a picture of her toes. The 40-year-old said she made a decision to come clean because she wanted to be free, saying she did not think it was 'such a big bloody deal', adding: 'Who am I hurting?' Despite potentially exposing her young children to ridicule, Ms Goff said she had considered the repercussions before writing her book. 'I didn’t wake up one day and say I’m going to write a book about being a hooker. I’ve thought about this very carefully, I’ve been seeing a child psychologist for a year,' she said. Her parents - who live in a middle-class suburb in England - told her she was 'disgusting' when they found out the truth . Despite potentially exposing her young children to ridicule, Ms Goff said she had considered the repercussions before writing her book . The escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012 . 'My kids know that mummy is a journalist… they know she makes sad people feel happy and they know she’s creative and wrote a book. That’s all they need to know at the moment.' Despite the stigma surrounding the profession, the escort said friends and peers had been very supportive of her transition into the industry in 2012 after visiting a brothel during her lunch break while she was still a beauty editor for a magazine. Two days later she was paid to have sex with men at an exclusive brothel in Sydney and 18 months later she moved into private escorting as Samantha X. But her parents - who live in a middle-class suburb in England - and her former partner were not as enamored with her new career path. Ms Goff's parents told her she was 'disgusting' when they found out the truth and her ex-husband's response was: 'Are you effing serious?'. 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff (left) told Sunday Night reporter James Thomas (right) 'When I look back on how I juggled the two lives, I am astounded,' Ms Goff tells Sunday Night reporter James Thomas (pictured) Goff charges $800 an hour or $5,000 a night for her services, and said she can teach married couples a thing or two . After her time sleeping with married men who pay her more than three times the average weekly salary, she says she knows the secret to a happy marriage. Ms Goff said listening was key as many men complained they were not being heard to by their spouse. She said she did not think that her clients sleeping with her were committing adultery because she gave her clients an outlet to escape from their normal lives and they could go home as happier husbands. Ms Goff said most of her clients did not see it as straying from their wives because there was no emotional commitment.","Samantha X was named as Sydney-based mother Amanda Goff .

"By . James Chapman for the Daily Mail . Signal: David Cameron told MPs he could take action in Iraq and inform the House of Commons afterwards . David Cameron last night opened the door to joining US air strikes against Islamic State forces in Iraq without Parliament’s prior approval. The Prime Minister gave his strongest signal yet that he is considering supporting Washington’s attempt to build a coalition to expand air assaults on the jihadists. He also told MPs Britain would ‘look very favourably’ on a request for help from Kurdish forces fighting extremists in Iraq, so they are ‘properly armed and equipped’. Downing Street has been wary about joining military strikes following Mr Cameron’s humiliating Commons defeat last year when he sought support for action in Syria. But the Prime Minister suggested yesterday he could order action against jihadists without MPs’ approval in advance. ‘If there was a direct threat to British national interests, or if… we had to act very rapidly to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe, the British Government must reserve the right to act immediately and inform the House of Commons afterwards,’ he said. Officials insisted no decisions had been made. Mr Cameron said this week’s summit of Nato leaders in Wales will include a ‘review of the effectiveness of the international response so far’ and a discussion of ‘what more we should do to help the region’. ‘Britain will continue to consider what further role is in our national interests, including any further diplomatic, humanitarian or indeed military measures we might take,’ he said. ‘We support American air strikes. I do not think that we should rule anything out. We should act… to promote the British national interest and to help keep our people safe. We should consider everything in the light of that.’ Intelligence chiefs believe at least 500 people have travelled from the UK to fight in the region, with 700 from France, 400 from Germany and hundreds from countries including the US, Canada, Austria, Denmark, Spain, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Australia. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre last week increased its assessment of the threat of an attack in the UK from ‘substantial’ to ‘severe’. Mr Cameron told MPs the world was ‘shocked and sickened by the barbarism’ seen in Iraq this summer, including the slaughter of Muslims by Muslims, persecution of religious minorities, enslavement and rape of women, and the beheading of US journalist James Foley by an apparently British terrorist. US president Barack Obama said last month that America was seeking to build a coalition to ‘take the fight to these barbaric terrorists’. Plans? The Prime Minister said he would look 'very favourably' on arming Kurdish forces to fight the IS . But a ComRes survey for The Independent today finds only 35 per cent of people believe the UK should join US air strikes, while 50 per cent disagree and 15 per cent say they ‘don’t know’. Former Labour minister Peter Hain said he backed air strikes to ‘stop [IS’s] genocidal attacks in the region’. He also said Britain should support the Kurds ‘in providing the equipment they need’. Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said IS was a ‘substantial threat to the continued integrity of Iraq’ and that US air strikes have been ‘successful in halting its further advance’. He added: ‘Would it not be better for the Royal Air Force to join in that measure?’ Tory MP Colonel Bob Stewart said: ‘Tragically, the only way to defeat people who are determined to carry out appalling acts, despite reason, politics, economic sanctions or whatever, is to defeat them on the battlefield.’","David Cameron said he could inform House of Commons after taking action .

"By . Christopher Stevens for MailOnline . Once, to be 21 was to stand on the threshold of adulthood. In the words of the music hall song 21 Today, you got the key of the door and the chance to do just what you liked. These days, for many, it barely has even symbolic significance. But to television producer Melanie Archer it’s a hugely important landmark – because the generation of children whose lives she started to document at the turn of the millennium – when they were seven – are now 21. Tonight, in the documentary 21Up: New Generation (tonight and tomorrow at 10.35pm BBC1), she revisits her proteges to discover how their lives have changed now that they’re no longer teenagers. All change: Ryan Sheridan is now working as a sports trainer despite battling with cerebral palsy . And the decency, humour and sheer determination she uncovers among today’s young people will be an inspiration, and perhaps a surprise, to many viewers. She returns to catch up with youngsters such as Ryan, who despite his cerebral palsy is working as a sports trainer, and jazz singer Orala, a committed Christian who intends to remain a virgin until she marries. ‘It’s a wonderful thing to be involved in,’ says Melanie, ‘a huge privilege, and a huge commitment in a way that nothing else ever could be.’ She started work on the series in the late 90s after working as a researcher with veteran documentary maker Michael Apted. His seminal programmes, returning every seven years to chart the lives of a group of 1960s schoolchildren, have now been running for half a century: in 2012, the latest installment, 56Up, was broadcast. Big plans: Committed Christian Orala Johnson has ambitions to become an opera singer now she is 21 . Tres bien: Alexandra Whitton is now studying in Paris and has a boyfriend who she sees every five weeks . Melanie was inspired to do the same for the 21st century, despite Michael’s warning: ‘It will become a much bigger part of your life than you could ever have imagined.’ She’s only now beginning to understand how true that is. ‘I feel a responsibility akin to being thir parent,’ she says, ‘even though we don’t experience day-to-day life with each other. They feel like my extended family.’ The 14 youngsters were picked from across the social spectrum. Some, like Alexandra and Oliver, come from wealthy families – both went to leading public schools and are now studying abroad. Brimming with confidence, Alexandra announces, ‘For the next ten to 15 years I’ll be going crazy to accomplish my goals.’ She has a boyfriend, but he’s in London and she’s at university in Paris: they see each other about once every five weeks, and that’s how she likes it. Gemma, a criminology student in Liverpool, takes a very different attitude to her life. Touching scenes with her boyfriend Charlie, including the moment when he helps her to cut her 21st birthday cake, show they are very much in love. Gemma was left with limited mobility by a virus when she was two years old. Her disability has helped to make her confident and upfront with others. ‘If I’m open about my condition, people are more willing to help,’ she told me cheerfully this week. ‘If I’m not embarrassed, nobody else is.’ For an older generation, the intrusion of a camera crew and two days of intense personal questions from the filmmakers might seem an unwelcome invasion of privacy. But these youngsters have grown up with their lives online, using Twitter and Facebook. ‘Nowadays everything is quite intrusive,’ Gemma points out. ‘It doesn’t bother me, I’m a very open person. But before you talk on camera, it’s important to decide what you want to keep personal and what you don’t mind other people knowing.’ In love: Gemma Roberts is studying criminology in Liverpool and is deeply in love with her boyfriend Charlie . Struggling with identity: Asif Lateef is trying to reconcile his religion with his love of pop music such as  Rihanna . That’s more difficult for participants such as Asif in Glasgow, whose family are observant Muslims. There’s a lot he wants to say, but he doesn’t want to offend his loved ones. Though he’s still religious, he doesn’t want to attend mosque several times a day. He prefers to be with his friends, studying law and listening to music – he confesses that he’s a Rihanna fan, though his mother thinks pop music is a temptation devised by the devil. Asif is coping bravely as he tries to shed the restrictions of his culture. ‘I felt I was a bit like a puppet as a kid,’ he says frankly. Stacey is dealing with a different kind of culture shock. At 14 she lived in a Derbyshire village and had visited a city just once – ‘I didn’t like Manchester, it was too big!’ But now she’s on the other side of the world, teaching English to Chinese teens in Hunan province, and when she walks down the street people stop and stare – many have never seen a European woman before. For Stacey, one catalyst of this massive change was the break-up of her parents’ marriage. She hasn’t heard from her father for two years. ‘I don’t think he cares,’ she says sadly. Tribulations: Stacey Tideswell has had to deal with her parents' divorce and hasn't heard from her dad in years . Footballer: Sanchez Payne had signed for Leeds United but left after injuries. He is now looking for a new club . Professional footballer Sanchez is very close to his parents, and relies on them for support and encouragement in his career. As a teenager he was a promising talent at Leeds United, but he’s suffered injury setbacks and is currently on the hunt for a new club. Sanchez has an unusual perspective on the TV series – he’s looking forward to the 70Up edition, when he hopes to be able to sit down with his children and grandchildren so they can see what his life has been like. ‘It’s a massive project and I’m delighted to be a part of it – it’s priceless,’ he told me this week. He too shares the sense that they’re part of an extended family – though it came as a shock to Melanie when he introduced her to a friend as ‘my second mum’. ‘I’d never thought of it in those terms,’ she says, ‘although I am the same age as his dad.’ Social media means that, although the 14 participants are now living as far apart as New York and China, they’re all able to maintain contact. They met in London earlier this month for a premiere screening of the programme. ‘Ryan’s mum and mine hit it off, and now they’re going to do a charity run together,’ Sanchez says. ‘One of the other guys is into the same music as me, so we’re going to meet up. This show is a real blessing in my life.’ ‘It’s weird to see how much we’ve grown up and changed,’ laughs Gemma. ‘But it’s really nice to share this thing together, and to have our lives documented. I’ll definitely want to continue with it in the future.’ 21 Up New Generation is on BBC One at 10.35pm on September 1 and 2 .","21Up revisits 14 young adults last seen as teens as they turn 21 .

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . Derek Grant, 38, pleaded guilty to the culpable homicide of Patrick Bradley (pictured), who blinded father-of three Grant in one eye when he was confronted after stealing Grant's son's phone . A father who was blinded in one eye during a confrontation with a thug who stole his son's iPhone has today been jailed for six years for stabbing him to death during the attack. Derek Grant, 38, pleaded guilty to the culpable homicide of Patrick Bradley, 29, a serial offender described in court as 'a man of violence'. Grant was blinded in one eye during the savage battle when Bradley stabbed him through the left eyeball. It emerged that the victim, who had a lengthy criminal record, had already been jailed for knifing someone in the eye. After sentence was passed at The High Court in Livingston a member of Grant's family branded the outcome 'a farce'. The woman, understood to be Grant's wife added: 'That guy was an animal.' Grant and three of his sons were originally charged with murder after Mr Bradley robbed his 19-year-old son Jordan - a politics student - at knifepoint. The Grants used the 'Find My iPhone' app on August 30 last year to locate the stolen mobile. Grant then left his home in the town's Wellington Street with Jordan and his two younger sons Lee, 17, and 16-year-old Jamie. The father-of-three had armed himself with a knife to confront Mr Bradley, a decision described by defence counsel Iain Duguid  as 'a huge mistake'. When they spotted the robber, who was not known to them, Derek Grant ordered him to hand back the stolen phone. Mr Bradley reacted by horrifically plunging a knife through Grant's left eye, blinding him. Severely injured, Grant stabbed Mr Bradley five times with the blade he had brought with him. Three of the blows landed in Mr Bradley's chest causing fatal injuries and he died in hospital later that day. Passing sentence, Judge Lord Boyd said a victim statement from Mr Bradley's parents made clear that he was 'a loving and caring son whose death at your hands has left them, as his mother says, ""broken-hearted"".' He added: 'Nothing I can say or do can alleviate that pain.' However, Lord Boyd highlighted that there was another side to Mr Bradley's character . The father-of-three had armed himself with a knife to confront Mr Bradley, a decision described by defence counsel Iain Duguid at Livingston High Court as 'a huge mistake' He told Grant: 'He was a man of violence. He had ten convictions for assault, five of which were on indictment and included assault to severe injury and assault to severe injury and permanent disfigurement. 'But you, of course did not know that. What you did know was that earlier that night Patrick Bradley had robbed your son of his mobile phone at knifepoint. 'Had he been caught it seems likely given his record that he would have been prosecuted in this court, the High Court, and on conviction would have received a High Court sentence. Bradley had robbed Grant's iPhone. The confrontation between the pair began after he refused to give the phone back . 'As it happens you had the means to bring him to justice because the phone had been easily located by the Find My iPhone app. 'All you needed to do was to phone the police and give them the information. However, you armed yourself with a knife and, along with your three sons, went looking for him.' The judge said Grant's lawyer had earlier described that decision as an error of judgment. But he told the accused: 'I can't accept that as a valid description. It's clear you were prepared to be met with violence - or at least the threat of violence - and went armed to meet it. 'All to often it's said in this court that people take a knife for protection. It's most unfortunate that it's an excuse we hear all to often when talking about tragedy. 'In the event the Crown has accepted that the violence you encountered was in their words significant and it was for that reason that your plea of guilty to the lesser crime of culpable homicide was accepted.' Lord Boyd acknowledged that Grant had lost an eye as a result of being stabbed and now had a lifelong disability, which had effectively ended his career as a delivery driver. He described Grant's conviction as a 'tragedy' for his family and told him the proud educational record of his sons was a credit to him. He went on: 'I take into account you will have to live with the physical consequences of that event for the rest of your life and I have reduced the sentence accordingly . 'Nevertheless, the fact is you took the law into your own hands and went looking for a man you knew was armed with a knife armed with a weapon of your own.'","Derek Grant pleaded guilty to the culpable homicide of Patrick Bradley .

"By . Hugo Gye for MailOnline . A brother and sister have been reunited for the first time in six decades after they were separated as young children. Allan Healy spent years looking for his long-lost sibling Margaret Mitchell - but was only able to track her down thanks to Facebook. After the pair were reunited, Mr Healy was delighted to discover that his mother is still alive, and still remembers him despite suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Reunited: Margaret Mitchell, left, found her long-lost brother Allan Healy, centre, thanks to the help of her neighbour Kathie McGill, right . Mr Healy and Mrs Mitchell grew up with their parents and brother Stewart in Dundee, but after their parents split up in 1954 the family was divided. Their father John took the boys to Plymouth, where he was originally from, while their mother Elizabeth stayed with her daughter in Scotland. In later life Allan, 66, joined the Army, while devoting years to trying to find his sister - without any luck. 'I scoured birth and marriage certificates, and other records, to try and find my sister,' he said. 'My search took me to Scotland, where I at first drew a blank because of the different system with data protection. 'Then I thought about Facebook and a cousin sent me a photograph of Stewart, Margaret and myself taken when we were children. 'I made it my Facebook profile picture and put out a message for anyone who might know Margaret Healy to get in touch.' Childhood: Mr Healy and Mrs Mitchell pictured in their youth with their brother Stewart, right . Mrs Mitchell, 67, was also using the site to try to find her brother - and when a friend stumbled across Mr Healy's photograph she realised it must be him. 'My neighbour Kathie McGill is interested in family history and she helped me by putting out a message for an Allan Healy, who I thought might still be in Plymouth,' she said. 'Then Kathie came through and said there was a photograph on Facebook with a young Allan Healy and a girl with him - and I was the girl. I was amazed.' After discovering the picture, the brother and sister had a tear-filled telephone conversation, and Mr Healy travelled to Dundee for a family reunion. He said: 'I got out of the car, looked over and saw Margaret standing there. I ran over and we hugged and cried. We couldn't believe that we were together again.' They went to visit their mother, now 88, in the Dundee care home where she lives - though Mr Healy assumed that she must have died years earlier. Mrs Mitchell said: 'When I spoke with him on the phone I was struggling for things to say at first. But I ended up speaking about Mum and he was so shocked to hear she was still alive. 'He just couldn't believe it and burst into tears when I told him. We went to visit her and even though she has Alzheimer's she still recognised him and held our hands together.' She added: 'I said, ""Hello Mum, I've brought Allan to see you."" She looked up and put my hand on his hand and her hand on top and said, ""We're all together again now.""' Their father, now 90, worked as a cooper in Plymouth, where he married his second wife. Mrs Mitchell is now planning to visit her brother at his home in Margate, Kent. 'He's been searching for me for years but I have to say that I never thought I'd see him again,' she said. 'I don't understand about all these modern Facebook things so I was just amazed that we managed to find him.'","Allan Healy and Margaret Mitchell were separated in 1954 when their parents split up and their father moved from Dundee to Plymouth .

When Gordon Olley went to see A Hard Day’s Night with his girlfriend in 1964, little did he know that he would later be walking out of the cinema with another woman on his arm. Now, the 67-year-old has taken his wife Mary, 65, to watch the Beatles film which they saw on their first ‘date’ at the same cinema in Dereham, Norfolk, exactly 50 years ago. He was just 17 when he took his then-girlfriend Edna, to watch the movie on August 30, 1964 - but she had asked him to buy an extra ticket for her best friend Mary, who was then just 15. Happy couple: Gordon Olley, 67, took his wife Mary, 65, to see the Beatles film A Hard Day's Night - which they saw on their first 'date' at the same cinema in Dereham, Norfolk, exactly 50 years ago .

'I bought a copy when it was released on DVD and the people at the cinema have been so nice to let us do this' Gordon Olley . Mr Olley dreamed up re-enacting their famous first date some ten years ago. ‘Back then they didn’t think they would be able to get hold of the film,’ he said. ‘I bought a copy when it was released on DVD and the people at the cinema have been so nice to let us do this.’ Dereham Cinema, part of the Hollywood Cinemas local chain, opened especially for the Olleys and staff went in earlier than normal to screen A Hard Day’s Night for the couple.

"By . Thomas Burrows for MailOnline . A woman fought off five hooded thieves and put one in a headlock to protect her blind husband who was watching television on the sofa. Marion Pedersen, 47, was watching TV with husband Andrew, 50, when the men broke into their sheltered accommodation home in Harborne, Birmingham. Fearing the gang were about to attack her husband, she launched herself off the sofa and attacked the group. Marion Pedersen, 47, fought off hooded thieves to protect her blind husband, Andrew, 50 . She wrestled one of the gang to the group and grabbed him in a headlock, before shouting for help. But the thief wriggled free and, along with the rest of the gang, fled - having left the couple's flat ransacked. They made off with the couple's laptop, a mobile phone and a purse containing a small amount of cash and credit cards. Ms Pedersen, a mother of one, was treated at the scene by paramedics following the incident at 12.10am on Thursday and suffered a fractured rib. She said: 'One minute we were watching TV and the next thing we knew these men were in the room, running amok searching for things to steal. 'We are on the ground floor and they broke their way in through the back door. 'I was petrified and initially felt frozen to my chair, but then I thought one of them was going to do something to Andrew. 'Instinct just came over me, I don't know if I was being brave or just stupid. 'I got one of the thieves in a headlock and dragged him down to the floor. 'I pulled back his hooded top as I wanted to get a good look at the face of someone who could do something so heartless. 'But then he pushed me off him and I felt my rib go and I started screaming. That's when they ran off. 'I haven't attacked anyone before but when one of them was going towards my husband I saw red.' Fearing the gang were about to attack her husband, she launched herself off the sofa and attacked them . Her husband, who used to work as a hospital porter before he went blind 16 years ago, added: 'I heard people coming in and my wife was screaming ""get out"". 'Apparently four of them went to the table and one came towards me. 'Marion saw red and got him in a headlock and knocked him to the floor. 'It was amazing, it scared them off. She is my hero.' The couple, who have been married for three years but together for 26, have only lived at the sheltered accommodation for a year. Ms Pedersen said her husband had now lost his 'lifeline' as relatives entertained him with the laptop that was stolen, while he sits through three four-hour sessions of dialysis every week. She added: 'I am sickened that anyone can break into someone's home, particularly when they know it is sheltered accommodation for vulnerable, disabled and old people. 'I'm worried sick that they will come back and have another go. 'I want them to be punished and I want to prevent anyone else from having this happen to them.' She described the thieves as Asian, aged between 18 and 20, and of a slim build. A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said: 'Police have launched an investigation after a break-in at an address in Elm Tree Road, Harborne, just after midnight on Thursday August 28. 'The occupant challenged the five offenders and was pushed to the floor. 'They made off with a laptop, a mobile phone and bank cards.'","Marion Pedersen, 47, fought off the thieves when they broke into her home in Birmingham .

"By . Jennifer Newton for MailOnline . Gadgets almost running out of battery can often strike fear in their owners but this man became even more panic stricken when he realised his camera drone was about to run out power over a lake. The man was flying his drone fitted with a HD-3D camera for just the second time over the water in his back garden in British Columbia, Canada when he noticed the battery on the gadget was running dangerously low. He then realised that he had to retrieve it quickly, and made a desperate dash, emptying his pockets and runs straight into the water fully-clothed to save his drone. Scroll down for video . Footage taken from the man's drone shows it hovering over a lake filming what appears to be his family in their back garden . But as the man realises the drone's battery is about to run out, he runs towards the water's edge . After a momentary pause, he takes his phone and wallet out of his pockets, throwing them down, before jumping into the water full-clothed . And luckily he just manages to grab it before it falls into the lake with the whole incident captured on camera. The footage, filmed by the camera, starts showing the man, and what appears to be his family, enjoying a day by the lake in their garden with one of the children even wading in the water. But then as the drone begins to fall, he realises that the battery is about to run out and he can be seen laying his iPad on the ground and running towards the lake. After pausing for a second at the lake's edge, he then removes his wallet and his phone from his pockets and runs into the water, which is waist high, wearing all of his clothes.

"By . Ashley Collman for MailOnline . Shot dead: Dana Miller (pictured) was killed last month in a murder-suicide when her 'depressed' husband Jeffrey shot her dead and then turned the gun on himself at their Jackson Township, Pennsylvania home . Police believe a man who suffered from a flesh-eating disease called 911 after shooting his wife last month, and then turned the gun on himself in a tragic murder suicide carried out in the midst of their bitter divorce. Jeffrey A Miller, 52, and his 47-year-old wife Dana W Miller were found shot to death in their Jackson Township, Pennsylvania home the evening of August 6 by their 18-year-old son Jeffrey Miller Jr. Friends say the couple, who had been married for 20 years and shared three teenage children, had separated in recent months due to issues surrounding Jeffrey's depression. Dana's friend Melanie Holscher says the Miller's relationship deteriorated in recent years, after her husband developed a life-threatening flesh-eating disease which aggravated his depression. 'It just got worse throughout the years and especially after the flesh-eating disease, but she was in there trying to provide a good home for her family and kids,' Holscher told WTAE. The couple were in the process of selling the home they shared on 300 Evans Road, when Jeffrey called his wife over to the house the afternoon of August 6, saying a potential buyer was stopping by and he wanted her to be there for the showing. That's when Jeffrey reportedly shot his wife several times, with a 9mm handgun that was registered in her own name. Police received an ominous phone call just before 5:45pm, from an anonymous caller they believe to be Jeffrey, reporting gun shots nears the address. Son Jeffrey Miller Jr arrived at the home to hear the final shot, and walked into the house to find both of his parents dead. Police say Dana Miller suffered several gunshot wounds while her husband was shot once in the head. There was no sign of struggle, police said. Local police added that they had been called to the home more than a half-dozen times since January, for domestic disputes mostly over personal property, police Chief Terry Seilhamer said. Lured: Jeffrey Miller allegedly called his wife the afternoon of August 6, and told her to come over to the home they were selling since a potential buyer was stopping by to see the house . One of those incidents turned violent, and Jeffrey went on to obtain a protective order against his wife, claiming she hit him over the head with an Xbox console. But Dana's friends and family say she was the victim of abuse, and that her estranged husband made up the claims to stop her from getting a restraining order herself. 'Dana did everything for him,' her mother Carol Wilson of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina said. 'He wasn't going to let anyone else have her.' At the time of her death, Dana was free on bond awaiting an August 26 hearing in which he was expected to have the charges dropped since she attended counseling sessions. He eventually dropped the retraining order on May 27, when she moved out of their home and into another house in Cranberry Township with their 15-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter. Eighteen-year-old Jeffrey Miller Jr remained at home with his father.","Jeffrey A Miller, 52, and his 47-year-old wife Dana were found shot to death last month at their home in Jackson Township, Pennsylvania .

"By . Lucy Thackray for Daily Mail Australia . The Royal Commission has found that the Rudd Government should have done more to protect the installers that lost their lives due to the botched home insulation scheme, ruling that the deaths were 'avoidable' and the $2.8 billion program was 'poorly planned and poorly implemented'. The reputations of former Labor ministers have been trashed in the report, according to the lawyer of one of the men who lost their lives. Gold Coast lawyer Bill Potts represents the Barnes family, whose 16-year-old son Reuben died just 21 days after starting as an insulation installer, in November 2009. Reuben was the second of four men who died working on the scheme before it was hastily shut down in early 2010. Scroll down for video . Death of a teenager: Rueben Barnes was just 16 years old and was three weeks into his first job with a home insulation company when he was electrocuted laying batts in the ceiling cavity of a house in Stanwell, Queensland . Mr Potts says the royal commission report into the scheme, released on Monday, has trashed the reputations of senior Labor figures. 'It's been trashed for good reasons, because young men died and that should never have happened,' Mr Potts told reporters in Brisbane. Prime Minister Tony Abbott has slammed the pink batts scheme, an initiative from the Rudd Government. 'The report's findings are grave, and its recommendations are detailed. It details a litany of failures arising from a dysfunctional culture,' said Prime Minister Tony Abbott. The report reveals that the scheme prioritised speedy work, which lead to crucial errors. Sufficient planning did not take place, nor were risks to installers identified or managed and training requirements were not met. Former prime minister Kevin Rudd took 'ultimate responsibility' for the disastrous scheme at a Commission hearing in May this year. Mr Potts told the court that (Mr Barnes) was 16 years of age, he had been on the job for three weeks (with) almost no training whatsoever. Reuben Barnes' safety equipment was some sunscreen.' He likened public servants rolling out the program to the crew of the Titanic. 'Too frightened, in essence, to call out ""iceberg ahead"". The reason for that is that they were told ""get this done and get it done quickly"",' he said. Lawyer Aaron Anderson said his clients Kevin and Christine Fuller, whose son Matthew died under the scheme, would be pleased the report addressed a number of their key concerns. 'Kevin and Christine will be working closely with the commonwealth government to make sure these recommendations, particularly those that were causative of Matthew Fuller's death, are addressed in a timely manner,' he said. Matthew Fuller, Rueben Barnes, Mitchell Sweeney and Marcus Wilson were the four installers who died during the roll-out, with hundreds of house fires breaking out before it was finally shut down in early 2010 . Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt promised to heed those recommendations. 'We are sorry for the errors that led to these tragedies. Nothing can bring these beautiful young men back but we can and we will learn the lessons,' he told parliament. Mitchell Scott Sweeney, 22, seen here with his mother Wendy, was the fourth person to die in the insulation scheme. He was electrocuted on February 2, 2010 while laying sheeting in a home in Millaa Millaa . When asked if the families deserved compensation, Queensland Premier Newman said it was time to consider it. 'They've got every right to just feel so terribly wronged,' he told reporters in Brisbane. 'I think these sort of things now need to be looked at.'","Royal Commission rules Rudd Government should have done 'more' to protect the installers .

"By . Harriet Arkell For Mailonline . Michael Deighton, 19, from Walker, Newcastle, is awaiting sentencing after admitting harassment after he was dumped by girlfriend Sophie Bruce . An obsessive teenager constantly texted his girlfriend asking where she was and who she was with, demanding she send him photographs of herself to prove it, a court heard. Michael Deighton, 19, was eventually dumped by girlfriend Sophie Bruce, 18, after he demanded she delete all her male friends from Facebook, but he then turned stalker, following her to work and onto the bus, Newcastle magistrates were told. The teenager, from Walker, Newcastle, is now awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to harassment at the city's magistrates' court. Prosecutor Veronica Jordan told JPs how Deighton became possessive of his girlfriend not long after they got together. 'At first she would say the relationship was fine but it was not long before the defendant became controlling and jealous,' she said. 'He was constantly texting her, asking her where she was and who she was with, and asking her to take photographs of where she was. 'As the relationship progressed, he asked her to delete all her male friends from Facebook, and he would contact friends and tell them lies about her.' When Miss Bruce ended the romance, Deighton began sending her abusive texts, followed her home, and began lurking near her house, the court heard. 'He threatened to ruin her life and visited her place of work attempting to get her sacked,' Mrs Jordan continued. 'On that day after work she got on the bus home and he was sitting on a seat. She gets off the bus and he follows her, threatening her, saying she'd better pass on her passwords for Facebook so they could ""always be together"". 'She was petrified he could be anywhere, waiting for her.' When Deighton was arrested, police spoke to his mother who told them he had borrowed her phone and sent 73 text messages to Miss Bruce in the space of 20 minutes. Charles Weidner, defending, told magistrates that Deighton's behaviour was a sign of his immaturity. He said: 'He fully accepts the relationship is at an end. This experience hasn't been pleasant for him. 'It's a lesson for him - it's something he is going to have to understand if he's going to have further relationships.' Magistrates adjourned the case and Deighton will be sentenced after pre-sentence reports have been prepared.

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . He was one of the 20th century's most famous faces, who wowed the world with his sensational escape acts. And now a new mini-series  will reveal some of the secrets that made Harry Houdini the greatest illusionist and stunt performer ever. It explores the master magician's life and his psyche and reveals how he accomplished some of his greatest tricks. Another great escape: Harry Houdini  stands in chains at the edge of a pier ready to dive into the water in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1906 . The History Channel's new mini-series Houdini will uncover some of the secrets of the great illusionist . Among the revelations are that he worked undercover for many years for the American and British governments. The claim is supported by the 2007 book, The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero by William Kalush and Larry Sloman. In it, the authors suggest Houdini spied on royalty and political leaders of Europe for years and fluency in German, and special abilities like subterfuge and sleight of hand made him an ideal candidate for espionage. Recruited by the British Secret Service, he passed along vital information he learned while performing for Kaiser Wilhelm and Tsar Nicholas of Russia. It is claimed he also worked for Scotland Yard, monitored Russian anarchists and chased counterfeiters for the U.S. Secret Service. Among the tricks explained are how Houdini hid a key to unlock a chain inside a false finger. Houdini employed several other methods of escape from handcuffs, leg irons and jail cells. Houdini chained up in a movie still from the film The Master Mystery made in 1918 . It is revealed he hide a key or a lock pick under his foot or in his bushy hair with adhesive to carry out some of his daring escapes. He also used a hollowed-out compartment of a shoe, or an accomplice who would palm the key in his hand, to be retrieved by Houdini when they shook hands. If he could inspect a jail cell in advance, Houdini might plant his escape tool in a bar of soap or under a bench. Harry Houdini hangs upside down from a crane after freeing himself from a strait-jacket on March 30, 1916 . Harry Houdini grasping a rock in fast-moving rapids in a scene from an unknown movie made between 1916 and 1923 . Harry Houdini as a young man, about the time he and his wife formed the team of the Houdinis, Harry and Bessie . Houdini similarly smuggled keys and picks into the boxes, milk cans, water tanks and other containers that confined him in his act, manipulating them with his teeth or specially designed extension rods. Sometimes he would have the opportunity to use rigged handcuffs. The manacles would lock securely when held upright, but snap open when they were turned upside-down. He was an accomplished athlete, excelling at gymnastics and was an amateur boxer, all of which gave him the endurance, stamina and strength needed to perform difficult stunts. Houdini star Adrien Brody, who stars as Houdini in the new mini-series, at the 67th Cannes Film Festival in France . Houdini was also became fascinated by spiritualism after the death of his mother. At the turn of the century, he joined his wife Bess in a trumped-up act in which she worked as the medium. But he had a change of heart, and went out of his way to expose phoney mediums which angered the spiritualist movement. In an article Houdini wrote, 'In the twenty-five years of my investigation and the hundreds of séances which I have attended, I have never seen or heard anything that could convince me that there is a possibility of communications with the loved ones who have gone beyond.' However, after his death in October 1926 Bess continued to attend séances, hoping to contact him. In October 1926, Houdini was punched in the stomach by a student in his dressing room, and later by a stranger in a hotel lobby. Kalush and Sloman's book suggests the spiritualists may have arranged the attacks. Houdini died days later in Room 401 at Grace Hospital in Detroit, his aura of invincibility over. Born Ehrich Weiss, the son of a Hungarian rabbi, Houdini came to the U.S. with his family at the age of four, passing through Ellis Island. Early in his career, he performed as Ehrich the Great before taking his stage name Houdini from magician Robert-Houdin, whose autobiography inspired him. As an early aficionado of aviation, Houdini learned to pilot his own Voisin biplane and was the third person to fly across Australia in 1910. In 1913, he introduced his famous Chinese water torture cell, in which he was suspended upside down in a locked glass-and-steel cabinet full of water, holding his breath for more than three minutes, before emerging triumphant. In December 1914, Houdini was famously summoned to a private meeting at the White House with President Woodrow Wilson, who told him, 'I envy your ability of escaping out of tight places. Sometimes I wish I were able to do the same.' Then, during World War I, Houdini entertained troops and held classes for soldiers, demonstrating how to escape from ropes, handcuffs and shipwrecks. He died in Detroit in 1926 of peritonitis due to a ruptured, infected appendix a week after being punched by a college student challenging the magician's much-boasted-about abdominal strength.

"Carolyn Keeling allegedly first abused the boy after offering him wine and stripping down to her underwear during a tutoring session in 1993 . A female tutor seduced a 13-year-old boy during a lesson at his home before abusing him during regular sex sessions that went on for two years, a court heard today. Carolyn Keeling, 63, allegedly started abusing the boy in 1993 when she gave him wine and stripped down to her underwear to sunbathe during a tutoring session at his home, a jury heard. The alleged abuse continued until 1996, when the boy was 15. Gloucester Crown Court heard how Ms Keeling, then in her 40s, started touching the teenager through his shorts and the pair later had sex after she had fetched a condom from her car. Prosecutor Virginia Cornwall said that for the next two years the pair regularly had sex at the boy’s home while his parents were out. She claimed that at other times they had sex at Ms Keeling's home and at local hunt meetings which she attended. The pair would often drink and smoke cannabis together, she said. Ms Keeling from Taynton, near Gloucester, has pleaded not guilty to six charges of indecent assault, all against the same boy, when he was aged between 13 and 15 from September 1993 to September 1996. She was said to have had an 'otherwise glowing career' and 'has never been in trouble'. The alleged victim, now aged 33 and a father-of-three, at first thought their relationship was 'brilliant' the court heard. But he said that having two teenage boys of his own made him realise that what had happened to him when he was younger was wrong. Mrs Cornwall said that the boy, who lived in Gloucestershire, had been excluded from school when he was 12 and Mrs Keeling was one of the home tutors appointed to teach him. The court heard that she would visit his home two to three times a week and was given her own key to the house to let herself in. She would sometimes go into the boy’s bedroom to wake him - even though he slept naked, Mrs Cornwall said. Mrs Cornwall said that when Ms Keeling initiated the relationship the boy threw himself ‘wholeheartedly’ into it. She said: 'This case is about a distorted relationship between an adult teacher and a child that was in her care. 'It is an unusual case and you may think that immediately because there is a woman in the dock. 'He was excluded from school and that is why he came into contact with her. He was using drugs and had been in trouble with the police. 'In her police interview she talks about him in terms that are relatively affectionate. She talks about him as someone with potential. Gloucester Crown Court heard how Ms Keeling, then in her 40s, started touching the teenager through his shorts and the pair later had sex after she had fetched a condom from her car . 'She smoked cannabis with him on occasions and on occasions they drank together. 'She saw him in circumstances that were inappropriate and the two of them had regular sexual intercourse. They would spend a great deal of time together. 'It was a relationship that developed over time, but in reality it was abuse because she was a woman in her 40s and he was a child. It was wrong.' The relationship ended when the boy ceased education at the age of 15 and said he did not want to take any exams, said the prosecutor. He then left home. He had sex twice more with Ms Keeling when he was in his early twenties after he went back to his former tutor asking for a job reference. But, said the prosecutor, he realised that the teacher did not have the same interest in him as an adult mature male as she did when he was an immature boy. 'She said, ""Do you mind if I make myself more comfortable?"" I said ""Whatever"" and she ended up taking her top off' In 2012 he felt troubled about what had happened in his youth and he told his partner and his mother. That led to him going to a sexual abuse referral centre and, as a result, calling the police. Mrs Cornwall said that when Ms Keeling was arrested, she denied that anything untoward had taken place and insisted their relationship was entirely innocent. In evidence, the alleged victim said it was when his own sons reached the ages of 12 and 13 that he realised what had happened to him as a boy was wrong - even though he had thought it was ‘brilliant’ at the time. He told the jury of the day when Ms Keeling seduced him as they sat on his patio on a ‘blazing hot day’ when he was 13. 'She said, ""do you mind if I make myself more comfortable?"" I said ""whatever"". 'She ended up taking her top off. She was in her bra. Then she took her trousers down and was in her underwear. Carolyn Keeling, pictured outside court today, said that her relationship with the alleged victim was innocent . 'I was thinking a few things. I was a young boy and I’m not saying I wasn’t. Of course I was. 'I did find myself getting aroused. I tried to hide it basically. But she cottoned on and she sort of giggled a bit. 'She said ""don’t worry about it, don’t be embarrassed. It’s perfectly natural. Any man would in this sort of situation."" He said that at that point he reciprocated her advances, adding, 'It doesn’t take much to develop the situation from there, does it?' He said that Ms Keeling then retrieved a condom from her car before they had sex for the first time outside on her patio. He said: 'I thought it was brilliant - I was 13 years old.' He told the jury that despite what had happened to him he felt bad about Ms Keeling being prosecuted because she had been a good teacher and a friend and he would not be able to read and write as well as he does if it had not been for her teaching. But he added: 'I have got children now and if the same sort of thing happened to them at that age I would not be a happy person. 'As I get older I realised it was not right. I didn’t look at it as abuse at the time, but now as a man in his thirties I know if I touched a 13-year-old girl I would expect the full force of the law.' He told the court that at the time of the alleged abusse, however, he thought the teacher, whom he called ‘Mrs K’, was as 'cool as a cucumber' because of the way she dressed, her music tastes and the fact she got cannabis for them to smoke together. Earlier, Mrs Cornwall had told the jury that during the first sex session between Ms Keeling and the boy the condom split. The trial continues.

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . A mother has been jailed after locking her four-year-old daughter in her room for three hours so she could go into town 'to be by herself'. Sophie Ritson, 21, was jailed for 150 days after she admitted neglecting and abandoning her daughter on July 25. North Cumbria Magistrates' Court heard that worried neighbours raised the alarm after hearing the little girl pleading for food and drink and shouting that she wanted to get out. The mother was seen in Carlisle city centre (pictured) after locking her in a room because 'she needed to be by herself'. File photo . Police were called to rescue the youngster after she was left in a bedroom for more than three hours while her mum went into Carlisle city centre. Diane Jackson, prosecuting, told how officers found that the little girl's potty was nearly full and the room was sparsely decorated with bare floorboards exposed. The court was told that a neighbour heard the girl shouting 'I want to come out' from an upstairs room and later 'I'm hungry. I need a drink'. Another neighbour said she spotted Ritson, of  Carlisle, Cumbria, with her partner in the city centre at about 1pm. The police were called and officers managed to open the kitchen window in an attempt to rescue the girl before Ritson finally returned home at around 4pm. When asked by police officers why she had left her daughter, Ritson said that she 'needed to be by herself'. She also claimed that, before she left the house, her daughter was given a drink and she had locked her door for the child's own safety. Sophie Ritson was jailed at North Cumbria Magistrates Court after admitting child neglect . She added: 'I don't know what I was thinking. Her attitude stinks. She is crying all the time,' the court heard. Ritson is allowed to be named after a court order banning publication of her identity was successfully challenged. Laura Harper, defending, said her client had received a lack of support since having her daughter. 'Sophie doesn't attempt to minimise what she did that day. She didn't feel as though she could go to anyone to talk to about child problems,' she said. Sentencing, District Judge Gerald Chalk condemned what the mother had done. He said: 'I take the view that this is so serious that custody is my only option. 'Parents know the pleasure of having children but also the commitment of looking after that child properly. But you chose to abandon her for several hours.'","Court heard Sophie Ritson, 21, locked girl in room to go into town .

"By . Harriet Arkell for MailOnline . Jailed: HIV-positive Alan Mason, 45, admitted causing GBH by having sex with a woman without protection . A man who intentionally infected his girlfriend with HIV has been jailed after admitting causing grievous bodily harm. Alan Mason, 45, from Endmoor, Cumbria, discovered he had HIV three years before he had unprotected sex with the woman, but still didn't bother to tell her, Carlisle Crown Court heard. Mason was jailed for two years and eight months by Judge Paul Batty QC, who told him: 'I am of the view that you deliberately targeted this hapless, vulnerable woman.' The court was told that Mason, a divorced father of two, was diagnosed in 2008. He met the 39-year-old woman, from Barrow, in a pub in Kendal in March 2011, and began a relationship with her. When she began feeling ill while on holiday seven months later, her GP suggested she be tested for sexually transmitted infections. Prosecutor Alex Leach told the court that when she told Mason what the doctor had said, he broke down and told her he was HIV positive. He said that when a blood test later revealed that she, too, had HIV, she 'went into total shock' and thought she was going to die because of the 'alarming' amount of weight she lost, the Cumberland News reported. In a statement, which was read to the court, she said: 'He has destroyed my life and the fact of what he did to me will live with me for the rest of my life.' Mason's lawyer said he had lost his home and his job after his marriage ended and he contracted HIV. Barrister Fraser Livesey said Mason was also shunned by his friends. Mason was prosecuted following an investigation by Cumbria Police which began when his victim complained she had contracted HIV from him. Detective Constable Damian West said: 'This is a unique case for Cumbria Constabulary and the sentencing imposed highlights the disregard Mason had for his actions. 'Even though the victim has to live with this virus, modern medication means there should be no impact on life expectancy. 'However, the virus has a significant day to day impact on those who have to live with it. 'If anyone has any concerns they should speak to their doctor, or seek support from dedicated organisations, such as the Terence Higgins Trust.' Scroll down for video .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . House prices in all but one  area of Britain are now more than three times the average salary, a new study reveals. Copeland in the Lake District is the last local authority area left in Britain where average house prices are less than three times the average annual salary, research by the TUC has shown. The study found that in 1997 around in one in five local authority areas had housing regarded as 'easily affordable' - 72 areas in total. Scroll down for video . The district of Copeland in Cumbria is now the only area where the average home in less than three times the average salary, a new study has found . But the number of those areas has dramatically fallen in the intervening years, as house prices have spiralled, the report found. The TUC said its research has found there are no longer any areas in the South East, South West, London and the East of England where average house prices are less than five times the average wage. It claimed areas across the country from Rotherham to Norwich are becoming out of reach for local people because of rising house prices and low wage growth. In 1997, around one in 10 local authority areas were 'out of reach' for housing, with average prices more than five times local salaries, but the number of those areas has increased eightfold, said the report. The top five least affordable areas of the country are in London, with the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea having average house prices more than 30 times the average local salary. Elmbridge in Surrey is the least affordable area outside London with an affordability ratio of 14.3, said the report.

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'London always comes out top when it comes to horror stories about ludicrously over-priced housing. 'But the toxic combination of rising property prices and falling real wages has meant that local housing affordability remains a huge problem for millions of people across the country. 'Houses and flats in traditionally affordable areas of the country - from Kirklees to Great Yarmouth and Plymouth to Oldham - are now out of reach for many local people. 'We need an ambitious programme of home-building to get house prices back under control. Barrow-in-Furness, also in Cumbria has the second most affordable homes - three times the average salary . Oldham, Greater Manchester is one of the many places where houses are no longer affordable, the TUC say . 'At the same time, the growing number of people who have no hope or desire to buy a property any time soon but are still being clobbered by soaring rents need a better deal too. 'But housing affordability isn't just about house prices, decent wages are just as important and there is a lot of ground to make up before we return to the kind of salaries that people were earning before the crash.'

'As our new research shows, eight in 10 parents are worried about how rising house prices will affect the next generation and don't believe that the mainstream political parties are effectively dealing with the issue of housing.

"By . Martin Robinson for MailOnline . A mother who took her critically ill son abroad for cancer treatment against the wishes of NHS doctors says the decision saved his life and could do the same for Ashya King. Ros Barnes raised £130,000 to take her child Alex to America  to have the proton therapy treatment when he was four. She said British doctors told her that medics offering the treatment were 'only after your money' but they still took Alex abroad because they feared radiotherapy could make their son deaf and blind. Scroll down for video . Treatment: Ros Barnes raised £130,000 to take her critically ill child Alex to America to have the proton therapy treatment when he was four - and he has recovered from his brain tumour . Row: Mrs Barnes said NHS doctors had said that medics offering this therapy abroad were after her money . 'When we were told that he had to have radiotherapy and that his tumour had come back, we were told that because he was only four, it would cause significant brain damage, he might be in a wheelchair or deaf or blind - if he made it at all,' she told ITV's Good Morning Britain. 'So when I asked the NHS about proton therapy, the oncologist said it's not tried and tested and if you go over there [to the United States], they're only after your money. 'And I said well, they can have my money. If it works, I don't care. We'll get him there and we'll do what we've got to do. 'Most of the doctors I spoke to advised against it. Obviously it saved his life. He's here and he's perfect.' Before and after: Alex's family sought alterbative treatment because they feared radiotherapy could make him deaf and clind . Ongoing case: Ashya King has a brain tumour and his parents, who have been arrested, took him abroad to seek alternative care for him . The difference between proton beam therapy and conventional forms of radiotherapy is that it is thought to cause less damage to the healthy tissue around the tumour. Proton therapy is a type of radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy. Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body. It means therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely. The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues. The treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours, including those found in the head and neck, eye, central nervous system, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal tract. The precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs, such as the eye, brain and spinal cord. Source: Mayo Clinic . For that reason it is particularly suited to children, who are more susceptible to harm from radiation because they are still growing. Conventional radiotherapy uses X-rays to kill cancer cells. But X-rays pass through the tumour and out the other side, damaging tissue. Protons, which are positively charged particles in the centre of any atom, stop when they reach the tumour. The treatment is popular in Europe because it has a lower risk of side effects, though some have expressed concerns because little is known about the long-term impact of the procedure. The only proton beam facility in the UK is at the Clatterbridge Centre for Cancer in the Wirral, which delivers ‘low energy’ therapy for rare cancers around the eye. The treatment, which costs £100,000 a patient, is not widely available on the NHS, but is commonly used throughout Europe. A moving video made minutes before he was arrested Mr King, 51, said they had gone overseas to try and get specialist cancer treatment which he said medics in the UK refused to sanction. Mr King said: ‘We pleaded with (the doctors) for proton beam treatment. They looked at me straight in the face and said with his cancer - which is called medulloblastoma - it would have no benefit whatsoever.’ His son, who is suffering from a stage four brain tumour, is being cared for at the Materno-Infantil hospital in Malaga. The family is banned from seeing him and he is under police guard.","Ros Barnes raised £130,000 to take her critically ill child Alex to America .

"By . Jason Groves for the Daily Mail . Boris Johnson’s dream of building a £100billion airport in the Thames estuary appeared to be dead in the water last night after Government advisers warned it was unrealistic. The extravagant scheme should be dropped from a review of Britain’s future airport capacity, former CBI chief Sir Howard Davies is expected to tell ministers today. The scheme, dubbed Boris Island, would have seen a new four-runway hub airport built in the Thames estuary with high-speed rail links to London. Artist's impression: The extravagant £100billion airport in the Thames estuary scheme should be dropped from a review of Britain's future airport capacity, former CBI chief Sir Howard Davies is expected to tell ministers . The London mayor argued that, with expansion at Heathrow constrained, the idea was the only way to keep the UK competitive in terms of airport capacity. But the independent Airports Commission, which was set up to tackle the need for increased airport capacity and is led by  Sir Howard, will today urge  ministers to focus instead on expansion at either Heathrow  or Gatwick. One source said the Boris Island idea would be attacked with ‘every conceivable sledgehammer’. Mr Johnson fought hard last year to get his plan included on the Commission’s short-list in the face of scepticism from experts, who warned it was too costly and would face major environmental hurdles. It leaves the Commission now looking at three detailed options – two for expanding Heathrow, and one for increasing capacity at Gatwick. Heathrow’s owners have proposed building a third runway, while the second option would be to increase the length of one of the existing runways to allow it to handle more flights. Setback:  The London mayor argued that, with expansion at Heathrow constrained, the idea was the only way to keep the UK competitive in terms of airport capacity . Both options are estimated to cost about £18 billion. The option to build a second runway at Gatwick would cost an estimated £9billion, but enjoys less support from the business community. Mr Johnson yesterday described the idea of expanding Heathrow as ‘madness’. Repeating his preference for a new site, he dismissed Heathrow plans as ‘self-defeating’ and ‘barbarically contemptuous of the rights of the population’. He added: ‘What frustrates me is that a third runway at Heathrow is so desperately short-sighted. ‘You could not conceivably get it built before 2029, by the airport’s own admission – and as soon as it opened it would be full.’ Mr Johnson said the Heathrow expansion would lead to medical problems associated with pollution, as well as congestion on the road network. Other critics warn the plan would require the demolition  of hundreds of homes and lead to increased noise pollution in  the area. The CBI yesterday urged the Commission to come forward quickly with a ‘spades in the ground’ solution to the lack of capacity, which it said was damaging Britain’s competitiveness. Deputy director-general Katja Hall said: ‘It tends to be hub airports that deliver the new connections to emerging markets that we desperately need. ‘With Heathrow full and the UK slipping behind in the race for new connectivity, it is essential that the Airports Commission delivers a solution that addresses the ticking timebomb of our lack of spare hub capacity.’ David Cameron publicly opposed the expansion of Heathrow at the last election, but Heathrow will now dominate the Commission’s work. The Commission is not set to report its decision until after the election. Expansion: Heathrow's owners have proposed building a third runway.

According to Marks & Spencer sales of its pink plonk are soaring this summer. This year's English Pinot Noir rosé, produced just a few miles from the M25, has been particularly popular with more than 500,000 bottles being sold at £11.99 in just a month in June and July. This year's English Pinot Noir rosé (left) from the Denbies wine estate on the North Downs in Surrey is outselling other popular wines at M&S, including the Spanish Raso de la Cruz (right) Garry Brooking, of M&S, said customers had shown a particular taste for dry rosé wines, including the English Pinot Noir. 'We always expect rosé sales to increase during the summer, but the fact that our English rosé has sold out so rapidly is testament to how far the country's wines have come, as well as changing consumer taste,' he said. 'Sales of rosés from Europe have dominated this year, showing that our customers are starting to prefer the lighter, drier styles produced in these countries.' The wine is produced at Denbies wine estate on the North Downs in Surrey which, at 265 acres, is the UK's largest single estate vineyard.

"By . Lucy Osborne for the Daily Mail . A family robbed while holidaying in France claim they are the latest victims of thieves who knocked them unconscious by piping gas into their tent. Hayley Kearns, 28, was heading to the Mediterranean with her parents, her brother and his girlfriend when they were attacked at an overnight rest stop on a motorway. Miss Kearns, brother Byron, 20, and his girlfriend Nic James, 31, awoke groggily in their trailer tent to find the window ripped open and valuables gone. Scroll down for video . Robbed: Tony Kearns (left), his daughter Hayley, Nic James and boyfriend Byron Kearns inside the trailer tent targeted by thieves in France . They said raiders took £2,000 in cash, their mobile phones, iPads, a Kindle and bank cards. The robbers had also taken their keys and ransacked their car while they slept, littering the service station with their possessions. Miss Kearns said French police told her East European gangs were preying on holidaymakers. Other British families have reported similar raids this summer, and yesterday the Caravan and Camping Club urged tourists not to sleep at French service stations and to consider buying gas monitors. Miss Kearns and her family were attacked on August 2 at the Aire de la Bouble on the A71 from Bourges to Clermont-Ferrand. They were travelling in two cars towing a caravan and the trailer tent. The thieves even stole Mr Kearns’ trousers as they searched for his car keys. Vulnerable: A trailer tent similar to the one owned by the Kearns, who were gassed as they slept . Miss Kearns’ parents Gill, 55, and Tony, 53, had slept in the caravan and were not robbed. But Miss Kearns believes they were gassed too, because their dog was with them but did not wake up. The customer services agent from Yate, Gloucestershire, added: ‘Even my parent’s dog didn’t make a noise, and he usually barks at anything. It makes me think they did something to him too.’ She said she woke up in the early hours and saw a shadowy figure, but was unable to rouse her brother before she was overcome with sleep. The next morning the family were ‘completely out of it’, she said, adding: ‘It was a really busy service station with people everywhere. I tried to wake my brother up but I couldn’t and then I don’t remember anything until the morning. ‘We have to have been knocked out. There was a tiny slit in the trailer tent, just big enough to put a pipe through. The police said we were the second or third group to have been done at that service station and the group were moving slowly south from Paris.’ Just weeks earlier on the same motorway, the Chadwick family lost possessions worth £2,000 in a similar raid near Bourges, while Debbie Keeney and Bob John, of Matson, Kent, were targeted at Lancon de Provence, losing cash, jewellery, passports and credit cards.","Family were heading to the Mediterranean when they were attacked at an overnight rest stop on a motorway in France .

"By . Associated Press . Leaders of the House and Senate intelligence committees on Sunday prodded President Barack Obama to take decisive action against what they say are growing threats from Islamic State militants on U.S. soil. The lawmakers, one Republican and one Democratic, offered bipartisan pressure on the White House to turn back the hazard of Islamist fighters who have taken control of vast swaths of Syria and Iraq. Those militants now are looking toward the United States or Western Europe for its next targets, lawmakers said. Scroll down for video .

Without offering specifics on any threats or suggestions how to confront them, the lawmakers said Obama soon needs to develop a comprehensive strategy to crush the fighters. 'His foreign policy is in absolute free-fall,' said Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who heads the House Intelligence Committee. 'It’s all related,' Rogers, R-Mich., told Fox News Sunday.

The chairs of both the House and Senate intelligence committees prodded President Barack Obama on Sunday, Aug. 31, 2014, to take decisive action against the growing threats from Islamic State militants on U.S. soil . 'The world sees the United States as withdrawn.' In another TV interview, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the California Democrat who leads the Senate intelligence panel, said Obama is perhaps 'too cautious' in his approach to combating the Islamic State group. 'This is a group of people who are extraordinarily dangerous,' Feinstein said. 'And they'll kill with abandon.' 'U.S. foreign policy is in free fall,' he said. 'Traditional allies are saying maybe the United States is not the best to lead us.' The pair of lawmakers, who have access to some of the nation's most sensitive secrets and receive regular and detailed briefings from the nation's spy agencies, offered dire predictions of an attack on the United States or its European allies if the militants are not confronted. 'They have announced that they don't intend to stop,' Feinstein said. 'They have announced that they will come after us if they can, that they will, quote, `spill our blood.' The threat, Rogers said, could include Americans who have trained with Islamic State fighters. He said there are hundreds of Islamic State-trained Americans who can return to the U.S. with their American passports. 'I'm very concerned because we don't know every single person that has an American passport that has gone and trained and learned how to fight,' Rogers said. Sen. Diane Feinstein, D-Cal., left, speaking at a Capitol Hill news conference in Washington. Feinstein and the chair of the House intelligence committee attacked President Barack Obama on Sunday . Rogers said U.S. intelligence agencies were tracking the Americans who are known to have traveled to the region. If they helped Islamic State fighters, he said, they should be charged under laws that prohibit Americans from aiding terrorists. 'ISIL would like to have a Western-style attack to continue this notion that they are the leading jihadist group in the world,' Rogers said, using another name for the group. The top Democrat on his intelligence panel, Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, was more skeptical. He said more needs to be known before judging whether they plan to commit terrorist acts in the U.S. any time soon. The group's priority now seems to be to hold on to territory it has gained rather than export violence. 'It is extremely urgent, but you don't just rush in,' he said.It was a view shared by Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee: ""We can't simply bomb first and ask questions later."" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican who serves on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged fast action and said Islamic State fighters ""must be defeated, not contained,"" because they represent a direct threat to the U.S. Added Homeland Security Committee member Rep.

The threat, Rogers said, could include Americans who have trained with Islamic State fighters. He said there are hundreds of Islamic State-trained Americans who can return to the U.S. with their American passports . Feinstein said she has seen nothing that compares to the viciousness of the militants who have overrun large portions of Iraq, killed civilians and beheaded American journalist James Foley. The Islamic State group has financing, military structure and weapons unlike any other militants, she said. Obama said Thursday he did not yet have a strategy for dealing with the Islamic State organization, a remark that brought criticism from Democrats and Republicans. In an interview published early this year by The New Yorker, the president appeared to minimize the group by comparing it to a junior varsity basketball team. The White House said he was speaking about a different threat posed by a range of extremists across the world. Feinstein said she thought the basketball analogy was wrong - 'I think it's a major varsity team' - but would not say whether she thought Obama projected weakness by admitting he had no strategy. 'I think I've learned one thing about this president, and that is he's very cautious,' she said. 'Maybe in this instance, too cautious. I do know that the military, I know that the State Department, I know that others have been putting plans together. And so hopefully, those plans will coalesce into a strategy.' Feinstein spoke to NBC's 'Meet the Press.' Rogers appeared on 'Fox News Sunday.' Ruppersberger was on CNN's 'State of the Union.'

"By . Gareth Rose . and Tamara Cohen For Daily Mail . A report by the Centre for Business and Economic Research says an independent Scotland's start up costs would be ten times more than Alex Salmond has predicted . An independent Scotland would require ‘start up costs’ of £2.5billion – ten times more than Alex Salmond has claimed – according to an expert report. The respected Centre for Business and Economic Research has warned the costs of creating the tax and welfare systems, defence force and a network of embassies would be vast. And if Mr Salmond has to set up a new currency, as UK ministers have refused to let a separate Scotland use the pound, the cost could increase by another £2billion. Mr Salmond has refused to publish his own figures but has suggested that a £250million price tag – less than the cost of the Scottish Parliament – was ‘reasonable’. Critics warned that the report paints a dire picture of the impact of separation on Scotland’s finances and public spending. The report also warns that an independent Scotland would have to borrow £12billion a year, raise taxes or slash public spending to plug the gap in Mr Salmond’s economic plans. Anne McGuire, a Scottish Labour MP, said: ‘This latest expert analysis confirms what we already know – independence isn’t a price worth paying. ‘The SNP are asking us to take on all these extra costs to try to replicate what we already have today. Where is the sense in every Scottish family paying through the nose for something we already have today as part of the UK?’ Any money spent on start-up costs is money that could be spent on schools or hospitals.’ The CEBR report increases pressure on the Scottish Government to publish research on start-up costs before Scots go to the polls on 18 September. The figures, which represents about £1,000 for every Scottish household, includes £1 billion for new tax and welfare systems, £400 million for a defence force and £450 million for foreign office real estate and offices, including about 100 embassies and consular offices. A Scottish intelligence agency could add £200 million, based on Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s estimate, while membership of the European Union, United Nations and Nato could cost millions more, CEBR said. John Swinney, the Finance Secretary, asked officials to come up with a figure more than two years ago, but it was not included in last year’s White Paper on independence. Ministers have since said they cannot even provide an estimate prior to negotiations with the UK Government – which will only happen in the event of a Yes vote. The Treasury has predicted the true cost of a separate Scotland would be between £1.5billion and £2.7billion. Despite this, Mr Salmond still described an estimate by Professor Patrick Dunleavy, of the London School of Economics, of £250million as ‘reasonable’. Mr Salmond (pictured during the TV debate with Alistair Darling last week) has refused to publish his own figures but has suggested a £250million price tag – less than the cost of the Scottish Parliament . Sam Alderson, economist at the CEBR, who wrote the report, said: ‘Setting up the kind of modern state that Scotland is used to is not going to be cheap even with the capacity it already has, and even with a reasonable amount of negotiations between the two states in terms of asset division. ‘In the long run there is more viability within it, but this is a speed bump to get over and Scotland will need a sensible approach from the Scottish and UK governments to successfully get this through because there is considerable risk.’ Mr Alderson said sharing the pound with the rest of the UK would be ‘fairly painless’ in the short term – but a new currency would have to be launched sooner or later. The circulation of new notes and coins, and the creation of a central bank, would cost a further £2billion, they estimated. An SNP spokesperson said: ‘The definitive expert report on set-up costs was published in June by Professor Patrick Dunleavy of the LSE. That report was a total vindication of the Scottish Government’s position, and put costs at around £200 million, a figure which he made clear could be offset by savings and efficiencies – and also a figure which the Scottish Secretary said he did not disagree with.’","Centre for Business and Economic Research warned costs will be vast .

When faced with the ultimatum of choosing between playing at his AFL preliminary final or his gridiron championships, the 31-year-old Melbourne man simply hopped into a helicopter and made it to both. 'It was quite rock star-ish,' Mr Decker told Daily Mail Australia. 'I like to do things kind of funky and having the club pay for it, I just went along with it.' The North Ringwood player said that unable to give up either sport, he took on both games throughout the season, warning his AFL coach that if forced to pick out of the two he would opt for attending his gridiron finals. Heath Decker, from Melbourne, plays AFL for North Ringwood and American gridiron alongside the Monash Warriors . It then emerged that his AFL semi final was scheduled for a 6pm kick off in Boronia, leaving him just over an hour for the two and a half hour drive to Bendigoto play alongside the Monash Warriors. 'The idea for a chopper came a few weeks out of the games, we were thinking about how to organise it and we thought ""that would be pretty rock-star"", but we sort of just giggled about it and it was swept under the rug,' Mr Decker said. 'But then it got a bit more serious closer to the date when the coach of the footy club said ""I'd really like you to stay and play"" because one of the top guys on the opposition was someone I'd played against a couple of times and I did a good job of it. 'Both our captain and the coach thought it was an important enough game for me to be there for and we knew the guy whose chopper it was so it was a little cheaper.' The 31-year-old's AFL coach organised for a helicopter to take him from his AFL half finals to his gridiron championships when he admitted he would attend his gridiron game if he was forced to choose .

'So I texted him so he could look up as we went by and then the pilot put us down about a kilometre down the road where my sister was waiting to pick us up.' Despite arriving five minutes before the game began, Mr Decker scored a touchdown in the first two minutes of his gridiron game .

She has since adamantly stood by her comments while trying to clarify that she was not saying people's 'grandmothers' are prostitutes . 'I wasn't calling them prostitutes; I was merely saying that old fashioned marriage from that period is uncomfortably close to an economic transaction,' she said . 'When you have a society where women's main currency is really their sexual favours, their ability to reproduce, then a lot of what women do is a form of prostitution.' 'For example, I would argue that traditional marriage, which included conjugal rights, particularly when women were not able to go to work or fired when they first got married, were basically selling their bodies and their reproductive rights to their husband. 'He bought them, by giving her room and board in return, was a form of prostitution. 'So I think we really have to discuss what we mean by prostitution. 'At least the women who choose it as a career choice, freely and uncoerced, that's very very important, only have to put up with him for about an hour.' 'Once upon a time it was a lifetime ladies, a lifetime.' Fellow panelist Swedish author Kajsa Ekman rejected Ms Caro's remarks as an 'an abstract comparison' as some sex workers have up to 15 buyers a day. Ms Caro, who copped flak on social media for the remarks, told Daily Mail Australia she was referring to a time when women were fired from their jobs when they got married and unwanted sexual congress was not considered rape if they were married. She said she was not talking about current housewives. Ms Caro engaged in a back-and-forth over the matter with fellow panelist Swedish author Kajsa Ekman . One of several tweets aimed at Jane Caro last night. Another tweet aimed at Ms Caro. 'SAHM' is an acronym for 'Stay At Home Mum'. 'She was obliged to say yes (to sex). In return, she got room and board... It was a historical analogy.' 'I'm a bit annoyed I'm getting tweets saying you think stay at home housewives are common whores. No. I never said such a thing.' 'I'm not saying women chose to be this way. Everyone's misconstruing it saying ""you're calling grandmother a prostitute.""' 'Women were placed in a situation where they really didn't have a choice.' As part of a panel which included Mexican journalist Lydia Cacho, editor Kay Hymowitz and authors Kajsa Ekis Ekman and Alissa Nutting, Ms Caro also implored young women to always say what they think. 'My advice is to be yourself. Do not allow anyone to mould your shape that doesn't feel anyone like you.' 'Be yourself, and always say what you think.' Ms Caro said she would give precisely the same advice to young men.","Jane Caro under fire over 'dangerous' remarks on Q&A last night that housewives in traditional marriages were like prostitutes .

"By . Jennifer Newton . and Sam Webb for MailOnline . Paul Ross feared for his life after collapsing in a car park after taking a massive hit of the drug mephedrone. The married BBC presenter yesterday confessed to a gay affair with a man he met at a dogging spot and became hooked on the drug - also known as meow meow - which he snorted off the man's face. The 57-year-old, who is the older brother of chat show host Jonathan Ross and a father-of-five, has admitted to cheating on his wife of 10 years with former English teacher Barry Olivier. The collapse came after his wife Jackie traced his phone to Mr Olivier's flat in Maidenhead, Berkshire. Scroll down for video . Paul Ross, pictured in happier times with his wife of 10 years Jackie, who is sticking by him despite his affair and drug use. He says he thought he was going to die after taking mephedrone, or 'meow meow' Ross, who had done six lines of the drug, ignored his wife's repeated bell ringing. He then took a 'huge bolt' of mephedrone and drove to a hotel in High Wycombe. The  BBC Radio London presenter told The Sun: 'I genuinely thought I was going to die. 'I parked in the car park near a hotel and just collapsed on the tarmac. It was daylight but no one was around to help.' The former film critic said the episode gave him a new-found clarity and he vowed to ditch the drug and make his marriage work. Ross met Mr Olivier at a known dogging spot in a secluded area near the Thicket roundabout in Maidenhead, pictured . Despite the affair, Jackie, who married the presenter in 2004,  is sticking by him, saying she is not ending a 14 year relationship over a 'six months of madness'. Mephedrone, or meow meow, is a powerful stimulant and is part of a group of drugs that are closely related to the amphetamines, like speed and ecstasy. There isn't much evidence about mephedrone and it's long term effects as it's quite a new drug but because it is similar to speed and ecstasy the . long-term effects may well be similar. There have reports of people hospitalised due to the short-term effects. It can cause euphoria, alertness and feelings of affection towards the people around you, but also anxiety and paranoia. Mephedrone, or meow meow, can also overstimulate the heart and circulation; and can overstimulate the nervous system, with risk of fits. Mephedrone is a Class B drug and possession can result in up to five years in jail and/or an unlimited fine. Ross said he was looking for an escape after facing financial ruin, which led him to look for casual sex on the Internet. After visiting a dogging site near to the Thicket roundabout in Maidenhead, he then met Mr Olivier, a father-of-four and began an affair, with them regularly meeting up at his flat in the Berkshire town  to take the drug. Mr Olivier claims that the presenter, with whom he used the pet names Puck and Pea, would often drive to his flat to snort mephedrone and have sex before starting his radio show. However, Ross has strongly denied taking drugs before presenting the show. The star then confessed to his wife about his drug use but it was only ten days ago that Mr Olivier got in touch to reveal the full extent of the affair. He has two divorces behind him and five children by his two former wives. In 2011, he spoke about selling his 600-year-old timber-framed property in the village of Bisham, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, for £579,950 . He said at the time: 'We're under no pressure to sell – the next house will probably be our last move so it's got to be right. 'We no longer need so many bedrooms as the girls don't tend to stay all at once any more,' said the presenter, who grew up in Leytonstone, east London, with his five younger siblings, who all work in the media. The BBC  announced that Ross will not be presenting his show this morning to 'deal with his issues' and is expected to be off air most of the month. A spokesman for the BBC said: 'Paul has spoken about his personal problems at length. He will be taking some time off to deal with those issues and won't be on air on Monday.'

"By . Wills Robinson for MailOnline . BBC series Top Gear is to be launched in France - a country which banned two of the UK presenters of the show from its roads last year. A version of the programme is to be made locally by BBC Worldwide France for the broadcaster RMC Decouverte and will begin filming in the next few months for screening next year. Presenters Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond were pulled over for speeding while filming the programme's Perfect Road Trip DVD, prompting a temporary ban and fines. A French version of Top Gear will be made by BBC Worldwide France and will begin filming in the next few months - despite Richard Hammond (left) and Jeremy Clarkson (middle) being fined for speeding last year . The French broadcaster already shows the original UK versions of the programme, delivering some of its highest ratings. The Top Gear format has been sold to countries such as Australia, South Korea and the US, and a Chinese version will launch later this year. Adam Waddell, the director of entertainment brands for BBC Worldwide, said: 'The French have some amazing roads and incredible scenery which is why Top Gear UK has often filmed there. 'Now French petrol heads are going to have their own version of the programme and I have no doubt that the hosts will bring their own personality and sense of humour to the new show. I can't wait to watch it develop.' BBC Worldwide France has produced other formats in the country including The Great Bake Off, The Weakest Link, Antiques Roadshow and Dancing With The Stars, the international version of Strictly Come Dancing. Clarkson on the Lotus Elise: 'This car is more fun than the entire French air force crashing into a firework factory.' On the Renault Clio V6: 'I think the problem is that it's French. It's a surrendermonkey.' On the Peguet 407: 'The 407 is like one of those French films you sometimes find on FilmFour in the middle of the night. It promises much and it delivers plenty of pubic hair. But somehow that isn’t really enough.' Responding to derogatory comments presenters made about 'lazy' and 'feckless' Mexican car, a BBC spokesman said:  'Our own comedians make jokes about the British being terrible cooks and terrible romantics, and we in turn make jokes about the Italians being disorganised and over dramatic, the French being arrogant and the Germans being over-organised,' The French broadcaster RMC Decouverte already shows the original UK version of the programme . Le Stig? There may be another white-suited driver when the show is produced across The Channel . Top Gear is broadcast in 170 different countries and attracts 350 million viewers per week - making it one of the BBC's most popular programmes and one of its biggest commercial successes. It started as a conventional motoring magazine show in 1977 but has developed and, especially since its 2002 relaunch, has built a reputation as one of the most comical but controversial shows on television. As its popularity increased, so did its international appeal, and the show's global spin-offs have been a huge revenue driver for the corporation. Versions of the programme have been made in Australia, Russia, the United States and South Korea. The UK version of the show is also shown in hundreds of countries in a variety of different languages. Its success forms a large part of the £156millon that BBC Worldwide made in the 12 months to March this year and the £1billion the commercial arm has generated since it was set up in 2007. The magazine is published in 31 countries and even Top Gear Stunt School- a £1.99 iPhone and iPad app - has been downloaded at least 2.4m times. DVDs produced by the motoring team have also been a big money spinner, with The Perfect Road Trip being named the UK's best-selling DVD in 2013. In 2012, BBC Worldwide paid £8.4 million for Clarkson’s stake in a joint venture which had owned the commercial rights to Top Gear. The presenter made more than £14million from the programme as the BBC moved to take full control of the hit series' production company.","Version of programme will be made locally by BBC Worldwide France .

"By . Tamara Cohen For Daily Mail . The policy is set to be announced by Energy Secretary Ed Davey this week and will be included in the Liberal Democrat's general election manifesto . Homeowners could get £100 off their council tax bill if they make their property more energy efficient, under plans from the Liberal Democrats. People will be rewarded for home improvements such as insulating their loft or installing double-glazing or a more efficient boiler. The commitment is set to be in the party’s manifesto for next year’s election and will be announced this week by Energy Secretary Ed Davey. To qualify for the £100 rebate, a homeowner would have to increase the home’s energy efficiency rating by two bands. All homes come with an Energy Performance Certificate which rates them on a scale from A to G – with band A the most efficient. Most homes in Britain are assessed in bands D or E. Mr Davey said the plan would offer both lower energy bills and council tax bills. He said the council tax rebate will ‘make action to end your home’s energy waste a no-brainer’. The policy would cost taxpayers £300million a year, but Mr Davey said it would help meet Britain’s legally-binding targets to slash carbon emissions by 80 per cent by 2050. Energy bills will be a key battleground in the election, with Labour’s Ed Miliband offering a 20-month freeze in energy bills if he wins, and the Conservatives hoping to cut back the green taxes added to household power bills. Measures which would move a property up by two efficiency levels cost thousands of pounds, but the Lib Dems say they offer a good rate of return on energy bills. Replacing an inefficient boiler and insulating cavity walls costs about £4,000, with an average energy bill saving of £200 to £300 a year. Solid wall insulation costs between £5,000 and £10,000, but can save households up to £400 a year on heating bills. Insulating a loft and installing solar panels costs £6,000 and saves about £200 a year. Under the Lib Dem plans, the £100 will still be able to be claimed even if householders get some of the work done through government loan schemes such as the Green Deal. Mr Davey has been in charge of this flagship scheme, which was intended to insulate 14million homes in Britain. But the scheme, which offers loans to carry out the work, has been criticised for low take-up and offering poor value for money because of high interest rates. While 300,000 people signed up for an initial assessment for efficiency measures by the end of July, only 1,815 installations had been completed. Mr Davey said: ‘The cheapest way to make rapid progress in cutting our emissions is by saving the energy we now waste. ‘Liberal Democrats have already helped many people to save energy and keep their bills down, and we are on track to meet our target of improving the energy efficiency of one million homes, but this major new tax incentive would mean we could go much further in the next parliament.’ A spokesman for Mr Davey added: ‘Britain’s housing stock is very poorly insulated. A lot of Victorian terraced houses, for example, look great and people love the original features, but the insulation is poor and they are left with high energy bills. ‘We are not offering short-term gimmicks. The only way to reduce your energy bill – permanently – is to install insulation. So we hope this deal would encourage people to dig out their Energy Performance Certificate and see if they can reduce the rating.’","Commitment set to be in Liberal Democrat's party manifesto next year .

"By . Sam Webb for MailOnline . Nicholas Smith, an acclaimed conductor, has been jailed for eight months for indecent assault . An internationally-acclaimed conductor who indecently assaulted a teenage girl has been jailed for eight months. Nicholas Smith's victim went to police 36 years after the assault following the high-profile death of sex attack victim Frances Andrade, a fellow pupil at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester. Smith, 66, was investigated in the aftermath of Mrs Andrade's death during last year's sex abuse trial of Michael Brewer, the former music director at Chetham's. Brewer was jailed for six years for indecently assaulting ex-pupil Mrs Andrade, 48, when she was 14 and 15 in the 1970s. Brewer's ex-wife Kay, 68, was also convicted of one count of indecent assault. Mrs Andrade killed herself at her home in Guildford, Surrey, a week after giving evidence against him. Smith's victim told police the death of Mrs Andrade, whom she knew while at the school, was like the 'curtain of a stage lifted'. The single indecent assault by Smith when his victim was aged 15 and he was 30, took 'minutes' but ruined her life, Minshull Street Crown Court heard. Smith, a visiting conductor at Chetham's in the 1970s, at first denied the sex attack but later admitted one count of indecent assault against his vulnerable victim, now in her 50s, on a date between 1976 and 1978, at his country cottage in Derbyshire. Smith went on to become an internationally-renowned conductor working across the world but his reputation now lies in ruins, the court heard. Jailing him for eight months, Judge Peter Lakin told Smith, formerly of Macclesfield, Cheshire, but now living in Malestroit in Brittany, France: 'You breached the trust placed in you in a most serious way. She was highly vulnerable and you knew it. 'When you were alone with her, you cynically took advantage of her vulnerability and subjected her to a deeply unpleasant and frightening ordeal. 'You pushed her to the ground, dragged her clothes up and then fondled and kissed her exposed breasts. 'This was a forceful sexual assault by someone in authority.' Loss: Frances Andrade killed herself at her home in Guildford, Surrey, a week after giving evidence against Michael Brewer, the former music director at Chetham's . Earlier, Vanessa Thomson, prosecuting, told the court that Smith's victim was a gifted cellist whose parents thought 'long and hard' about where to send her for schooling and to further her musical talents. But, coming from the countryside, she felt very homesick and became deeply unhappy at Chetham's which had an 'appalling culture' and 'uncaring atmosphere' that 'pervaded' the school at the time. She began to 'rebel', smoke cannabis and drink alcohol, the court heard. Smith came into contact with the girl as he was the visiting conductor, though she described him as 'creepy, slimy, smirky and yucky'. She missed the countryside and Smith, who owned a cottage near Buxton, Derbsyshire, 'latched on to this'. He and his wife arranged to take the girl to the cottage for a weekend away - where he pounced on her while his wife was upstairs having a bath. Miss Thomson said: 'The defendant simply pushed the complainant to the ground, dragged her clothes up, outer and underwear, exposing her breasts and started to fondle her breasts and kiss them, skin to skin, him kissing at her nipples.' After a struggle the girl got away, but felt there was no-one at Chetham's she could trust to tell of the assault, which had a profound effect on the course of her life. Smith came into contact with the girl as he was the visiting conductor, though the victim described him as 'creepy, slimy, smirky and yucky' In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: 'It was the death of Frances Andrade, who I knew, that catapulted me into phoning Greater Manchester Police in January of 2013. 'I knew what Nicholas Smith did to me was wrong, but I didn't know how wrong. 'I felt a deep sense of shame about it and part of me somehow cut off.' The woman said she turned to alcohol and substance abuse and her musical talent was seriously affected during crucial years in her youth. She went on: 'I have lived with what might have been for a very long time and, through the uncovering of what happened at Chetham's, know that things may have been very different both in my career and personally.' Chetham's School of Music in Manchester. Smith's victim said the school had an 'appalling culture' and 'uncaring atmosphere' at the time of the offence . The victim's career floundered as she went into rehabilitation for drug and alcohol abuse, she has been on anti-depressants and and is now in therapy, but would have 'coped with life very differently' but for the assault she suffered as a teenager. The statement added: 'I hope that Nicholas Smith feels disgusted by his own abuse of power and that the amount of damage caused by behaviour such as his will lessen.' Smith went on to become a music director in South Carolina in the United States between 1993 and 2007, and led the Kuopio Symphony Orchestra in Finland from 1982 to 1990. According to his website, he performed as a conductor in Spain, Poland, Germany, France, Northern Ireland and England, including for the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra. He became principal conductor of the Northern Chamber Orchestra at the age of 22 and has conducted many productions at the Buxton Opera Festival. Brewer's ex-wife Kay, 68, was also convicted of one count of indecent assault and jailed for 21 months . During the 1990s he was artistic and executive director of Performing Arts Management and produced more than 300 major outdoor concerts in Britain. Between 1972 and 1974 he was a lecturer in music history at the Royal Northern College of Music. Neil Usher, mitigating, said Smith would have had 'thousands' of opportunities to repeat his behaviour over the years with youngsters - but this assault was a one-off, committed 36 years ago. Mr Usher added: 'His reputation, internationally and domestically, was extremely high. His reputation lies in ruins. 'He's gone from being a celebrated and much sought-after conductor here and abroad, to someone who is unemployable. 'Personally he's extremely damaged.' Detective Chief Inspector Jamie Daniels, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Following the publicity surrounding the conviction of Michael Brewer, this woman found the courage to report what had happened to her, and today she has seen justice finally served after close to three decades. 'I can also understand why people have drawn comparisons between Michael Brewer and Nicholas Smith. 'Both men were highly regarded musical scholars who had a responsibility and duty of care to young children. 'Smith, like Brewer, took advantage of a homesick young girl in a location away from school grounds while she was isolated and vulnerable. 'It is some small comfort that he has chosen to accept his guilt and at least spared the victim the need to give evidence at court, but this should not detract from the fact that he completely disregarded his duty to make sure no harm came to her at a time when, as a teacher, he should have been encouraging her obvious musical talent. 'Instead, he took the opportunity to abuse her for his own sexual gratification and I hope his sentence serves as another reminder that such offences are intolerable no matter when or where they are committed. 'A number of other investigations into allegations of historic abuse are ongoing and it would not be appropriate to comment on them at this juncture, suffice it to say any and all allegations of historic sexual abuse will be thoroughly investigated by specially trained and highly dedicated detectives.'","Nicholas Smith jailed 36 years after he assaulted teenage pupil .

"By . Katy Winter for MailOnline . A woman has run up £40,000 worth of debt and had to move back in with her mother-in-law - all because of a shopping addiction. Emma Sims, 41, started shopping as a teenager with her mother and became used to getting what she wanted. Her habit spiralled out of control when she was suffering with severe depression in 2011 and she was spending up to £2,000 shopping for clothes, bags and shoes online. Scroll down for video . Emma's love of fashion saw her buying countless clothes which she would wear only once . Emma was spending over £2,000 a month at the height of her addiction, using credit cards to rack up £40,000 worth of debt . Eventually Emma and her husband Andrew, 38, had to sell their house and move in with Andrew's parents. But the equity they got back on the house did not even begin to cover the £40,000 debts Emma had racked up. Now they are starting to clear the debt and Emma is working hard to keep her shopping addiction under control. The office worker said: 'People don't take shopping addictions seriously - they just think it's as easy as stopping spending. 'I would try and ask myself if I really needed what I was buying, but I always managed to justify it. 'It's so hard to quit because you can't just go cold turkey. I will always need to buy things. 'I have a passion for fashion so a lot of my money went on clothes and shoes. I would wear them once and then the novelty would have worn off.' Emma was the youngest child of three by a long way and her mother would take her shopping to help her daughter deal with bullying at school. She said: 'My mum spoiled me. I got everything I wanted. Emma says her shopping problem began in childhood, when her mother would use buying things as a way of comforting her over the bullying she experienced at school . Emma says she was unable to stop herself spending, and that people realise that it is a real addiction . 'I can't blame her for the debt I got myself in, but she didn't help. She had bad money habits herself and I followed her example.' When Emma was 24 her mother died of breast cancer. A year later her father remarried but it put a strain on relations within the home and Emma moved in with Andrew. With a mortgage to pay, Emma's shopping habits did not change, and when the couple married in 2005 they paid for both the wedding and honeymoon mostly with credit cards. Emma was forced to sell her home to re-pay some of the money, but is still deeply in debt . Emma said: 'The country was in a boom. Credit was easy to get and we were always getting letters through about new cards with zero per cent interest. 'We would get a lot of credit card statements but wouldn't think much about it. I have no idea it got up to over the years because we were would put it onto the mortgage. 'It built up more and more and Andrew was getting increasingly stressed about it. I continued to pretend it wasn't happening and he wanted me to realise I had a problem on my own.' In 2011 the couple had a trial separation. Emma had recently been diagnosed with depression and during this time her condition got worse. She was shopping in an attempt to make herself feel better and was racking up bills of £2,000 almost every month. Emma said: 'I would order online so it didn't really feel like I was even shopping. 'I would buy things in every colour and then return a lot of them. I was telling Andrew that it's not as bad as it seemed on the credit card statements because it hadn't included the things I had returned. 'My husband told me that if we worked on my problems we could give the marriage another go. 'We decided to sell the house and move in with his parents.' Although it was only intended to be a short-term solution, the couple have now been living in the house for two years. Emma said: 'The house didn't sell for as much as we thought it would and one thing after another always comes up. 'The credit cards want huge interest so by the time we've paid that each month we're barely making a dent in the debt. 'I am working on my problem though and have seen a therapist. We are making progress, it's just very slow.'","Emma says her addiction began in childhood .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband today claims he is like Margaret Thatcher in an extraordinary attempt to prove he is up to the job of leading his party. The Labour leader compares the Iron Lady’s grip on the challenges faced by Britain in the 1970s to his own ideas about how the country should be run. But Tory former Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said Mr Miliband has as much claim to the mantle of Baroness Thatcher as 'Silvio Berlusconi had to that of Julius Caesar'. Labour leader Ed Miliband likened himself to Margaret Thatcher who he said was a conviction politician who understood the challenges Britain faced . Mr Miliband used a speech at the CBI annual conference today at the Grosvenor House in London to praise eurosceptics . A succession of political leaders, including Tony Blair and David Cameron, have sought to portray themselves as the heir to Baroness Thatcher’s brand of conviction politics. But as the son of a Marxist who advocates greater state intervention, Mr Miliband is probably the most unlikely. In a documentary to be broadcast tonight – called ‘What Does Ed Miliband Really Think?’ – the Labour leader tries to draw parallels with his own struggle to appear relevant to 21st century Britain with Baroness Thatcher’s early stages as Tory leader. Boris Johnson today urged David Cameron to 'put on that pineapple-coloured wig' and emulate Baroness Thatcher in his talks with the EU . ‘She was a conviction politician and I think conviction really matters,’ Mr Miliband tells Radio 4. ‘I think that in the 1970s, it was a similar moment, and that is the biggest parallel. 'It was a similar moment in the sense that a sense of the old order was crumbling and it wasn’t 100 per cent clear what was going to replace it. ‘And the challenge of the future, of the next few years and indeed of the election, is who can rise to the scale of challenge that the country faces and who can create a project for how this country’s going to be run that is genuinely going to make our economy work, not just for a few people but much more widely.’ But Sir Malcolm was withering in his response: 'I understand Ed Miliband is trying to present himself as a conviction politician and latter-day reincarnation of Margaret Thatcher. 'I do not know whether to laugh or cry.  Having served in Margaret Thatcher’s Cabinet for four years, I recall a Prime Minister who despised politicians who try to be all things to all people. 'Mr Miliband appears to fall into that mould.  He has as much claim to the mantle of Margaret Thatcher as Silvio Berlusconi had to that of Julius Caesar.' Mr Miliband was trying to expand on his vision for the country, but struggled to explain ideas like pre-distribution and predatory capitalism. He said he did not yet have a full set of policies, but wanted a clear plan before the general election after seeing Gordn Brown flounder once he became PM. 'I learned some lessons,' he said of his time working with the former Labour Chancellor. 'I think that, when he became Prime Minister, he didn’t have a clear enough sense about how he wanted to take the country forward. 'And so I learned that lesson, and I’m not somebody who is going to go into the coming election not being clear about where I want to take the country afterwards.' However, Mr Miliband may struggle to corner the market in Thatcherite conviction politics. Today Boris Johnson urged David Cameron to assume the defiant positioning – and dress sense – of the former Tory PM in his dealings with Europe. Mr Cameron is facing growing calls from his own own party to take a tough stance during talks this week on a seven-year budget deal for thew European Union. Writing in his column in the Daily Telegraph today, Mr Johnson said: ‘It is time for David Cameron to put on that pineapple-coloured wig and powder blue suit, whirl his handbag round his head and bring it crashing to the table with the words no, non, nein, neen, nee, ne, ei and ochi, until they get the message.’","Labour leader hails Baroness Thatcher as a 'conviction politician' who understood the big challenges facing Britain .
