Industry chiefs insist the bill for converting parking meters, vending machines and phone boxes to take the new £1 coin could be as much as £100million. More than 100,000 parking machines will need to be changed at a hefty cost to local council tax payers, diverting cash from other work, such as filling pot holes. Alternatively, councils may try to recoup the cost by raising parking charges and fees for resident permits. Prototype: The new £1 coin will be introduced from 2017, George Osborne announced today . The cost of re-calibrating each parking machine is estimated at £500 a time, which means converting every one across the UK in time for the switch in 2017 would add up to £50million. On top of that, private companies operating more than 400,000 vending machines offering everything from train tickets to hot drinks and snacks will also have to be altered. Payphones, betting shop fruit machines, launderette washing machines and supermarket trolleys will also have to be upgraded to take the new 12-sided coin. Today, officials from the Royal Mint suggested the cost of converting machines to cope with the new coins would be around £20million. However, this is disputed by the industry experts such as the British Parking Association. The British Parking Association, whose members run car parks and on-street parking machines for councils and private firms said the bill will be far higher. Spokesman, Jo Audley, said: ‘We have estimated that about 100,000 parking machines will need to changed. Costly: More than 100,000 parking machines across the UK will have to be re-calibrated, at a cost of £500 a time . ‘That is lower than a few years ago when there were 750,000 parking meters which have been replaced, in most areas, by pay and display machines. ‘The last time machines were changed was two years ago to cope with new 5p and 10p coins. At the time we estimated the cost was £350 each. Now, two years on, we are looking at £500 per machine, which adds up to around £50million.’ However, he said that one benefit of the change will be to stop around 40million counterfeit coins going in to parking machines each year, which would offset the cost. The association said some councils and car park owners might decide to switch to cashless machines, which would be expensive to install. Asked who would foot the bill, he said: ‘We know local authorities are suffering cutbacks. If they have to spend extra money upgrading parking machines, those costs are going to be passed on to motorists in higher charges. ‘What we don’t want to see is a motorist finding their new £1 coin is rejected by a parking machine and they are then hit by a penalty notice when they go off to get change.’ Small firms, such as laundrettes, also have concerns about the cost. Chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, John Allan, said: ‘Small firms who deal with low priced items are more likely to be effected by fake currency but we do have concerns about the extra costs of introducing a new pound coin. ‘For example, small firms may have to pay out to replace machinery. But, there’ s no doubt counterfeit coins and notes can seriously damage small businesses. ‘Not only are they worthless but a business could be prosecuted if it passes them on.’ Announcement: The new pound coin was one of the measures Chancellor George Osborne revealed in his Budget 2014 speech . It is thought the new design coins will be cheaper for the Treasury and the Royal Mint to manufacture than the existing gold version, which replaced the £1 note in 1983. However, any change to the nation’s coins always brings a huge logistical exercise and cost with the result local councils are expected to ask the Treasury to cover the bill. The Budget announcement yesterday included the establishment of a new £200million fund which councils will be able to bid against in order to fill pot holes made worse by the heavy rain and floods of the winter. Councils complained bitterly when new thicker 5p and 10p coins were introduced in the spring of 2012 with the result that thousands of parking and vending machines had to be altered. At the time, they warned they would need spend scarce resources on the task rather than important jobs such as mending the roads. In the past, the trade body representing the vending machine industry has been critical of the Government for springing coin changes on them without sufficient notice. This time, they are being given a three years period to prepare. In 2010, the Automatic Vending Association (AVA) said the introduction of new 5p and 10p coins would cost its members £42million and the coin machine industry as a whole as much as £100million. It seems unlikely the bill generated by the new 12 sided coin will be any less. The AVA said it accepted there is a need for a new £1 coin in order to combat counterfeiting, however it is keen to keep down the cost. A spokesman said: ‘It is imperative that the vending industry works with all the other interested parties to ensure that the security and implementation can be undertaken at the lowest possible cost to industry. ‘The AVA supports the development of a new coin which is more secure than its predecessor and can incorporate new technologies in the future and works through the existing machine base at minimal cost.’ Upgrade: Telephone boxes across the UK will also have to be upgraded to accept the new £1 coin, which is due to be brought into circulation in 2017 . Out with the old: The present £1 coin, left, . will be replaced to allay concerns about counterfeiting. Its replacement . will be a reworking of the old-fashioned threepenny bit, which last . circulated in 1971 . The British Retail Consortium said . supermarkets might get around the need to change trolleys by allowing . customers to buy plastic tokens that fit the security chain slots. Andrew . Mills of the Royal Mint stressed the decision on the change has been . made by the Treasury and the Chancellor, George Osborne. He . said there is a problem with the existing £1 coin because it is . relatively easy to counterfeit with the result there are as many as 45 . million in circulation. Asked . about the cost of changing equipment, he put the average conversion fee . at £10-£12. ‘Over the three years before introduction it will probably . cost the economy as a whole around £15m-£20m,’ he said. ‘We have to look at the benefits and we have to make sure the change-over goes as smoothly as possibly. That is why we are engaging very closely with all stake-holders in the industry and the general public.’ Speaking to the BBC’s Today programme, he dismissed the idea that the new coin is similar to the euro and insisted it looks ‘suitably British’. The Treasury’s impact assessment of the changes made to the 5p and 10p coins two years ago suggested a total cost to councils and businesses of £80million. Industry experts believe the bill this time will be higher still. The AVA calculates that some 450,000 vending machines will need to be changed on top of 100,000 parking machines and around 60,000 payphones.","George Osborne announced the new coin in his Budget speech today .

NHS staff have been caught writing favourable reviews of their hospitals on patient feedback websites. They were awarding hospitals five-star ratings and posting messages such as ‘the doctor was very helpful’, ‘lovely staff’ and ‘very impressed with the consultant’. An investigation found half the reviews of one NHS trust – Nottinghamshire – on a popular feedback site were written by its own employees. NHS staff have been caught writing favourable reviews of their hospitals on feedback websites (stock picture) Campaigners accused staff of being dishonest and said their actions undermined patients’ ‘fundamental trust’. There are a number of TripAdvisor-style websites where patients can review hospitals and other services and give them a score out of five stars. But an investigation by the BBC’s Newsnight programme found half of 100 reviews of Nottinghamshire NHS Trust on website Patient Opinion had been written by staff. The trust, which mainly runs mental health services, claimed that staff were writing on behalf of vulnerable patients – such as the elderly or those with learning difficulties – who would otherwise have been unable to comment on care. But the investigation identified many highly suspicious reviews on other websites, which looked as though they had been written by staff pretending to be patients. They included comments such as: ‘Very impressed with the consultant’, ‘the investigations were very thorough and performed very  efficiently’, ‘The doctor was very helpful’ and ‘lovely staff’. On the Care Connect website, launched by the NHS last summer, reviews apparently by staff rated hospitals a whole star higher on average than those by patients. NHS whistleblower Gary Walker, who was forced out of his job at United Lincolnshire Hospitals, said: ‘We’ve known for a long time that the culture of the NHS is one of staff under pressure to deliver results. I think this is a symptom of that, that staff are now putting on results that aren’t necessarily true and it’s interfering with results. ‘The data they are reporting is skewing the results. That’s wrong. It’s making the data the public sees almost meaningless.’ Half the reviews of Nottinghamshire NHS Trust (King's Mill Hospital in Mansfield pictured) on one site were written by its own employees . Paul Hodgkin, chief executive of the Patient Opinion website, said: ‘Patients and families think the NHS is going to tell them the truth in all sorts of ways. But if there’s an incentive to do little things, like I’ll just put in this story that looks good, that actually attacks that fundamental trust.’ Neil Churchill, director of patient experience at NHS England, said: ‘We can’t guarantee that all the reviews are coming from patients and families but we can be sure that the vast majority are. ‘What they were doing in Nottingham was to help vulnerable people have a voice . . . The NHS in England is leading the world in patient feedback. We have to get this in proportion. At that kind of scale you cannot game [cheat] it.’ In August, the NHS launched Care Connect in a bid to make the system more transparent. It covers 20 hospitals in London, but by 2015 it will be rolled out to every trust and GP in the country.In its first few weeks, it was bombarded with negative reviews about ‘appalling’ care, dismissive nurses and blood-spattered A&E units.","An investigation found half the reviews of one NHS Trust - Nottinghamshire - on a popular feedback site were written by its own employees .

A motorist has branded council jobsworths 'pathetic' after he was given a parking ticket for briefly pulling over to check a road's parking restrictions. David Osborne, 68, stopped outside a bar he was visiting in Bristol and got out of the driver's seat to read a parking sign on the pavement. When he realised it was a clearway for another 90 minutes he jumped back into his car and parked around the corner. David Osborne was sent this parking fine picture by Bristol City Council showing him looking at a sign about parking restrictions . David Osborne outside the Van Dyck Forum pub in Fishponds, Bristol, where he was fined . But his momentary infringement was caught on film by a CCTV operator at Bristol City Council and he was sent a £70 penalty notice. Mr Osborne, from the city, said: 'I’ll be honest, when I first opened the letter I had to really think back as I couldn’t even remember the incident. I was very shocked. 'I couldn’t have been parked up for more than 90 seconds, tops. 'I literally got out of the car, looked up at the sign and saw I couldn’t park there during peak hours, so I got back in and drove away.' The letter included pictures of Mr Osborne, snapped by the council’s cameras, which clearly showed him out of his car, leaning back to check the signs. 'It’s pathetic, and a complete waste of the council’s money,' he added. Mr Osborne pulled up for a minute to check the hours of parking restrictions - only to receive a £70 fine in the post almost four weeks later . The parking restrictions sign in Bristol Osborne fell foul of . 'It has to pay to send the notice and pictures out and then for the appeal process, all for the sake of a few seconds. It’s ridiculous.' Mr Osborne had taken his partner out for a romantic Valentine’s Day drink at a pub in Fishponds, Bristol, when he thought he had found the perfect spot to park outside. But after hopping out at 5.01pm to check the parking sign he saw there was a restriction between 4.30pm and 6.30pm, so he drove off to park his Land Rover Defender nearby. He thought nothing more of it until the parking fine dropped on his doormat demanding he paid the full amount within 28 days. The letter Mr Osborne received included pictures the council's cameras had taken of him reading the sign about parking restrictions . Mr Osborne, who works as a builder and decorator, said: 'I now have to spend my time sorting this all out. Why should anyone have to go through that?' He added: 'I understand parking tickets are necessary and if I’d parked without paying then I wouldn’t have a problem.

But officers told 30-year-old Lee Price he had to commit a crime first - so he went out and did just that. Price left the picturesque market town of Church Stretton in Shropshire, known for its natural beauty, scenic walks and historic rock formations, to go on a shoplifting spree at Waitrose. Price had told officers he was bored and the quaint town was an 'alien environment' to him.

He was jailed for 12 weeks after pleading guilty to one charge of shoplifting at Telford Magistrates' Court. He is believed to have been sent to HMP Birmingham in Winson Green, situated close to the notorious James Turner Street, dubbed 'Benefits Street' in the popular Channel 4 series. Dean .

Filthy: A cooker appears caked in fat and grease at the Top Sweet Centre. Mohammed Gaffar was fined £5,750 after pleading guilty to eight counts of contravening the Environmental Protection Act . Property: Mohammed Gaffar, the 48-year-old owner of Top Sweet Centre in Werneth, Greater Manchester (pictured) pleaded guilty to eight counts of contravening the Environmental Protection Act . When food inspector Samantha Jackson arrived without notice to inspect the premises, she saw a customer trying to remove flies from a kebab before members of staff asked her to call back another time. On the kitchen floor she found a box of raw chicken covered in flies and two trays of kebabs. Ms Jackson was also confronted by mouse droppings on shelves, on the floor and under the fridge, which she believed constituted an 'immediate danger to public health.' An excessive collection of refuse was found in the rear yard of the takeaway, the toilets were filthy, and a dirty bar of soap and unwashed towels were described as 'not fit for purpose'. Ms Jackson informed Gaffar, who had previously been warned about hygiene in 2009, 2010 and 2011, that he either had to voluntarily close the shop or she would be forced to issue an order. Dirty: Food inspectors were confronted by mouse droppings on shelves, on the floor (pictured) and under the fridge, which were described as an 'immediate danger to public health' Shocking: This oven at the Top Sweet Centre in Werneth, Greater Manchester has taken on an orange colour due to layers of grease and dirt .

Ruth Crimmins, prosecuting, said: 'This was an awful filthy state of a takeaway. The boiler was covered in grease and was leaking and the inspector didn't leave until all the food was thrown away.' Gaffar accepted responsibility for the conditions and said he had been lazy due to Ramadan. He apologised for the state of the shop and indicated a willingness to improve standards. Since reopening the shop, Gaffar has had to gain food hygiene certificates and has agreed to maintain a food-standards book.

'We always take what legal action we can to force dirty businesses to stop taking unacceptable risks with the public's health.

Miss Lawrence was ‘comfortable’ with people smoking in her car and home, police said, and officers have been checking the DNA of male smokers known to have sat in her vehicle without finding a match. Police also want to trace a man who told shop workers he knew Miss Lawrence or used to work with her, but has never been traced. The man, identified on CCTV, mentioned the case to staff in Tang Hall, York, on April 1, 2009 - almost two weeks after she disappeared. The charity Crimestoppers today renewed a £10,000 reward for any information which leads to the arrest and conviction of someone responsible for Miss Lawrence's disappearance. It is the fifth time the reward has been offered and it will be valid for the next three months. Mystery: The 'left-handed smoker' who was seen on a bridge with a woman on the morning Miss Lawrence vanished has never been found. Pictured: A previous reconstruction by the BBC's Crimewatch . A cigarette butt found in Miss Lawrence's car, which was being repaired when she disappeared, is being reexamined . Witness: This man in a Co-Op in Tang Hall, York, said he knew Claudia on April 1, 2009. He was never traced . Analysis of Miss Lawrence's phone . records indicate she was spending an unusual amount of time . ‘socialising’ in the Acomb suburb of York during this period and police . believe somebody she was seeing there is ‘yet to come forward.’ Evidence . inside Miss Lawrence’s house indicates she left as normal early in the . morning of Thursday 19 March to walk the three miles to work at the . University of York’s Goodricke College for a 6am shift. Another more curious item police want to trace is Miss Lawrence’s set of GHD hair straighteners. Detective Superintendent Dai Malyn, who is leading the review, said officers had spent two months examining her terraced house. He said: 'From the review of all the evidence available, including the fact that Claudia's bed was made and it appears that she had eaten breakfast and brushed her teeth, it is our belief that she had left for work on the morning of Thursday 19 March 2009. 'What is unusual is that Claudia's GHD hair straighteners - model number 14.4.1B and purchased in May 2007 - were missing from her home. Police are investigating how and why Miss Lawrence's GHD hair straighteners could have disappeared . Peter Lawrence, right, the father of Claudia, left, described the uncertainty surrounding the case as 'a cancer' 'From our inquiries, it is doubtful . that she would take them to work in her blue and grey Karrimor bag which . has also never been found.' Mr Malyn said extra fingerprints and DNA material were found throughout the house and work on this was ‘ongoing.’ He . added: ‘We are keen to eliminate people who have been inside Claudia’s . home before and after her disappearance. The elimination process is . simple, we just encourage people to come forward. Not doing so only . raises questions as to why you wouldn’t.’ Anniversary: There is a £10,000 reward for information which leads to a conviction . Mr . Malyn is to take part in a 5th anniversary appeal on the BBC’s . Crimewatch programme tonight. The show is expected to feature new . details of two vehicles seen at the time of her disappearance, but . police have refused to discuss this information before broadcast. Police have also released photos of hair dye bottles found in Miss Lawrence's house. Officers said Miss Lawrence regularly used hair dye to highlight her naturally brown hair and they found a significant quantity of it in the house. Det Supt Malyn added: ‘There is a possibility that Claudia may also have been colouring another person's hair. If anyone knows about this or it was you, please come forward now.’ The . high-profile police inquiry has always focused on Miss Lawrence’s . private life and her parents have been upset by reports about her . lovers. Police have previously revealed at the time she went missing she was in a secret ‘long term casual relationship’ with a man who was in a serious relationship himself. She also went out with a different . mystery man 48 hours before she vanished. Miss Lawrence arrived for her . early shift looking tired and told a work colleague she had been out . until 4 or 5am with a boyfriend. Miss . Lawrence was a prolific user of her mobile phone and further ‘cell site . activity’ analysis showed she was often in Acomb during her spare time . in the weeks before she disappeared. Although . known to drink in a pub there, police believe there could be vital . information about this aspect of her social life that they have not been . told about. Mr . Malyn said: ‘We have spoken to people in the Acomb area and I still . think there may be somebody over in Acomb who is yet to come forward or . give us the full information we require.’ Hair dye: Police have released photos of hair dye bottles and believe Miss Lawrence may have been dying someone else's hair before she disappeared . Dye: Some of the products found in Miss Lawrence's house. She was also believed to dye her own hair . Evidence: More of the hair dye products in the chef's home. More fingerprints were found in the house . Miss Lawrence’s silver Samsung D900 mobile has never turned up. It went dead at 12.10pm on the day she went missing. Police said yesterday they don’t think it ran out of battery power and believe ‘it was deliberately turned off by someone.’ When police were called in they found Miss Lawrence’s bed made and dirty breakfast dishes in the kitchen sink. Mr Malyn said police ‘favour the theory’ she set off for work as planned with her mobile and rucksack containing her chef’s whites. He said it was ‘doubtful’ she would take the straighteners to work but they ‘could be crucial to the investigation.’ His colleague Chief Superintendent Simon Mason told a press conference there is ‘not a prime suspect and nor is there any individual who could be deemed to be classified as suspect status.’ But he added: ‘There are a number of individuals who remain and are of particular interest to this investigation.’ Speaking earlier Peter Lawrence, the missing woman’s father, said waiting five years for news was ‘like a cancer.’ ‘It gets worse and worse and of course there is no resolution until we know what happened to Claudia.’","It has been five years since Claudia Lawrence, 35, disappeared .

Reza Khalilzada, a Dutch national, ordered the Uzi machine gun from the United States but was caught when his parcel was intercepted by customs officials on August 8 last year . Following the discovery, US Homeland Security notified Metropolitan Police and officers from the Met’s Central Task Force carried out a search of his address – where he lived with his parents and three siblings. During the raid of the family home in Pinner, Middlesex, on August 14 last year, officers uncovered the barrel of an AK-47 rifle under his mattress - which is also believed to have been imported from the US. When detectives questioned Khalilzada about the machine gun, he told police he had responded to a website advert offering money to provide a ‘drop-off address’ for an unknown package, because he was not doing well at college and wanted a job. During the search of his bedroom, officers also found a rucksack containing nunchucks, CS gas, a lock knife, lighter fluid, aerosol cans, a lighter, a catapault and ball bearings, a scarf and bandana, balaclavas, gloves, field dressing for wounds and bandage tape, amphetamines, ecstasy and four CDs containing images and videos of Khalilzada's family. Detectives also seized ear defenders, three computers and a number of USB memory sticks, £600 in cash and several bank cards. Khalilzada, 18, was charged with firearms offences on August 15 last year. However, the next day his parents reported that another package - also from the US - had been delivered for him. The imported parcel stated it contained a ceramic dish and an ornament featuring three ceramic owls sitting on a log but x-rays by US custom officials revealed that in fact it held the lethal IWI .22 calibre UZI machine gun, pictured, and 187 rounds of ammunition . It contained various parts of an assault rifle which, when combined with the AK-47  rifle barrel found under the mattress, created a fully functional, automatic assault rifle with the potential to kill. The ammunition seized at the US border also fitted this rifle. Examinations of Khalilzada’s computer showed it was heavily encrypted but the teenager failed  to supply police with a password, which he claims he has forgotten. He admitted two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon (AK-74 barrel and CS gas), and two counts of possession of a controlled drug (MDMA and amphetamine) and was found guilty of another weapons charge and customs charges at Isleworth Crown Court. He was sentenced to six years behind bars. During a raid at his family home in Pinner, Middlesex, police officers found an assault rifle, pictured, CS gas, drugs, knives and three computers .

A benefits cheat defrauded the taxpayer of £66,000 in order to buy a holiday home in Spain, a court has heard. A judge told Caryl Williams she had been 'subsidised' by people less well-off than her and used the money to fund a lavish lifestyle. Her fraud came to light after an anonymous tipster told the authorities she had been claiming benefits despite owning a second home and secretly living with her partner. Williams, 57, has been ordered to repay the money she wrongly claimed - but she is having just £7.20 a week deducted from her benefits, meaning it would take 176 years to pay all the money back. She pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown . Court yesterday to falsely claiming £58,406.04 in income support, . £335.14 in employment support and £7,304.28 in council tax. The . fraudster had previously insisted she was innocent, but changed her . plea at the last minute after a judge told her she would be likely to . avoid jail. She was sentenced to 10 months in prison, suspended for two years because of her previous good character and her poor health. Williams . was also ordered to wear an electronic tag and observe a nighttime . curfew for four months, confining her to her home in Bridgend, South . Wales. Judge Tom . Crowther told her: 'You have been thoroughly dishonest in obtaining . money to which you were not entitled. This was theft of public funds . raised by taxes on working people.' He added that such frauds damaged the public trust, by casting suspicion on genuine claimants. 'There is not an endless pot of money . and it diverts funds from those genuinely in need,' the judge said. 'Your property in Spain has been heavily subsidised by those working in . the United Kingdom. 'You . see only an entitlement for yourself, not the fact that you have taken . from the needy. You lived a lifestyle which many would regard as . enviable and beyond their means.' Home: Williams owns a house on this street in the town of Rute in southern Spain . Prosecutor Kayleigh Simmons said Williams' claims, which began in 1998, had originally been genuine. But . in 2012, there was an anonymous call to the benefit fraud line saying . she had been living with partner Bryan Pinwell for years, and that they . owned a property in Spain. Checks . revealed that his bank accounts and finance arrangements for two . motorbikes and a large motor-home were linked to Williams' home, which . was also the address he had given his employers. The couple each have a 50 per cent share in a house in Rute, in southern Spain, which they bought in 2005. Suspended sentence: Williams, left, escaped jail after a judge heard that she suffered from ill health . Ms Simmons said: 'She later admitted she visited the property for two weeks once or twice a year, that her children also went there and that Mr Pinwell had agreed to leave his share to her family if he died.' Mr Crowther told Williams: 'You were sitting talking about how to divide up, after death, property acquired by using a contribution of public funds. You were dividing that up as a gift to your children'. Jeffrey Jones, defending, said that Williams was severely disabled due to multiple sclerosis, depression and diabetes. He added that she is dependent on morphine for pain relief, and has difficulty dressing herself.","Caryl Williams bought a holiday home in southern Spain with her partner .

A tiny village in north Wales has been cut off from the world for more than a month after winter storms brought down phone lines. Villagers living at World's End tucked away in a narrow steep-sided valley are lost without phone and internet links. The lines were toppled by 100mph winds on February 12 and so far BT's engineers have failed to get them reconnected to the outside world. The village of World's End in Denbighshire has been cut off from the world for a month after winter storms brought down phone lines . And they feel 'forgotten' at World's End as the lack of communication has damaged businesses in the remote Eglwyseg Valley in Denbighshire. BT has apologised for the delay in repairs - blaming extensive damage to lines. Winds brought down phone lines and power cables in the area during storms which battered much of Britain. But while electricity was restored within five days, residents say they have no firm date for when their phone lines will be reconnected. Portia Kennaway runs six businesses at World's End - including two farms and a caravan site. She said 'very poor' mobile phone signals meant villagers have been left with little means of communication. The lines at World's End were toppled by 100mph winds February 12 - and BT engineers have so far failed to get them reconnected to the outside world . Ms Kennaway said: 'It's just depressing, nobody can get hold of us and they think we are avoiding them. 'People will just not believe that we haven't had phone lines for a month. 'Without a landline or internet connection I have had to rely on my staff to check business emails at their homes outside the valley. 'This has led to delays in getting back to people and left some customers unhappy.' Ms Kennaway pays £3,600 a year in line rental to BT for phones for her home and businesses, said the firm should do more to help. World's End is in North Wales, between Wrexham and Llangollen, and is popular with walkers . She said: 'We feel desperately forgotten and lonely. We are totally powerless and it's very depressing. 'We are trying to run businesses and we are being crippled.' World's End is a narrow vale which lies at the head of the Eglwyseg Valley. The area is very popular with walkers, cyclists and tourists and provides spectacular scenery throughout the year. The isolated collection of farms and cottages lies on a single track road which crosses Esclusham Mountain, the Ruabon Moors and fords the Eglwyseg River. A BT spokesman said they were 'sorry' for the delay in repairing the damaged phone lines. The spokesman said: 'The bad weather last month did cause extensive local damage to some of our overhead lines and poles in the area. 'We're having to replace two poles and about 180m of line. Specialist equipment is needed for that. 'We expect to carry out the work next week, but before if possible.'","Villagers in World's End are lost without phone and internet links .

John Hirst raked in millions from investors in the ex-pat community in Majorca where he lived . A conman who ripped off investors to live a life of luxury through a £5m investment fraud has been ordered to pay back just £650,000 to those he duped. John Hirst raked in millions from investors in the ex-pat community in Majorca where he lived, and spent it on first-class travel, lavish weddings and extravagant hotels. He was jailed for nine years in August 2012 for masterminding the so-called 'Ponzi' scam - leaving many of the people he scammed financially ruined. The plot was similar to the £41bn fraud for which United States financier Bernard Madoff was jailed for 150 years in 2009. Hirst had moved to Spain after . his release from jail for another bogus £500,000 investment scheme which . involved defrauding Yorkshire miners out of their redundancy payments . in the 1990s. On Tuesday, Bradford Crown Court heard that the 64-year-old ex-salesman could only pay back a fraction of the £4.7m he swindled from his neighbours and friends over an eight-year period. Judge Jonathan Durham Hall was told investigations by the Serious Fraud Office had led to an agreed figure of £4,717,042 that Hirst benefited from. But prosecutor Lisa Freeman confirmed he only had available assets worth £650,522.94. Just under £200,000 is already held by investigators and the outstanding amount is made up of cash gifts to people and money in other accounts. Hirst also owns a speedboat worth about £20,000. Hirst and his co-conspirator Richard Pollett ran the fraud scheme between 2001 and 2009, persuading investors to hand over large sums to invest on the Dow Jones Index futures market with guaranteed returns of 18 percent a year plus a two percent bonus. But while investors handed over around £10m, they only got back around £4m back. Some of the investors were friends of Pollett, who they knew and trusted. Bradford Crown Court heard previously that victims of the scheme were both in the UK and in the tourist and ex-pat community in Spain, many were elderly, investing their retirement nest egg - some got no money back. Hirst's wife was 'literally showered' with 'money and jewels', and the couple enjoyed luxury holidays, while £270,000 was spent renovating the Hirsts¿ £1.5m villa in Majorca (pictured) and their Las Vegas wedding cost more than £90,000 . Hirst’s wife was 'literally showered' with 'money and jewels', and the couple enjoyed luxury holidays, while £270,000 was spent renovating the Hirsts’ £1.5m villa in Majorca and their Las Vegas wedding cost more than £90,000. The couple stayed at the exclusive Burj Al Arab Hotel in Dubai on the way to the Seychelles for their honeymoon and also held a £100,000 party an at exclusive Majorca hotel for friends following their wedding. Hotels, holidays and flights were said to have cost just short of £160,000 with more than £25,000 spent on jewellery. The couple also enjoyed taking cruises and spent more than £75,000 on a series of trips. Hirst also paid cash for a luxury home for his ex-wife and her daughter. But in 2009 when there was a series of delays in payments to investors their plot began to unravel. Soon the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) began an investigation into the scheme, called Operation Noble, alongside West Yorkshire and Surrey Police. His wife Linda, laundered a total of £750,000, for which she was jailed for two-and-a-half years. Pollett was jailed for six and a half years. His wife Linda, laundered a total of £750,000, for which she was jailed for two-and-a-half years . Life of crime: John Hirst and his wife Linda spent £90,000 . of stolen cash on their wedding in Las Vegas . Extravagant: John Hirst, who lived in this spacious Majorca villa, moved to the country after being released from prison in the UK for similar fraud offences . Compensation orders were made against both Linda Hirst and Richard Pollett last year. Speaking after the sentencing hearing in August 2012, Charles Dewey, of Somerset, who formerly lived in Majorca and was a victim of the Ponzi fraud, said he and his family are having to start life again 'much in the manner of a student'. 'We have nothing left, we are on benefits, we are starting out again. 'The investment was £300,000, some of it we got back as income but we never were expecting to lose that capital. 'I think they are evil, I think I can speak of the other 120 investors, they have gone to a vulnerable group not big companies,' added Charles. Judge Durham Hall agreed to make a formal compensation order against Hirst totalling £650,522.94 which will be paid to investors on a pro-rata basis. Hirst has been given six months to pay the sum and was warned he faced another four years in jail if the cash is not handed over.","John Hirst raked in millions from investors in ex-pat community in Majorca .

Abandoned: The usually busy car park in Leeds had shut its gates at the end of January, but morning commuters found the site was back in action after it was re-opened by conmen . Cheeky conmen disguised in high-vis jackets broke into a disused city car park and re-opened it - charging unknowing drivers £4 to leave their vehicles there. The usually busy car park had shut its gates at the end of January, but morning commuters heading to work found to their surprise that the site was back in action. Dozens of motorists paid a reported £4 . each for a day’s stay to two high-visibility jacketed ‘attendants’, who . had put up signs bearing the name of the Elite Parking firm that ran the . facility in Leeds, West Yorkshire until its closure. However, it quickly emerged the people taking the payments had no connection to Elite and no right to be operating on the privately owned site. By the time the security company responsible for the site arrived on the scene, the unauthorised pair had vanished. Twenty Four 7 Security Services (UK) said that the site’s padlocked gates appeared to have been cut or forced open. A staff member from the company also said there had been no indicator anything was wrong when the site was checked by a patrol in the early hours of yesterday. The Elite signs used had been left behind at the car park when it closed earlier this year after Leeds City Council decided not to renew its long stay licence. As word of the scam spread yesterday morning, drivers began dashing back to the site move their cars amid fears the site could be locked up again with their vehicles still inside. However, Twenty Four 7 maintained a presence at the site during the afternoon so it could be kept open for latecomers to retrieve their cars. People who worked at the car park when it was run by Elite raised the alarm after they started receiving calls from their old customers about the reopening. Packed: Former car park attendant Joe Harding said the site would have quickly filled up if the 'attendants' had continued with their scam . 'If the people responsible had continued then the place would have been packed full every day in no time at all,' said Joe Harding, a former parking attendant at the site. A Leeds City Council spokesman said: 'We understand that someone broke into the site found some old signs left behind by Elite and managed to con a number of motorists into paying for parking. 'As soon as we were alerted we contacted landowner Taylor Wimpey, who were very surprised to find someone illegally using their land and they took immediate steps to re-secure the site.'

They claimed the two hours it took coastguards to carry out the unsuccessful rescue attempt was not properly examined at the hearing. The coroner ruled she died of misadventure.

Furness-Smith, a former Royal Navy 'poster girl', had been coasteering . with her brother Alex on November 2 last year when they were swept into a . cave by 15ft waves. Mr Furness-Smith, . 31, tried to summon help on his mobile phone but couldn't get a signal . and so left his 30-year-old sister to swim out for help. Coastguards and lifeboat crews were unable to reach Miss Furness-Smith due to the severe conditions and spoke to her through a blowhole in the top of the cave. Coastguard . Ian Bugler finally risked his own life by being lowered down the . extremely narrow hole after hearing Miss Furness-Smith scream 'get me . out of here'.

He described the moment he found her body after being lowered down the 15ft hole just wide enough for him . By the time he entered the cave, two hours into the rescue, Miss Furness-Smith, who was known as Buffy, had drowned. Her body has never been recovered. Speaking . after the inquest, Patricia Furness-Smith called into question the . legitimacy of the hearing and said the family were already pursuing a . second inquest. Mrs . Furness-Smith, an author, psychologist and magistrate, said: 'The family . has no confidence that this inquest properly examined the circumstances . of Buffy's death and the rescue operation that took place. 'We . feel this has been a total sham. We need to discuss it with our legal . representatives and make a decision (as to whether to appeal for another . inquest). 'We have lost our wonderful daughter and we would like to have some peace and quiet to actually grieve for her. 'But . equally we owe it to her to actually get to the truth of how her last . hours panned out. It is imperative that no other family ever suffers . what we have gone through. Charlotte Furness-Smith who drowned in a cave in Dorset after taking part in the dangerous sport of coasteering . 'If it takes a fight in order to make sure people do learn lessons then we must follow that through.' Miss Furness-Smith, . a maths teacher, had travelled to the Dorset coast with her brother to . go kite-surfing but it was too windy so they decided to go coasteering . at Tilly Whim Caves near Swanage. They put on wetsuits, buoyancy aids and helmets before clambering down the cliff onto a ledge and jumped into the sea at 1.30pm. As they swam past the cave entrance they were hit by a 15ft sea swell whipped up by 60mph winds and swept into it. The . inquest heard from a coasteering expert who said he would never have . considered entering the sea on that day due to the severe weather . conditions. Recording a . verdict of misadventure at the inquest in Bournemouth, Mr Payne said: . 'What I can't ignore is that Charlotte and Alex put themselves in a . risky situation in poor weather that was predicted to worsen. Rescue attempt: Her brother, Alex, left her trapped in the cave while he called for the Coastguard. They rushed to the scene, but could not save her in time . 'Alex confirmed they had not checked tides or anything like that. It was predictable that the weather was going to worsen. 'The . information was available but Alex and Buffy decided to enter the sea . on that November day anyway to do the activity of coasteering. 'They . were strong swimmers but they were rapidly overcome. They were swept . into the cave and that is how the whole sad affair started. 'If Alex had not been able to escape, no-one would have known they were there. They may have both perished. 'This particular misadventure went very sadly, and indeed fatally, wrong.' Mr Payne praised the coastguard rescue team and said he would be recommending Ian Bugler for a bravery award. Aftermath: In the hours after the horrifying incident, rescuers had to retrieve her body from the tiny inlet. Today, Alex, 31, told an inquest she screamed for help while she was trapped in the small cave . Tide: A lifeboat crew tried to reach the 5ft entrance to the cave but was beaten back by the waves. One rescuer was lowered down into the cave, but Charlotte was already dead . Adrian Rogers, helicopter paramedic winchman, was also in attendance to hear the accounts of what happened . He . added: 'He acted with considerable bravery. He was advised he did not . have to go down into the blowhole but the decision was taken that it was . the only option available.' In . a statement Scott Titt, president of the British Mountaineering Council . and who was at the cliffs on the day, raised concerns about the . apparent lack of urgency of the rescue. But Mark Rodaway, manager of Portland coastguard, said his team did all they could to reach Miss Furness-Smith. He . said: 'This was a complex rescue with winds gusting up to 60mph, . horrendous sea conditions combined with high tide and limited access to . the cave. 'This was proven . when one of our coastguard rescue officers risked his own life when . attempting to abseil down a narrow blowhole. 'I . am confident the coastguard helicopter crew, rescue teams and the RNLI . lifeboat crews on scene that day made every effort while there was still . a chance of a successful rescue outcome.' Miss Furness-Smith, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, was born in Trinidad and Tobago and her family returned to the UK when she was eight. She . joined the Royal Navy Reserves at Exeter University and was part of the . Navy's recruitment team. She graduated in engineering before going on . to qualify as a maths teacher and worked at a school in Bristol.","Charlotte Furness-Smith's parents claim vital evidence was not examined .

A drama of unimaginable horror unfolded on a quiet residential street in Birmingham when a teenage boy allegedly launched a frenzied knife attack on his mother and two sisters, leaving all three with multiple wounds. Shocked neighbours described the scene in Small Heath as 'like something out of a horror film', with one claiming to have seen part of the attack on his CCTV system. He watched as one girl, just 10 years old, was dragged in a headlock into the street and stabbed multiple times in the upper body and neck. She then tried to crawl to a neighbour's house for help, he said. Scroll down for video . The scene on Little Green Lane, Small Heath, Birmimgham, where a woman and two children were found stabbed on Wednesday morning . A . teaching assistant and caretaker from the primary school across the . road from the house raced to help the little girl as she lay in agony. Her older brother, aged 17, calmly stood and watched nearby before being taken away by police, witnesses said. The mother, one claimed, was stabbed in the eye. The 10-year-old was airlifted to hospital where her injuries were described by police as 'serious' while her 16-year-old sister and their mother were taken to hospital by ambulance. Police were called to an address in Little Green Lane at 7.20am on Wednesday by a resident who reported hearing screams. A statement said: 'Officers arrived at the scene within a matter of minutes and arrested a 17-year-old in the street and recovered a knife nearby. He has been taken to hospital having suffered a minor cut to his hand. 'A woman in her 40s and a teenage girl - believed to be aged 16 - were found inside a house with knife injuries whilst a younger girl, 10, was found on the pavement with stab injuries.' Crime scene: A woman speaks to the police at the edge of the cordon in Small Heath . A baby was discovered unharmed inside the address and is currently being cared for by family members. Chief Inspector Dean Hatton, of Birmingham Central Police, said: 'All three casualties have suffered multiple knife wounds and have been taken to hospital for emergency treatment. The two girls are in a serious condition, whilst their mother is described as stable. 'This appears to be a contained, domestic incident: the teenager was arrested outside the address and we are not actively seeking anyone else in connection with the incident.' The stabbing occurred on the same road in which 75-year-old Mohammed Saleem was murdered last April. The house where today's three victims were attacked is directly opposite the family home of Mr Saleem. Ukrainian Pavlo Lapshyn was sentenced to 40 years in prison after admitting his murder. Grim: Bloodstains can be seen around the outside of the house . Shahid Saleem, 41, was stunned when he heard screaming and checked his private CCTV cameras - only to see the attack unfolding on camera. He said: 'I just couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was frozen to the spot. ‘I . saw a woman with short dark hair run over to the girl - I recognised . her as one of the teachers at the primary school across the road. ‘At . that point I ran out to help - there were lots of neighbours running . around, tending to the two sisters. The boy was just sitting in the . road. He was completely dead behind the eyes. Analysis: A forensics officer examines items outside the house . ‘The police arrived and lead him away, he went willingly, and the paramedics started working on the girls straight away. The air ambulance came for her.‘ . ‘It was horrendous to witness. I just hope all three of them are ok. ‘The father is working away in Saudi Arabia, so the boy was left as man of the house. ‘They had only recently moved back into the house, which they had been letting out, because they were trying to sell it, so the whole family could move back to Saudi.’ Farah Naz, 45, who lives nearby, said: 'I heard someone screaming, it sounded like they were terrified and in pain, so I sent my son to see what was going on. Investigation: Police forensic personnel working at the scene on Little Green Lane . 'He came tearing back to the house and told me I needed to go and help. I ran round the corner and there was a girl lying in the doorway. 'She was covered in blood and it looked like she had been stabbed in the neck.There was blood everywhere. It was like a scene from a horror film. 'There were two people kneeling over her, comforting her, it was the caretaker from the primary school and a teaching assistant. 'They kept telling her it was going to be OK. Then all the emergency services arrived and it was a bit of a blur.' Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, spoke of her shock. She said: ‘Nothing like this has ever happened here before, I am in total shock, I just don’t know what to do with myself. ‘I was getting ready to go to work, it was just after 7am I think and I heard these screams, these really high pitched screams. ‘It was like something from a horror movie, they were deafening, I looked out of my window but I couldn’t see anything. ‘I was scared, I knew something bad had happened so I didn’t leave my house, then within minutes I saw police cars and ambulance pulling up.

"PUBLISHED: . 10:52 EST, 19 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:42 EST, 19 March 2014 . A heartfelt letter written by Winston Churchill in which he reveals that his fears that he is too old to carry on as Prime Minister has emerged for sale . A heartfelt letter written by Winston Churchill in which he reveals his fears that he is too old to carry on as Prime Minister has emerged for sale. The letter, dated April 6, 1955 - the day after the war time Prime Minister tendered his resignation to the Queen - was written during his second term in office, while Churchill was 81. He had suffered a series of strokes which had affected his speech and his ability to walk, and had fallen out of favour with the British public in the years following the war. In the two-page typewritten letter to prospective Conservative candidate John Harvey, Churchill revealed to his ally that he could not face another four-year term. The letter reads: 'At a General Election the Head of the Government and Leader of the Party unfolds the policy for the new Parliament, to which he is personally pledged. 'For some time past I have not felt that at my age it would be right for me to incur such new and indefinite responsibilities. 'It is necessary therefore in the public interest that my successor should enter upon his duites in reasonable time to present himself and his programme to the Nation as and when he chooses. I have therefore tendered my resignation to The Queen.' Churchill goes on to give his full backing to his successor, Anthony Eden, who he commends for upholding the principles of the Conservative Party. It continues: 'Her Majesty has invited Sir Anthony Eden to form a Government. 'In him the Conservative Party have a leader who has, by his long and distinguished service, gained their full confidence and who will, I am sure, sustain the highest interests and traditions of Britain and uphold the causes of Tory democracy which Lord Beaconsfield proclaimed which Lord Randolph revived, and which I have tried to serve.' Churchill's first term as Prime Minister began in May 1940 after the resignation of Neville Chamberlain. He led the country through World War II, earning himself a reputation as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century. In the two-page typewritten letter to prospective Conservative candidate John Harvey, Churchill, then 81, admits he could not face another four-year term . However by 1945 he had fallen out of favour and was replaced by Atlee, who had served as Churchill's deputy. In 1951 the Conservatives were again voted back in with Churchill as their leader but the great man was suffered increasing health problems. Following his resignation Churchill remained as an MP until standing down at the 1964 election. He died in January 1965 aged 90. The letter is tipped to fetch £15,000 when it goes under the hammer at Nate D Sanders in Los Angeles in an online auction ending on March 27. Sir Winston Curchill shakes hands with Pierre Mendes, watched by Anthony Eden, on the steps of Chartwell. After his resignation, He gave his full backing to his successor, Anthony Eden . Laura Yntema, from the auction house, said: 'This letter is not the formal one he would have presented to the Queen but in terms of importance it is a very close second. 'Churchill would only have sent letters of this nature to a few of his closest allies. 'Its significance is huge as it brings to an end the career of one of the greatest politicians of all time. 'During World War II the United States had Franklin D. Roosevelt as its iconic leader and the UK had the equivalent in Winston Churchill. 'Unlike FDR, Churchill survived the war but he wasn't deemed to be as great a peacetime leader as he had been during the conflict and he was defeated in the election of 1945. 'By the time he was voted back into power in 1951 he was an old man and was suffering from a series of health conditions. 'After four more years in charge of the country Churchill felt he had no choice but to hand over the reins to someone else because of his failing health. 'This letter is fascinating as Churchill confides that he had felt for some time that his age and health were a detriment to his leadership of the country. 'Nevertheless, Churchill will always be remembered as one of the greatest wartime leaders of the 20th century and we expect plenty of interest in this historical document.'","The letter, dated April 6, 1955, written during second term in office .

The former Premier League striker admitted the charge at Nottingham Crown Court after he drove his Porsche into two other vehicles last year. The footballer, who appeared in the dock wearing a blue suit and open-necked white shirt, changed his plea to one of guilty this morning. Shamed: Marlon King, 33, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving at Nottingham Crown Court. The ex-Wigan Athletic striker will be sentenced on May 2 . A 35-year-old was airlifted to the . Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham following the smash on the . Lincoln-bound carriageway of the A46/A17 in Winthorpe, Nottinghamshire. The road was closed for two and a half hours following the pile-up, which also involved a Volkswagen Polo and a Vauxhall Astra. Judge Nigel Godsmark QC told King he would adjourn for a pre-sentence report. Defending King, Charles Langley asked that 'alternatives' be looked at to an immediate custodial sentence. He faces a maximum of two years in prison when imprisonment he is sentenced on May 2. Ordering an interim driving ban, the judge told King he would make 'no promises'. The incident followed the footballer's 2009 . conviction for sexually assaulting a student in a London nightclub, for . which he was jailed for 18 months. The . player, who has made 469 senior appearances, was on loan to Hull from Wigan Athletic when he groped the student's bottom and then punched her in the face when he she rejected him. He is said to have broken the 20-year-old female's nose and split her lip during the confrontation in Soho in December 2008.

She said she had taken part in a dance audition in a London nightclub when Clifford, 70, stopped her as she was leaving and claimed he was acting for James Bond producer Cubby Broccoli who was doing screen-testing for the film Octopussy. The woman told the court: ‘He said, “I’m looking for girls for a Bond film. I work for Chubby (sic) Broccoli and you would be great for it”. ‘He said I can make a phone call and maybe set you up with a screen test. ‘I was very happy about that so I waited for him to make a call.’ The woman, who had previously danced on a television show with Pat Sharp in the early 1980s, said Clifford made a call from a public phone box in the club before calling her over. She told the court: ‘The person on the phone said they were Chubby Broccoli and that Max thought I would be a good potential for one of the Bond girls. ‘He asked for my vital statistics. It was quite normal to give that. ‘He said...you need to do something before we can agree to the screen test. Max Clifford told a dancer that nobody would believe her if she told how he asked her to perform a sex act on him in a nightclub toilet, Southwark Crown Court heard today . ‘He asked me if Max was circumcised and asked me to look. I thought it was a joke. I kind of froze. He said it again. Then I realised that I was stuck.’ The woman bowed her head in the witness box and broke down in tears as she spoke during the court hearing. After composing herself, the alleged victim, who said she was wearing a leotard for the morning audition, told the court that Clifford was ‘smiling’ as he stood beside her during the phone call. He was ‘calm’ as he then took her by the hand into the male toilets, she said. The woman added: ‘I was afraid. Just shocked really.’ Asked by prosecutor Rosina Cottage QC why she went with Clifford, the woman replied: ‘I have no idea. ‘All I know I was frightened. It was a man probably older than my father. You trust people who are older than you when you are that young.’ She told the court Clifford pushed her into a toilet cubicle before he undid his trousers and made her touch his erect penis. The alleged victim, who is now 43 but was around 18 at the time of the alleged indecent assault, told the court how Clifford said he could 'offer her the chance of playing a Bond girl' and said he was in touch with the producer who was doing screen-testing for the film Octopussy, pictured (file picture) ‘He said I had to, I had to masturbate him,’ the woman said. She told the court Clifford put his hand down her leotard and pulled at her breasts. ‘When I did take my hand away he put it back,’ she added. 'I thought I need to get this over with and get out. ‘He said something very cocky like, no-one is going to believe me, or “Who’s going to believe that?” ‘With hindsight I probably should have slapped him but when you’re young you feel powerless.’ The woman said her behaviour became ‘erratic’ over the next year and she broke up with her first boyfriend as their relationship was ‘ruined’. Clifford, from Hersham, Surrey, pictured, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven teenagers aged  14 to 19 between 1966 and 1984. He denies all the charges . She did not tell police at the time because she feared she would not be believed and she later joined a kibbutz in Israel, she told the court. She said she told her older sister about the alleged incident but swore her to secrecy and only broke her silence with friends at a dinner party after seeing reports of Jimmy Savile’s abuse. During cross-examination, Richard Horwell QC, defending Clifford, suggested to the witness that the alleged assault ‘simply did not happen’. The alleged victim replied: ‘I wish I could say that was true.’ The former dancer, one of seven alleged victims of indecent assault by Clifford, pictured, broke down in tears as she spoke at Southwark Crown Court, London, today . Mr Horwell told the woman that Octopussy was released before the alleged incident happened. She responded: ‘I wouldn’t know. I was young, I didn’t follow Bond films. I’m not a fool. I was young but I’m not a fool. I know what he said. I believed him until the phone call. He knows the truth as I know the truth. I tried to block this from my mind for a long time.’ Judge Anthony Leonard QC later pointed out to the court that the James Bond producer was known as ‘Cubby’ not ‘Chubby’ Broccoli. Another woman, who is not a complainant in the case, told the court that Clifford tried to show his penis to her during a photoshoot and encouraged her to sleep with influential people to further her career. Publicist Max Clifford, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday, denies 11 counts of incident assault against seven women and girls . She told the court she visited Clifford's office in New Bond Street, central London, in 1986 when she was 18 and working as a dancer and part-time model. Clifford took her phone number and called her later that evening, she said. 'He said he was interested in me and that I had something quite special,' she said. 'Something for a career in film. He didn't want to go down the TV route.' The woman, who cannot be named, told the court that Clifford had claimed she was 'very suitable' for a role in the film Labyrinth, starring David Bowie. The publicist told her there were lots of good-looking and talented people in the world and 'you need to do certain things to get further', she said. Asked by Ms Cottage what she believed Clifford was referring to, the witness replied: 'You have to sleep with someone if they were interested in you.' Clifford told the woman that a dinner had been organised at a hotel in High Street Kensington with Bowie and Hollywood actor Walter Matthau, she said. Clifford claimed that Bowie would 'wink' if he was interested in her for a film role and she would have to go up to a hotel room with the star, the witness added. 'I was really nervous,' she said. 'I didn't turn up. I said I was ill.' The woman said she attended a recording of Michael Barrymore's gameshow Strike It Lucky with Clifford and another woman in 1986. On another occasion, she said she went to a flat with the publicist for some promotional photos in which she posed in a swimsuit. The woman said she had taken part in a dance audition in a London nightclub when Clifford, pictured, claimed he was acting for James Bond producer Cubby Broccoli who was doing screen-testing for the film Octopussy . Clifford asked the woman to join him on a sofa when another man went into a room with a woman she believed was Clifford's 'mistress', she said. She told the court: 'He said ""I'm not confident... I've got issues about the size of my penis. It's affected me for years. It's really affected me. Will you have a look?""' Clifford then took out his penis, she said. 'He said ""It's really small but if you touch it, it will get bigger,""' the woman told the court. Ms Cottage asked the woman if she looked at Clifford's penis after he exposed himself. She replied: 'No, it freaked me out. I got up and left the room.' The woman told the court she decided afterwards not to pursue a modelling or dance career because she thought it was 'seedy and horrible'. She said she told her mother, stepfather and cousin about the alleged incident. The alleged victim told the court Clifford, pictured, pushed her into a toilet cubicle before he undid his trousers and made her touch his penis. She also told the court Clifford put his hand down her leotard and pulled at her breasts . The woman contacted police from her cousin's home after allegations against Clifford emerged in the press, the court heard. During cross-examination, Mr Horwell suggested to the witness that Clifford did not show his penis to her. She replied: 'Why would I say it? What gain would I get from saying it?' The woman added: 'I thought I was 18, naive, and that's what people do to get ahead, and I'm not doing it.' Clifford, from Hersham, Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven teenagers aged  14 to 19 between 1966 and 1984. He denies all the charges.

This is the footage that framed two drug dealers dubbed 'Britain's dumbest criminals' after they forgot to turn off their own CCTV cameras while cutting and selling cocaine. Cousins Arshad Khan and Abid Khan used a snooker hall as a front for their illegal business, hiding drugs inside the tables in a bid to shore up their struggling finances. But they forgot to switch off the security cameras which they had installed to deter troublemakers at the Frames Snooker Club, in Accrington, Lancashire - and these images were seized by police. Caught: Arshad Khan, 40, and Abid Khan, 27, used a snooker hall as a front for their cocaine business - but forgot to turn off the CCTV while they cut and sold the drugs . Cameras throughout the building in Accrington, Lancashire, captured every step of their clandestine business . Arshad Khan (right), 40, and his 27-year-old cousin Abid Khan (left) had been hiding the drugs under the tables . When police watched the CCTV footage, they saw the Khans dividing up cocaine on the baize of the tables and bagging them up for sale. It emerged that the two cousins had been hiding their haul of drugs inside chalk compartments and on the underside of the tables. At Burnley Crown Court Arshad, 40, from Haslingden, and 27-year-old Abid, from Colne, admitted possessing ecstasy and conspiracy to supply cocaine, and were each jailed for three and a half years. During mitigation, Abid's lawyer Philip Holden said: 'It's like something off Britain's Dumbest Criminal. It's bizarre that people who are running this sort of enterprise would allow the CCTV still to be running.' Earlier, the court heard how the pair had leased the club in April last year using funding from their families, but quickly saw the business fail and began using it as cover for drug dealing. In June, police stopped a car with three associates of the Khans and found a bag of cannabis, and in October they raided the two men's homes and found bags with traces of cocaine. The pair admitted possessing ecstasy and conspiracy to supply cocaine at Burnley Crown Court . The footage showed them dividing cocaine on the baize of the tables and bagging them up for sale . The snooker hall in Accrington Arshad Khan and Abid Khan used as a front for their illegal activities . Burnley Crown Court heard when police seized the CCTV footage, they saw the Khans dividing up cocaine on the baize of the tables and bagging them up for sale . After finding Abid's fingerprints on one of the bags, officers raided the club and found 70g of cocaine worth £11,500, 236g of bulking agents and a haul of cash. Sniffer dogs went into the premises and located a carrier bag containing 55.3 grams of cocaine, scales, a dish and a spoon in a snooker table. A box containing £1,805 cash was behind the counter. An empty vending machine in the reception area was also searched and in it were 28 bags of cocaine, weighing 10.6g, seven snap bags weighing 2.53g at 71 per cent purity, a further knotted bag with 3.37g and also 72 ecstasy tablets. CCTV footage from the club was seized and showed both Khans holding plastic bags, weighing up and dividing the drugs, going from the snooker tables to the counter and exchanges taking place with unknown accomplices within the property. Abid was arrested at his home and police found a safe with £3,400 in cash and £270 in his jeans, along with a bag of cocaine. Mr Holden said his client had planned to be a driving instructor but went into a drug dealing instead when he developed a cocaine habit. He said: 'He literally got his hands dirty, bagging up drugs at the snooker hall. He is a promising, intelligent, articulate young man, who has fallen from grace. 'He started to take drugs, ended up on a downward spiral, his partner left him and he became depressed... He tried to become a driving instructor before the effects of drugs took hold.' Tim Storrie, for Arshad Khan, said his client committed the offence to earn money to shore up his failing business. The barrister added: 'It was a foolish idea. He had involved himself in taking cocaine and he was using between £50 and £100 worth a day.' 'These events have been a terrific shock. The defendant knows that when he is released, he has a lot of bridges to build.' Sentencing, the judge Nigel Grundy said: 'I accept the snooker club was first started as a legitimate business enterprise. 'But it soon became clear to both of you that was failing and you chose to supplement your income significantly by engaging in what can properly be described as a drug street dealing operation.' 'I accept that to some extent the operation was naive in that you kept the CCTV on when you were performing those activities, but that may simply be you were so arrogant you never thought you were going to be caught.'","Arshad Khan and Abid Khan used hall as a front for illegal business .

"PUBLISHED: . 19:39 EST, 18 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 03:38 EST, 19 March 2014 . British women enjoy fewer years in retirement than those in most other Western nations, a study has revealed. Shorter lifespans and longer working lives mean a British woman can expect 22.1 years in retirement – five fewer than the 27.4 enjoyed by French women. Experts say the gap is only going to increase due to the Government’s determination to raise the state pension age. Widening gap: Retirement is shorter for British women - and men - than those who live in many other developed countries . The study, by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, shows that men in the UK fare slightly better when compared with other rich nations. But they can still expect a retirement lasting just 19.1 years – three and a half years shorter than their French counterparts. The retirement span of British men is slightly above the average for the OECD, which represents the top 34 industrialised countries. British women are in 22nd position, under the OECD average and below five countries which used to be behind the Iron Curtain. The study, Society at a Glance 2014, found that while life expectancy has surged in Britain over the past four decades, the rate is slower than it is for many of our competitors. Life expectancy has risen by 9.2 years since 1970 in the UK but in France it has gone up by 10 years and in Germany, 10.2. The study warns that the taxpayer will come under increasing pressure to support its older generation. In Britain, there are 3.5 working-age people per pensioner but by 2050 that will be just 2.2. Ros Altmann, a former Treasury adviser, said: ‘British women are poor relations on pensions both here and in Europe – and it is only going to get worse. ‘With the retirement age rising significantly, the differential in retirement span between British women and European women here is only going to widen. ‘On top of this, state pensions for women are much lower in Britain than elsewhere.’ The OECD report shows that British women tend to retire at the age of 63.2, by which time their life expectancy is 85.3. This gives them a retirement span of 22.1 years. Retirement rankings: Greece, Slovakia and Poland all outrank the UK in terms of how long their women spend in reitrement . Across the OECD, the average retirement span is 22.5 years. But French women tend to retire at 60, by which time their life expectancy is 87.4, giving them a retirement span of 27.4 years. Even former Soviet bloc states such as Slovenia, Czech Republic and Slovakia fare better than us, as does Ireland. British men tend to retire at the age of 63.7, by which time they have a life expectancy of 82.8, giving them a retirement span of 19.1 years – three fewer than women. France, again, does much better, with a retirement span of 22.6 years. Top of the male league is Luxembourg with a span of 23.4 years. But British men have longer retirements than the OECD average of 18.1 years. Across the OECD, women tend to have 7.5 extra years in retirement than they did in 1970, while men have eight more years. Mrs Altmann said: ‘Women in Britain are now working later because of the increase in state pension age and also, it is important to point out, because some like to earn the extra money. ‘This is not happening in some European countries but it is likely the state pension system and retirement ages there will turn out to be unsustainable.’","Study shows that British women can expect a 22.1-year retirement .

He died aged 42 after mistakes by Wythenshawe Hospital consultants, an inquest heard . A father-of-two died of a heart infection after doctors missed three chances to save him, an inquest has heard. Stephen Avery, 42, could have lived if doctors had put him on antibiotics just 48 hours sooner, it was said. But, despite displaying the telltale symptoms of infection, consultants at Wythenshawe Hospital missed three opportunities to treat the taxi-driver and former local football team manager and coach. At his inquest in Manchester, heart expert Professor Keith Channer condemned the decisions made by hospital staff. Describing . Dr Channer’s evidence as ‘compelling’, coroner Nigel Meadows said: 'An . appropriate physician should have been able to recognise the symptoms as . indicated. Had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would . not have died.' Mr Avery, from Crossacres, Wythenshawe, first visited his GP in October 2011, suffering broken sleep, night sweats and lethargy. He was diagnosed with a chest infection, and prescribed antibiotics. But his symptoms worsened after a brief improvement, prompting further antibiotics and a referral. Then at Wythenshawe Hospital on May 1, 2012, Dr Paul Sanders, consultant rheumatologist, recognised his symptoms as indicating a heart infection, but after tests, failed to diagnose him. On his return on May 11, Dr Keith Harkins, consultant physician, again suspected Mr Avery had a heart infection, but stopped his GP-prescribed antibiotics to carry out tests, including a heart scan. Due to a system failure, the scan order never reached the right department. Mr Avery with mother Maureen, wife Jennifer, 44, daughter Phoebe, now 14, son Dominic, now 18. If the popular father had had antibiotics started 48 hours before he probably would not have died, it was said . On May 14, yet another consultant . re-ordered the scan urgently, but when his condition was finally . diagnosed the next day, and an antibiotics drip was started, it was too . late. He suffered a cardiac arrest and died on May 15. Coroner . Nigel Meadows said Mr Avery, who had a congenital condition which made . him more susceptible to infection, died of endocarditis. Coroner Nigel Meadows said Mr Avery, who had a congenital condition which made him more susceptible to infection, died of endocarditis . He said contributory factors were ‘significant failures’ on May 1 and . May 11 to recognise his symptoms and failure to start the right . antibiotics drip by the 12th. He said if the young father had the right scan, diagnosis and treatment earlier, he probably would have survived. Recording a narrative verdict, Mr Meadows added: 'These medical practitioners are bound to reflect upon their involvement but at the time they thought they were making the right judgements. 'But they were not judgements that were well-founded.' Popular and well-liked Mr Avery lived in Stockport and worked for Wythenshawe’s Club Cars. More than 800 people attended his funeral and he left behind wife Jennifer and children Dominic, 18, and Phoebe, 14. After the hearing his wife, 44, said: 'Wythenshawe Hospital has not only let our family down but they have let our entire community down. 'Stephen was a wonderful family man but also so well-known and loved in the community. 'The findings of the inquest have confirmed the family’s view that Stephen’s death could and should have been avoided if only he had been provided with appropriate and prompt clinical care and management during his time in hospital.' A University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust spokesman said: 'We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Mr Avery following their very sad loss. 'The trust has reflected on its practice following its investigation to understand what lessons can be learned. 'We will also give full and careful consideration to the comments and feedback from the coroner.' Infective endocarditis is an infection that can seriously damage the heart valves and cause other serious complications if not treated quickly with antibiotics. After someone has suffered from the infection they often require surgery to repair or replace damaged heart valves. It is an infection that affects some parts of the endocardium - the tissue that lines the inside of the heart chambers. The infection usually involves one or more of the heart valves which are part of the endocardium - it is serious and life-threatening. Most cases are caused by a bacterial infection and usually occur in a person who has an infection or a wound in another part of the body. People who inject street drugs are also at greater risk as they can also inject bacteria into their bloodstream if they use dirty needles. In the UK, endocarditis occurs in about 20 in a million people each year. It is most common in people with heart valve problems, have had heart valve surgery, have congenital heart defects or who have a poor immune system. Symptoms include feeling generally unwell, having aches and pains, tiredness, fever and loss of appetite.","Stephen Avery could have lived if put him on antibiotics 48 hours sooner .

A mother has turned her post baby bulge to biceps, transforming her 17st body to become a champion powerlifter. Lisa James, 29, from Llanelli, South Wales, started to pile on the pounds after the birth of her second child and at her heaviest she weighed 17st and struggled to fit into size 20 clothes. But less than two years later the mother-of-two is now a champion powerlifter, holding both the British and European records. Lisa started to gain weight when she was pregnant with her second child (right) but has now totally transformed her body by taking up power lifting (left) Lisa initially lost 4st in a year by drastically cutting her calories, but said she was very unhappy with her body . Auxiliary nurse Lisa started to count her calories and within a year her weight had plummeted to just 9st. She said: 'I lost the weight very quickly, about 4st just fell off. At my lightest I weighed 9st and was a size eight, but I just wasn’t happy. 'I’d lost my boobs and had a lot of loose skin as I lost the weight so quickly. I felt really self-conscious and it put a strain on my relationship, I couldn’t bear him touching me. 'I was also really tired and was feeling quite low. Then my partner - the dad of my kids - went off and had an affair, which made everything much worse.' In a bid to get back some of her self-confidence Lisa decided to have a boob job and increased her cup size to 34DD. But it was only when she took a job at her local gym that she decided to start improving her body by working out. Lisa says while she was unhappy being large (right), neither was she confident when she weighed 9st, and it is only since starting powerlifting (pictured with trophies, left) that she likes her body . Now the part-time personal trainer is a healthy size 10-12 and is more confident than she’s ever been. Lisa said: 'Initially I did all the usual stuff at the gym. But I was getting bored of doing the same sort of thing all the time and took up powerlifting. 'I’d see all the girls going to classes, but I wanted to try something totally different and have something to train for. 'Powerlifting really pushed me to my limits and I was instantly obsessed with it. I love training hard and seeing the results. Although she doesn't weigh herself Lisa is a healthy size and says she has never felt more confident . 'One year after I started losing weight I entered and won the 2013 Wales’ Strongest Woman competition. And then went on to win the World Championship Powerlifting in Chicago. 'I must have known I was overweight but now I find it hard to believe that I didn’t do anything about it sooner. 'But being skinny didn’t make me happy - I’m heavier now but I’m fit and healthy. It was the powerlifting that really made the difference. 'I cut out all bad foods and allowed myself one cheat a week and as the weight came off it gave me more motivation to keep going, my diet now is a bit different as I have to eat every three hours to keep my metabolism fast and I have to eat a high protein diet along with complex carbs and good fats. 'Powerlifting really pushed me to my limits and I was instantly obsessed with it. I love training hard and seeing the results' Lisa says . 'I don't have dairy and I don't eat any processed food or have any salt or sugar, I have a diet to follow pre-competition and I use Avenches biotech supplements to assist with my training - I'm sponsored by them and have the best advice and products off them to help me.' 'It’s changed me as a whole person. I’m more independent and I’m motivated.' The young mother is adamant that powerlifting is not just for men and actively encourages other women to take up strength sports. She said: 'I keep everything girly. All my kit is pink. That’s the message I want to give to girls: You don’t have to be manly if you’re a powerlifter, it’s about being strong and fit.' Lisa’s healthy outlook is something she hopes to pass onto her two children Kacey, six, and four-year-old Jacob. She said: 'My whole experience has made me want to motivate other people. 'I now run seminars to inspire other women to change their life, which is exactly what I did. 'I look better and feel better than ever before. I’m known as the Power Princess, which I think sums me up pretty well.'","Lisa's weight rose to 17st after the birth of her second child .

Benefits Street star White Dee has spoken out about her battle with crippling depression. Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - appeared on ITV's This Morning to try and raise awareness of the condition. At the height of her depression - triggered by the death of her mother in 2011-  she says she felt permanently numb and cried for 24 hours a day. 'There was just a big gaping hole in my life and I was too scared to leave the house,' she told presenters Holly Willoughby and Christine Bleakley and Dr Chris Steele, the resident GP. Dee, the undisputed star of Channel 4’s controversial . documentary series, is seen as the famous matriarch . of James Turner Street in Birmingham. But she says her depression left her a prisoner in her own home and it was only because a friend took her to the GP that she is now on medication. She explained: 'When my mum passed away it left a real hole in the family. I used to speak to her 10-15 times a day and see her nearly every day.' She said she initially coped with her grief by trying to care for her father. 'I went into overdrive. I am the elder sibling so I started obsessing over Dad. We have a real old-school Irish family - Dad worked, Mum did all the cooking. 'I sort of jumped in, thinking he was useless - but he wasn't. I was trying to protect him, but in the end, he had to say ""back off, stop ringing me 10 times a day"". 'Once I realised Dad was OK, there was nothing to do. There was just a big gaping hole. 'I was locked away in the house, too scared to leave and Mum wasn't coming back.' Dee said she then began lying to friends about where she was, to prevent her reclusiveness from being discovered.

Housebound: Dee - the star of Benefits Street - said her depression left her a prisoner in her own home . 'Then one day after four or five months, a friend clocked it and took me off to the doctor to get me the help I needed,' she recalled. She admitted that because of the taboo surrounding depression, she probably wouldn't have sought help had a friend not taken her to the GP. PSYCHOLOGICAL symptoms of depression include: . Continuous . low mood or sadness, feeling hopeless and tearful, being irritable and . intolerant of others, not getting any enjoyment out of life and having . suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm. PHYSICAL symptoms include: . A . change in appetite or weight, disturbed sleep - especially finding it . hard to fall asleep at night or waking early in the morning - loss of . libido and a lack of energy. Today, Dee takes the antidepressant Sertraline and is under the care of her local mental health team. 'The only thing I don't do any more is cry 24 hours a day,' she added.'You start taking antidepressants and you stop crying, but just feel numb, permanently numb.' She admitted that she sometimes also feels suicidal. When quizzed about her matriarchal role and the fact that on the show she always seems to be helping others, she replied: 'We were filmed every day for 18 months - there might have been a week when someone else was looking after the kids because I couldn't do anything and couldn't move. 'Some people have said to me: ""you don't look depressed"". 'People throw the word around and say after a bad day ""oh I'm so depressed"" - but it kind of feels personal [and strange to have it used like that]. 'I let it go over my head - I have to concentrate on myself.' And despite depression . being the most common mental health issue - affecting nearly a fifth of . adults and 80,00 children and young people - depression is still . one of society's taboos, resident GP Dr Chris Steele explained. Unknown: Dee admitted to presenters Holly Willoughby and Christine Bleakley that people have said: 'You don't look depressed' 'Telling someone they don't look depressed is a ridiculous way to assess someone,' he said. 'I have had severe depression three times - I remember once sitting crying in the toilets before going on air to do a live phone-in - on depression. It was a nightmare. 'You can't just ""pull yourself together"" - you need help, so see a doctor. You will get better if you take treatment and medical advice.'

A mailman in Long Island has been arrested for throwing out more than 1,000 pieces of mail at a mix of four different trash sites in the span of a week. Patrick Paskett, 24, was arrested and has been charged with mail destruction which is considered a felony and could lead to five years in prison. The investigation was prompted by residents in Seaford and Massapequa Park complaining that they were not receiving packages that they knew had been sent. Something wrong in the small town: Residents of Seaford and Massapequa Park in Long Island noticed that their mail was not being delivered in the first week of March and alerted authorities . 'It happened. I resigned. I don’t work for them anymore. It’s over,' Paskett told The New York Post. Technically he is still employed with the United States Postal Service until the case is finished, but he is no longer delivering mail. The investigation focused on the mail that he dumped between February 27 and March 6 but The Post reports that he admitted to throwing mail in trash bins about 15 times in the last three months. After the complaints from residents were reported to authorities, a federal agent was assigned to track Paskett's movements on March 6, though it is unclear how they were able to limit the scope of their investigation to just Paskett and not others who covered similar areas. Once confronted, Paskett showed where he discarded the stamped mail and investigators were able to recover 1,018 letters and packages that he threw out between February 27 and March 6. 'The defendant, Patrick Paskett, further stated, in sum and substance, that he knew it was wrong to throw away mail,' a criminal complaint filed with Brooklyn Federal Court reads. Problematic: Patrick Paskett, not pictured, began working for the USPS in June and now faces up to five years behind bars . Paskett was released on his own recognizance but faces a possible five year sentence. 'Very, very bad- I mean, people ar waiting for their checks; people are waiting for their bills, and it's very bad,' Massapequa Park resident Christine Augello told CBS New York. 'He should have never done that.' His court date has not been set but he will be staying at his parents' home, where he lives, until the trial.","Patrick Paskett, 24, was followed by authorities after Long Island residents complained that mail went missing .

Modern mums are often portrayed as being irrational for stopping their children playing with dirt. But the plight of Paralympian skier and flag-bearer Millie Knight shows there are real reasons to be wary. The 15-year-old was blinded in one eye by an infection known as toxocara, which is contracted from contaminated soil. Millie Knight of Great Britain, 15, pictured with guide Rachael Ferrier at the Sochi 2014 Paralympic Winter Games, was blinded in one eye by toxocara . What is toxocara? Toxocara are essentially dog worms, whose eggs are passed out in the dog’s faeces. Accidental ingestion causes humans to be infected. Children playing in parks are most at risk, as soil may be contaminated by passing canines. Toddlers putting their hands in their mouth after playing in dirt or eating soil are another at-risk group. Toxocara is contracted from soil contaminated by dog faeces and can cause blindness . How many people are affected by toxocara in the UK? Studies have shown that up  to three per cent of the UK population have antibodies to the parasite, which means they have ingested it at some point. But it is usually symptom-less and causes no problems for most people. How does toxocara  cause blindness? Once ingested, the eggs hatch in the intestine and the parasite larvae cross the gut wall into the bloodstream. This allows them to travel to organs including the liver, heart, brain and eyes. The larvae don’t develop at these sites, but in rare cases local inflammation in reaction to them causes the disease toxocariasis. In the eye, it can cause blindness, as happened to Millie. How can I prevent my  child getting toxocara? Handwashing after being in the park, and before eating, are essential, as is washing all raw vegetables before eating.","Toxocara is contracted from soil contaminated by dog faeces .

A severely injured motorcyclist has his face rebuilt using titanium plates produced by a 3D printer – a machine that creates three-dimensional, useable objects by building them from thin layers of plastic or metal. But the treatment that put Stephen Power in the headlines last week  is far from a one-off medical miracle. In fact, you may have been benefiting from this remarkable technology for years at your local dental practice. Nothing new: The treatment of Stephen Power, pictured before and after the operation, who had his face rebuilt using titanium plates produced by a 3D printer, is far from a one-off medical miracle . NO MORE CHEWING RUBBER . In dentistry, 3D scanners and printers are used to produce moulds of the mouth, replacing the unpleasant experience of having to bite into gunk-like impression material. ‘For 100 years dentists relied on manual impressions, made using a mouth-shaped tray filled with a quick-setting rubber,’ says Eric Erickson, of Stratasys, the main supplier of 3D printers for dentistry. ‘This was used to make a plaster of Paris model of the patient’s teeth, and helped dental technicians hand-craft crowns or dentures. ‘Now we scan the mouth, create a computer model and send it to a 3D printer. ‘Not only is that far quicker, it means an absolutely precise representation of your mouth and teeth, and therefore better fitting crowns or braces.’ Dentists and surgeons regularly use . 3D-printed surgical aids too, such as a mouth-shaped sheet with  a hole . for the drill to be used for implants. Mr Erickson says: ‘Before, things . were done simply through knowledge and experience, but these guides use . exact replicas of your mouth to show exactly where to drill, meaning . fewer mistakes like hitting nerves.’ Up to ten per cent of dentists use these digital technologies. MOTORING AHEAD . The . 3D technology first emerged  in the 1980s and is commonly used by . Formula 1 teams. In fact, the engineering centre at Cardiff Metropolitan . University, which worked with the surgeons reconstructing Stephen . Power’s face, was originally focused on producing prototypes for the . motor industry. The . technique works much like normal document-printing but instead of . recreating a two-dimensional image from the screen, it translates a 3D . virtual model on the computer into reality. Objects are formed from a . series of layers or particles, rather than by chiselling  a shape from a . block of material – meaning excellent precision and better efficiency. In the case of Mr Power, X-ray scans of his head were used as a starting . point, with new guides and  plates built virtually before being . printed. Painstaking: The facial models, guides and implants which were all 3D printed by the team at Swansea's Morriston Hospital . STRIVING FOR ACCURACY . Last . month it was revealed that orthopaedic surgeons in Newcastle had . created a titanium pelvis through 3D printing. The replacement was for a . patient with a rare bone cancer who had to have half  his pelvis . removed to stop the disease spreading. Paul . Unwin, chief technical officer at Stanmore Implants, which produced the . pelvis, says: ‘In difficult cases, 3D printing can be more appropriate . as it’s good for complex shapes, and we can build structures like . lattice work that allows bone to grow into it. 'We’ve produced 11 . pelvises in this way, and nine shoulder blades – these can be just 2mm . thick in places.’ Maxillofacial . surgeon Adrian Sugar, who carried out the operation on Mr Power at . Morriston Hospital in Swansea, adds: ‘We’ve been using 3D printing for . 12 years in pretty much every aspect of reconstructive surgery. Pioneering: Mr Power's skull after the operation with temporary staples . His surgeon said: 'Stephen had a very complex injury and correcting it involved bones having to be re-cut into several fragments' ‘For planning operations we use it to produce both virtual and physical models of the skull, and the technology has made surgery easier and far more accurate. Instead of spending many hours in the operating theatre thinking, we now spend many hours before surgery thinking. ‘To some extent it’s more time-consuming but the surgery is more accurate – we can produce a much more reliable outcome by doing things in this way.’ PRINTING SKIN .  .  .  AND ENTIRE ORGANS . In future it is likely such techniques will be used in hospitals throughout Britain. ‘The challenge now is to make this a quicker, cheaper, more manageable process,’ says Mr Sugar. The technology is evolving fast and has vast potential, particularly for prosthetic limbs. ‘It could reduce two weeks’ manual work to a night’s printing, and produce limbs that fit better too,’ says Ted Varley, of prosthetics firm RSL Steeper. There is even scope for printing entire organs. A kidney, strips of liver tissue and human blood vessels have all been created using 3D printers – a process known as bioprinting that works through cartridges loaded with human cells.","Stephen Power had his face rebuilt using 3D printed titanium plates .

The Million Women Study has found that women over 50 who are overweight or obese have a higher cost to the NHS due to increased admissions . Obesity caused by poor lifestyle choices such as diet are the cause of one in eight hospital admissions for women over 50-years-old, according to a new study. Researchers from the University of Oxford found that hospital admissions for women over 50 are commonly caused by issues to do with obesity or being overweight, and that these issues accounted for around 2 million days in hospital a year. The research was part of the Million Women Study, one of the biggest health research projects currently taking place in the UK. Researchers found the information by looking at the diseases in women with a high body mass index (BMI) of more than 25, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. However, while these diseases are common with women over 50 who have a high BMI, the study found that most of the issues were to do with cancer. Weight is one of the big risk factors for breast cancer, and is one of the few that can actually be altered. This was explained by lead author of the study Gillian Reeves, who said: 'A lot of the work I do is related to cancer. 'A lot of the risk factors for breast cancer, in particular, you can't change. 'In some sense, it is quiet nice to think this is a modifiable risk . factor – there is a lot to be gained by not putting on excess weight.' The Million Women Study estimates that the annual bill to the taxpayer by overweight or obese women over 50 and their hospital visits is around £500 million, based on one NHS bed costing £250 a day. The study looks at changes in health of the whole population over time, and has been running since 1996, looking at around a quarter of all the women in the UK aged between 50 and 64 - around 1.3 million women. 36 per cent of the 1.3 million participants were overweight, and around 18 per cent were obese, more than 54 per cent of the total women who participated, and a few per cent less than the official figure of women in England - 58 per cent. The NHS may be spending more money on conditions related to obesity, like hip replacements and heart disease, due to the poor lifestyle choices commonly associated with being overweight . Some of the most common reasons for overweight women being admitted were cataract surgery (45,000 admissions) and gallbladder disease (35,000 admissions), followed by breast cancer (34,307 admissions) and heart disease (32,483 admissions). The study found that weight was a big factor in both minor and major conditions. Women with a BMI higher than 25 were at a big risk for diabetes (74 per cent of admissions) an knee replacements (66 per cent of admissions), and one in five heart attacks were because of weight. Minor conditions included carpal tunnel syndrome (31 per cent of admissions in overweight people and 23 per cent in obese people), which cost the NHS a lot because they are common. The study found the more weight women put on, the more likely they were to spend time in hospital. Reeves told the Guardian: 'Previous reports may have under-estimated the effect of BMI. 'The increased risk is quiet steady.' The study did not look at how much the cost of the increased admissions was to the NHS, but they do intend to study this as well, with estimates that conditions to do with weight are more costly to the NHS than others. One peculiar aspect that the study found was that overweight women who had a BMI higher than 25 were less likely to smoke or drink, which meant that the majority of admissions with overweight women were due to conditions only related to being overweight rather than other factors.","Women over 50 who were admitted to hospital were more likely to be obese .

Andrew McSherry, 52, nearly died from heart disease while he was drinking eight litres of fizzy drinks a day. During the last 20 years he has spent an estimated £35,000 on Irn-Bru. Andrew McSherry used to drink eight litres of Irn-Bru a day - in the last 20 years he has spent £35,000 on it . He was downing the equivalent of 150 teaspoons of sugar a day and suffered catastrophic artery damage. After life-saving surgery, Mr McSherry briefly gave up his favourite drink before going back to it - this time to the sugar-free diet version. The father-of-three now says he has cut back and is down to four litres a day – his wife Margaret, 46, however, is not happy with his efforts. Mr McSherry said: ‘I did give up for a few months but I just couldn’t live without Irn-Bru. ‘I shouldn’t drink it. The doctors have told me not to - but I just can’t help it. ‘My wife is always moaning at me but there are worse things to be addicted to. I don’t drink alcohol, for instance. Mind you I don’t drink any water, either.’ In 2011 Mr McSherry almost died of heart disease and because his arteries were so clogged he had to have a life-saving quadruple heart bypass . Mr McSherry almost died from heart disease when his addiction was at its height in 2011. He started to suffer from shortness of breath and tests revealed he had severely clogged arteries. As a result, he had to have major heart surgery to prevent a heart attack. He was so dependent on Irn-Bru he would suffer withdrawal symptoms if he didn’t down a two-litre bottle during the night - and still tops himself up through the small hours. He was taking in 2,400 calories day - the recommended healthy amount for a man - from the drink alone. Mr McSherry, a former labourer, said he was also eating three meals a day but maintained a normal weight despite his sugar-heavy diet. Mr McSherry drank so much Irn-Bru he was consuming the equivalent of 150 teaspoons of sugar a day . Mr McSherry, from Cumbernauld, near Glasgow, added: ‘I always have a two-litre bottle by my bedside because I need to top up the levels through the night. ‘I have my first proper drink when I wake up at 6.30am - then I just carrying on drinking throughout the day. ‘I’m amazed I haven’t turned orange. I can’t remember how long I’ve been drinking it - years and years. ‘Even when I was younger and I was going to the pub I’d only drink Irn-Bru - about seven or eight cans a night. Mr McSherry's doctors told him to give up the drink but he found this too difficult. As a result, he still drinks four litres a day - but he has swapped to the sugar-free diet version . ‘But when I started drinking it again I thought I need to be careful, so I switched to Diet Irn-Bru. At least that’s cutting out the sugar.’ The diet version of Irn-Bru contains around 423 calories a litre - meaning Mr McSherry still gets nearly 1,700 from the drink each day. His Irn-Bru habit was featured in the 2012 BBC Scotland series ‘Addicted to Pleasure’, hosted by actor Brian Cox. A spokeswoman for Irn-Bru manufacturers A. G. Barr said: ‘Irn-Bru can be enjoyed in regular and sugar-free variants as part of a balanced diet and a healthy, active lifestyle. ‘Millions of people have enjoyed Irn-Bru this way for generations. We would never advocate the over-consumption of any one product.’","Andrew McSherry, 52, has spent £35,000 on Irn-Bru in the last 20 years .

Having fertility treatment can be very stressful for hopeful parents, but now one clinic has found a way of making it slightly easier. A fertility clinic in Barcelona has created an app that allows parents-to-be to see their embryos in the lab in real-time. The Institut Marquès fertility clinic offers the service to couples who are having IVF and whose embryos are being incubated in an ‘Embryoscope’. This state-of-the-art incubator contains . a camera which takes a photograph of the embryo every 20 minutes for . the three to five days that it is being incubated after fertilisation, . and before it is transferred to the mother-to-be. A fertility clinic has created an app which allows hopeful parents to see their embryos developing in the lab . These images can then be accessed be the parents via an app – known as ‘Embryomobile’ - on their smartphones. Dr Victoria Walker, fertility specialist at Institut Marquès fertility clinic, told MailOnline: ‘This app helps parents-to-be feel close to their embryos and it makes them feel empowered. ‘It allows them to feel more in touch with the embryo.’ She added: ‘We have had very positive feedback. During trials 100 per cent of people said seeing the images was very powerful and 87 per cent said it was a powerfully positive experience. ‘People also say it makes them feel calmer and they say it is amazing to see the creation of new life. The images are taken by a camera in the incubator every 20 minutes. They are also used by the embryologists to track which are likely to be the best quality for transfer to the mother . ‘They are amazed to be able to see their children being created and they say it makes them feel part of the process.’ Dr Walker said the images are also beneficial for the embryologists as seeing how the embryo changes can allow them to detect which are of good quality and which are not. This allows them to select the strongest embryos for transfer to the woman, giving the best chance of a successful pregnancy. Dr Walker said: ‘Most people are extremely impressed by the images – parents are watching the beginning of their child’s life. It is very moving.’ She compared the experience to the first antenatal scan and said the average couple look at the images three or four times a day. Dr Victoria Walker at the Institut Marquès fertility clinic (pictured) says the app allows parents to feel closer to their embryos and to feel part of the process . One hopeful parent said: ‘It's . definitively incredible. It's an awesome view of the origin of a human . life. I've studied biology and my husband and me feel really rewarded . and full of joy for being the witnesses of such an amazing event.’ Another added: ‘I have seen the creation of life and it is something very special when you know they are yours.’ Only hopeful parents who pay an extra 500 euros to have the special incubator are able to use the app. If the embryo is successfully transferred to the woman, and the pregnancy is successful, the parents receive a DVD showing a slideshow of the images. The fertility clinic has also established that there is a greater chance of fertilisation if eggs in the lab are played music. Freddie (pictured) was the first British baby to be born thanks to the technique . The Institut Marquès fertility clinic hit the headlines last year for using a technique which sees music played to embryos while they were in a petri dish. The first British baby born thanks to the technique was born in 2012. Freddie was played pop songs by Michael Jackson and Madonna as well as tracks from Nirvana and Metallica while in the dish. Researchers believe the vibrations caused by the music aid fertilisation. The scientists found that the chance of fertilisation during IVF treatment is five per cent higher if music is played in the incubators.","The Institut Marquès fertility clinic in Spain has created 'Embryomobile'

The world's leading space agency is looking for asteroid hunters to help save the planet - and you could help. Nasa is offering up to $35,000 (£21,000) over the next six months to anyone who is able develop computer code that can identify life-threatening asteroids. By mining talent from the general public, the space agency hopes to spot dangerous space rocks such as the one that saw off the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. Nasa is offering up to $35,000 (£21,000) over the next six months to anyone who is able develop computer code that can identify life-threatening asteroids . The bounty is part of its Asteroid Data Hunter contest which plans to reduce the number of false positives found in images from ground-based telescopes. Over the past two decades, Nasa has been looking for dangerous near-Earth asteroids larger than 1km in size, and claims to have found 98 per cent of them. But existing asteroid detection systems can only track one per cent of the estimated objects that orbit the sun, according to asteroid mining firm Planetary Resources, who is partnering with Nasa on the project. In a session at the SXSW conference in Texas, Nasa scientist Jason Kessler said: ‘The likelihood of something hitting us in the future is pretty guaranteed, although we’re not freaking out that there is an imminent threat.’ The bounty is part of its Asteroid Data Hunter contest which plans to reduce the number of false positives found in images from ground-based telescopes . Scientists have warned of a possible asteroid collision with the Earth this month. An asteroid around two-thirds of a mile wide (1.2km) could hit the Earth on March 21 and has been classified as 'an event meriting careful monitoring"" by astronomers. But they say the probability of the asteroid hitting Earth is just 1 in 909,000 and the risk of impact is likely to decrease as they collect more information. The newly-discovered asteroid, known as 2003 QQ47, has a mass of around 2,600 million tons (2,600 billion kg). Its orbit calculations are currently based on just 51 observations during a seven-day period. Dr Alan Fitzsimmons of Queen's University, Belfast, one of the expert team advising the UK NEO (Near Earth Objects) Information Centre, based in Leicester, said: 'The NEO will be observable from Earth for the next two months, and astronomers will continue to track it over this period.' ‘If a 30-metre asteroid were to hit in the wrong place at the wrong time, it could wipe out an entire city,' Currently there are only around 100 people who tracks asteroids each day to determine their shape and speed. Nasa wants to increase that number, particularly over  Africa and Asia where spottings aren’t being made. ‘Ultimately our goal is to get an infrared telescope that’s away from the Earth,’ he Professor Kessler. ‘We recognise we need to get away from the Earth so that our field of view opens up.’ ‘The opportunity as the number of detections increases is for amateur astronomers – our citizen scientists – to help here.’ Citizens science projects such as this are increasingly being used by researchers to help in large-scale projects. Zooniverse, for example, is one of the leading online platforms for citizen scientists, working on a range of projects including classifying galaxies. Last month, up one million volunteers signed up to the programme.","Bounty, available for six months, is part of Asteroid Data .

But one nutrition expert says it is simply a myth that drink water aids slimming. Dr Beth Kitchin, at the University of Alabama, has stated that drinking water is not a magical key to weight loss. She said: ‘There is very little evidence that drinking water promotes weight loss - it is one of those self-perpetuating myths. It is a myth that drinking water aids weight loss, according to a nutrition expert . ‘I'm not saying drinking water isn't good - but only one study showed people who drank more water burned a few extra calories, and it was only a couple of extra calories a day.’ Dr Kitchin added that it is also a myth that people should drink eight glasses of water a day. She said: ‘Yes, people do need to get fluids - but it does not have to be water. There's no evidence that it melts away fat or makes you feel fuller, so if you don't like water it's OK.’ She explained that water is the best liquid to drink to hydrate but that green tea, coffee and squash are also hydrating. She said: ‘People think coffee doesn't count, but actually it does. ‘When you drink coffee, your body is retaining much of that fluid - especially for people who are habituated to drinking caffeine, as the body adapts, resulting in a reduced loss of fluids.’ Dr Kitchin said some people also believe that drinking very cold water can help them lose weight. Dr Beth Kitchin says drinking very cold water can cause a dieter to burn a few more calories but not enough to make a tangible difference to weight . She believes this can increase the number of calories burned but that it does not have sufficient impact to aid weight loss. The bad news for dieters is that Dr Kitchin says the only way to lose weight is to eat fewer calories. She suggests focussing on eating fruit, vegetables and soups. Dr Kitchin's claims contradict 2013 research which found that drinking two cups of water before a meal can help people lose weight. The research, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, suggested drinking water can reduce hunger meaning dieters consume fewer calories.","Dr Beth Kitchin says it is a myth that drinking water aids weight loss .

Thousands of people have been sent a distressing hoax email telling them they have cancer, a health watchdog has warned. The message appears to be from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), and carries the subject line: ‘Important blood analysis result.’ Seeming to come from an official Nice email address, it advises the recipient that their white blood cell count was found to be low after a recent blood test, and that they should visit their GP immediately as cancer is suspected. The message appears to be from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), and carries the subject line: 'Important blood analysis result' Nice said it has been bombarded with phone calls following the hoax, and that those who have had blood tests recently have been particularly alarmed. The email says: ‘We have been sent a sample of your blood analysis for further research. During the complete blood count (CBC) we have revealed that white blood cells is very low, and unfortunately we have a suspicion of a cancer. ‘We suggest you to print out your CBC test results and interpretations in attachment below and visit your family doctor as soon as possible.’ Sir Andrew Dillon, Nice chief executive, said: ‘A spam email purporting to come from Nice is being sent to members of the public regarding cancer test results. ‘This email is likely to cause distress to recipients since it advises that “test results” indicate they may have cancer. ‘This malicious email is not from Nice and we are currently investigating its origin. We take this matter very seriously and have reported it to the police.’ Nice is advising people who have received the email to delete it without opening it, and not to click on any links as it may contain a computer virus. A spokesman said it was not clear exactly how many people have been affected, but the high number of calls to the organisation yesterday suggests it could have been sent to thousands. Michelle Kelly, 30, received the email yesterday morning at work. The call centre manager, who works in Liverpool, was worried by the message, particularly as she had blood tests for a kidney problem a few weeks ago and has a history of cancer in her family. She said: ‘I’m used to getting spam but when I saw that email, because I’ve had blood tests done recently, your heart sinks. ‘I did think it could be spam as it had a zip file attached and I know not to open spam emails, but there was a chart saying that  my white blood cell count was low and it was from a nice.org.uk email address. Seeming to come from an official Nice email address, it advises the recipient that their white blood cell count was found to be low after a recent blood test, and that they should visit their GP immediately as cancer is suspected . ‘I don’t know what offends me more – if I received that news via email or that someone is that malicious and they want to get a virus on to my computer that much that they would do something like this.’ Distressed, she called her boyfriend Chris Stebbings, an IT specialist, to tell him about the email. Mr Stebbings, 30, from Newcastle, said: ‘Michelle called me straight away and was in a bit of a state – as you would be. ‘We’re quite savvy when it comes to things like this and know what a spam email looks like, but you see the word cancer and you don’t think anyone would do that.’ Vicky Townshend, 60, also received the spam email yesterday morning. The self-employed secretary from Lewes, East Sussex, said: ‘It was very unpleasant but I did think it was spam. ‘It had grammatical errors and a zip file attached. I had a blood test about a year ago but I don’t think it was related. I think the people behind it are disgusting and I was very annoyed about it, but it was just too ridiculous.’ Nice has been using its Twitter account to reassure concerned recipients that the emails, which it claims are coming from India and Turkey, are a hoax. It said the spam attack was not caused by hacking, as the organisation does not hold patient data.","Email says white blood cell count was found to be low in recent tests .

If you want to keep chatting away while you order your morning flat white - then it's going to cost you. At least that's the view taken by one Australian cafe manager, who has imposed a 50-cent 'talking tax' on customers who refuse to get off their phones while at the counter. Luke Proust from Bella Natural Food Co on the New South Wales Central Coast decided enough was enough after dealing with one-too-many rude patrons, so he put up a Post-It note at the counter announcing a new policy. New policy: Luke Proust from the Bella Natural Food Co on the New South Wales Central Coast has won a legion of fans after posting this note at the front counter . Not on my watch! Bella Natural Food Co manager Luke Proust says it's common courtesy to put away your phone at the counter . The note, which has received hundreds of likes and shares since being posted to Facebook, reads: 'Fifty cent surcharge for being on the phone at the counter. It's rude!!' The feisty barista has told the MailOnline that after one particularly bad morning of dealing with rude customers he felt compelled to act. 'My boss said “you had better write a sign”, so I wrote it on a Post-It note. 'He (the customer) didn't take it too well, in fact he walked out without his coffee, he said that I was being rude by charging him without having a sign. 'I said being on the phone and not engaging with me was the rude part of the deal.' Luke Proust's sign has received all sorts of attention - and most of the customers have gotten behind his push to ban rudeness at the counter . Legion of fans: Some customers have even donated 50 cents to the tip jar so they can stop and take a picture of the epic sign . Mr Proust said that experience wasn't isolated. The cafe manager says he has several customers on any given morning who will be too busy on their phone to even make eye contact or show basic manners when placing an order. 'You get half a dozen people in every day who are super rude on the phone,' he said. 'But if anybody has worked in the customer service industry, you can't do customer service if the customer's not willing to reciprocate.'

A ‘miracle baby’ has defied the odds to reach his second birthday despite being born with just a tiny amount of healthy brain. Shelly Wall discovered three months into her pregnancy that baby Noah had a catalogue of health problems including spina bifida, rare chromosome abnormalities and hydrocephalus - fluid on the brain. His condition was so serious that doctors warned Mrs Wall, 42, and husband Rob, 48, that he would not survive. Noah Wall (pictured with his mother, Shelly) has amazed doctors by reaching his second birthday despite having a catalogue of serious health problems . But despite the odds being stacked against them, the couple repeatedly refused a termination and two years on Noah is continuing to astound medical professionals. Mrs Wall, from Abbeytown, Cumbria, said: ‘We wanted to give Noah a chance. ‘We are trying really hard to make day-to-day life as normal as we possibly can for him - we treat him just like any other child. ‘He is potty training now and he knows if he uses the potty then he gets chocolate. ‘It is amazing that he understands what it is and what he is supposed to do despite having only two per cent of his brain functioning. ‘He can also use a fork, spoon and a cup by himself. He knows a lot of different animals and will tell you to put the light on or off or to open the door. Before he was born Noah's parents were advised to abort him because he has spina bifida as well as fluid on the brain and rare chromosomal abnormalities . Noah's mother says that he has just two per cent of the amount of normal brain tissue he should have. Image shows a scan of his brain - the dark area is all fluid and the grey area is the only normal brain tissue . ‘He chooses things and makes decisions. He never shuts up and he can sing as well. ‘It is absolutely amazing. To look at him you wouldn’t know there was anything wrong.’ When Mrs Wall went for her 12-week scan doctors discovered that her unborn baby had spina bifida, a condition which affects the development of the spinal cord. Doctors also told the couple that the condition had left a massive hole in Noah’s back which they said they would be unable to stitch up. During the pregnancy, the couple were regularly offered a termination but they stood firm, adamant that their son deserved the chance to live. Noah Wall (pictured with Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne) was not expected to survive for long after his birth and his parents were warned he would not be resuscitated - so they were amazed to hear him cry . Noah (pictured shortly after his birth) was allowed home when he was 10 days old but he had to return to hospital several times after suffering complications . But realising that the odds of survival were extremely low, the family began organising the unborn baby’s funeral. But when Noah was born on March 6 in 2012, he took his first breath and began crying. He was paralysed from the chest down - but he was alive. Doctors changed their mind and carried out a five-hour operation to stitch up Noah’s back. Mrs Wall said: ‘The first thing we heard when he was born was him taking a breath and then crying, which was unbelievable. ‘We had been told that he wouldn’t be going down to the baby care unit because they were adamant that he wouldn’t take a breath and said it would be cruel to keep a baby alive on oxygen.’ Noah was allowed home after ten days but due to several emergencies had to return to hospital on many occasions. Noah (pictured with his mother, Shelly, shortly after his birth) is paralysed from the chest down . Noah's mother, Shelly, has set up a shop to raise money for Noah. She was given a Small Business Sunday award by Dragons' Den star Theo Paphitis . The space left by the brain in Noah’s head is filled by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) which is drained regularly by a fitted shunt. He passes this fluid out when he goes to the toilet. The fluid became infected when Noah was seven weeks old and he had the shunt removed. Two and a half litres of fluid was drained manually using a needle in his head. The shunt was then replaced and the shape of Noah’s head is now closely monitored. Despite having so little healthy brain tissue, Noah can say a few words and he is now potty training . Noah (pictured shortly after his birth) is susceptible to fits and to meningitis and his parents know that they have to take one day at a time with him . Noah requires constant supervision, has to be massaged five times a day as well as undertaking regular sessions of physiotherapy and hydrotherapy. As he only has a tiny part of his brain, his parents and sisters Steph, 21, and Ally, 17, are forced to live day to day knowing that it could be the last time they spend with him. Mrs Wall said: ‘We don’t know how long he will live but we won’t put a time on him. We just take every day as it comes. ‘We spend a lot of quality time with him and he gets a lot of attention. ‘He is susceptible to fits but thankfully he hasn’t had any yet. He is also susceptible to meningitis. Mrs Wall said: 'We don't know how long he will live but we won't put a time on him. We just take every day as it comes. We spend a lot of quality time with him.' Noah is pictured with TV presenter Nick Knowles . Noah picked an Against All Odds Baby gong for bravery at the Big Heart Awards, organised by Mother & Baby magazine . ‘He can’t regulate his own body temperature so we constantly have to take clothes off or put clothes on him.’ Research has shown that a lack of folic acid three months before pregnancy - not just during - can cause spinal bifida and Mrs Wall now spends her time raising awareness through Noah’s story. She updated her Twitter on a daily basis throughout her pregnancy and has support from celebrities including Dragon’s Den star Theo Paphitis - who handed her one of his ‘Small Business Sunday’ awards for the shop she runs to raise money for Noah. As well continuing to amaze doctors, Noah has now scooped a national award for bravery earlier this month. The toddler picked up the Against All Odds Baby gong and rubbed shoulders with celebs including Jenny Frost and Imogen Thomas at the Big Heart Awards, organised by Mother & Baby magazine. Noah was born with a large hole in his back and doctors were worried they wouldn't be able to repair it . Noah's parents are now raising awareness about the importance of taking folic acid before and during pregnancy in a bid to prevent spina bifida. Noah is pictured with Billy Byrne from DIY SOS . Mrs Wall said: ‘We are absolutely thrilled to bits. Noah ended up with lots of toys and goodie bags. ‘We were nominated by one of our followers on Twitter. I don’t know how many people were nominated but we got an email saying that Noah had won. ‘It is really nice to be nominated because you never expect anything. It’s wonderful. I’m still trying to take it all in. ‘The more awareness we can raise about his condition the better. We want to help as many people as possible. ‘We are watching Noah every day and you can never relax. It’s not nice but we have to make sure that he is OK. He is a happy baby and he is always smiling which is incredible.’","Noah Wall's parents, Shelly and Rob Wall, were advised to abort him .

Now one pair of twin sisters say they have even shared labour pains. Leanne Humphreys developed unexplained stomach cramps just as her sister Vickii’s waters were about to break. Twins Vickii (left) and Leanne (right) are so close that Leanne felt Vickii go into labour. Vickii is pictured with her daughter, Ava, and Leanne is pictured with her son, Harry . Moments after Leanne developed stomach pains, Vickii went into labour. The following morning Vickii's daughter, Ava-Jai, was born. Leanne already had a baby son, called Harry. Like many twins, Leanne and Vickii, from Bolton, are very close. The pair have experienced headaches at the same time and conceived within six months of each other. But last year the identical twins, 20, took their sisterly bond one step further when Leanne felt Vickii go into labour. Leanne (left) and Vickii (right) are identical and say they are so close that they have even experienced headaches at the same time . Leanne (left) and Vickii (right) were conceived through IVF and their parents describe them as 'miracles' Leanne said: ‘We have always been close. When we were younger we were inseparable and things are exactly the same now. ‘We have always had a special bond and have experienced matching headaches before. ‘Once I was at work and I had an awful headache so I got sent home. When I got home Vickii was already there and when I asked what she was doing she said she had been sent home with a headache too. It was weird. Leanne (pictured) was sitting down watching television when she suddenly suffered severe stomach cramps. Just a few moments later, Vickii's waters broke and she went into labour . ‘When I found out I was pregnant in September 2012 I told Vickii straight away. She was a great auntie from the start and was there for me all the way through my pregnancy.’ Leanne’s son Harry was born in April 2013, but just three weeks before he was born, Vickii announced that she was expecting too. Leanne said: ‘I was eight months pregnant when Vickii told me she was expecting. I couldn’t believe it. Leanne experienced sympathy pains throughout Vickii's labour. Image shows Vickii with her daughter, Ava . Vickii and Leanne say they hope their children will be as close as they are . We have always done everything together and it felt so special that both our babies would be born in the same year.’ The twins, who live together with their parents, have always been described by their parents Julie and Gary as ‘miracle babies’ after they were conceived through IVF. Leanne helped coach Vickii through her pregnancy and Vickii witnessed and experienced new-motherhood by being there for Leanne. Leanne said: ‘By the time Vickii was at the end of her pregnancy I think she was well-equipped. She had been there to help me feed and change Harry so she knew exactly what it was going to be like when it was her turn.’ As Vickii’s due date drew closer Leanne did everything to talk her twin through the labour. Vickii (left) said: 'I think it's amazing that Leanne had labour sympathy pains for me. We have shared everything else together, so why not this?' Then on Sunday December 1, the twins’ closeness became clearer than ever when Leanne felt Vickii go into labour. Leanne said: ‘Vickii was three days overdue and we were sat in the living room together watching TV. ‘Suddenly I had the most horrendous pain ripping through my stomach. I told Vickii I was feeling ill and two minutes later she got up and hobbled into the bathroom. ‘I sat on my own rubbing my belly and Vickii shouted to me and asked me to go upstairs. I went into the bathroom and her waters had broken. I couldn’t believe it. It was like I had felt her labour pains. Vickii (left) and Leanne (right) want their children to attend the same school and hope to take them on holidays and days out together . ‘I continued to have the stomach pains while Vickii was in labour and nothing could seem to get rid of them. It’s as though I was sharing the labour with her. It just shows how connected we are.’ Vickii said: ‘Ava and Harry are definitely going to grow up to be best friends as well as cousins. ‘We really want them to go to the same school when they are older and we will definitely be having family holidays and days out together. ‘I think it’s amazing that Leanne had labour sympathy pains for me. We have shared everything else together, so why not this?’","Leanne Humphreys developed stomach cramps while watching TV .

Jayde Dinsdale, the teenager who collapsed and almost died after drinking cocktails of energy drinks and Jagermeister, now says she drank just four Jagerbombs, which she believes which triggered her three heart attacks. Speaking on ITV's This Morning, Jayde, 18, said that she had met up with friends after work earlier this year and had four cocktails in two hours. Jagerbombs, a mixture of caffeine-rich energy drinks and the German alcoholic spirit Jagermeister, have become extremely popular with young people who often knock them back in one shot. Scroll down for video . Jayde Dinsdale told This Morning how drinking energy drink cocktails caused her to collapse . Blonde Jayde, who was accompanied by her father Darryl, 38, told This Morning hosts Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that she had drank four of the cocktails in two hours and had felt 'absolutely fine. I went home, went to bed and felt perfectly normal.' However she did admit that she has no memory of the night or the following morning, saying: 'I'm relying on what everyone else has told me.' The next morning Jayde collapsed in the bathroom of the family home near Yeovil, Somerset. Said Darryl: 'I was downstairs in the kitchen and I heard a massive thump. Jayde's mum then screamed at me to get up there.' Jayde said she had gone to bed as normal. The next day she had three heart attacks . When he got upstairs, he discovered his daughter lying on the floor. 'She was purple,' he said. 'It was every parent's worst nightmare.' While Jayde's mum Natalie, 38, dialled 999, quick-thinking Darryl stayed calm and started pumping his daughter's chest in a desperate attempt to keep her alive. 'I've got to thank Vinnie Jones and those adverts he did with the tune 'Staying Alive,' said Darryl. 'It just clicked in my head and I just started doing it.' Later the paramedics who attended to Jayde told him that without his actions it would have been 'highly unlikely' that they would have been able to save her. Jayde's quick-thinking father Darryl performed CPR to the tune of 'Staying Alive' which probably saved her . Jayde, who had suffered two cardiac arrests on the bathroom floor, was taken to the intensive care unit at Yeovil District Hospital. She then had a third arrest and was then put in a 52-hour coma to protect her brain and heart. Her body was cooled to just 32 degrees to protect her brain and her family faced an agonising wait to see if she would recover. She then had to spend another three weeks in hospital and had an internal defibrillator fitted to get her heart started again in case she has another attack. Darryl, 38, said that he remembered the British Heart Foundation adverts in which Vinnie Jones does CPR . Darryl said it was a mystery as to why she had such a bad reaction to the drinks as she had previously drunk Jagerbombs with no bad effect, and had no reaction to other caffeinated drinks such as coffee before. 'We had no idea that this sort of thing could happen,' he said. This Morning's Dr Dawn Harper said that such a massive reactive to caffeine was 'thankfully very rare' but warned that 'caffeine is a stimulant, it can make you more alert and we say that you shouldn't really have more than 400mg in a 24-hour period [equivalent to around four cups of coffee]. Jayde and Darryl Dinsdale were joined by Dr Dawn Porter who said that people should watch their caffeine intake . 'Some energy drinks can have as much as 200mg in a can and you were clearly very sensitive to caffeine,' she told Jayde. She added that sometimes the labelling on energy drinks could be wrong, giving a misleading impression of how much caffeine they contained. Gavin Partingdon of the British Soft Drinks Association said that people should drink caffeinated drinks 'in moderation' and that they were not recommended for people with a sensitivity to caffeine. Football's tough guy Vinnie Jones demonstrates CPR in the British Heart Foundation advert . One in ten British teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week . High in sugar, cleverly . marketed and sold in supermarkets and shops alongside regular soft . drinks, it's easy to see why young people in their masses have taken to . energy drinks. Last year, a major study found our children have one of the highest consumption rates in Europe. One in ten British teenagers consumes four to five energy drinks a week. Worryingly, . younger children are following suit: one in four under-tens - 24 per . cent - has had at least one energy drink in the past year, compared with . the European average of 18 per cent. Now, experts are calling for them . to be banned from sale to youngsters. In . a paper last year, Dr Jack James, editor of the Journal of Caffeine . Research, says caffeine should be regulated just like cigarettes and . alcohol. 'Although caffeine . has been widely considered to be benign, awareness is increasing that . its consumption is associated with substantial harm, including . fatalities and near-fatalities,' he wrote. 'How many caffeine-related fatalities and near-misses must there be before we regulate?' In January month, a government adviser compared energy drinks with drugs, and urged schools to ban them. Some schools have done so, with many teachers complaining the drinks affect behaviour and concentration. And . a 2011 study in America reported on a number of cases where excessive . caffeine consumption in energy drinks had been associated with effects . such as 'seizures, mania, stroke and sudden death'. The . researchers warned that high caffeine drinks were particularly risky . for children with existing conditions such as heart arrhythmias, . diabetes or mood and behavioural disorders, which may be undiagnosed.","Jayde Dinsdale had THREE heart attacks after drinking with friends .

"By . Lucy Waterlow . PUBLISHED: . 10:57 EST, 10 March 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 11:33 EST, 10 March 2014 . A man who had a vasectomy long before meeting his second wife has revealed the devastating consequences his inability to have children had on his marriage. In a desperate bid to have a baby, his wife sought a sperm donor from 'unofficial channels' and ended up having an affair. She eventually conceived twice this way but her infidelity led to her having an abortion and then becoming a single parent. Marriage breakdown: Peter anonymously shared his story on today's This Morning . Her ex-husband appeared on today's This Morning to share his story but did not real his true identity and all names were changed. Peter recalled how he met his second wife, Rebecca, who was 'significantly younger' than him in 2004 when he was a divorcee in his sixties with a grown-up son. After his first divorce, he decided he did not want to have any more children and had a vasectomy. Rebecca was aware of the situation when they met and fell in love and said it wasn't an issue. They married in 2008 and then the situation changed. Rebecca, now in her mid-thirties, decided she did want to become a mother after all. 'It's very hard when you can't supply your wife with . the one thing she really wants' Peter explained to This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby: 'Her biological clock was ticking and . things changed, we were in love and in stable relationship it was the . natural next step. 'It's very hard when you can't supply your wife with . the one thing she really wants. It's a very hard thing to come to terms . with.' Peter said he looked into having his vasectomy reversed but was told there was 'no chance' because it had been carried out too long ago. The couple then discussed using a sperm donor but dismissed doing this via official channels. Peter explained: 'The problem with going through official channels is you have no . idea who the father will be and have no connection with them. Rebecca . wanted a junior version of myself.' Peter thought this meant the conversation was over so he was 'taken aback' in 2010 when Rebecca revealed she had found 'someone like me' after researching unregulated donor websites and had set up a meeting. 'I thought the . conversation was dead. I didn't know she was pursuing other avenues to get a . donor,' he said. 'She said she had been looking into it and had found someone. They had arranged to meet seven days later.' He added: 'We both took it for granted it would be artificial insemination, sex was never implied or spoken about.' Betrayed: He said he didn't know his wife's relationship with the sperm donor had become sexual . Peter agreed to escort Rebecca to met the donor, called Rhys, and took an instant dislike to him. 'I didn't like Rhys, it was his whole demeanor, he kept us waiting at the designated meeting place and then hardly acknowledged Rebecca,' he said. Peter said at no point did he consent to the pair having natural sex. After this meeting Rhys donated sperm for artificial insemination to Rebecca. But Peter said: 'That was the only time artificial insemination took place, the rest of the time it was sex.' Rebecca began visiting Rhys once a month when she was ovulating. Inevitably the situation began to have a detrimental effect on her marriage. Peter said he began to suspect her relationship with Rhys had become sexual but didn't find out for sure until they had a ""blazing row"". 'I was shocked but wasn't completely . surprised when she told me she was pregnant again, I had a strong . feeling she was still seeing Rhys' He recalled: 'I shouted at her, ""you might as well be having sex with him!"" and she said ""we are!""' When Rebecca then fell pregnant, Peter demanded she have an abortion or he would leave her. He admitted: 'She had the abortion which I regret, it was a terrible thing to ask woman to do but I wasn't thinking straight at the time.' After the abortion, Rebecca and Peter's relationship became beyond repair and he admitted they were living under the same roof but ""not living as a married couple"". Unbeknown to him, Rebecca resumed her affair with Rhys and fell pregnant again. By now, Peter said Rebecca was in love with Rhys and intended to divorce Peter and raise her child with him. He said: 'I was shocked but wasn't completely surprised when she told me she was pregnant again, I had a strong feeling she was still seeing Rhys.' But after Peter and Rebecca split up, Rhys wasn't interested in raising the child with her as she had hoped. Peter had a vasectomy years ago before meeting his second wife who was 30 years his junior . Instead, he claimed no responsibility as the father under the Human Fertilisation Embryology Act of 2008. He denied having a sexual relationship with Rebecca and said she had only ever received his sperm via artificial insemination. Rebecca launched legal proceedings taking her case to London’s High Court Family Division last July. Peter said: 'It was bought out through evidence that they had been having sex relationship for a number of months and he could not deny it in court under cross reference.' 'Motherhood for me has come at an extremely high price' It also transpired during the court proceedings that Rhys was a prolific sperm donor who had sired up to 30 children. He was registered on three different websites and had even advertised his services at 'male-dominated breeding orgies'. The judge on the case said Rhys had committed ""calculating betrayal and abashed dishonesty"" and had ""concealed his overall activities from recipients he entered into relationships"". But he added that Rebecca had also been ""untruthful, devious and manipulative."" Single mother: Rebecca aborted her first child with Rhys then kept the second - but he denied to take responsibility as the father (posed by model) The judge ruled that the baby had been conceived during a sexual relationship and as a result, Rhys was ""not only his biological father but also his legal parent."" Peter is now trying to get on with his life as a single man again after all the hurt and betrayal. Rebecca said in a statement read on This Morning: 'Motherhood for me has come at an extremely high price. I . have an adorable child who is my entire life however that has not compensated for the devastating and highly distressing events that . unfolded and will undoubtedly stay with me for a lifetime.' Meanwhile, Rhys added in a statement that he sees himself as the victim. He said: 'The husband was fully aware of his wife's . quest to conceive a child at no point did he intervene to say he did not . wish to go ahead, had he done so at any point we would not be in the . position we are now. The process has been destructive to me emotionally, personally and financially.'","Peter (not his real name) was divorcee with son when he met Rebecca .

'Literally from then on out, we eat exactly . the same bites of food and the same amount of drink to stay the same . weight, no matter what.' Their rule even applies to the drinks they choose when they go out and the pair carry a set of scales to measure food on the go. 'Whenever we have situations where we can't tell whether portions are even or not, we'll pull out the scales and weigh it,' explains Amy.

The deal floundered when Everton officials arrived in Spain to find the asking price had soared from around £12million to nearly £18m, and the 28-year old ended up joining City in the summer instead. Moyes also headed to Manchester, to replace Sir Alex Ferguson as manager, and was dismayed to discover United’s scouting network in southern Spain had allowed their City counterparts to outmanoeuvre them for both Negredo and lightning-quick winger Jesus Navas. Negredo revealed he was aware of Everton’s interest but insisted it was always his intention to see out the season with Sevilla before testing himself in the Barclays Premier League. Slide show: The Spaniard stretches to score his second in the hammering of West Ham at the Etihad . Home comforts: Negredo now has 15 goals in his last 15 appearances at the Etihad Stadium . Ruud Van Nistelrooy: 24Alvaro Negredo: 18Fernando Torres: 18Sergio Aguero: 17Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink: 14Didier Drogba: 12Thierry Henry: 10  Mario Balotelli: 10  Dennis Bergkamp: 10  Robin van Persie: 5 . ‘There were some rumours, but I just wanted to finish the season with Sevilla,’ he said. ‘I wanted to wait until it got to the summer before I started looking at other options. I never really considered the possibility of moving in January.’ Known affectionately as The Beast by Etihad fans, he has terrorised opposition defences all season and is now just one goal behind Sergio Aguero in City’s scoring charts. ‘I am in a great moment, but I hope to get even better,’ he said. ‘I need to get more goals and catch Sergio up quickly, because I know that when he comes back from injury, he will score plenty. Class act: Manuel Pellegrini was impressed with what he saw from his front man on Wednesday . Spanish steps: Negredo chose to stay with Sevilla last January, rather than head to Everton . ‘But, the way I am feeling and the way my game is going, I do feel this could be my best moment so far. This could be the best season of my career. I’m feeling comfortable, I score a lot of goals and hopefully I can make some assists. This is how I want to continue for the rest of my time here. The only real target, though, is to grow, to improve as a player and become better as I go along.’ United have their work cut out to make it an all-Manchester final, with their tie balanced on a knife-edge, but Negredo is unconcerned about who City will face. ‘At the moment, we just want to be sure of booking our place,’ he said. ‘Maybe the fans are all thinking about United, but as long as we are in it, I don’t mind. I’ve never been to Wembley before, so that is all that matters.’ Uphill task: Manchester United will go into the second leg of their Capital One Cup semi-final 2-1 down after a shambolic display at Sunderland on Tuesday, for whom Fabio Borini (right) scored the winner .","Everton were only prepared to pay £12m for Negredo so he stayed in Spain .

Tourists visiting Britain's capital may soon be able to dawdle for longer without upsetting the city's notoriously short-tempered drivers. London is road testing 'intelligent' pedestrian crossings designed to read the requirements of the crossing throngs and offer a safer way to get from A to B. Busy drivers will welcome the 'call cancel' technology, which cancels the traffic stop action if a pedestrian wanders off after pressing the button, while video cameras and sensors will automatically detect how many people are waiting as well as the speed of the crossing pedestrians. Safety first: TfL is road testing intelligent crossings that read the requirements of the pedestrian traffic . The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, and Transport for London (TfL) hope that the new pedestrian SCOOT (Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique) system will eventually help make it easier and safer for millions people to cross the road throughout the capital. The first trials of SCOOT will . take place on crossings outside busy Balham and Tooting Bec Underground . stations this summer. They are part of an ongoing road safety system in the city, including the recent Pedestrian Countdown technology which was successfully rolled out in 200 locations. Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: . 'I am delighted that London is the first city in the world to be . trialling this cutting-edge equipment, which will benefit pedestrians . across the city. The hi-tech systems will be trialled at two of London's busiest tube stations this summer . 'This . really is a fantastic example of how London is leading the way by using . 21st century technology to help make it easier for people to get around . our great city. 'Innovation like this is key to keeping London moving efficiently and making our roads safer for everyone to use.' TfL's Leon Daniels said of the crossings of the future: 'These new trials of pedestrian detection technology will allow our traffic signals to become even more intelligent, bringing huge benefits to those waiting to cross the road where there is heavy pedestrian demand.' Depending on the outcome of the summer trials TfL hopes to develop the technology to use at other busy pedestrian areas such as sporting venues and busy high streets.","Trials of new SCOOT road safety system to start in summer 2014 .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A pregnant woman who drove a minivan, with her three young children strapped inside it, into the ocean off a Florida beach has been charged with attempted murder. Ebony Wilkerson had her bail set at $1.2 million on Saturday and remained in custody after the shocking incident at Daytona Beach on Tuesday. A tourist filmed the dramatic rescue of Wilkerson's three children, aged 3, 9. and 10, as they cried for help as giant waves pounded their vehicle. Charges: Ebony Wilkerson arrives for her first court hearing after being arrested for three counts of attempted murder . Custody: Wilkerson, pictured in court Saturday, is being held on $1.2 million bail after being accused of trying to kill her children . The children had lowered the windows to . scream for help, and the oldest child could be seen trying to wrest . control of the steering wheel from her mother, investigators said. Arrest: Ebony Wilkerson, 32, faces attempted murder and child abuse charges . Wilkerson got out of the . van and allegedly tried to block a beach safety officer from getting to the . children, a witness told investigators. The 32-year-old from South Carolina has been charged with three counts of first-degree attempted murder and three counts of child abuse. According to an arrest affidavit, she had arrived in Florida three days before the incident, and was trying to escape an abusive marriage. The children told investigators their mother had been acting 'crazy' since they arrived in Florida, and Wilkerson's sister tried twice to get mental health treatment for her the day before she drove the van into the water, the affidavit said. Officers from Daytona Beach Police, who evaluated Wilkerson before the incident, decided that she did not qualify for involuntary mental health confinement, the affidavit said. Her children are currently in state custody. Good Samaritans and lifeguards had come to their aid, rushing into the Atlantic to remove them from the vehicle as it filled with water. In . response to questions about Wilkerson’s mental state, Volusia County Sheriff Ben Johnson . stated on Friday that investigators have found no information suggesting . that the suspect was suffering from any psychiatric or emotional issues. Johnson . explained that the decision to charge Wilkerson in connection to the . incident was based on several factors, including interviews with . witnesses and the woman’s children, who told deputies that their . mother drove the minivan straight into the surf. Scroll down for videos . Rescue: The dramatic moment the children were plucked to safety was filmed by Simon Besner . Race against time: The rescuers managed to grab all the children from the car as it was submerged in the surf . Johnson added that when questioned by police, Wilkerson claimed that she had tried to drive out of the ocean, but eyewitnesses insisted that she was going in the opposite direction and then tried to hamper the rescue efforts, suggesting intent to kill them. ‘She tried to stop one of the beach rangers from getting into the window,’ Johnson said. The sheriff also revealed that Wilkerson's young son tried to fight his mother in a bid to gain control of the steering wheel. ‘She actually told them, ""close their eyes and go to sleep, mama's taking him to a better place,""' the law enforcement official said. Wilkerson, who is 28 weeks' pregnant with her fourth child, was described by officials as calm, cooperative and 'very lucid'. Update: Sheriff Johnson, right,  with investigator Sgt. Richard Forton, center, make a statement about the incident . Wilkerson was stopped in her vehicle by police officers two hours before she . drove into the ocean. Her sister called police after becoming worried because Wilkerson . had been talking about demons. The officers found her lucid and let her go, Police Chief Mike Chitwood said. According . to Wilkerson's sister, Jessica Harrell, the 32-year-old woman was . trying to escape from an abusive spouse when she drove from her home in . South Carolina to stay with her in Florida. 'Her . husband beat on her, so she came down to my house from South Carolina,' Jessica Harrell said in a call to a 911 dispatcher just hours before . Wilkerson drove her minivan into the . surf. Harrell, 28, asked the . operator to send officers to perform a welfare check because her . sibling appeared emotionally distraught. 'She's . talking about Jesus, that there are demons in my house, that I'm trying . to control her, but I'm trying to keep them safe,' Harrell said on the . call. The woman revealed that she made an attempt to take Wilkerson to a hospital the day before, but the 32-year-old left. Unstable: The pregnant South Carolina woman who drove the minivan carrying her three young children into the ocean surf had talked about demons before leaving the house . Safe: A lifeguard carries one of the three children rescued from the minivan . Frantic: Stacy Robinson, left, ran into the water and carried the two older children out of the surf . When . officers caught up with Wilkerson and interviewed her, the woman . allegedly told them that she was heading to a shelter for abused women. She also added that she was going to her ‘safe place'. Wilkerson . was let go because she did not meet the criteria to be detained under . the Florida Mental Health Act, which allows people to be involuntarily . committed if they appear to present a danger to themselves. In the 911 call, Harrell said that she had tried to take her sister to a shelter, but it had no vacancies. Police in Myrtle Beach said Wilkerson filed a domestic violence report March 1, accusing her husband of sexually assaulting her. Court records uncovered by the Post and Courier indicate that Wilkerson was married to Lutful Ronjon, 31, of Cross, who was arrested in May 2005 on domestic battery charges. The report stated that Ronjon beat up his wife during an argument about receipts while the couple were vacationing in Myrtle Beach. The battery charge was later dismissed after Ronjon underwent a domestic violence pre-trial service program. The Post and Courier in Charleston also found that Wilkerson was involved in a deadly crash in Delray in February 2007. On . the day of the accident, Wilkerson was going northbound on Interstate . 95 when she switched lanes and slammed into the rear of a Nissan driven by Douglas Krane, of Fort Lauderdale. Dramatic: Lifeguards and passersby try to secure the vehicle as waves crash around it . The . impact sent Krane's car skidding across the road and into a concrete . barrier. The driver's wife, Jennifer, suffered critical injuries in the . collision and died several days later. Wilkerson . was cited for improper lane change, lost her license for a year and was . ordered to serve 132 hours of community service, according to court . records. In video of the rescue at the beach this week, taken by Simon Besner, a . tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards . try to pull her children from the vehicle. Witnesses . described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children . remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her . under the van. 'It was a bit terrifying,' Besner said. In the video, several men frantically . try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's . side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan. The small child is eventually pulled to safety. Another tourist described watching with horror. Help: The woman's sister called police and . warned them that she was talking about demons, prompting them to do a . welfare check but they released her because she was lucid . 'My . friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the . beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin . visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6. 'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.'

White House pastry chef Bill Yosses is quitting, and partially blames first Lady Michelle Obama's focus on 'healthier' eating. Former first lady Laura Bush hired Yosses in 2007, but the Obamas brought a new attitude in 2009 that often frowns on fatty, decadent desserts. 'I don't want to demonize cream, butter, sugar and eggs,' he told The New York Times, quipping that leaving the plum White House job was a 'bittersweet decision.' Scroll down for video . White House pastry chef Bill Yosses has been dogged by the healthier-eating preferences of first lady Michelle Obama since 2009, so he's packing up his pastry knives and leaving . Gone are the days of full-fat, traditional desserts like those featured in the Bush White House -- including the traditional iced Christmas gingerbread house . Hail to the Eggplant: The first lady has championed healthy eating, especially for children . The Daily Caller noted that while the famed New York restaurant pâtissier has been replacing butter with fruit puree, and using honey and agave nectar instead of sugar, he was never fully on-board with changing how he made tarts, cakes, sugar sculptures and other yummies. His masterpieces have been the subject of Bon Appetit-worthy photography whenever foreign dignitaries visit the U.S. for State Dinners, but Michelle Obama's policies of encouraging 'food literacy' apparently denied his craft most-favored-nation status. Yosses has even pared back on baking breakfast doughnuts, sometimes replacing them with smoothies made from apples, kale, spinach and ginger. The Times reported Tuesday that when the Obamas moved in, he was instructed to make fewer indulgent treats, produce them in smaller portions, and serve them less often to the first family. President Obama refers to him as 'the crustmaster,' but his signature work has been featured less and less. 'For special, nostalgic occasions, we still make 20 percent traditional desserts,' Yosses said. 'Coconut cake with seven-minute frosting, lemon steamed pudding with layers of custard, mousse and cake, sticky toffee pudding, and every kind of chocolate dessert possible.' Dessert or Yarn Barn sampler? For a State Dinner honoring French President Francois Hollande, Yosses made not lady fingers but Vermont maple syrup fudge, lavender shortbread cookies and cotton candy dusted with orange zest . Tiny cookies: Mrs. Obama has pushed for smaller dessert portions during official White House dinner events . But the 20 percent solution won't cut it anymore. Mrs. Obama said in a statement that she is 'grateful to him for his outstanding work, not just as the White House pastry chef, producing the most delectable creations for everything from birthday celebrations to state visits, but also as a key partner helping us get the White House kitchen garden off the ground and building a healthier future for our next generation.' The 'Let's Move!' initiative has urged parents to give healthier habits to their children -- including changes in eating -- but more than 1 million schoolchildren have stopped buying school lunches since her directives changed what lunch ladies serve nationwide . Some of her activism has rubbed off on Yosses. He's moving back to New York City in June to be with his husband and start educating children and adults about eating better – a mostly losing battle, as nanny-state Mayor Michael Bloomberg found out during his years in Gracie Mansion. During a public forum on Google+ in November, he hinted that the president is more fond of pie crusts than with what's inside. 'Well, I don't want to reveal too much about the president's tastes or speculate about them,' he said. 'But, really, my impression is if you just served the crust, he'd be OK.' Yosses contributed to an article in the book Desserts For Dummies titled 'How to salvage a dessert disaster,' writing about some of the 'cosmetic surgery' that he's had to perform over the years when his creations flopped in the kitchen. For cakes that emerge from baking pans with holes in their sides, he says, ''before covering these problem areas with frosting, try picking cake remnants from the pan and reassembling and reattaching them to the sides of the cake.' If parts of the edge of your pie fall off, 'use jam to glue the broken pieces back on.' And for sponge cakes that won't stay in one well-shaped chunk, 'use the broken pieces to make English trifle or an improvised strawberry shortcake.' The book doesn't mention kale smoothies.","Bill Yosses has been baking fewer breakfast doughnuts, sometimes replacing them with apple, kale, spinach and ginger smoothies .

A reality show insider told MailOnline the 28-year-old model applied to star as a mentor alongside Naomi Campbell on the upcoming second season of the British show, but was rejected. The source claimed she was 'nightmare' and 'disrespectful'  while filming the Australian series in the franchise. But Trunfio has hit back at the allegations of her bad behaviour, saying: 'My experience on The Face has been so positive and I thank Naomi for the opportunity.' Scroll down for video . Branded a nightmare: Producers of The Face UK have reportedly refused to cast Nicole Trunfio as a mentor on the second series of the popular modelling show after they heard of her rude and disrespectful behaviour on the Australian set . Controversial: A source close to the producers claim the 28-year-old model was demanding and difficult to work with while filming the debut series of The Face Australia . Nicole addressed the revelation she has her eye on a role on the Face UK, adding: 'I don't see myself doing more of the show in other markets but if Naomi thought I was right for any of her markets, of course I would consider it.' Mark Fennessy CEO of Shine, the production company which makes the show rushed to Trunfio's defence saying the allegations the model was difficult to work with were untrue: 'On behalf of everyone at Shine we are shocked and appalled at these comments - they are 100 per cent totally incorrect.' He added: 'On behalf of the production I can tell you she (Nicole) is a delightful, professional, a sweet girl that turned up on time everyday and was incredibly professional. A nicer person you could not meet.' The insider claimed to MailOnline Trunfio had demonstrated what was considered a bad attitude on the program which had alienated not only her fellow mentors Naomi Campbell and Cheyenne Tozzi, but also the crew and the contestants. Not concerned: Trunfio showed she was relaxed and happy in a picture on Instagram on Thursday as she had her hair and make up done . The source said: 'She was an absolute nightmare and was incredibly disrespectful. The source claimed the situation was so bad even Trunfio's fellow mentors didn't want to spend time with the model. 'Naomi . and Cheyenne kept well away from her, and even the models Nicole was . supposed to mentor did not want to engage - they were willing to risk . losing the competition just so they didn't have to be around her!'

Still got her appetite: The model posted an Instagram pic of herself enjoying dinner and a glass of wine on Wednesday night as she shrugged off rumours of a rift with her fellow mentors . She said: 'At the moment, I am concentrating on the Australian show and many projects including Trunfio Universe, my fine jewelry line. 'I don't see myself doing more of the show in other markets but if Naomi thought I was right for any of her markets, of course I would consider it.' Fennessy said he had not spoken to anyone from the UK regarding Nicole's performance on The Face Australia. He said: 'I have spoken with nobody in the UK and no one at Shine UK has contacted us with a steer on Nicole.’ The Shine CEO also said he knew of no feud between Naomi and Nicole: 'Not as far as I'm aware. In the heat of battle and amidst competition you are going to find there will be moments of tension. Effortlessly cool: The Australian model wore a cropped white blouse and black Toni Maticevski skirt for her journey to Western Australia on Tuesday . 'Naomi is a real competitor - she has been exactly the same in the UK and US productions, so there is nothing untowards about that. The thing is Nicole soldiered on and was very graceful under fire. 'That is all part and parcel of the competition as far as I am aware - they leave it all at the door and they have a quite a cordial and professional relationship outside of that. 'I don't think they are best friends, but not too many people are best friends with Naomi after working with her.' A US spokesperson for told MailOnline the claims about The Face UK and the model's behaviour 'sound like nonsense'. Confrontation: The Perth born model and Naomi Campbell began fighting in the first episode of the season after they both wanted to mentor a young model . Nicole has been hitting the promotional circuit in the last week for the Fox8 show, and flew from Sydney to Perth on Tuesday, despite suffering excrutiating stomach pains and a trip to hospital. She seems to have taken the catty remarks regarding her performance in her stride - on Wednesday night she posted a picture of herself on Instagram enjoying dinner and a glass of wine while clutching a rose. Then on Thursday she demonstrated she was calm and relaxed while getting her hair and make up done for a photo shoot in a picture she put on social media.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Snowboarder Vic Wild, a native of Wild Salmon, Washington, took home two gold medals in Sochi this week – only he did it for Russia rather than Team USA. American by birth, Russian by marriage and by choice, Wild completed a historic sweep of the Olympic snowboard parallel slalom events to give his adopted country a boost in the race to top the medals table. Wild edged Zan Kosir of Slovenia by 0.11 seconds in Saturday's parallel slalom final to win his second gold medal of the games. Couple of winners: American-born snowboarder Vic Wild (left) won two medals for his adoptive country of Russia, along with his wife, Alena Zavarzina, who took home a bronze Wednesday . Champion: Wild, 27, won a total of two gold medals on Wednesday (left) and Saturday (right) Close shave: Wild edged Zan Kosir of Slovenia by 0.11 seconds in Saturday's parallel slalom final to win his second gold medal of the games . The victory capped a remarkable four days for the guy from White Salmon, who is married to Russian snowboarder Alena Zavarzina and earlier won gold in parallel giant slalom. Wild’s Wednesday triumph was all the sweeter since he took home his first gold medal just minutes after his better half won a bronze. Zavarzina was unable to see his run and had to check with the media before discovering that there was an Olympic champion in the family. ‘He deserves it, he's worked so hard,’ she said. ‘He's so far from his home town and he had to switch countries. ‘He has to deal with the Russian mentality, with stuff he's not used to, working with people who don't understand him most of the time. ‘I'm very happy. I'm going to cry right now.’ As the Beach Boys’ hit ‘Good Vibrations’ played over the loud speakers following his win over Swiss Nevin Galmarini, Wild wrapped himself in a Russian flag handed to him by Zavarzina. International love: Wild married Zavarzina (left), a Moscow native, in 2011 after a three-year courtship and switched his allegiance to Russia . Different red white, and blue: Frustrated by what he saw as a lack of funding from the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Association, Wild praised his adoptive country for giving him a chance to win medals . ‘It's incredible to win it along with Alena, for us to both have success on the same day is truly incredible,’ Wild told reporters. ‘I don't know how this happened, it's too good to be true, I might wake up soon. It feels like a dream.’Wild added, ‘I'm so stoked to win it for Russia, those people out there were rooting so hard, it feels awesome.’ The 27-year-old narrowly escaped the semifinals in Saturday's parallel slalom. He lost an edge in the first heat and trailed Benjamin Karl of Austria by 1.12 seconds heading into the deciding race. Wild somehow made up the difference during a frantic sprint down Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, stretching his hand across the finish line first to win by inches. The final wasn't drama-free either. Wild took a .12 lead over Kosir - who earned bronze in the PGS - after the first run and held the Slovenian snowboarder at bay in the final. Wild thrust his arms into the air in triumph while the decidedly pro-Russian crowd chanted ‘Vitya.’ ‘This right here, two golds, this puts him in a whole different stratosphere,’ said Wild's brother, Mike. ‘He'll go down in history. This is what it's all about.’ And it further validated Wild's decision to marry Zavarzina, a Moscow native, in 2011. Culture shock: For an American from a small Washington state town, adjusting to a life in Moscow has been an uphill battle made more difficult due to a language barrier . The two friends became romantically involved in 2009 before being wed nearly three years ago. Wild saw it as a chance not only to be with the woman he loves, but also to become a member of a nascent Russian snowboarding team looking to make splash in Sochi. Frustrated by what he saw as a lack of funding from the U.S. Ski & Snowboard Association, Wild has blossomed after trading the Stars & Stripes for a different kind of red, white and blue. ‘Russia is the country that's given me the opportunity to win a medal. If I was still riding for the USA, I'd be back home with perhaps some mediocre job doing something mediocre,’ Wild said after winning his first gold medal earlier this week. He placed third at the world championships last year and was easily the best snowboarder in his sport's answer to Alpine skiing. The victories are also worth about $250,000 to Wild and his wife. Zavarzina didn't make it out of first round of elimination Saturday, but it hardly mattered. Their windfall at the Extreme Park means maybe they can move out of the 300-square foot apartment they share in Moscow. Reflecting back on his roller-coaster ride of a career in snowboarding, Wild told reporters Wednesday his path was not for everyone. Wildcard: Russia's Vic Wild celebrates winning the men's parallel slalom snowboard finals at the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games in Rosa Khutor February 22 . Harsh words: Wild told reporters that had he stayed in US, he probably would have been stuck in a 'mediocre job and doing something mediocre' Frenemies: Wild admitted that some of his Russian team mates were not delighted by his arrival, but still helped him adjust . ‘All my friends, they understand,’ he said of his former U.S. team mates. ‘They've seen me at my lows, they know that it was very important for me - my entire life - that I make this switch and that I give it one more shot. ‘If I hadn't done this, I think I'd always be wondering, “what if?” You don't want to live your life like that,’ he said. Wild and 24-year-old Zavarazina met in 2009 and were married in July 2011. They celebrated what Wild called a ‘full-on Siberian wedding in Novosibirsk. The American expat admitted that he did not understand much of what was said during the ceremony. ‘It was probably more stressful than today. It was the most stressful day of my life,’ he said, smiling. ‘I was walking into one building, thinking to myself, “Dude, you are way too far from home to run!”’ Moving to Moscow has also been something of a culture shock for the young man from a small northwestern town of just over 2,000. Big plans: Wild revealed that he intends to snowboard for another four years, and to learn his new language properly . ‘Moving to the big city was hard for me, for sure. The first couple of months I was quite depressed, but once I started learning how to enjoy Moscow, life's actually been a lot better,’ he said. Wild indicated that some of his Russian team mates were not delighted by his arrival. ‘My team mates helped me so much,’ he said wryly. ‘I don't think many of them like me so much but I really appreciate it.’ Wild revealed that he plans to snowboard for another four years, and to learn his new language properly. ‘I'm very focused on snowboard and training, and I haven't put in the time I need to for really speaking. I can get around and do simple stuff, but I'm not a Russian speaker,’ he said.","Vic Wild, 27, married Russian snowboarded Alena Zavarzina, 24, in 2001 .

"By . Ted Thornhill . When police arrested 60-year-old Judy Lynn Hayman at her San Diego home last month they thought they had finally captured someone who had been on the run from the law since 1977. But police have been left red-faced after it emerged that Hayman had been told by a California court in 1982 that she was a free woman. Hayman had escaped from a prison in Ypsilanti 37 years ago after serving eight months of an 18-to-24-month sentence for stealing clothes from a Detroit store. Scroll down for video . Error: Judy Lynn Hayman (pictured left in a 1976 police mugshot) was arrested in February as police thought she'd been a fugitive since 1977. She's pictured right at her subsequent court appearance . She legally changed her name to Jamie Lewis in 1983 and had been living in San Diego for several years. She . was arrested on February 4 after a Michigan Corrections Department . officer who was stuck at his desk because of bad weather pulled her . fingerprints and sent them to the FBI and other police agencies, thinking she was still wanted. After . the officer discovered the prints matched those of a woman living in . San Diego under a different name, he sent an investigator to California . and she was arrested. However, Hayman’s defence attorney, Lisa Damiani, submitted documents showing Hayman's prison sentence was suspended in 1982 after she'd surrendered. Deputy . District Attorney Richard Madruga asked the judge to dismiss the . fugitive charge after a Michigan judge confirmed that Hayman had indeed . been sentenced to time served. Hide out: Hayman, 60, was arrested at this gated community in San Diego . Escape: Hayman was serving a sentence for larceny when she ran away from this Huron Valley prison in 1977 . Neighbors . at her apartment complex blocks at Balboa Park . said she'd lived in the building for almost seven years. Her next-door neighbor told The Associated Press after her arrest that Hayman was a ‘quiet loner but basically a nice person.’ Theresa Padilla said Hayman spent most of . her time indoors, except when she walked her chihuahua, Monty, who was . old and had to be put down less than a year ago. Hayman . had photos of three sons on her wall, and at least one of them visited . often, taking out her trash and doing other chores, Ms Padilla said, . adding: 'Her three boys seemed like they were raised well.' Ms Padilla said Hayman didn't appear to be married or have a job. She said . she and Hayman spoke infrequently but did share their experiences in . battling cancer. Hayman also mentioned living in Detroit and being a fan . of Michigan basketball teams. One of her sons was visiting her when she was taken into custody, police said, and had no idea she was considered a fugitive. The . officer who found Hayman’s fingerprints, Lieutenant Charles Levens of . the Michigan Corrections Department, explained earlier that many police agencies . had fingerprints that matched hers, but under different names. He gave the information to an investigator, Tim Hardville, who tracked her down in San Diego. 'I . said, ‘Tim, you're going to get your girl here’,' Lieutenant Levens . said.

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . A woman who suffered six miscarriages has finally given birth to a baby girl - thanks to egg yolk. Lorraine Donakey, 23, from Liverpool, suffered six miscarriages in as many years before almost abandoning hope completely that she would ever have a baby. But thanks to pioneering treatment involving injecting egg yolk into her system, Ms Donakey has now successfully gave birth to Lulu-Rose. Lorraine Donakey, 23, gave birth to a healthy daughter - Lulu-Rose - after suffering six miscarriages in six years . Ms Donakey, who has a degree in forensic psychology, said: 'Finally having her in my arms is indescribable. When she was born I cried my eyes out. 'Every time I got pregnant I thought it would be different. I spent thousands on baby clothes and equipment for six babies that were never born. 'It was to the point where people wouldn’t dare tell me they were pregnant because they didn’t want to upset me. I didn’t find out about my brother’s baby until it was four months old. 'Even with the treatment I barely believed that my baby would make it, it was always ""if"" she made it. Ms Donakey was told her miscarriages were caused by 'killer cells' in her body attacking the embryos . Ms Donakey had pioneering egg yolk treatment which involved injecting her with a solution containing egg yolk to suppress the 'killer cells' and allow Lulu-Rose to develop . 'Now I’ve got Lulu-Rose I feel so lucky. She’s already spoiled rotten.' Ms Donakey suffered . her first miscarriage when she was just 17 and studying for her A . Levels. She found out just hours before her exams that she had lost the . baby. The treatment is given to suppress natural killer (NK) cells in a woman's body, the theory being that some women’s bodies are non-baby-friendly and their immune system attacks the embryo as if it were a foreign body. Intralipids — a mix of soya-bean oil, egg yolk, glycerine and water — are a fat emulsion used as a source of calories and essential fatty acids for post-operative patients and premature babies requiring nutrition into their bloodstream. They have also been found to have an immuno-suppressant effect. The theory is that the intralipids have a stabilising effect on cell membranes, which makes it harder for the killer cells to attack and go on to cause implantation failure and miscarriage. The fats are highly calorific — about 200 calories a dose, the equivalent of a Snickers bar — and have been likened to ‘getting an armful of mayonnaise’. Administered via a drip usually twice before conception, and then three more times after, the treatment is thought to help the embryo implant and grow normally. Alongside this, women are also recommended to take steroids, which further suppress the immune system, and blood thinners to prevent blood clots, which also can impede embryos implanting. She said: 'I became . pregnant by accident, but by the time I had a miscarriage I had come . round to the idea of having a baby. I was devastated. 'Then I knew I wanted to be a mum and was determined to keep trying for a baby. 'But . it always ended in heartbreak. The consultant at the hospital told me . the hardest part of having a baby was getting pregnant, but I could do . that bit, I just couldn’t keep the baby. 'When . I went to the hospital each time it was like they knew me. Ann-Marie, . my nurse, was fantastic. It was like she was going through it with me. 'But as time went on and I began to hate my body for what it was doing to me and my babies.' After hearing about a new treatment available privately, desperate Ms Donakey turned to the internet to find out more. There . she found out about Rafet Gazvani, a fertility specialist at Liverpool . Women’s Hospital, who was offering the pioneering treatment. Ms Donakey underwent a womb biopsy and was told the reason she kept miscarrying was because of ‘killer cells’ that kept attacking the embryo. She was treated using intralipid liquid, a mix of egg yolks and saline solution, which suppresses the 'killer cells' and allows the baby to grow. She said: 'We had to pay to have the treatment privately. Luckily, my mum was able to help out and she put the costs onto her credit cards. 'With the other babies, I started preparing for their arrival. I probably spent thousands on clothes and things, but I didn’t dare with Lulu-Rose. 'Even on the way to be induced I still kept saying if the baby comes, it was never when. Ms Donakey says that during her pregnancy with Lulu-Rose she was terrified of suffering another miscarriage so she took lots of vitamin supplements and avoided exercise . 'I didn’t exercise and I took vitamins every day - I would line them up in the morning.' Thankfully the treatment was successful and Lulu-Rose was born at  weighing 4lbs 14ozs on January 17 this year. She said: 'Having six miscarriages definitely takes its toll, on my body and my mind. 'But I know I want more than one baby and now I know the treatment works. 'I want other women to know that this treatment is available, maybe it can work for them too.'","Lorraine Donakey, 23, had six miscarriages in six years .

"By . Dan Bloom . A trainee medical negligence lawyer locked her dog in her kitchen for a week until it starved to death. Katy Gammon abandoned five-year-old boxer Roxy while she stayed with her mother, leaving the dog to spend six days clawing at the door until it went blind, slipped into a coma and died. When the 27-year-old returned a week later the stench through her letterbox was so strong she could not face going inside - so returned to her mother for another nine weeks. Roxy was only discovered when a neighbour saw a swarm of flies at the kitchen window, and was so decomposed an RSPCA inspector had to scrape her body off the floor with a shovel. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video . Horrific: Roxy the five-year-old boxer died a long, painful death after being locked in the kitchen by trainee medical negligence solicitor Katy Gammon, 27. She was only found when a neighbour saw swarms of flies . Decomposed: The dog was infested with maggots after Gammon smelled the decomposing body and refused to enter the house for another nine weeks after Roxy's death. It is one of the worst cases the RSPCA has faced . No explanation: When the RSPCA showed Gammon, pictured leaving Bristol Magistrates' Court, the horrific photographs of her dog's body she told the inspector: 'I don't know what you want me to say' The animal welfare charity, which prosecuted Gammon, described the case as one of the worst it has ever dealt with. Gammon, who was a trainee solicitor with the Bristol legal firm Lyons Davidson, is facing jail after she admitted two animal cruelty charges today at Bristol Magistrates' Court. A Lyons Davidson spokesman said she no longer works for the firm. Shock: The RSCPA released photos of the dog's body to show the gravity of Gammon's crimes . Magistrates heard Gammon . had started staying with her mother's home nearby and initially began . returning to feed Roxy. When she dislocated her knee, she was unable to get to the house and claimed her ex-boyfriend was feeding the animal. But that was a lie, the court heard. Gammon did not check on the dog for a week and had tied a rope to the handle of the kitchen door, fixing the other end to a hook in her hallway so it could not be opened. Left without food and water Roxy clawed frantically at the . door, leaving fragments on the floor, as she tried in vain to escape. A vet said Roxy would have taken up to . six days to die in horrific conditions and in severe pain, first becoming blind and falling . into a coma before finally passing away. Finally, on November 3 last year, a neighbour alerted police after seeing swarms of flies through the kitchen window. Police arrived and were greeted by a strong smell of decomposition and the kitchen still closed with the rope. They called the RSPCA and the remains of Roxy were removed for a post mortem. Horrified RSPCA inspector Chris James had to remove the dog's body with a shovel. He said a . stream of maggots had crawled from the kitchen down the hallway - to . where there were tins of dog food on a table. Offender: Gammon, who the court heard was sorry for her actions, pleaded guilty before Bristol magistrates . Gammon . was interviewed and admitted leaving Roxy for a week before going back . to check on her, when she found a stench coming from her home. She . told RSPCA Inspector Miranda Albinson she had looked through the . letterbox and been greeted by a smell so awful she couldn't bear to go . into the house. Gammon said: 'I assumed she was dead - I never went back.' Insp . Albinson asked her: 'You deliberately locked her in the kitchen and . left her for a week to die, that correct?' 'Psychiatric issues': A report is being prepared on Gammon before she is sentenced . Gammon replied: 'Yes, . basically.' When shown photographs of the scene Gammon added: 'I don't know what you want me to say.' Gammon pleaded guilty to one count of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal, and another of failing to prevent causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. The two offences each carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison and possible fines of £20,000. Joanna Lyons, defending, said Gammon now had 'genuine remorse' for the suffering she had caused and was 'absolutely mortified'. She said Gammon appeared to have 'some psychiatric issues' and asked for sentencing to be adjourned for the preparing of a report. Gammon was freed on unconditional bail to be sentenced at the same court on April 9. Chairman of the Bench Patricia Lee told her: 'This is a very serious offence - so serious that there's no way we can sentence today. 'We need a full report about you and your circumstances and everything about you.' Gammon, who had hobbled into court on crutches wearing a grey trouser suit and white shirt, did not comment outside court. Insp Albinson said after the case: 'This is one of the worst cases we have ever come across. 'The police who attended the scene were genuinely upset by it and they investigate murders. 'She showed no remorse whatsoever in interview. It is difficult to understand.' Today a spokesman for Lyons Davidson law firm yesterday said Gammon no longer worked for the company but would not say when she left. Her entry on the company's website yesterday described her as a paralegal with a law degree and said she had completed a legal practice course. It added: 'She runs a wide-ranging caseload investigating claims concerning failed surgery, delays in diagnosis. dental claims and infection cases.'","Katy Gammon, 27, tied Roxy up and left home for a week .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A boy with disabilities in Michigan who said he didn't want an 11th birthday party because he had no friends got the surprise of his life on Tuesday when players from his local ice hockey team showed up to offer him a special deal. Colin and his family were enjoying pizza when several players and coaches from the Kalamazoo Wings appeared and presented him with a special one-day contract that will allow him to join the team for their home game at Wings Stadium on Sunday. The contract, which is the first one-day . deal the team has ever offered, will give Colin the opportunity to get . his own jersey, drop the game puck and even sit on the bench with the . players, among other activities. Colin, 11, got the surprise of his life on Tuesday when players from the Kalamazoo Wings appeared and presented him with a special one-day contract that will allow him to join the team on Sunday . ‘I was not expecting this,’ Colin told the Kalamazoo Gazette. ‘I knew we were going to the restaurant, but I was not expecting the rest.’ It all came about about Colin's mother, Jennifer, who asked that her last name not be used, started a Facebook page for her son after she asked him what he wanted to do for his 11th birthday, which was on March 9. Colin, a 5th grader at Gull Lake Community Schools, said he didn't want a party because he didn't have any friends. He suffers from a sensory processing . disorder and another disorder similar to Asperger syndrome which cause . him to struggle with facial expressions, verbal cues and in some social . situations. Colin reads his contact which will give him the opportunity to get his own jersey, drop the game puck and even sit on the bench with the players . Colin's disabilities mean that social skills aren't easy for him and he often acts out in school. He typically eats lunch alone everyday because no one will sit with him. His mom decided to start the Facebook page as a way to boost Colin's confidence.

"By . Nathan Klein . An Australian family which fought tirelessly for nine months to save their pet from death row says the ending is 'bittersweet' after the dog was released from the pound - but forced to relocate more than 1200 kilometres from home. After a long and expensive battle with authorities, and a groundswell of public support via an incredible social media campaign, Zeus, an American Pit Bull whose breed is considered dangerous in Queensland, was finally freed on Wednesday. And despite a huge and emotional sigh of relief from his owner Sinaed Cuff, Zeus is unable to spend the rest of his life with the family that loves him, a strict condition of his release. Lucky to be alive: Zeus the dog was sentenced to death for being a restricted breed in Queensland, Australia, but thanks to a campaign to save him he will instead be relocated to the Australian Capital Territory, some 1200km away from home . Ms Cuff said her dog was captured by the Brisbane City Council after he was found by rangers 'wandering at large' when he escaped their backyard last year. The family expected to have Zeus returned and to pay a fine. Instead, the council instead issued a destruction order for Zeus - declaring he was part American Pit Bull, a restricted breed in the state of Queensland. His family had adopted him just seven months prior to his capture, but believed him to be a labrador/Staffordshire terrier cross. After a long search for a vet willing to independently assess Zeus’ breed, he was named as 'a crossbred entire male dog' who 'appears to have the physical characteristics more of an American Staffordshire Terrier than any other breed'. The veterinarian’s certificate should have secured the dog’s immediate release but the council stood by their classification of Zeus as a Pit Bull, which was later supported by a Council-engaged assessor. The matter was then taken to court in January thanks to the Barristers Animal Welfare Panel, who found a legal team willing to fight pro bono, but later adjourned to enable the parties to explore the option of re-homing Zeus outside the Brisbane City Council’s jurisdiction. Stressed out: Zeus was forced to live in Brisbane City Council's pound for nine months while his owners fought a destruction order in the courts . In addition to fighting the death penalty, the family also was required to pay an impoundment bill of nearly $30 per day, which now totals more than $4500. But thanks to fundraising efforts from Bark Queensland and Sydney-based advocacy group Team Dog, those costs were covered in full. Team Dog's founding member Melanie Isaacs said she launched a social media campaign called 'Free Zeus' after hearing of the family's fight and the financial dilemma that might have prevented them getting Zeus back. Within hours of launching the campaign last Friday, Ms Isaacs said donations to help the family had totalled more than $2000 - well more than the $1500 required. Ms Isaacs said determining a dog's breed could be problematic, if not impossible. 'We don't know for sure if Zeus is a Pit Bull or not, it's impossible to tell the breed of a dog or find out if he has any Pit Bull in him. 'That's the biggest flaw with breed-specific legislation.' As a puppy, Zeus was a playful and energetic dog and his owners hope he will be just as happy in his new home . The council had told Zeus's owners they would release the pet if they satisfied a range of requirements, which Ms Isaacs said they did, and paid the impoundment costs. However, Ms Isaacs said officers inexplicably changed their minds that same afternoon, deciding to keep Zeus until the next scheduled court hearing in April. But after the fees and documentation was provided, the council finally chose to release Zeus on Wednesday - on the condition he be sent to the Australian Capital Territory, more than 1200km away from his home. Ms Isaacs said relocating Zeus to the ACT was their only viable option, with the territory the only place in Australia where the breed was not deemed illegal. 'It's a bittersweet ending, I guess,' Ms Isaacs said. 'The family is really happy because they thought Zeus was going to be put to sleep, and now he has a really loving home to go to.' Despite being on death row, Zeus was treated to a lot of cuddles and attention while in the pound . Ms Cuff said saying goodbye was the hardest thing she's ever had to do. 'It's hard to see the silver lining the day after saying my goodbyes with a night full of tears and mixed emotions, but yesterday was a beautiful sight...he was so happy and so curious with all his forgotten surroundings,' she said. 'We all just need to try and keep our minds set on the good things that have come of this instead of his month after month long fear of his end.' Her partner Cameron and four-year-old daughter were also reeling over Zeus' relocation, devastated he wouldn't be coming back home. 'My daughter knows that he is safe and will be going from his holiday to a new mummy where he will be safe and loved and have a lot of fun, though you can imagine her pain loosing her friend,' she said. 'My partner loved Zeus, and the fact of loosing him from the beginning has seemed unbearable for him to think about.' But despite the pain, Ms Cuff said it was a happy ending for an animal she thought would be euthanised for doing nothing wrong. 'Luckily with all the support and followers we have we all have achieved something amazing,' she said. 'He is safe, he is free and he will be loved.'","Zeus was captured by council rangers after escaping his owner's backyard .

"By . Tom Kelly . Friends: Kirstine Hamilton, who has a ten-year-old daughter with former partner Neil Trotter . Kirstine Hamilton's romantic honeymoon in Mexico was rudely interrupted by the news that her former partner, Neil Trotter, had scooped £108million on the lottery. But with great grace, the very new Mrs Hamilton showed no bitterness on learning that her ex had suddenly become one of the richest men in Britain. Instead, she sent him a joking text message: ‘That’s just typical of you, Trotter.’ The pair, who have a ten-year-old daughter together, are said to remain on good terms despite their split several years ago. Mr Trotter yesterday said that he planned to use his fortune to buy country mansions, sports  cars and designer handbags for his new girlfriend. But he appeared amused when asked if he would be buying his ex-girlfriend a house – and explained that she and her husband were rich enough already. He said: ‘She’s just married. He’s in Formula 1. I think he’s in charge of all the radios and things like that for Bernie Ecclestone. They are well off and live just up the road from me. ‘Her mum texted her. She was pleased – she said, “That’s just typical of you, Trotter.”’ Mrs Hamilton, who will turn 41 at the weekend, attended Purley High School for Girls in South London, close to where her ex-boyfriend went to school. The couple are believed to have broken up not long after their daughter Annabelle was born, and Mr Trotter has been with his new partner Nicky Ottaway, 33, for eight years. Victorious: Car mechanic Neil Trotter, with partner Nicky Ottaway, celebrates his win in Dorking, Surrey, where he was revealed as the man who scooped a £108million jackpot on the Euromillions lottery . Mrs Hamilton has also moved  on, and a few months ago she left the semi-detached home in a cul-de-sac in Caterham, Surrey, where she is believed to have lived with Mr Trotter during the time they spent together. Her parents, Keith and Christine Pitman, are also believed to have moved away from Surrey, and until recently were living at a £350,000 red-brick semi-detached house on a country lane in the village of Chiddingstone Causeway, Kent. Pictures posted on Mrs Hamilton’s Facebook page last month show her in a white wedding dress and kissing her new husband, in full morning dress, surrounded by their friends and family. Another picture, apparently from later that evening, shows her in a blue dress clutching a celebratory glass of champagne. House: The home of racing driver Neil Trotter and his 33-year-old partner Nicky Ottaway in Coulsdon, Surrey . And it’s clear it’s not just the former partners who remain close – since Mr Trotter’s stepmother organised some of the flowers for the wedding reception. 'She’s just married. He’s in Formula 1. I think he’s in charge of all the radios and things like that for Bernie Ecclestone. They are well off and live just up the road from me' Neil Trotter . Mrs Hamilton posted a picture of the display on Facebook, with the comment: ‘Big thank you to Brenda Trotter for our lovely table flowers xxx.’ As for Annabelle, their daughter, Mr Trotter admitted that he plans to buy her a pony following his extraordinary win. It’s nearly as good a gift as the one he will be getting himself – an extravagant country house with plenty of space in its garage for a fleet of supercars. Mr Trotter said yesterday that he had no plans to marry Miss Ottaway, his girlfriend of eight years - even though she has already quit her job to live a life of luxury with him. Workplace: Chameleon Coachworks in Mitcham, Surrey, which is run by 41-year-old car mechanic Mr Trotter . The couple from Coulsdon, Surrey, both resigned after he became Britain’s fourth biggest Lottery winner ever by scooping Friday’s EuroMillions jackpot. And they insisted they had no worries about the huge win affecting their relationship. But Mr Trotter, who is a successful amateur racing driver, admitted he was not thinking of spending his winnings on a lavish wedding. He said he did not want to ‘rush into’ marrying his long-term partner in case he ‘regretted it later’. Mr Trotter said: ‘We are quite happy. We’ve spoken about it before, but we are quite happy to just go the way we are going. It wouldn’t really make any real difference. If you rush into something you would regret it later, maybe.’ Lucky store: The Londis shop in Wallington where the £108million winning ticket was purchased . His girlfriend, who is a keen rider, said she expected to buy a horse and some designer shoes. ‘Nicky has an endless list, including clothes, shoes, handbags and a horse and a dog,’ Mr Trotter admitted. Asked if she feared the money could come between them, Miss Ottaway said: ‘We would like to think that it’s not going to change us,’ but added: ‘We don’t know. We’ve never been in this situation before.’ Her partner added: ‘I’m not worried.’ Mr Trotter – who admitted he did share some character traits with his namesake, wheeler-dealer ‘Del Boy’ Trotter from Only Fools And Horses – said he would use the money to buy a country mansion with plenty of garage space for a fleet of supercars. And in an echo of the catchphrase of David Jason’s sitcom character, Mr Trotter told his father’s secretary on Friday that he would be a multi-millionaire ‘this time tomorrow’. Champagne moment: Mr Trotter said yesterday that he had no plans to marry Miss Ottaway, his girlfriend of eight years - even though she has already quit her job to live a life of luxury with him . He said: ‘I always knew I’m going to be a millionaire. I’m a Trotter so it’s going to happen at some stage. I have always believed, and it obviously works.’ Mr Trotter hopes to use the money to help his family and friends – and plans to buy a pony for his daughter Annabelle. He bought his winning ticket from Londis in Wallington, Surrey, where he would stop nearly every day on his way to his car bodyshop, Chameleon Coachworks in nearby Mitcham. He checked his numbers at 10.30pm on Friday. On finding that they all matched, he turned ‘as white as a sheet’, according to his partner. Comparison: Mr Trotter admitted he did share some character traits with his namesake, wheeler-dealer ¿Del Boy¿ Trotter (centre) from Only Fools And Horses . Miss Ottaway said she did not believe him at first, and added: ‘I think I told him to shut up. It was totally unreal.’ Mr Trotter went to see his father that night to confirm he did indeed have a winning ticket before returning home to celebrate with his girlfriend and two bottles of Budweiser. He immediately folded his business – despite having one car in his garage for repairs and another booked in for Monday. Meanwhile, Miss Ottaway rang up her ‘stunned’ boss yesterday and quit her job as an accounts assistant at a small firm in Epsom that makes books of remembrance for crematoriums.","Kirstine Hamilton heard about Neil Trotter's win while on honeymoon .

"By . Ashley Collman . A Colorado couple are being blamed for the death of their 2-year-old son, after the toddler died in a house fire. During the course of their investigation, authorities discovered that 27-year-old Julia Welton and her husband Christopher Welton, 33, encouraged their son Levi to smoke. The boy and his older brother Dean, 5, tested positive for THC two times before the house fire broke out at their home in Sterling in mid-January. Too young: Two-year-old Levi Welton (center) died after a fire broke out at his family's Colorado home last January. His parents Christopher (left) and Julia (right) Welton were charged this week in his death . Arrested: Julia Welton, 27 (left), and Christopher Welton, 33 (right), were indicted Tuesday on child negligence charges . Mystery: It's uncertain what caused a fire to break out at the Welton's home in January, but a lighter was found in the room where Levi was left unattended . Firefighters found Levi unconscious in a closet of the bedroom where the fire broke out. The toddler was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. Though the cause of the fire is still under investigation, authorities say they found a lighter in the room where Levi and his brother were left unattended. A Colorado grand jury indicted the Weltons on charges of negligent child abuse resulting in death, negligent child abuse - no injury and three counts of contributing to the delinquency of a child. The couple were arrested and booked at Logan County Jail where they are being held on $100,000 bail. Local child services authorities had been investigating the couple, according to documents obtained by 7 News. Father and son: Levi and older brother Dean (5) tested positive for THC, the principal drug found in marijuana, two times before the house fire. Above, a  picture of Christopher with Levi from his Facebook page . The Logan County Department of Human Services tested Levi and Dean for THC in November 2013 and both boys tested positive to the drug found in marijuana. From there, the department filed a Dependency and Neglect Motion in court, which cited a lack of supervision, drug use and inappropriate people visiting the home. And marijuana wasn't the only drug use going on in the home. During one home visit, 'little white pills' were found on the floor and 'in Levi Welton's hand'. Caseworkers deemed the home a fire hazard during the house visit as well, since Julia Welton was observed ashing her cigarette on the carpet - something she didn't realize she was doing until a caseworker pointed it out. A cigarette butt was also found on the floor. Parents: The Weltons are also facing three counts of contributing tot he delinquency of a child . The children were temporarily taken out of the home, but eventually returned. The second time they tested positive for THC was just hours before the fire broke out and Levi was killed. According to authorities, the two boys had been left without parental supervision in one of the home's bedrooms while their parents smoked weed with friends in another room. Though the cause of the fire is still unknown, it seemed to originate in a pile of clothing and blankets underneath the window where the boys were found. Despite the report saying the Welton boys tested positive for THC, father Chris told Fox 31 he never let his kids smoke the drug. Mother Julia reportedly holds a medical marijuana card for a painful condition, but her husband was also tested positive for THC. He says he's now lost his job as a plumber due to the negative publicity. Wife Julia says they've received death threats as well, which is causing a strain on their mourning. 'All of these rumors about us killing our son need to quit. And I'm tired of hearing them. I want to mourn about my son without all the rumors,' she told Fox 31.

"By . Becky Barrow . Employment minister: Esther McVey praised bosses yesterday . The longest pay squeeze in history is finally coming to an end as the jobs market continues to swell. Last year 1,000 people a day stopped claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance, with the number of claimants falling at its fastest rate for 16 years. The Chancellor yesterday hailed the ‘staggering’ fall of 24 per cent, or 363,200, in 12 months. He also bragged that for the first time in 35 years, our employment rate is higher than America’s. The number of workers in Britain has reached 30.2million – the most since records began in 1971. Nearly half – 14million – are women, including many bread-winning wives as well as those in families who cannot survive on one income. Employment minister Esther McVey hailed business-owners – and those brave enough to set up a company during the financial crisis – for helping the jobs market to reach such heights. ‘The rise in employment is being fuelled by businesses and entrepreneurs across the country who are feeling increasingly confident with the improving economy,’ she said. ‘They should be congratulated.’ In further good news, pay rises in the private sector are set to beat inflation for the first time following the onset of the financial crisis. Since 2008, the typical worker’s wage increases have failed to match the rising cost of living, leaving many struggling as energy and food bills spiralled. But the Office for National Statistics said yesterday that the average private sector worker is now seeing their pay rise by 1.7 per cent – just 0.2 percentage points below the current rate of inflation. The squeeze will continue to ease, George Osborne said yesterday, with pay rises set to beat inflation for each of the next five years. Last year 1,000 people a day stopped claiming Jobseeker¿s Allowance, with the number of claimants falling at its fastest rate for 16 years . The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts that next year wages will rise by 3.2 per cent, compared with inflation of just 2 per cent. Andrew Goodwin, senior economic adviser to the accountants Ernst & Young’s ITEM Club, said: ‘With inflation expected to fall further this year, wage growth will soon outpace price rises and pay packets will go further than before.’ Yesterday’s ONS figures also debunked Labour’s claims that the private sector could not create enough jobs for those made redundant by the State. The private workforce has risen by around 1.4million people since the last general election, while the number of public sector staff has dropped by 360,000. Although these figures exclude the impact of ‘reclassifications’ by the ONS, such as moving the newly privatised Royal Mail’s workforce from the public to the private sector, Mr Goodwin said: ‘All in all, it is looking like a broad-based and sustained labour market recovery.’ The number of overall job vacancies jumped to 588,000 in February, the largest number since 2008, while unemployment fell by 63,000 between November and January to 2.3million. Two years ago, nearly six unemployment people were chasing every job vacancy, but today the figure is closer to four. The ONS said the record level of employment includes a huge increase in those who are self-employed. Their ranks have swelled by around 500,000 since the Coalition came to power, reaching a record 4.5million. Experts say this may not be wholely due to entrepreneurial zeal, however. They suggest it could simply be that redundant workers have struggled to find well-paid work during the financial crisis, and decided to set up on their own instead. George Osborne has warned the job is far from done . George Osborne yesterday welcomed the biggest upgrade to Budget growth forecasts for three decades but warned:  ‘The job is far from done.’ The independent Office for Budget Responsibility now expects the economy to grow by 2.7 per cent this year. This would represent the biggest leap for seven years. The watchdog also said the economy will surpass its pre-recession peak this summer. However, Britain is still on course to rack up a deficit of more than £100billion this year, with no surplus expected until 2019. The national debt is on course to top £1.5trillion, or £60,000 per household, in the coming years and will not start shrinking as a percentage of national income until 2016-17. ‘We set out our plan and together with the British people we held our nerve,’  the Chancellor said. ‘But the job is far from done.’ The OBR forecast growth of 2.7 per cent this year, compared with 2.4 per cent in the Autumn Statement in December and 1.8 per cent in the Budget last year. ‘That is the biggest upward revision to growth between Budgets for at least 30 years,’ said Mr Osborne. ‘Later this year the OBR expects Britain to reach the point when our economy is finally larger than before it collapsed six years ago. 'That’s because we’re now growing faster than Germany, faster than Japan, faster than the US. There is no major advanced economy in the world growing faster than Britain today.’ Government borrowing fell to around £115billion last year and is expected to edge lower to £107.8billion this year – some £3.4billion less than predicted in December. The OBR now expects borrowing of £95.5billion in 2014-15, shrinking further every eyar before Britain finally reaches a surplus of £4.8billion in 2018-19. Mr Osborne had hoped to balance the books by the general election next May, but sluggish economic growth in recent years means austerity will stretch well into the next parliament. Andrew Smith, chief economist at KPMG, said: ‘The original strategy was to combine recovery with repair of the public finances over the current Parliament. 'The good news is that we are finally getting the recovery; the bad news is that we are only halfway through what has now become a decade-long deficit reduction programme.’ Ed Miliband said the country faces more austerity because Mr Osborne’s plans have failed. ‘Back in 2010 you told us that by the end of 2014, the economy would have grown by nearly 12 per cent,’ he said. ‘Today the figures say it’s been barely half that, and you want the country to be grateful.’ Unpopular: King John of England . George Osborne had MPs on both sides of the House laughing yesterday with a jibe likening Ed Miliband to England’s notorious medieval ruler King John. Announcing a grant to help pay for celebrations of the 800th anniversary of the signing of the Magna Carta by the 13th century king, the Chancellor made a series of unflattering comparisons between the ‘weak’ John and the Labour leader. To cheers from the Tory benches – and laughter from Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls – Mr Osborne told MPs: ‘King John’s humbling centuries ago seems unimaginably distant. ‘A weak leader, who had risen to the top after betraying his brother, compelled by a gang of unruly barons to sign on the dotted line. 'So I will provide a grant to the Magna Carta Trust to ensure that today’s generation learn the lessons of the past.’ It was a thinly-veiled reference to the way Mr Miliband vanquished his older brother David with the help of trade union barons as they fought for the Labour crown in 2010. The parallels are not exact. John, the youngest son of Henry II, did attempt to seize control from his older brother Richard the Lionheart, who had been kidnapped during the Crusades and imprisoned in Germany in 1192. But the attempt was unsuccessful and John was banished when Richard returned to England in 1194. Labour party leader Ed Miliband responds after George Osborne delivered his Budget statement to the House of Commons . Unlike the Milibands, however, Richard and John were soon reconciled. David Miliband, by contrast, has quit as an MP and moved to the United States to avoid becoming part of the ‘soap opera’ surrounding his brother. John’s reconciliation with his brother allowed him to become king on Richard’s death in 1199. George Osborne had MPs on both sides of the House laughing yesterday with a jibe  likening Ed Miliband to England¿s notorious medieval ruler King John . Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne laughs as Labour party leader Ed Miliband responds to his Budget statement to the House of Commons . He ruled until his own death in 1216, signing the Magna Carta in 1215. He was considered a failure as a king, losing major lands to France and being forced into a humiliating climbdown by the nobility. Some £20million is being set aside to fund a grant scheme for repairs to cathedrals. The funding is timed to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the First World War, with cathedrals set to play an important role in remembrance services. The Church of England has warned it faces a £87million repair shortfall in the next  five years. The Very Rev Vivienne Faull, Dean of York and chairman of the Association of English Cathedrals, welcomed the funding. ‘Whether great or small, cathedrals are part of the lifeblood of their cities,’ she said.","The Chancellor bragged that for the first time in 35 years, our employment rate is higher than America’s .

"By . Sara Malm . A mother and daughter have been found guilty of subjecting their neighbours to a bizarre hate campaign, including falsely accusing the local vicar of being a paedophile and threatening to kill an eight-month-old baby. Lynne Portues, 54, and Natalie Veart, 21, targeted various people and businesses in their community with online abuse and made dozens of hoax 999 calls. The pair even harassed the local magistrates, who had to trial them in absentia after they refused to stop chanting and were thrown out of a Hartlepool court. Hate campaign: Lynne Portues, 54, and Natalie Veart, 21, from Hartlepool threatened their neighbours, falsely accused a local vicar of paedophilia and made hoax calls to the police . Veart, from Hartlepool, sent Facebook messages to Seaton Carew Golf Club and church-goer Sarah Baker on July 22 last year claiming innocent Father Paul Allinson was involved in paedophilia. Just a week later she stormed round to next-door neighbours Anne Holland and Stephen Paul and said she would kill their eight-month-old granddaughter. Mr Paul told the court how he heard Veart shouting through the walls that she was going to get his granddaughter and kill her. He said: ‘It made me sick to my stomach, for somebody to threaten an eight-month-old baby who can’t defend itself - it was disgusting.’ His partner Ms Holland, 52, said she called the police and held the phone up so that they could hear the threats that were being shouted at her family. Under attack: Father Paul Allinson, pictured, was subjected to 21-year-old Veart's hatred when she sent Facebook messages to Seaton Carew Golf Club and a church-goer claiming he was a paedophilie . During police interviews Veart continually referred to her neighbours as ‘scum, chavs, and anti-social vermin’. When challenged about her threat to kill the baby she replied: ‘Do I look like a murderer to you? I can’t even drive, what sort of kidnapper would I make?’ During the same week of Veart’s verbal attack of their neighbours, her mother made 22 unnecessary 999 calls to Cleveland Police in just four days. She claimed her daughter had been assaulted and they were too afraid to leave their homes, but also made up bizarre fake ‘emergencies’ about sandwiches and her dog. Magistrates were forced to trial the duo in their absence after they refused to stop chanting about ‘not recognising the law of the land’ and were thrown out of court. Baffling: Portues and Veart had to be removed from Hartlepool Magistrates Court during their trial as they refused to stop interrupting proceedings . Despite the false accusation, Father Paul said he forgave Veart - and even wanted to help the pair. Speaking after the hearing at Hartlepool Magistrates Court he said: ‘As a clergyman all I’ve ever tried to do is be supportive and caring and try to help the two people involved. ‘Despite the pain and sadness it caused to myself, I have to continue to try to be forgiving and maintain standards that I should hold as a Christian.’ Veart was found guilty of sending by public communication network a message that was grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character, and also of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. Portues was found guilty of persistently making use of a public communications network for the purpose of causing annoyance, inconvenience or needless anxiety. Chairman of the bench Gareth Hicks issued an arrest warrant for the pair to bring them back to court for sentencing.","Lynne Portues, 54, and Natalie Veart, 21, targeted their local community .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks, including Scotch whisky, have been axed to bring some cheer to Britons struggling with the cost of living. The move is part of a £300million sweetener for drinkers which the Treasury freely admits is expected to result in ‘higher consumption’. In a radical shift, George Osborne is scrapping the alcohol duty escalator, which has increased the tax on drink by 2 per cent above inflation every year since 2008. Cheers: Chancellor George Osborne announced automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks will be axed to help bring some cheer to Britons struggling with the cost of living . Budget: Yesterday's Budget included a raft of welcome measures, including cutting the duty on beer, by the equivalent of 1p per pint and freezing the taxes on spirits including Scotch . He is also cutting the duty on beer by the equivalent of 1p a pint and freezing the tax paid on spirits, including Scotch, to support the industry. The move will be welcomed at a time when Westminster politicians are keen to woo Scots away from voting for independence in a referendum on September 18. However, the changes represent a major shift in fiscal and social policy away from using taxes to drive up the cost of booze as part of a concerted attempt to discourage excessive alcohol consumption. Treasury papers issued alongside the Budget even make clear the changes will lead to a rise in drinking, stating: ‘There will be an increase in consumption compared to the previous policy.’ The change puts the Government on collision course with the medical profession which has been arguing for minimum alcohol prices in order to encourage Britons to cut back. A programme set up by the parents of IRA victim Tim Parry to support British terror victims was saved. The Government was embroiled in a row when it emerged the £150,000-a-year Survivors For Peace project faced closure after Lottery funding dried up. Colin Parry, whose 12-year-old son Tim was killed alongside Johnathan Ball, three, in the IRA bombings in Warrington in 1993, last month  criticised David Cameron’s ‘offensive and thoughtless’ refusal to throw it  a cash lifeline. y the Chancellor committed a full year’s funding to the programme and vowed to look for a permanent solution. The timing of the news was particularly poignant for Mr Parry and his wife Wendy who today mark the 21st anniversary of Tim’s death. Mr Osborne said: ‘Survivors for Peace no longer receives lottery funding. I know myself what incredible work they do. ‘To honour the memory of all victims of terrorism, we will provide the funding the programme needs.’ Announcing the changes, Mr Osborne said: ‘Scottish whisky is a huge British success story. To support that industry, instead of raising duties on whisky and other spirits, I am today going to freeze them. And with some cider makers in the West Country hit hard by the recent weather, I am going to help them by freezing the duty on ordinary cider too.’ While home drinks producers have been given tax breaks, the Chancellor said wine, which is mainly imported, will rise by 6p a bottle. High-strength sparkling cider goes up 8p a bottle. Mr Osborne said the automatic price rises linked to the alcohol duty escalator were no longer necessary or justified. ‘We’ve introduced new laws to prevent alcohol being sold below minimum tax rates, and this helps prevent supermarkets undercutting pubs, and helps stop problem drinking,’ he said. ‘It’s a far more targeted approach than the alcohol duty escalator hated by many responsible drinkers.’ However, the Treasury documents said the new rules will increase consumption and cost the Government £300million a year in lost taxes because of the savings given to drinkers. Katherine Brown, of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, condemned the change as ‘staggering’. She said: ‘With alcohol costing the country £21billion a year, and alcohol-related hospital admissions more than doubling over the last ten years, it comes as a shock to learn that the Chancellor believes that it is right to further incentivise drinking by making alcohol cheaper. ‘It is yet more evidence to suggest the Government has turned its back on public health and frontline workers such as nurses and police offers, who have to mop up the mess that alcohol creates day in day out. 'It is yet another sad day to see how the profits of multi-national alcohol producers have been prioritised over public health and safety.’ While drinkers have been spared rises in duty, there has been no protection for smokers. The duty on a pack of 20 cigarettes has gone up by 24p. It will rise by 8p on a pack of five small cigars, 23p on a 25g pouch of hand-rolling tobacco and 13p on a 25g pouch of pipe tobacco. Scottish vote: The move is likely to be welcomed at a time when politicians are keen to woo Scots away from voting for independence in the referendum on September 18 . Theatre companies will get tax relief of up to 25 per cent. Performing arts companies, including those putting on dance, opera and plays, will  be eligible for a tax break of  20 per cent. Regional firms that tour will have their bills cut by an even more generous 25 per cent for any initial investment in new productions. The tax changes will come into effect September 1 following a consultation. Theatre firms, many of which  operate as charities, will welcome the move, particularly because it comes after cuts to funding for the arts during the recent austerity years. The Treasury said the tax cut would be worth up to £15million a year and was in recognition of the ‘unique value that the  theatre sector brings to the  UK economy’. The Chancellor told MPs that he was applying the same tax relief to theatres that is already offered to film companies. The Coalition’s new transferable tax allowance for married couples was made slightly more generous yesterday. George Osborne announced that  the amount a person in a couple can transfer will be raised in line with  the increase in personal income tax allowance. It was originally planned that a married person who earns under the £10,000 income tax threshold would be allowed to transfer £1,000 of their allowance to their spouse – reducing their annual tax bill by £200. But now the Chancellor’s move to raise the personal allowance to £10,500 means a husband or wife will be able to transfer £1,050 of their allowance to their spouse, cutting their annual tax bill by £210. Only the 24million basic rate taxpayers will benefit, but David Cameron has signalled he wants to go further if re-elected with a Conservative majority. Labour have said they will scrap the tax break if they win the election. Flood defences will get a £140million boost following the devastation of the wettest winter for 250 years. The cash injection will be used to repair and improve defences across Britain, after about 5,000 properties were flooded and the Somerset Levels left underwater for weeks, causing around £1billion of damage. David Cameron visited flood-hit areas last month and said money would be ‘no object’ in the relief efforts. He promised a £5,000 ‘repair and renew’ grant to help homeowners who had been affected. But Labour claims the budget for maintaining defences has been cut by 20 per cent under the Coalition, affecting flood-hit areas in theSouth East and South West. Green groups say more money for defences is urgently needed. They point out that the Government’s climate independent advisers recommend an extra £500million.","Chancellor George Osborne axed automatic tax rises on alcoholic drinks .

"By . Jane Fryer . Some of science’s greatest advances have been delivered by partnerships. Think of Watson and Crick, who discovered the structure of DNA; Rutherford and Bohr, who developed a model of the atom; Banting and Best, who discovered insulin. Will we one day be reading about the exploits of Edwards and Barker? Boffin Jamie Edwards (right) built the reactor from scratch in a bid to be younger than American Taylor Wilson who completed a reactor aged 14 in 2008. Jamie had help from his friend, George, in the school lab where he built the reactor . Jamie Edwards is the boy from Preston who two weeks ago entered the record books as the youngest person — he was 13 — in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor. George Barker is his assistant, sidekick and loyal best friend. George, 13, says: ‘I organise meetings for Jamie, and tidy up for him — he’s really, really messy; you should see his bedroom, it’s a right tip with stuff everywhere! I make brews for him — he  prefers hot chocolate with just a little bit of milk.’ But he leaves the science to Jamie. ‘I don’t help him build his experiments, because that’s his special project,’  he says. For his part, Jamie — now 14 — says magnanimously: ‘He might chuck me a couple of spanners over. And he tries to calm me down when I get a bit stressed.’ Jamie and George, together with their . brilliantly open-minded headmaster, Mr Hourigan, are sitting with me in . one of the school science labs at Penwortham Priory Academy. Jamie started building the reactor in October in a under-used science laboratory at his school . We are admiring the machine that, in a ‘radiation controlled area’ and in front of an audience of experts, helped Jamie achieve nuclear fusion from scratch, by using high energy to smash two hydrogen atoms together to make helium. The ‘reactor’ is perched on a couple of scratched old lab tables and, to be  honest, doesn’t look terribly high-tech. For a start, there’s lots of chicken wire. ‘That’s not chicken wire, it’s a Faraday cage!’ says Jamie, with a hint of indignation, a Faraday cage being a metallic enclosure that shields its contents from electric fields. There are also endless plugs and a heavy metal lid, which falls off with a clank when Jamie leans on it. ‘We had a bit of a disaster a few minutes before the experiment — one of the two vacuum pumps stopped working, which shorted out the electrics,’ he says, pointing at a bit of metal. ‘But it was too late to turn it off and restart it, so we just risked it, and it worked.’ George is full of admiration for his friend. ‘It’s an amazing achievement — magnificent, really,’ he says. ‘I don’t think Jamie realises how big it is.’ Indeed, ever since the Geiger counter lurched into life, registering radiation and confirming that fusion had taken place, Jamie — and, to a lesser extent, George — have become famous. After working against the clock, he finally finished the task of successfully making two atoms of hydrogen smash together to make a helium nuclear fusion . They have appeared on BBC news, been inundated with interview requests from all around the world and even clapped by older Year 11 pupils during their lunchtime. ‘Jamie likes his name being around the school and in the news,’  says George. ‘He likes the fame. I’m probably the same — it’s  great fun.’ While most amateur scientists would limber up by, for example, generating static electricity, or messing around with magnets and iron filings, Jamie has always set his sights a little higher. This is a boy who had science birthday parties, knew an entire Encyclopedia Of Science off by heart by the age of seven, and thinks TV physicist Professor Brian Cox is ‘OK, but a bit slow. He’s like: “We have a particle . . . and another particle.”’ So he cut his teeth on a nuclear reactor. ‘It was the first major experiment I’d done. I was browsing through some physics videos on YouTube — none of that pop rubbish — and I came across this boy called Taylor Wilson, who built his own nuclear fusion reactor when he was 14. I thought, why don’t I do that?’ So he did — after giving a very detailed Dragons’ Den-style pitch to Mr Hourigan, in which he explained why it was all such a good idea. ‘He was very convincing. And a bit scary,’ says Jim Hourigan, who is 57 and retiring this year (perhaps he wanted to go out with a bang). Modest Jamie said: 'It is quite an achievement. It's magnificent really. I can't quite believe it - even though all my friends think I am mad' ‘I didn’t understand the science to start with — my background is in IT. So he had to explain it to me, and reassure me he wasn’t going to blow up the school and irradiate everybody — because as soon as you say nuclear reactor, people do tend to get all upset. ‘But he was so enthusiastic that I wanted to give him the opportunity — sometimes you have to take a bit of a risk to really invest in kids.’ So last April, with Mr Hourigan’s blessing and a budget of £3,000, Jamie set about ordering equipment and piecing his ‘reactor’ together. He had a few bits and bobs already — not least his own Geiger counter, for measuring  radiation, bought with his Christmas money two Christmases ago. ‘He stands by the railway line measuring the nuclear waste trains for radiation as they go past,’ says George, who prefers carp fishing and motorbiking to investigating the mysteries of the atom. ‘They go past about five times a day from Sellafield to all the nuclear power plants in the country. When they’re full, the levels spike a bit,’ says Jamie. 13-year-old Jamie Edwards has become the youngest in the world to build a nuclear fusion reactor . ‘And he goes round Springfields [a nuclear site near Preston]  picking all the stickers off the  lorries and taking them home,’ George adds proudly. ‘I run tests on them to see what’s in them — what’s contaminated,’ says Jamie, who is also a member of Fuser.net — ‘a group of amateur physicists like me who all have fusion reactors in their garage or basement, although some of them are really old — like 50!’ And so the other day, with George’s support and in this very room, Jamie flicked a switch and achieved nuclear fusion. Fission, which involves splitting atoms, is the process at the heart of atom bombs. Fusion is the process that powers our sun and other stars. Jamie likes to refer to his experiment as creating ‘a star in a jar’. ‘I was confident it would work,’ says Jamie with a grin. ‘I wasn’t nervous. I’m never nervous. Even on TV, I’m chilled.’Unlike poor George. ‘I wasn’t chilled,’ he says. ‘I got very nervous. All those cameras!’ I can’t help wondering whether, just occasionally, it’s a teeny bit tricky being Jamie’s best friend. After all, he’s in the top set for everything, plays loads of musical instruments and cooks. Perhaps the most annoying thing about Jamie is that, despite being good at absolutely everything, he is also good looking, charming and very entertaining company. So does he have a girlfriend? ‘Not at the minute.’ ‘He did!’ crows George. Head teacher Jim Hourigan congratulates Jamie as a Geiger counter registers the fusion reaction . Jamie Edwards (pictured) built the reactor from scratch in a bid to be younger than American Taylor Wilson who completed a reactor aged 14 in 2008 . ‘It just sort of went downhill,  I guess.’ And George, do you ever think, ‘Blimey, wouldn’t it be nice if there was something Jamie wasn’t good at?’ ‘Yep. But he’s a good mate, too. And I’m better at motorbiking than him. And fishing. I’ve caught much bigger fish than him.’ What do they argue about? ‘Oh you know, whether the diffusion plugs should go on this side or the other side. He should listen to me sometimes,’ says George with a shrug. ‘But he always apologises — “Sorry boss!”.’ I mention the rumour that Jamie’s already planning his next experiment — building his very own Hadron Collider. ‘Yeah, maybe,’ he says. ‘If I get round to it. It’s a bit more challenging, but I reckon you could make a linear particle accelerator the size of this desk.’ While George wants to fix tractors for a living, Jamie has his heart set on Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the leading universities in the U.S. — ‘to study nuclear sciences and engineering, then maybe work in nuclear fusion and plasma physics’. And make a lot of money? ‘A fair bit. Enough to get a fairly nice bike and live in the countryside somewhere. And I’d maybe make a flying car — a DeLorean with a fusion reactor on top. And maybe when I’m a bit older, I’ll go into politics — the Government seems to make a lot of bad decisions. But I’d have my own party.’ Of course he would. And I bet it would do jolly well, too.","Jamie Edwards built reactor in his Lancashire school aged just under 13 .

"By . William Turvill . These photographs show a tired-looking Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI today in his specially-adapted wheelchair. They come after it emerged yesterday that the former pope had written a four-page critique on Pope Francis's landmark interview in which he criticised the Church's obsession with 'small-minded' rules. Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, Benedict's personal secretary and head of Pope Francis's papal household, who is pictured alongside Benedict today, said that Francis had solicited Benedict's input on the interview. This photograph shows Pope Emeritus Benedict looking weary today in a specially-adapted wheelchair . The pictures have emerged after it was revealed that the former pope had written a four-page critique of Pope Francis's landmark interview in which he discussed the Church's obsession with 'small-minded' rules . It was published in September in 16 Jesuit journals around the globe and helped define Francis's agenda. The Jesuit priest who conducted the interview, the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, said yesterday that he gave the first printed copy of the interview to Francis on the day it was published. Francis gave that version to Benedict to critique, Mr Spadaro said. Though Benedict's comments had no impact on the published article, the revelation is further evidence of the remarkable and unprecedented collaboration between the two popes, who stay in touch by phone, in person and by sending notes back and forth across the Vatican gardens via Mr Gaenswein. Mr Gaenswein told German broadcaster ZDF that Francis had given him a first copy of the interview to forward on to Benedict, and received a four-page letter from the retired pope three days later. The former pope looks tired as he walks with Monsignor Georg Gaenswein, Benedict's personal secretary and head of Francis's papal household, who revealed that Francis had solicited Benedict's input on the interview . Though Benedict's comments had no impact on the published article, the revelation is further evidence of the remarkable and unprecedented collaboration between the two popes . ‘He did his homework - he read it and, in accordance with his successor's request, he did indeed offer some thoughts and some remarks on certain comments or certain questions on which he thought something additional could perhaps be said in another place,’ Mr Gaenswein said. ‘Of course I won't say what, but that was interesting.'. Francis has said he relies on his predecessor's sage advice and has increasingly coaxed Benedict out of his secluded retirement to participate more in the public life of the Church.","Georg Gaenswein, Benedict's personal secretary and head of Pope Francis's papal household, said Francis had solicited Benedict's input .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Minnesota woman had promised her aunt to watch her 6-year-old daughter while the woman was recovering from an injury, but instead she took off, leaving the girl to freeze to death outside, according to newly released charging documents. Rachel Stacey Downer appeared in court in Beltrami County on a second-degree manslaughter charge and was released on $100,000 bond. She could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. Downer's cousin, 6-year-old Mercedes Mayfield, was found curled up on the front step of a Bemidji apartment building early February 27. Break in the case: Rachel Downer, 22 (left), was arrested and charged with manslaughter in the death of her 6-year-old cousin Mercedes Mayfield (right) last month . Tragic end: The little girl, pictured here with her cousin, was found frozen to death outside an apartment building in Minnesota . The child's mother, Malika Peoples, called 911 at around 6.30am to report her daughter was stiff, frozen and unresponsive. The . girl was dressed in a winter coat and hat, with a boot on her left . foot. Her right boot and her mittens were found on an outside step. Temperatures that night dipped down to 19 degrees below zero, with a wind chill of 32 below, the criminal complaint cited by Minneapolis Star Tribune said. The . last time Mercedes was seen alive was the evening before. Downer was . going to take her cousin to her apartment to baby-sit her that night, . but changed her mind and didn't tell Mercedes' mother, according to the . complaint. Mercedes helped . Downer carry her things to her car. Downer said she watched the girl . enter the building, then got in her car and drove off. Miss Downer told police Mercedes had shut the apartment's safety door gently, so it would not lock her out. It has not been revealed how many hours the first-grader spent outdoors from the time Downer took off and until she was found lying unconscious. Misunderstanding: Downer was supposed to take her cousin to her apartment, but at the last minute changed her mind without telling the girl's mother . Left to die: Downer told police Mercedes helped carry her things to her car, and the 22-year-old then watched the enter the building before driving off . According . to the complaint, Downer was supposed to be watching Mercedes and a . 3-year-old sibling, as well as Downer's own 2-year-old son, while . Peoples was at work. Peoples told police that she hurt her arm at work and took pain medication to help her sleep while Downer watched the children. The . family ate dinner together, then Peoples turned in early. When she was awakened by her alarm clock at 6am, neither Downer nor Mercedes were in the apartment. ‘Ms. Peoples said that she then called Downer and asked her why she had . taken Mercedes home with her when she knew Mercedes had school,’ the . complaint said. ‘Ms. Peoples said that she then looked out her front . window and saw her daughter lying on the front step. ‘She then went outside and pulled her into the entryway and called 911.’ Rescue . workers tried to revive Mercedes, but she was pronounced dead at the . scene. The Ramsey County medical examiner's office reported that she . died from hypothermia due to exposure to the freezing cold. Downer is due back in court March 24. She has been barred from making contact with the victim’s family. Following her release from jail, the 22-year-old suspect briefly addressed the incident in an interview with KAAL-TV. ‘I'm . hurt right now.

"By . Amanda Williams . and Lizzie Edmonds . Police investigating the murder of nightclubber Melanie Hall who was brutally murdered 17 years ago, have received new leads after an appeal. Detectives from Avon and Somerset police have been contacted by members of the public after a BBC Crimewatch appeal aired last night. It came after police released a photo of a . white VW Golf GTi hardtop that disappeared from official records . shortly after Melanie vanished. Detectives investigating the murder of Melanie Hall believe this car may be linked to the murder . The car - registration C752 CYE - disappeared from official records around the time of Miss Hall's death . Melanie, then 25, disappeared on a night out in Bath, Somerset, in June 1996. Her remains, dumped beside a slip road on the M5, were not found until 13 years later. The hospital worker had been battered around the head and her body was wrapped in black bin bags and bound with blue rope. The vehicle - registration C752 CYE - was last known to be registered on August 7, 1996. Police say they do not know what happened to it since - and are appealing for anyone with information about it. They are particularly interested in sightings around the Bath area at the time Melanie disappeared. They also say the car was linked to the Pentwyn area of Cardiff around the time. Detective Superintendent Mike Courtiour, leading the inquiry, said: 'We had a reasonable number of calls that are of interest to us and which warrant further investigation. 'We are still keen to reach as many people as possible who may have information about the white VW Golf GTi between April and August 1996, particularly people from the Pentwyn area of Cardiff.' Hospital worker Melanie Hall, who was last seen in a Bath nightclub in 1996. Her remains were found wrapped in plastic bags bound by tape by the side of the M5 motorway 13 years later . Last November a 44-year-old man from Bath was arrested and questioned for two days before being released on police bail pending further inquiries. Detectives also searched a property on an estate in the city. He was the fourth suspect to be questioned about Miss Hall’s murder since her remains were discovered. At the time, her father Steve, who lives near Bradford-upon-Avon, Wiltshire, said the development was 'progress'. He said: 'We are hopeful that progress is being made. It is a long and painful process 17 years down the line. 'This would appear to be connected to the appeal we made at the beginning of October, which is great. We are keeping our minds open on these things. ‘The police are keeping us informed and we are hopeful. It is not the first time someone has been arrested in connection with her death but we are remaining positive.’ Steve Hall and Pat Hall pictured at a press conference shortly after their daughter's remains were found . Miss Hall, who worked in a hospital, was last seen in June 1996 after apparently arguing with her doctor boyfriend in a nightclub. Despite a huge police operation, no trace of her was found until 2009 when a workman found parts of her skeleton hidden in plastic bags. He was clearing undergrowth just a few yards off the northbound slip road at junction 14 of the M5 near Thornbury, Gloucestershire, when he found the remains. The find was almost 30 miles from where the psychology graduate was last seen in Cadillac’s nightclub. Five bin-liners contained or covered her remains, including arm and leg bones and her pelvis and skull. Other parts of her skeleton were found partially buried nearby. In the four years since Melanie's discovery, her parents and sister Dominique have issued repeated appeals for members of the public to help police with their inquiries.","BBC Crimewatch appeal has unearthed new leads in the historic case .

Before, he looked jovial waiting for the Pope to see if he could get a brief chat in before the Pope disappeared to see his VIP audience. However, soon Crowe's mood turned sour as the movie star was approached by police at the general audience and told to leave, moments before the Pontiff decided to acknoledge many members of the general audience except for him.

Noah is thought to cost in the region of £75million and is due for release in America on March 29 . Aronofsky's film, based around the story of Noah’s Ark from The Book Of . Genesis, has already gained a fair amount of criticism. Agnostic US TV host Bill Maher slammed the movie for a perceived lack of ‘plausibility.’ Russell Crowe takes the lead in the new film based on the tale of Noah from The Book of Genesis . 'But the thing that’s . really disturbing about Noah isn’t the silly, it’s that it’s immoral,’ he said. 'It’s about a psychotic mass murderer who gets away with it, . and his name is God.' Noah . is also thought to be banned in several countries for depicting . religious characters, with censorship boards in Bahrain, Qatar and the . United Arab Emirates informing distributor Paramount that they won’t be . releasing the film. The actor takes his seat during a press conference ahead of the film's US release at the end of the month. The epic has been banned in several countries for depicting religious characters . Speaking of his latest . role, the actor recently claimed his depiction of Noah will go against . the grain of common belief regarding his character. He . said: ‘The funny thing with people, they consider Noah to be a . benevolent figure because he looked after the animals: ""Awww, Noah. Noah . and the animals.""

"By . Mia De Graaf . Tragic: Emma Shaw, 22, was trying to stop her boiler from leaking when she was hit by 230 volts and died . A young mother was fatally electrocuted by 230 volts as she mopped up water from a leaking boiler in her flat because an electrician who tested it was unqualified. Emma Shaw, 22, suffered the shock in her store cupboard as her one-year-old son Brayden played in the living room nearby - just months after the mains were inspected. She was trying to turn off her stopcock to stop the boiler leaking but was hit by volts and lost consciousness almost immediately. Her lifeless body was discovered by her boyfriend Andrew Cross when he returned to their flat in West Bromwich at midday on December 14, 2007. Today, a court heard documents certifying the property as safe were filled out by an unqualified electrician - who cannot remember carrying out the tests. Christopher Tomkins, 52, drew up and signed papers on March 8, 2006, which said he had carried out tests at the flat, exercised reasonable care, and the circuits were safe. His work was approved by qualified supervisor Neil Hoult at Anchor Electrical and Building Services, which managed the block. However, in a police interview, Mr Tomkins described himself as 'a mate of an electrician' and 'was not qualified as an inspector', Wolverhampton Crown Court heard. Richard Matthews QC, prosecuting, told a jury: 'The purpose of the certificate was to certify that the electrical installations were safe. 'In . fact they were far from safe and expert investigations since Emma . Shaw’s death have revealed that a cable in circuit three had been . penetrated by a screw during the construction phase and that caused a . metal frame to become live and charged to 230 volts. 'That occurred prior to the testing and inspection carried out by Christopher Tomkins. Her 23-month-old son Brayden had been playing on the floor near her when she was hit . 'If . Christopher Tomkins had tested circuit three properly or at all as he . purported to have done and Neil Hoult signed he had then the fault that . was present would have been detected immediately and the problem . investigated and remedied. '(In police interviews) he stated he was . an electrician’s mate who was used to working in a pair and he was at . Jefferson Place to assist with the secondary fittings. 'He said he . was not qualified to act as a test inspector, he admitted the writing . and signature was his but said he didn’t remember carrying out any . electrical insulation tests.' It came just months after documents were signed to prove the property's mains ha been checked . The court heard that during the construction a screw used to attach plasterboard to the metal frame in the wall in the store cupboard penetrated a cable causing it to become live. As a result of the blunder, when Miss Shaw’s boiler leaked, the puddle of water in her store cupboard crept under the skirting board and touched the frame - meaning it was also live. When Miss Shaw knelt in the puddle as she prepared to mop the floor she too became electrically charged and when she touched the earthed stopcock she suffered a huge shock. Tomkins and Hoult, who are both from Rowley Regis, West Midlands, both deny one charge of breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 in relation to the work they carried out in March 2006. The trial, which is expected to last eight days, continues.

"By . Dan Bloom . Frustration: The letter complained about the attention the author had gained from his books . A letter by Alice in Wonderland author Lewis Carroll complaining about the fame sparked by his classic children's books has been auctioned for almost £12,000. Writing from Oxford's Christ Church college in 1891, the notoriously reclusive author told a friend: 'Sometimes I almost wish I had never written any books at all.' An anonymous bidder bought the letter for £11,875 - three times its estimate - while a photograph Carroll took of a young girl with a bucket and spade in Eastbourne in 1882 fetched £5,250. Carroll, whose real name was Charles . Dodgson, wrote the three-page letter to a friend he addressed as Mrs Symonds almost 30 years after first achieving fame for his Alice books. The author said he resented giving his . autograph and hated people finding out his real name. He wrote: 'Dear Mrs Symonds, I don't think I . explained successfully my reasons for disliking letters of mine being . put into autograph-collections. 'All . that sort of publicity leads to strangers [underlined] hearing of my real name in connection with the books, and to my . being pointed out to, and stared at by, strangers, and treated as a ""lion"". 'And I hate all that so intensely that sometimes I almost wish I . had never written any books at all.' He said he realised . plenty of people 'like being looked at as a notoriety' and could not understand why he used a pen-name and craved anonymity. But he went on: 'We are not all made on the same pattern: & our likes & dislikes are very different'. The writer, who was notoriously shy with people he did not know and suffered from a stammer, loathed anyone knowing about his private life and never gave interviews. Photographer: The author (left) also took a photo of a girl on the beach which sold for more than £5,000 (right) He guarded his real identity so . carefully that in 1890 he went as far as to produce a printed notice . known as the 'Stranger circular'. When he received letters addressed to C. L. Dodgson, talking about Lewis Carroll, he returned them with a copy of the notice. It . read: 'Mr Dodgson...neither claims nor acknowledges any . connection with any pseudonym or with any book not published under his . own name'. The letter was written from Christ . Church, where Carroll was a mathematics don, on 9 November 1891 and he used dark grey ink rather than his usual . distinctive violet. It sold at Bonhams in central London after a bidding frenzy. The auction house had predicted worldwide interest from collectors of Alice in Wonderland memorabilia. Revealing: The back page of the letter said he was different from those who craved publicity . It comes after another letter by . Carroll emerged in 2008, cryptically answering modern-day speculation as . to whether he was a paedophile. Written to the muse for Alice in Wonderland, Alice Liddell, it read: 'Thank you for the sight of the pretty photographs, but don't keep the child in for me - I am fearfully busy - and what could [Carroll's contemporary] Miss Lloyd have been thinking of to say such things of me? 'She must have taken some remark of mine about liking children and have said to herself for ""some"" read ""all"", for ""girls"" read ""boys"" and for ""ten"" read ""two""  -  such a method of exaggeration is wholly unfounded.' Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, depicting the journey of a young girl through a fantasy world, was published under the pen name Lewis Carroll in 1865 by Macmillan and Co. Rarities: The auction also contained an unpublished letter from JRR Tolkien to his publishers discussing the difficulties of completing Return of the King, the third part of his famous Lord of the Rings trilogy . The author's own illustrations were replaced by those of John Tenniel, a more accomplished artist already famous for his work on Punch magazine. The phenomenal success of the stories was followed in 1871 by his sequel Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There. Even Queen Victoria wrote personally to the author saying how much she enjoyed his work. Carroll died shortly before his 66th birthday in 1898 from pneumonia. By the time of his death, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland had become the most popular children's book in England. By 1932, it was one of the most popular in the world.","Letter written to a friend from Oxford in 1891 has sold for £11,875 .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . A Chechen warlord who has claimed responsibility for a string of deadly attacks in Russia in recent years has reportedly been killed. The apparent death of Doku Umarov was announced by a website sympathetic to Islamist militants fighting Russian rule in the North Caucasus. The death of Russia's most wanted man, who called for attacks on last month's Winter Olympics in Sochi, has been reported before by the Kremlin-backed leader of the Chechnya region, but not by Umarov's sympathisers. Chechen warlord Doku Umarov who has claimed responsibility for attacks on Russia that have killed hundreds of civilians has died, according to a website sympathetic to Islamist militants fighting Russian rule . The Kavkaz Centre website called him a martyr who had 'given 20 years of his life to the Jihad', but did not say when or how Umarov had been killed. It did not say when or how he had died, but the simultaneous release of a video address by a militant introducing himself as Umarov's replacement indicated it may have been some time ago. A bearded man, identified as Ali Abu Mukhammad, says in the video posted on YouTube that he was asked to take Umarov's place. 'I am declaring that I am taking on this responsibility,' he says, wearing combat fatigues and sitting on a grassy slope with an automatic rifle at his side and a black-and-white Islamist flag behind him. A spokesman for Russia's National Anti-Terrorism Committee was quoted by state news agency RIA as saying he could not confirm Umarov was dead. But Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, who is backed by Moscow, wrote on his Instagram microblog: 'The terrorist mouthpiece reports that Doku Umarov is dead! 'Umarov was killed in a security operation, which I wrote about earlier... now it is confirmed by the rats themselves.' Jihadist: Umarov was blamed for suicide bombings in Volgograd (above) which killed 34 people at Christmas . Failed mission: Umarov had urged his fighters in a video posted online last July to use 'maximum force' to prevent Putin staging the Winter Olympics in Sochi, seen here during the closing ceremony . Umarov, a former Chechen rebel who embraced the jihadist goal of establishing a caliphate, united local militant groups in the Chechnya, Dagestan and other North Caucasus provinces under his command in 2007. His Caucasus Emirate group said it was behind suicide bombings that killed 37 people at a Moscow airport in 2011 and 40 on the Moscow subway in 2010. The group is also widely thought to have masterminded three deadly bombings that 41 in the southern Russian city of Volgograd in as many months, before Russia hosted the Winter Olympics in the Black Sea city of Sochi. Umarov, who styled himself as the Emir of the Caucasus Emirate, had urged his fighters in a video posted online last July to use 'maximum force' to prevent Putin staging the Olympics. His death would be a breakthrough for President Vladimir Putin in the fight against the militants.","Doku Umarov's death reported by site supporting rebels fighting Russia .

"By . Scarlett Russell . For most people, university is the perfect time for meeting new people and having wild, one-off experiences. But a worrying trend reported by The Debrief has found that such experiences are putting hundreds of students health at risk, as a shocking number are choosing to have unprotected sex. One 20-year-old Exeter student even admitted to the website that she’d had unprotected sex with a fellow student knowing he had chlamydia. Ready for bed? University students are shunning condoms in favour of 'nights of passion' ‘He was completely honest about contracting the disease – we were even joking about it that night – but I just let the passion get the better of me,’ said the woman, who wished to remain anonymous. ‘I knew that it was easy to treat and that there was a chance I wouldn’t get it at all, so I just thought “f**** it”. ‘I was pretty wasted at the time, which didn’t help. ‘Now that I look back, I can’t believe how reckless I was – what if he had something else?’ It might seem shocking, but she is not the only student risking their health for a night of passion. Online pharmacy www.UKMedix.com carried out research last week stating that 19 per cent of 18 to 30-year-olds would have sex with someone knowing that their potential partner had an STI. 'No condom? No problem.' Website reports trend of unsafe sex amongst British university students . And, 39 per cent of these people claim they already have had unprotected sex with someone with an STI. Another 26 per cent explained they would be happy to have sex with someone with an STI because if they used protection it would be, ‘impossible to catch it’. Some 11 per cent explained they would still have sex because they ‘always let passion get the better of them.’ Furthermore, another recent study has found that 39% of students at the prestigious Oxford University have willingly had unprotected sex. But what’s brought on this sudden disregard for safe sex? Many students at UK universities say they'd have sex with someone knowing the potential partner had an STI . ‘We see a lot of university students,’ Victoria Leonard, Nurse manager for young persons’ health service Brook in Salford and Bolton told The Debrief. ‘The number of people who have come into our services enquiring about STI testing has actually decreased in the last year, but the number of tests which come back positive has increased from 6.8% to 7.6% in only a year. ‘That’s a worrying trend.’ Linda Ahearne, who manages the sexual . health clinic at the London College of Arts, claims there is a ‘massive . STI problem,’ among students, despite raised awareness and publicity. ‘I suspect that STIs have increased amongst students in the last couple of years,’ she said. ‘Despite . all the publicity and help available, students seem to be having more . unprotected sex and are slow to get tested when they have.' William Wright – a 19-year-old first year . ergonomics student at Loughborough University – told The Debrief that . having unprotected sex with a girl was the equivalent of getting a . trophy. ‘I never wear condoms, and neither do most of the guys I know,’ he said. ‘A lot of guys I know from uni brag about not using condoms when they have sex with a girl. ‘It’s mainly because they’re uncomfortable and make you lose sensation. ‘Also, there’s nothing more unnatural than stopping stuff with a girl to strap on a bit of latex. ‘Some girls do make a point of asking, but not that many of them insist on it. ‘The way I see it, everything is so easy to treat these days that it’s not that big of a deal if you contract an STI.' How will I know if I've got an STI?Different STIs have very different symptoms. And some have no symptoms at all. But if you can see or feel symptoms, these can include an unusual discharge from the vagina or penis, heavy periods or bleeding between periods, pain or burning sensation when passing urine, rashes, itching or tingling around the genitals or anus. What does a test involve?Tests for STIs vary. Lots of services also offer urine testing, some can mean just taking a swab from the cervix or tip of the penis. Sometimes you can swab yourself, other times a doctor or nurse will do the swab. Others involve taking a blood sample. Your health advisor can talk you through what will happen with the tests and anything you are worried about. Can you get sexually transmitted infections from oral sex?Yes. Some STIs, including Chlamydia, Genital Herpes, Gonorrhoea, Genital Warts and HIV, are passed on through oral sex. To reduce the risk of infection, use a condom for oral sex. What happens if the test says I have an STI?Your clinic will encourage you to talk to your current partner and sometimes to your previous partners. This is so they can also be tested. And remember, most STIs are treatable with antibiotics. How can I protect myself from STIs?The best form of protection is to use a condom. And you can use a condom with any other form of contraception for the ultimate in safer sex.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . It has been five years since Claudia Lawrence went missing . Police are hunting two men and two vehicles seen near the home of missing chef Claudia Lawrence, who disappeared five years ago. Detectives from North Yorkshire Police announced the dramatic turn in the search for Miss Lawrence, on the fifth anniversary of the day she failed to turn up for work at York University in 2009. Detective . Superintendent Dai Malyn, who is leading a new review of the case, has . told BBC1's Crimewatch programme that attempts to trace one particular . man could be 'hugely significant'. He was seen outside her house in Heworth Road by a witness at 6.45am on the morning of Miss Lawrence's disappearance - March 19 - and was described as 55 to 65, with grey mid-length hair, and wearing a three-quarter length sandy coloured mac. 'It's really important we trace that man.' Mr Malyn said. Police also want to find a man in his 30s, about 5ft 8in tall, with very tidy brown hair with a fringe, who was seen in the road in the week before her disappearance. 'It looked as if he was looking for an address, he was on the phone, and he had a rucksack on his back,' Mr Malyn said. 'He appeared to walk up to a green door, which we thought was Claudia's door, and a lady at the door appeared surprised, but then let the man in.' Police also want to trace the owners and users of a Vauxhall Astra van which was parked opposite her house at about 9pm on the evening of March 18, and a light hatchback car, possibly a Ford Focus, which braked unexpectedly in her road at 5.42am the next morning. 'What we want to know if why did that vehicle brake, who was in it, and did it stop to give her a lift to work,' Mr Malyn said. North Yorkshire Police said 10 people had called the incident room following last nightâ€™s broadcast. A spokesman said a further 10 people contacted the police in response to the media coverage earlier this week, taking the current total to 20 calls. Scroll down for video .

'The response to Crimewatch and the wider media appeal has been very encouraging,' he said. 'We . hope people will continue to support the Claudia Lawrence investigation . by looking at the new appeals contained on the microsite. 'The . investigation team is now taking the necessary time to assess the fresh . information and will issue an update in due course.' They have also found the DNA profile of an unknown man on a cigarette butt in the university chef's Vauxhall Corsa. North Yorkshire Police launched a review of the investigation last year after a new major crime unit was established by the force. Miss Lawrence was 35 when she was reported missing by her father, Peter, on March 20 2009. She was last seen at around 3.05pm on March 18, walking back towards her home, and that night she spoke to both her parents on the phone. It is thought something happened to her after she left for work early on March 19. Mr Malyn's team has spent two months re-examining Miss Lawrence's small, terraced home. Police have said before that Miss Lawrence's mobile and rucksack have never been found. They are also looking for the drivers of this  light hatchback car, possibly a Ford Focus, which braked unexpectedly in her road at 5.42am the next morning . 'What we want to know if why did that vehicle brake, who was in it, and did it stop to give her a lift to work,' Detective Dai Malyn said . They said her hair straighteners also appeared to be missing. Mr Malyn said: 'From the review of all the evidence available, including the fact that Claudia's bed was made and it appears that she had eaten breakfast and brushed her teeth, it is our belief that she had left for work on the morning of Thursday 19 March 2009. 'What is unusual is that Claudia's GHD hair straighteners - model number 14.4.1B and purchased in May 2007 - were missing from her home. 'From our inquiries, it is doubtful that she would take them to work in her blue and grey Karrimor bag which has also never been found.' He said techniques not available in 2009 had uncovered additional fingerprints that need to be identified. Mr Malyn said: 'There is also other DNA material from items examined in the house that have been recovered. Forensic work is ongoing in respect of these items.' His team has also found the DNA profile of an unknown man on a cigarette butt in the Vauxhall Corsa. Her sister, Ali Sims, told Crimewatch that Miss Lawrence's portrayal at the time as a manhunter was 'so unfair' The 'left-handed smoker' who was seen on a bridge with a woman on the morning Miss Lawrence vanished has never been found. Pictured: A previous reconstruction by the BBC's Crimewatch . A cigarette butt found in Miss Lawrence's car, which was being repaired when she disappeared, is being reexamined . Peter Lawrence, right, the father of Claudia, left, described the uncertainty surrounding the case as 'a cancer' The car was in a local garage at the time of the disappearance but Mr Malyn said the profile did not relate to any man who had yet come forward. Yesterday Miss Lawrence's father, Peter, discussed the 'torture' his family had suffered through five years of not knowing what has happened to her. Her sister, Ali Sims, told Crimewatch that Miss Lawrence's portrayal in the press at the time as a manhunter was 'so unfair'. 'Yes, she was pretty, she had lots of admirers, it's just how a normal 35-year-old would lead their life,' she said. 'We know that a lot of people came forward at the time, but there are still some people that we want to come forward. 'Imagine living with not knowing what has happened to a member of your family, day in day out, for five years, the wondering.

"By . Sara Smyth . A breathtakingly expensive divorce battle between a major Laura Ashley stakeholder and his wife - a former Miss Malaysia - has been branded ‘out of control’ in an extraordinary attack by a High Court judge. Foreign divorce cases like this one that are fought in England deny people in need ‘precious court time’ for more serious legal matters, said Mr Justice Holman during a taxpayer-funded hearing. He said parents who were seeking ‘precious court time to recover their children from abduction’ would be kept waiting as long as lengthy foreign divorce cases were allowed clog up the British courts. The Malaysian couple, Mr Khoo Kay Peng, 75, who owns a 40per cent stake in Laura Ashley and his estranged wife Pauline Chai, 66, have already wracked up costs of £1.6 million on what Mr Holman called ‘preliminary skirmishes’ in the extraordinary battle. Pauline Chai: Demanding £500million in her divorce from Laura Ashley stake holder Khoo Kay Peng . Mr Chai, who owns a £30million property in Hertfordshire, has alone incurred costs of £920,000 in England fighting the case. But the senior judge pointed out that the couple, who do not pay tax in Britain, are actually paying a fraction of the costs of the taxpayer-funded court hearings, have only contributed £2,355 towards six days of court fees. Mr Justice Holman said: ‘Neither of them are British citizens. Neither of them currently pays any English taxes whatsoever. ‘Very serious issues ought to arise as to just how much time of an English court these parties should be able to take up on these preliminary skirmishes, whilst squeezing out the many needy litigants who need precious court time to recover their children from abduction or seek their return from care, and other such issues.’ Pauline Chai, pictured as a former Miss Malaysia in 1969, and Malaysian businessmen Khoo Kay Peng . Ms Chai is seeking £500 million in the case, which would represent the largest divorce settlement in Britain to date. Khoo Kay Peng and Pauline Chai are the most recent in a long line of foreign couples to seek a multi-million pound divorce in the UK. Just two days ago, stay-at-home husband Weng Choy won a crucial battle to his £11million divorce settled in English court. The couple led a luxury lifestyle - with homes in Hong Kong and Malaysia, a £1million wine collection and £4.5million apartment in Kensington - but Mr Choy says he gave up his personal ambitions to allow his 'breadwinner' wife Lena Tan to pursue her career. Ms Tan had fought having the divorce heard in Britain on the grounds that the Malaysian couple do not have any business interests in Britain - just property. It is thought she wanted to have the case heard in Malaysia as British judges are widely considered to be 'generous' towards the partners of rich spouses. But judges this week ruled Mr Choy could have his case heard in the UK because he had been 'habitually resident' for a year before the split. In 2011, the late Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky divorced his second wife in the costliest marriage split in British legal history. The massive payment dwarfed the previous UK divorce record of £48million and came just two years before Mr Berezovsky's death. It . has not yet been decided whether the full divorce hearing will be heard . in England or Malaysia. But the top judge said it ‘borders on the . fantastic’ that ’10 days of precious court time’ have been reserved in . October for the High Court to consider where the case will be heard. A one-day hearing last week for an application for maintenance cost Ms Chai £55,000. The judge described the cost of the worldwide litigation as ‘completely out of control’. ‘Phenomenal costs are being spent, a phenomenal amount of court time worldwide has already been taken up,’ he said. Ms Chai now lives at Rossway Park, a £30 million, 1,000-acre estate near Berkhamsted in Hertfordshire. The couple, who married in 1970 and have five children, lived a lavish lifestyle with properties in England, Kuala Lumpur and Australia, and an estate in Canada. The judge said Dr Khoo must pay his wife a further £70,000 for living costs and £100,000 for legal costs for the seven weeks before the next hearing in April. Ms Chai, who was Miss Malaysia in 1969, is represented by the ‘Diva of Divorce’ Ayesha Vardag, who said these legal fees are ‘small beer for the ultra rich’. ‘When you have a couple trying to divide up billions of hundreds of millions, the legal costs are generally high, because there’s enough at stake to make it worth it. It’s the biggest financial transaction most people will ever undergo. ‘Big cases are what make English justice affordable for the needy,’ she told the Independent. Timothy Bishop, QC who represents Dr Khoo last year said that allowing the case to be held in London would bolster ‘the ill-gotten reputation of this country for being the divorce capital of the world’.","Justice Holman said foreign divorce cases were clogging up British courts .

Scroll down for video . A disabled man was beaten up and thrown off the side of a bridge in Argentina by striking trade unionists after he begged them to let him pass so that he could take his pregnant wife to hospital . Razl Lezcano, 27, who has an artificial leg, had decided not to wait for an ambulance and instead put his three-month pregnant wife on the back of the motorbike when she reported getting severe stomach pains . His tearful wife Ana said: 'There was a large crowd at the bridge just before the hospital and he got off the bike and went over to ask if they would let us past. 'They ignored him and when he asked a second time, one of them punched him in the face. 'Then the others started beating him up and then they robbed him, stealing his wallet and mobile phone before picking him up above their heads - taking him to the side of the bridge and throwing him onto the road below. When they got close to the hospital they were stopped at a Puente Avellaneda bridge in the Argentinian capital of Buenos Aires by members of the transport workers union who have blocked the road in a protest to demand more pay and better conditions . Tearful wife Ana (wearing white) said: 'There was a large crowd at the bridge just before the hospital and he got off the bike and went over to ask if they would let us past' 'They ignored him and when he asked a second time, one of them punched him in the face,' she said . 'They could see that he was disabled, he has had an orthopaedic leg since he was 17. 'They have even tried to steal that but they couldn't get it off, so they just threw him and the leg over the edge of the bridge. They were like animals, they didn't care if he died.' Images of the brutal attack on the young father caused shock in the South American country and prompted Juan Corvalan, the head of SUPA union whose members are accused of carrying out the attack, to step down. The man was dragged onto the bridge and beaten as she wife watched in fear . Mr Lezcano is thrown off the bridge and into the road before being helped up . He said: 'This is not the image I want for my union. I am a worker myself, not only a union leader. I was deeply upset by the images.' But the union was criticised further after nobody visited the-critically ill man and there was no offer of compensation to help with the medical bills and suffering for him and his family. Doctors meanwhile confirmed that despite the woman's stomach pains the unborn child is still developing well, although they warned that the current stress was not good for the pregnancy.","Disabled Razl Lezcano, 27, was driving his pregnant wife Ana .

"By . Associated Press . The recordings of frustrated emergency responders have been released showing the havoc that the George Washington Bridge closure wreaked in Fort Lee, New Jersey after Governor Chris Christie’s aides plotted retribution against a political enemy. Responders who were searching for quick routes to get an ambulance to an elderly woman in distress and police to the hunt for a missing boy frantically tried to find quicker routes to the emergencies but were stuck in unmoving traffic like thousands of residents. 'Fort Lee traffic is a nightmare,' one dispatcher is heard saying in the call that came as police responded to the report of a missing 4-year-old boy. Target: Hours of emergency dispatcher calls were released Friday showing how responders had to deal with unimaginable traffic on the George Washington Bridge (pictured in January) About 10 minutes later, someone tried to ascertain the scope of the gridlock as responders tried to get to the scene on September 9. 'It's backed up, probably, all the way into Cliffside,' he said, meaning the neighboring town of Cliffside Park. That same day, someone in Fort Lee called for an ambulance but a dispatcher had to be creative on the spot in issuing directions to deal with the traffic jam that came as a result of lane closures on the GW Bridge into New York City. 'The George Washington Bridge is totally gridlocked,' a dispatcher said, giving alternate directions to a driver to help circumvent the traffic. Hours of similar dispatch tapes were released Friday that span the week in September when traffic jams clogged streets and trapped motorists in their cars for hours. A 91-year-old woman died at her Fort Lee . home while the gridlock was at its height, but family members have said . they don't believe the traffic was a factor in her death. Plot: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's chief of staff Bridget Kelly (seen at right with him on September 12, 2013 as the lane closures were in effect) allegedly planned the 'traffic study' to get back at the mayor of Fort Lee for not endorsing Christie . An Associated Press review of dispatch tapes and call logs and interviews from neighboring towns shows the traffic jams appeared not to lead to anyone's death or seriously compromise their medical care. The missing 4-year-old was also found safe. The 911 records, obtained over several weeks through public records requests, included reports of chest pains, traffic collisions, false fire alarms and a dead goose in a parking lot. And dispatchers not only had to deal with the usual phalanx of calls for medical help. 'We're getting calls from irate motorists,' one dispatcher said. In each call, dispatchers and first responders voiced frustration and exasperation as streets that normally carry heavy amounts of traffic during the morning rush hour turned into virtual parking lots. 'Lemoine is packed. Fletcher's packed,' a responder radioed in about streets near the George Washington Bridge in Fort Lee. Co-conspirator: Other documents released earlier this week show that David Wildstein, Christie's number 2 at the Port Authority who helped approve the closures with Kelly, joked about the traffic and didn't take it seriously . Officials said response times were doubled or quadrupled because of the traffic. The traffic jams occurred from September 9 to 13, and have led to dozens of people being subpoenaed. Those summoned include many in Christie's inner circle, his re-election commission and the state Republican party. At least four people have lost their jobs because of the traffic jams, which were believed to be aimed at Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich after he did not endorse Christie for re-election. Christie has apologized for the lane closures and said he was 'embarrassed and humiliated' by a former aide who called for the shutdown. The governor also has said he was not involved and had no knowledge of the lane closures beforehand. The U.S. Attorney for New Jersey and the state legislature continue to investigate. Town officials have said the traffic jams caused unnecessary delays for first responders.","Emergency dispatch calls have been released showing how responders struggled to help ambulances get to critical situations .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A Florida store worker who was fired from JC Penney after revealing sales strategies claims the chain is trying to silence him. Bob Blatchford appeared on the Today show last July to disclose how prices were nearly doubled before the same items went on sale at the original price. After firing the custom decorating studio coordinator, the store has filed a petition claiming his statement on their prices was confidential business information. Speaking out: Bob Blatchford lost his job at JC Penney two days after appearing on Today, above, to discuss sales prices . Blatchford claims the chain is targeting him to try to prevent him from speaking out more about the sale practices. When he appeared on Today, he said: 'I saw a lot of pricing teams going through the store, raising the prices, mostly doubling - towels and clothing. Then they would go on sale, and they wouldn't always go on sale for 50 percent off.' 'Not only was it a fake sale, but they were actually paying more than they would have been previously,' he added. After being fired, Blatchford tried to get unemployment benefits, but his application was contested by JC Penney. While the price strategy Blatchford talked about is considered by many as an open secret, the store has filed a petition with the American Arbitration . Association, the Huffington Post reported. Trade secrets: JC Penney has filed an arbitration petition against its ex-employee who is accused of sharing confidential information . Priced up: A cookware set originally sold for $200 was marked up to $250 and then put on sale at the first price . In it, the chain described Blatchford's revelations on Today as 'trade secret, proprietary and confidential . business information'. JC Penney also accused Blatchford of having an 'unbalanced vendetta' against them, and claimed he had a 'love of media attention'. It told Huffington Post it was forced to file an arbitration petition to protect customers, and claimed Blatchford had confidential business and customer records. Around the time of his appearance on Today, JC Penney had reverted to its old pricing strategies after replacing its chief executive, Ron Johnson, who had pledged to eliminate 'fake prices'. Sales dropped by $4.3 billion and customers of the 112-year-old chain complained. Johnson's successor reinstated the coupons and sales strategy to win back customers, which led to consumer groups started to investigate the discounts. Competition: JC Penney tries to attract customers with sales and coupons . According to the Huffington Post, several examples of sales prices that were higher than the original price were found. One such example was a stainless-steel kettle that had been $40 was priced up at $58 before it appeared in the sale at $39.99. JC Penney and its retail competitor Kohl's were accused in a lawsuit of violating consumer protection guidelines in California. However, Federal Trade Commission guidelines say if the price has been offered on a regular basis for a reasonably sustained period of time then the practice is legitimate.","Bob Blatchford lost his job last July after discussing sales strategies on TV .

"By . Richard Spillett . One of Britain's biggest hoarders is selling nearly everything he owns after finding new love. Anthony Skipper, 50, couldn't bare see anything go to waste and quickly amassed a huge collection of unwanted machinery, vehicles, household gadgets and furniture. But, after he started seeing a new girlfriend this year, he vowed to change his lifestyle and is now selling off more than 800 items he has collected. Anthony Skipper is to hold an auction this weekend, selling off more than 800 items he has collected in years as an obsessive hoarder . Mr Skipper couldn't stand seeing anything go to waste and collected hundreds of items of furniture, machinery and anything else that had been thrown away . The items, which range from classic American sports cars to vintage farm machinery, will go under the hammer in Lenwade, Norfolk, on Saturday. Mr Skipper said: 'I’ve always been fascinated by buying old things and doing them up - I’ve collected all of my life. 'But when my marriage fell apart, about eight years ago, I went into overdrive and just collected everything and anything to help fill in what was missing from my life.' Anthony, of Felthorpe, Norfolk, decided to turn his life around after he started seeing Karen Bradley, 51, of Whitwell, Derbyshire, in January. Mr Skipper vowed to change his life and sell off his huge hoard after meeting new girlfriend Karen Bradley . The more than 700 items to be auctioned include six lawnmowers, four garden wendy houses and assorted pieces of farm machinery . This giant Winnebago camper van is also up for grabs in the auction, which Mr Skipper hopes will earn him around £30,000 . He first met fellow rock 'n' roll music-lover Karen around 30 years ago but they got back in touch with each other again through Facebook. He said: 'I came to a realisation around Christmas time that I didn’t need all of this stuff and needed to move on with my life. 'It came around the same time as I started a new relationship and I’ve now got a totally new outlook on life.' The most valuable item up for grabs will be his 1965 Chevrolet C10 panel van, priced at between £4,000 and £5,000. Also up for sale is a 30ft Roma . caravan, a Winnebago, old bicycles, furniture, sheds, a fruit machine, a . carousel horse, a hay cutter, books, old tools and flower pots. Anthony hopes to pocket £30,000 if everything goes - including his eight motor vehicles. He added: 'You see these television shows about hoarders and think, how can people be like that? But that was me. 'I didn’t realise how bad it had become until I started gathering all this stuff together, which took a good few weeks. 'I’ve collected things from auctions, bought stuff off friends and picked things up in skips. I can just about remember where everything here came from and how much I paid for it all.' 'We hoarders are a special breed and I’ll always collect things - but I’ll never be as bad as this again' Norwich Livestock Market, which is organising the sale, have described Mr Skipper's collection as an 'Aladdin's cave'. Among the higher-end items up for grabs are a large Winebago Motor Home, fitted with a Chevrolet Engine, and a fully-operational 1965 V8 Chevrolet van. Other vehicles in the auction include a 'flat-bed drag racing truck', fitted with a Jaguar engine, a 1994 Chevrolet pick-up truck, a Mercedes saloon, two caravans and numerous trailers (pictured). The list of 642 lots also features some more bizarre items, collected by Mr Skipper during his years as a compulsive hoarder. The auction list includes seven lawnmovers, 24 desks, five chandeliers, hundreds of work tools, 11 fire extinguishers, more than 20 smoke alarms, five flood lights, 11 packs of laminate flooring and five children's wendy houses. Among the stranger items listed are 'a goat tether chain', a 'very heavy' German brass lamp, 'slurry tanker pipes' and 'a quantity of 8ft railway sleepers'.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The parents of the teen who killed four people while driving drunk has paid undisclosed sums to three of his victims but has still not settled with the fourth victim. Ethan Couch, the teen whose lawyer argued that he had 'affluenza' after his wealthy parents coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility, is currently in state custody and is expected to receive alcohol and drug rehab. Youth pastor Brian Jennings and Hollie Boyles had pulled over separately at the side of a Burleson, Texas road on June 15 to help Breanna Mitchell who had a tire blowout. Turning back time: Ethan Couch, pictured at a February hearing, was sentenced to 10 years' probation in a drunken-driving crash that killed four people and his wealthy relatives have reached settlements with two families of victims . Blaming the parents: Tonya Couch, left, and Fred Couch, Ethan's parents, previously offered to pay to have him receive treatment at a California rehab facility that costs $450,000-per-year . Couch was speeding at around 70 miles per hour and he hit the gathered group- killing those three people and Mrs Boyle's daughter Shelby who was with her at the time. He also seriously injured two of his friends who were sitting in the back of the flatbed truck that he was driving at the time of the crash. So far, The Dallas Morning News reports that Couch's relatives have reached undisclosed settlements with the Mitchell and Boyles family but have not yet agreed on a deal with Jennings' family. There have been no reports of a deal with his injured friends' families, including that of Sergio Lemuus who was left paralyzed after the accident. It . was revealed during the trial that Couch's blood-alcohol level was 0.24 - . three times the adult limit, though minors aren't allowed any alcohol in . their system - and that he was also on the prescription drug Valium . when he started the chain reaction of crashes. The 16-year-old's lawyer Reagan Wynn and prosecutor Richard Alpert would not identify the facility where Couch will go or where it is located. Killed: Hollie Boyles, 52, and her daughter, Shelby Boyles, 21, were helping out the driver of a broken down SUV when they were struck and killed by Couch's out-of-control pickup. Their relatives have settled with the Couches . Victims: Breanna Mitchell,  and Brian Jennings, 41, were both killed in the horrific crash and Jennings relatives have not yet reached a settlement with Couch's parents . The teen's family previously had offered . to pay for Couch to go to a $450,000-a-year rehabilitation center near . Newport Beach, California. There is no minimum amount of time Couch must spend in the facility before his release, prosecutor Riley Shaw said. The judge warned that he could face prison time if he runs away from the facility or violates any other terms of his probation. Wynn ripped the media and the public's focus on ‘affluenza’ and said that his client was misunderstood. He said reporting of the Couch case had ‘so twisted the facts that were actually presented in court that I don't think the truth will ever be able to come out now.’ ‘It was ridiculous to think that we walked into court and said, 'Oh, this is a rich white kid,' and she decided to probate him,’ he said. Scene: The accident happened on the night of June 15, 2013 on this road in Burleson, Texas . No jail: Ethan pictured here in December, avoided jail for killing four and injuring two more after his attorney argued that he was coddled by his parents so much that he didn't understand the difference between right and wrong . But Alpert accused Wynn of hypocrisy, pointing out that a defense witness made the comment in the first place. ‘His witnesses don't say things by accident,’ Alpert said. ‘So they thought maybe that would help — that's my interpretation — and it blew up on them. It was a stupid thing to say.’ Asking Judge Jean Boyd in February to give Couch jail time for intoxication assault was a last-ditch effort by prosecutors, who have said they have almost no way to appeal the judge's sentence in the case. Alpert said he hoped the Couch case would lead the Texas Legislature to allow juries to sentence some juvenile defendants. The case has already spurred calls for potential changes. Texas Lt. Governor David Dewhurst, who serves as president of the Senate, has asked for a study of sentencing guidelines in intoxication manslaughter cases. Left alone to live in luxury: This is the mansion in Burleson that Ethan  was allowed to live in unattended, and where he hosted wild parties .","Ethan Couch's family has reached settlements with two of the three families of his victims .

"By . Paul Donnelley . An Ohio university student drowned trying to save his dog from an icy grave. Kyle Miller, 21, was kayaking with his friend Austin Gifford, 19, on Saturday morning on one of the Darby Bend Lakes west of Columbus when his Scottish terrier who he had taken with him fell into the frigid waters. The two men, neither of whom were wearing life jackets, tried desperately to reach the dog and in doing so, both kayaks capsized. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Animal lover: Kyle Miller, a 21-year-old university student, seen here with a baby big cat, drowned while trying to save his pet dog from an icy lake in Ohio . Kyle tried to hang on to his capsized boat but the water which was below freezing (30F or -1C) proved too much. His strength quickly ebbed away and he went under around 11am, while Austin was able to swim to shore and seek help. Kind eyes: Kyle Miller gave up his promising track and field career to work with animals and was intending to move to Alaska to do so . The Darby Bend Lakes area of the park is a former quarry and is up to 80 feet deep in places, and both Kyle and his dog were nowhere to be found. Officers from the Ohio Division of Natural Resources Division of Watercraft used sonar equipment built specially for deep water to find Kyle’s body, which was recovered at 2pm on Sunday some 71 feet below the surface. The dog’s body was also recovered on Sunday afternoon. His family watched distraught as the rescuers brought his corpse to the surface. Understandably, they were too upset to talk to the waiting media. Kyle, a student at the private Otterbein University and former track athlete, was reading zoo and conservation science. He had hoped to move to Alaska to work with animals. ‘He was a talented athlete and a great young man,’ Dave Lehman, his former coach, told the Columbus Dispatch. ‘We all feel fortunate to have known him.’ His lecturer Professor Anna Young was too upset to talk but released an email statement: ‘Kyle was always so calm and had such kind eyes. He would have been an excellent ambassador for wildlife. It’s tragedy to lose someone so young and passionate.’ Austin was released from the hospital Saturday night.","Kyle Miller, 21, was not wearing a life jacket on lake in Ohio .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . A haggard-looking Bridget Kelly, the former Chris Christie deputy chief of staff whose emails and text messages launched the 'Bridgegate' scandal, appeared in a New Jersey courtroom as her lawyers sparred with prosecutors over whether she can use the Fifth Amendment to block document subpoenas. Kelly arrived at the courthouse for her first public appearance since the national fascination with her part in the scandal began, appearing none too pleased to be there but resigned to her personal stake in the rulings that will likely determine her legal future. Gurn and bear it: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's former deputy chief of staff Bridget Anne Kelly faced a crush of media as she arrived at Mercer County Court in Trenton, New Jersey . Kelly appeared in court but didn't testify; her lawyer argued that she shouldn't have to turn over documents to Democrats investigating the 'Bridgegate' scandal . Under fire: Kelly arrived at the courthouse for her first public appearance since the national fascination with her part in the scandal began . Reid Schar, a prosecutor famous for . putting Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich behind bars, argued Tuesday that . his subpoenas aren't a 'fishing expedition' but demand specific records . that a Democrat-dominated legislative committee knows exist. The . committee hired Schar in January to lead a probe into the state's . Republican governor and his appointees, at least three of whom are . linked to an apparent plot to snarl traffic in the New Jersey town of . Fort Lee as payback for its mayor's failure to endorse Christie's 2013 . re-election bid. Kelly and Bill Stepien, a former . senior Christie campaign official, insist that the Fifth Amendment's . right against self-incrimination should protect them from turning over . documents that might point to their guilt in the alleged scheme. Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson quizzed Schar on the former officials' legal argument that giving documents to Schar would be tantamount to testifying against themselves – something the Fifth Amendment says they can avoid. 'If that were true,' Schar responded, 'essentially every single subpoena would be open to the Fifth Amendment.' Michael Critchley, Kelly's attorney, said Monday that she would show up personally in court, a step she didn't have to take. Kelly, famous for emailing Port Authority official David Wildstein that it was 'time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,' was fired in January after Gov. Christie confronted her. The governor has insisted that he had no knowledge of the September 2013 closures of lanes leading from the town to the iconic George Washington Bridge, beginning on the first day of school and lasting for five days. More than a dozen figures in the Bridgegate debacle have already complied with subpoenas similar to those Kelly and Stepien have rebuffed. But those two have held out, leading to speculation that they are angling for legal immunity. Wildstein is also defying investigators, refusing to testify in a January hearing. Schar argued Tuesday that he shouldn't have to promise he won't charge Kelly or Stepien with a crime in order to get emails, text messages and phone call logs that might describe her involvement in the plot. Under fire: Kelly is accused of being part of a plot to deliberately snarl up traffic on the George Washington Bridge to get back at a mayor who refused to endorse Christie . Highs and lows: Kelly seemed relieved after she was clear of the cameras outside the court. Her taking the Fifth has led some to speculate she could be angling for legal immunity at a later date . Bill Stepien (L) is a former Christie campaign manager who was implicated in a string of emails related to the bidge closures . The pugnacious Christie's approval numbers have dropped but he remains a viable 2016 presidential contender, aided by the direct, no-nonsense style that he brought to a town hall meeting with constituents on March 4 . Stepien's lawyer, Kevin Marino, argued that the legislature's Democrats don't have the right to demand thousands of documents that they suspect might suggest his participation in a partisan attack on Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. But Schar told Judge Jacobson that emails already in his possession point to the existence of many others. 'I'm really sorry for causing you this much stress this close to November,' Stepien wrote in one email. Marino read all five emails aloud in court, dismissing Schar's argument and saying they don't constitute 'reasonable particularized knowledge' or a 'foregone conclusion' – the legal standards – that more documents are waiting to be discovered. Marino argued that the government's position is that 'we don't have any idea what exists, but we'd like you to tell us.' Tuesday's hearing is crucial to New Jersey legislators' continuing investigation into the actions of Christie's staffers, because if Jacobson quashes the subpoenas, all three of the key Bridgegate figures will have blocked committee Democrats.","Bridget Kelly and Bill Stepien are defying Democrats on a state legislative committee, refusing to turn over documents that might incriminate them .

"By . Nathan Klein . A cyclist was knocked to the ground after being 'doored' while riding down a busy Australian street - and then abused by the passengers responsible. The female cyclist was riding along the inside lane of Collins St in Melbourne when the rear door of a taxi opened, causing her to crash heavily to the ground. The footage, captured by a camera mounted on the handlebars of the bicycle, shows her riding past several cars before the taxi door is flung open. Caught on camera: A cyclist riding through the streets of Melbourne was knocked to the ground after being 'doored', and then abused by the passengers responsible. In the video, the woman immediately demands that the taxi's three passengers hand over their details, telling them 'I’ve got it all on camera'. One of the men apologies, but another tells her riding was 'dangerous'. All three men refuse to give their names. 'Do you know what you just did? You just doored me. That’s an offence,' the cyclist said. She pursues them along Collins St towards Swanston St, and they begin to abuse her. 'You ride up the inside of a car that’s stopped at the lights — you are a fool,' one man said. That was followed by: 'The way people like you ride around is disgusting.' Ignored: The cyclist demanded the men's details before being abused . 'It's not an offence': Once the male passengers get out of the taxi, they tell the cyclist that they had done nothing wrong and refused to give out their details . Cycling advocates say the action clearly amounted to an offence, known as 'dooring'. Victoria Police are now investigating the incident after a 65-year-old man from Brighton contacted them after seeing the video footage on the news, she said. Victorian Greens leader Greg Barber told 7 News the footage was 'distressing'. 'The really distressing part is that those men are arguing with the cyclist, saying she is in the wrong, when they are at fault,' Mr Barber said. Victoria’s road rules state that it is an offence, punishable by a fine of more than $350, to cause a hazard to a person or vehicle by opening a car door.","Cyclist knocked to the ground after a passenger opened a taxi door as she was riding along a busy Australian street .

Scroll Down for Video . Burning: The 1994 El Dorado burns in the parking lot of the McDonald's on Beach Boulevard near St. Johns Bluff in Jacksonville, Florida on Sunday . 'They were going at it,' said witness Sabryna Maré of the couple who were standing behind her in line. 'She was saying she wanted this and wanted that, and she wanted either a McFlurry or an ice cream on top and he was not in for it. Then he was yelling at her saying he's not going to do it.' At this point the argument escalated out of hand and the woman began making seemingly outrageous threats. 'Next thing you know, she says 'I'm going to blow it up,' and we were wondering what are you going to blow up? ' said Maré. 'I am going to blow it up': The man quickly discovered that the woman was talking about his car . Smoke: The firefighters arrived to put the flames out and couldn't find any trace of the man or woman . At this point the woman burst out of the restaurant and within minutes the shocked patrons of the McDonalds saw 1994 El Dorado in flames in the parking lot. 'She got something out of the car that happened to be a bottle and then she got gasoline from who knows where. Then she poured everything all over it and next thing you know there was a match and it was up in flames,' said Maré. Witnesses tried to put the fire out but when the firefighters arrived the car was beyond help. The woman who is thought to have started the fire disappeared out of the parking lot and the police are keen to speak to her and the man who vanished after the flames were put out. 'It was one second here, one second there, gone. Later we saw the car parked on the side of Beach Boulevard,' said Maré. Jacksonville Sheriff's Office officers said the license plate did not match the vehicle.","The argument over the ice cream treat happened on Sunday morning in Jacksonville, Florida .

"By . Kate Lyons . The cameraman who filmed Steve Irwin’s final moments has spoken for the first time about the Crocodile Hunter’s shocking death. Justin Lyons was in the water with Irwin when he was killed by a stingray eight years ago and told how the sting ray stabbed his mate ‘hundreds of times’, including one blow that punctured his heart. Mr Lyons, whom Steve Irwin described as his ‘right-hand man,’ said they were cruising in an inflatable boat off the coast of far north Queensland looking for something to film for a documentary when they spotted the giant stingray. Tragic end: Steve Irwin's cameraman and 'right-hand man' Justin Lyons has shared what happened in the Crocodile Hunter's final moments . They filmed the stingray, which measured eight feet across, for some time before they decided to get one last shot of Steve Irwin swimming up behind the animal. ‘All of a sudden it propped on its front and started stabbing wildly with its tail, hundreds of strikes in a few seconds,’ Mr Lyons told Channel Ten’s Studio 10 programme. He said the stingray probably thought Steve Irwin’s shadow was a tiger shark and acted to defend itself. Mr Lyons did not realise that anything was wrong with his friend at first, as he was filming the stingray swim away. ‘It wasn’t until I panned the camera back [and saw] that Steve was standing in a huge pool of blood that I realised something had gone wrong.’ He managed to get the injured Crocodile Hunter back onto the boat, where he saw the extent of his injuries. He said the stingray had a ‘jagged barb’ which ‘went through his chest like hot butter.’ ‘He had a about a two-inch injury over his heart with blood-fluid coming out of it,’ said Mr Lyons. ‘He was in extraordinary pain. [The stingrays] have got venom on their barb, so I’m sure it was excruciatingly painful. 'Hundreds of strikes': Cameraman Justin Lyons demonstrated the stingray's fatal blows . The Irwins pose for a family portrait before his death. From left: Bindi, Steve, Robert and Terri . ‘Even if we’d been able to get him into an emergency ward at that moment, we probably wouldn’t have been able to save him because the damage to his heart was massive.' Mr Lyons, who has not spoken about the tragic death of his friend before, held back tears as he described Mr Irwin’s last moments. ‘As we’re motoring back, I’m screaming at one of the other crew in the boat to put their hand over the wound and we’re saying to him things like, “Think of your kids, Steve. Hang on, hang on, hang on.” ‘He just sort of calmly looked up at me and said, “I’m dying.” And that was the last thing he said.’ Mr Lyons could not believe what had happened to his seemingly invincible best mate. ‘We thought he was going to live forever,’ he said. ‘We hoped for a miracle, so I literally did CPR on him for over an hour before we got him to … the medics.’ But the Crocodile Hunter was pronounced dead by medics at the scene. Mr Irwin had a rule that his crew were to keep filming no matter who was injured and so the stingray’s attack, the CPR on Steve and his death were all caught on camera. Mr Lyons insists he does not know where the footage is and believes it should never be aired out of respect for his family. ‘I don't know what's happened to it and I hope it would never see the light of day,’ he said .

"By . Mark Duell . A flooring salesman who left school at 16 is set to become one of Britain’s richest men as he stands to pocket £520million when the firm behind the hit game Candy Crush floats on the stock market. Mel Morris, a former Derby County FC director, has a 12 per cent stake in King Digital Entertainment - maker of the addictive game involving moving candies to make a line of three in the same colour. The father-of-two was also behind dating website uDate, launched in 1998, which was sold for £100million in 2003 and netted him £20million, some of which was later invested into King.

Entrepreneur: Mr Morris was also behind dating website uDate, launched in 1998, which was sold for £100million in 2003 and netted him £20million, some of which was later invested into King . Mr Morris, 58, who was born in Littleover, Derbyshire, set up a hardwood flooring firm and property company in Spain upon leaving school - and was a management consultant by the age of 20. Later on came uDate, whose success was put down to matching innovative technology with a large customer base. Three years after that sale, he was part of a consortium that took over Derby County. Mr Morris, who is married, then sold his internet security company Prevx in 2010 - which produced anti-virus software for businesses and individuals - for more than £10million to US giant Webroot. It was only revealed last month that Mr Morris was a significant player in King, after the firm’s filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission named him as chairman of the business. He is expected to shoot into The Sunday . Times Rich List - with his £520million from Candy Crush set to put him . in between the likes of Harry Potter author JK Rowling and entrepreneur . Peter Jones. Chief executive: Italian entrepreneur Riccardo Zacconi (pictured), 47, who has led King with Toby Rowland since co-founding the company in Sweden in 2003, will hold a 9.5 per cent stake after the IPO . Mr Morris lived from 1996 to 2004 in a three-bedroom home in an area of Belper, Derbyshire, with an average house value of £470,000, although his residence since then is not known. King - which gets 78 per cent of its revenue from Candy Crush, the most downloaded free app last year - expects to be worth £4.5billion when going public on the Nasdaq in the US this month. Candy Crush launched on Facebook in April 2012. The London-based firm’s game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later. The game - which was the top revenue-grossing app in 2013 - has been downloaded more than 500million times. The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra ‘lives’.

The basic games are free, but players must pay for add-ons or extra 'lives' Mr Zacconi, who lives in London with . his Chinese-Swedish wife and son, is in line for a £300million payday. He co-founded the firm with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne. The chief . executive of King - which was originally launched with the idea of . specialising in games that could be played on Yahoo! - also worked with . uDate until it was sold in 2003. Mr Zacconi lived in a three-bedroom flat worth £2.2million in South Kensington, central London, from 2007 to 2010, before moving to a three-bedroom house worth £1.4million in Bayswater, west London. King . wants to benefit from focusing on the £10billion market for mobile game . apps and avoid the fate of rivals such as Zynga, which has struggled to . make its games as popular on phones as online. King . said yesterday that it expects to price its initial public offering . (IPO) at $21-$24 (£13-14) per share, valuing it slightly higher than .

King was originally launched with the idea of specialising in games to be played on Yahoo! Twitter’s successful IPO in November and a surge in Facebook’s shares have fuelled speculation of other tech firms going public, including music-streaming service Spotify and lodging website AirBnB. Stellar popularity has now helped King's revenue grow to £361million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from £13million in the first quarter of 2012. But most of that growth was fulled by Candy Crush rather than any of the 180 games King provides through mobile phones, Facebook and its own website. King, which has more than 650 employees, has focused on launching more games on mobile platforms, a market that analysts expect will grow to £10billion this year from just £4billion in 2010. Big hit: Candy Crush launched on Facebook in April 2012. The London-based firm's game was released on Apple devices in November that year, followed by an app for Android devices a month later . Zynga's stock price has halved since its IPO in 2011 as the popularity of the Farmville game waned, while Finland's Rovio has struggled to replicate the success of Angry Birds. King's IPO is scheduled to be priced on March 25, and the stock will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ‘KING’ on March 26. Of the 22.2million shares on sale in the offering, the company will sell 15.5million, while stockholders, including Apax Ventures, will sell 6.7million shares, King said. Unlike most other tech companies that have gone public recently, King is profitable, has no debt and generated positive cash flow from operations for each of the last nine years. LORD SUGAR . Born to a poor Jewish family in Hackney, east London, Lord Sugar famously started out with just £100 in 1967, selling aerials out of the back of a van. But he sold his electronics firm Amstrad for £125million in 2007 and now has £150million cash as well as a large property portfolio. Sugar is also known for his catchphrase 'You're fired' on his entrepreneurial BBC TV show The Apprentice. The 66-year-old former Tottenham Hotspur FC chairman is now in 98th place on The Sunday Times Rich List with an estimated worth of £860million. DUNCAN BANNATYNE . Former car trader Duncan Bannantyne famously bought an ice cream van for £450 before eventually selling 'Duncan's Super Ices' for £28,000. The grandfather-of-two, who is known best for featuring on BBC TV show Dragon's Den - for which he is paid £950 a day - also sold his nursing home business for £46million in 1996 and now operates Bannatyne’s Health Clubs. But the 65-year-old has suffered financial problems and huge company debts more recently, with his divorce from wife Joanne last year costing him £345million. JULIAN DUNKERTON . Julian Dunkerton, whose plan to become a doctor fell down when he only got three Es at A-level, decided at 19 that he wanted to launch a fashion business. So he worked in a factory and as a fruit picker to raise enough money to rent a shop, before opening an indoor market stall. His Cheltenham-based business made £16,000 in his first year, 1985 - and his Superdry clothing is now favoured by celebrities including ex-footballer David Beckham and actress Kate Winslet. The father-of-four now receives a salary of £400,000. Last year his company SuperGroup reported a 22 per cent surge in pre-tax profits and annual revenue of £360million.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The 54-year-old truck driver dubbed the 'Vampire Trucker' after accusations arose that he kidnapped at least two women and kept them as sex slaves in his semi has prior arrest warrants for assault, it has emerged. Timothy Jay Vafeades made headlines last week after it was revealed he's accused of holding women hostage for months as they criss-crossed America and even forcing one to wear false 'fangs' with him. On Monday it was uncovered that he's been wanted for domestic abuse in Florida since November 2012. Scroll down for video . Bad trucker: Timothy Jay Vafeades is accused of kidnapped at least two women and holding them against their will in his semitrailer while he traveled the country for work. One of his victims says he wore dentures with vampire fangs, which he seems to be donning in the above Twitter picture . The Miami Herald first reported the finding and the warrant on a misdemeanor charge in Polk County may be read here. The trucker 'obsessed . with vampires' is, more seriously, accused of keeping women as unwilling sex slaves while he . traveled the country for work. One of those victims includes a 19-year-old relative from Florida. While . being held captive, Vafeades filed down a 19-year-old victim's teeth . with a Dremel after telling her she 'had an ugly smile' and forced her . to wear dentures while he wore his own pair with vampire fangs. The truck driver made his first appearance in Minnesota court last Wednesday as he faces charges of kidnapping, transportation for illegal sexual activity and posession of child pornography. If convicted he could face between 10 years and life in prison. Intimidator: Vafeades successfully kept two women hostage in his semitrailer for months at a time by threatening to beat them if they made eye contact or spoke with anyone . An arrest warrant filed Tuesday in . Salt Lake City claims Vafeades kidnapped the 19-year-old relative who . had come from Florida in May 2013 to work with him on his truck, named . the 'Twilight Express.' Public . records indicate Vafeades has been running Twilight Express Trucking . since 2009, meaning the business name could very well be a reference to . the popular vampire book series by Stephenie Meyer which was turned into . a film franchise starring Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. On . their first night on the road, the victim recalls waking up to Vafeades . sexually assaulting her. She asked what he was doing and he stopped and . the next day the two traveled on to Wyoming. After . a week on the road, the teen told Vafeades she wanted to go home and . she grabbed her belongings and went to exit the trailer. But Vafeades stopped her in her tracks, hitting and strangling her until she blacked out. For the next six months, Vafeades kept his relative captive with threats and intimidation while they traveled to Washington, Nevada, Texas, Tennessee and other states. Vafeades confiscated the teen's ID and social security card and took the SIM card out of her cell phone so she couldn't make any calls. She was also forbidden from using public restrooms and was beaten if she made eye contact with strangers. Despite her pleas, Vafeades forced the teenager to have sex with him more than 100 times during their time together, a criminal complaint states. Vafeades was arrested at a Clay County, Minnestota, weigh station on November 26, just a few days before Thanksgiving, after officers noticed bruises on the teenager and discovered a 1999 restraining order barring Vafeades from contacting the girl. Meeting place: Vafeades' second victim says she agreed to go out to dinner with him after meeting him at this truck stop in Salt Lake City, but that he kidnapped her and held her hostage for months . After his arrest, a second woman went . to authorities to report she had been held captive in Vafeades' truck, . according to the warrant. The . woman told detectives she met the driver at the Sapp Brothers Truck Stop in Salt Lake City in April 2012. She agreed to have dinner with him and got into his . truck, according to the report, but Vafeades told her about 10 minutes . into the ride that she was going with him for a week or more. The . woman said Vafeades kept her with him for about three months through . threats and violence, forcing her to have sex with him nearly every day . and calling her his slave, authorities said. According to her report, Vafeades told the victim that he 'owner her, that she was never getting out, and that she would do what he told her to do'. He too forbid his victim from making eye contact or talking with anyone, especially men, and if she did he would beat her with a belt while she lay naked on the trailer's sleeper bed. The victim said these beatings happened regularly, sometimes daily and other times weekly. She said he had her hair cut and colored to disguise her identity and forced her to marry him. Both . women said Vafeades watched child pornography often, and a police . search revealed he kept 'hundreds' of child porn videos and pictures on . external hard drives. The 19-year-old victim reported that the porn appeared to show girls about 14 years of age. He also forced the women to do his company paperwork, and never paid them for the work. The . trucker faces state charges in Minnesota in addition to the federal . counts. He is in the Clay County Jail awaiting transfer to Utah.","Timothy Jay Vafeades, 54, is accused of kidnapping at least two women and holding them in his semitrailer while he traveled the country .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 27-year-old man has been accused of fatally stabbing his elderly father and seriously wounding his mother in a savage scissor attack in their New York apartment this morning. New York Post reported Anthony Powe was taken into custody in his underwear shortly after the 5.45am attack at the apartment at 784 Columbus Avenue, Manhattan. The mentally ill son allegedly ran from the Upper West Side building near West 97th Street, through Central Park to East 96th Street on the other side of the city, where he was nabbed by police. Scroll down for video . Scene: Anthony Powe, 27, is accused of knifing his parents inside their apartment on Columbus Avenue, Manhattan (pictured) about 6am this morning . Darlington Powe, 71, was found dead inside the eighth-floor apartment while his wife, Alicia Powe, 56, was rushed to St. Luke’s . Hospital in a serious condition. The father, reportedly an accountant at Bellevue Hospital Center, had allegedly been repeatedly stabbed in the face and chest, and the mother had been stabbed in the chest. Neighbors heard screams and called the police, who reportedly found a pair of bloody scissors in the apartment. An upstairs neighbor told the Post she heard a woman yelling and begging the attacker to stop. 'Oh my god! I heard it! I heard a woman screaming in the apartment below. I heard her say, ‘Stop, you’re going to kill him! Oh my God, no!’ They are such beautiful people,' she said. Scene: Police were called to the Manhattan apartment this morning following reports of an assault . Powe's distraught sister said her brother loved his family and blamed his history of mental issues for the alleged attack, but said he had never been violent. 'I can't believe this is happening. He is schizophrenic. Once he realizes what he did, he's going to freak out,' Rochelle Powe, 44, told DNAinfo. 'He goes to hospitals on a regular basis . and went to peer groups. He heard voices in his head. He had to stay on . his medications.' She said her father was a 'wonderful, fun-loving dad' who was good at math and created oil paintings. Darlington Powe's ex-wife, Martha Powe, 70, said the alleged attacker 'always had problems'. 'He always had nervous problems. Darlington was worried about him,' she said. 'He was really worried.

Always walking around with capri pants, you know, short pants, making weird faces. He crazy!' Maria, who had worked in the building for 18 years, said. 'The . problem [is] because too many people live in that apartment. Seven . people in a studio! Two sons, two daughters, mother, father and . grandmother in wheelchair. And crazy son!' He said the son worked the night shift at a local food store. A former neighbor who lived one door down for six years told DNAinfo she frequently heard fights in the apartment.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . and Ap . Billionaire Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay has checked himself rehab, the team announced in a statement Tuesday afternoon. The announcement comes just days after Irsay was arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated and possession of illegal prescription drugs following a traffic stop in the Indianapolis suburb of Carmel on Sunday evening. In the statement, the team thanks fans for their support and applauds Irsay's decision to seek help for what reportedly has been a long battle with prescription drug addiction. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . James Irsay, owner of the NFL's Indianapolis Colts, was jailed early March 17 . Social-media butterfly: Irsay is known to often interact with fans on social media websites like Twitter . 'Yesterday, Jim Irsay took the first step toward regaining good health,' the team says in the statement. 'He voluntarily checked into a highly-respected health care facility . and is committed to undergoing the treatment and care necessary to help . him meet his challenges head-on. Jim, the Irsay family, and the Colts . organization are all deeply appreciative of the incredible outpouring of . support and compassion from our fans and the Indiana community.' Additionally, Irsay thanked supporters in a post on Twitter. 'Deepest . thx to family, friends, fans, colleagues for the messages of support, . thoughts and prayers. Impossible to tell u how much this means,' the NFL . owner posted on the social networking website on Monday afternoon. Friends say Irsay has been battling his drug problem for some time, and that his arrest could be a blessing in disguise. 'He's a sick, sick man,' one source told the Indy Star. 'He desperately needs help.' According to the Indy Star Irsay's recent dramatic weight loss - he went from 235lb to 165lb - has raised red flags among his friends and acquaintances. The night of his arrest, Irsay drove at a slow rate of speed, stopped in the roadway and failed to signal a turn before police stopped him, Lieutenant Joe Bickel of the Carmel Police Department said in a release. Teetotal: Irsay told Twitter followers that he hasn't had an alcoholic drink in 15 years last October . Jailed: Attorney James Voyles (left) and Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay leave the Hamilton County Jail in Indianapolis, Monday after Irsay was detained overnight . 'During the course of the investigation, Irsay subsequently failed several roadside field sobriety tests,' Bickel said. Myra Borshoff Cook, a spokeswoman for Irsay, declined to comment early Monday on his arrest. In an inventory of Irsay's vehicle, 'multiple prescription drugs were discovered in pill bottles,' police said. 'These Schedule IV prescription drugs were not associated with any prescription bottles found in the vehicle.' Irsay, who frequently interacts with fans of the NFL team on Twitter, wrote an October 2013 tweet saying 'I don't drink...haven't in over 15 years.' Irsay acknowledged in 2002 that he had become dependent on painkillers after several years of orthopedic operations but said he had overcome the problem after undergoing treatment. Marion County prosecutors said the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration investigated how Irsay obtained the painkillers. Federal authorities wouldn't confirm any investigation was taking place. Prosecutors at the time said they saw no reason to charge Irsay. A plastic surgeon who wrote painkiller prescriptions for Irsay later surrendered his federal permit to prescribe narcotic drugs. League spokesman Greg Aiello said in an e-mail to USA Today Sports that Irsay, if found guilty, would be subject to league discipline, the same as a player would. Weight loss: A fuller-looking Jim Irsay addresses media about his team the Colts in 2012 . Drug charges: Irsay (pictured in October 2013) now faces four felony charges relating to drug and intoxicated driving . 'The league's Personal Conduct Policy applies to all NFL personnel,' Aiello said. Irsay, who lives in Carmel, became the Colts owner in 1997 after the death of his father, Robert Irsay and a lengthy legal battle with his father's second wife. Along the way, Jim Irsay held virtually every job from ball boy to general manager. Forbes magazine estimated Irsay's net worth at $1.6 billion. Meg Irsay filed in November for divorce from her husband of 33 years, citing an 'irretrievable breakdown' of the marriage. A joint statement issued by the couple said Jim Irsay would retain full ownership of the Colts and his other business interests.  The couple, who married in 1980, have been separated for a decade and are the parents of three adult daughters. Since taking ownership of the team, Jim Irsay has made a reputation for himself by buying the scroll manuscript of Jack Kerouac's beat poem 'On the Road. 'for $2.43 million and often takes to Twitter to post comments ranging from the Colts' inner workings, popular music, and idle thoughts.

A woman who found 100 million lire in cash has been told the money is worthless because the currency is no longer in use . However, her hopes of being set up for life were dashed when she went to Italy’s central bank (Banca d'Italia) to have the cash exchanged into euros where she was told the money was now worthless. She hired lawyers to challenge the decision but they were unsuccessful because before adopting the euro currency on January 1 2002, Italy’s central bank had set a time limit for the exchange of the lira. Any coins or banknotes not presented to the bank before December 6, 2011, were then declared worthless. Italy had the strictest time limit of all 18 eurozone countries, although Finland, France and Greece were just a year behind with a 2012 deadline. The central banks of nine eurozone countries, including Germany and Ireland, set no limit for exchanging banknotes from the old national currency.

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 06:19 EST, 8 November 2011 . Vindicated: Michael Woodford was sacked for raising concerns about fraud at Olympus, which has now admitted to hiding £1 billion losses on securities investments . The British ex-boss of Olympus - fired after just two weeks for raising concerns about fraud at the firm - has today been vindicated after the Japanese camera company admitted to hiding £1 billion losses on securities investments. Michael Woodford, 51, was sacked on October 14 for questioning the firm's 2007 £1bn takeover of Reading-based medical equipment firm Gyrus and the purchase of three other smaller companies. He had only been made its CEO at the start of the month - after 30 years working for the company which saw him rise to become head of its European operations. Olympus said the axing of its first ever foreign president and chief operating officer was because he 'failed to understand the company's management style or Japanese culture'. But he maintained it was because he had uncovered a series of questionable payments, and then campaigned for the company to come clean. And today Olympus admitted to fraud, dating back to the 1980s, after bowing to mounting pressure to explain a series of baffling transactions that have put the future of the firm in doubt. With the news, Woodford called for the Olympus board to resign, and said he would like to return to manage the company should shareholders wish to reinstate him. A subdued Olympus President Shuichi Takayama, who staunchly defended the deals when he took over from Tsuyoshi Kikukawa last month, told a press conference: 'I was absolutely unaware of the facts I am now explaining to you. The previous presentations were mistaken.' He blamed his predecessor Kikukawa, who quit as president and chairman on October 26, Vice-President Hisashi Mori and internal auditor Hideo Yamada for the cover-up. And he revealed he was now considering initiating criminal complaints against them. Happier times: Michael Woodford (right) and former Olympus President Tsuyoshi Kikukawa (left) who has been implicated in a £1bn fraud at the firm . He said Olympus had discovered funds relating to its purchase of Gyrus, which involved a huge advisory fee of £427 million as well as payment of £480 million for three tiny domestic firms, were used to hide losses on the securities investments. The investment in the three domestic firms was largely written off a few months after the deals closed. It means Olympus, its directors and accountants are now open to possible criminal charges for suspected accounting fraud and shareholder suits. 1919 - Takeshi Yamashita founds the firm Takachiho Seisakusho . Firm primarily focuses on developing and selling microscopes . 1930s - Company branches out into the world of cameras . 1942 - The company is renamed Takachiho Optical Co . 1949 - Name is changed again to Olympus Optical Co . 1950s - Firm expands into gastrocameras . 2003 - Renamed, for a third time, to Olympus Corporation . HQ in Tokyo, Japan . Ryosuke Okazaki, chief investment officer at ITC Investment Partners, said: 'This is very serious. Olympus admitted it has made false entries to cover its losses for 20 years. 'All people involved in this over 20 years would be responsible. There is a serious danger that Olympus shares will be de-listed. The future of the company is extremely dark.' Olympus' announcement sent its shares tumbling 29 per cent to a 16-year low. The company has lost a staggering 70 per cent of its value, or $6 billion, since it fired Woodford, who had been one of the few foreign CEOs of a Japanese blue chip company. Olympus said it discovered the cover-up while working with an independent panel set up last week to investigate the deals. Kikukawa and Mori confessed to their roles on Monday night, Takayama said. Mori was sacked earlier in the day while the internal auditor offered to resign. Olympus said it would decide whether others were responsible after further investigation. The independent panel's head, retired Supreme Court justice Tatsuo Kainaka, said his team may recommend criminal charges in its report, which will be completed early next month. Takayama said he believed the loss-postponement scheme had started before the 1990s. Camera giant: Olympus was founded in 1919 and has become one of the biggest firms in the industry . The firm said it had funnelled money related to the acquisitions through various funds and other measures to defer posting the unspecified losses, similar to practices seen after Japan's bubble economy of soaring asset prices burst in 1990. While Olympus did not offer concrete details, Takayama said he believed the company may have initiated the loss-postponing scheme when its earnings had taken a drastic turn for the worse, possibly during a period of yen strength. Such a scheme may have involved creating a fund or special purpose vehicle to buy battered securities at book value, getting them off Olympus' balance sheet. The cost to fund that scheme would have ballooned over time. Nippon Life Insurance, the biggest shareholder in Olympus, urged the company to be more transparent in its explanations. Keiji Isaji, an attorney with K&L Gates law firm in Tokyo, said: 'The members of the board appear to have breached their fiduciary duty owed to the company and to the shareholders.' And a spokesman for the Tokyo Stock Exchange said the bourse needed more information before deciding whether to put Olympus shares under supervision, a step towards possible de-listing. He added that Olympus needed to examine the size of the deferred losses and whether they had an impact on shareholder investment decisions before taking further action. Lawyers said if Olympus had knowingly falsified its consolidated financial statements that were deemed material in nature, its representatives could face up to 10 years in prison or a fine of up to 10 million yen. Legal experts also said outside auditors might be criminally liable. Olympus replaced its auditor, KPMG, in 2009 after a disagreement over how to account for the controversial acquisitions. In a confidential internal document obtained by Reuters, Kikukawa, the firm's then president, wrote to Olympus executives in the U.S. and Europe, revealing there had been a disagreement with KPMG which he did not plan to disclose to the stock market. In May 2009, Kikukawa announced the contract with KPMG had ended and that another global accounting firm, Ernst & Young, would take over. Ernst & Young said it had no comment on the Olympus disclosure.","Michael Woodford had only been in job for two weeks .

"By . Alex Greig . and Associated Press . A dangerous Nile crocodile has been captured alive in Florida's Everglades National Park after a two year hunt. Wildlife officials believe the five-and-a-half-foot killer may be the same one that escaped from a Miami-Dade facility and had eluded them for almost two years. The African species grows up to 20-feet-long, can weigh as much as 2,000lb, and is much more aggressive than the smaller American crocodile, which is shy of humans and rarely seen. Juvenile: This Nile crocodile was captured on Sunday in Florida's Everglades National Park . The Nile crocodile is thought to be responsible for 275 to 745 attacks on people a year, most of them fatal, making it the third-most dangerous species in Africa, after the lion and hippopotamus, according to the Crocodile Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. 'They get big. They're vicious. The animals are just more aggressive and they learn that humans are easy targets,' said Joe Wasilewski, a reptile expert and veteran wrangler. The American croc 'is a gentle animal, believe it or not. That's their nature. They're more fish eaters. They don't consider humans a prey source.' Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission spokesman Jorge Pino says they believe the Nile croc may have escaped from a facility in Miami-Dade County. He says they're looking at DNA to confirm their suspicions. Allowing Nile crocodiles to escape into the wild is a third-degree misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $500 and jail time of up to six months. Prevention: Florida has more invasive amphibians and reptiles than anywhere else in the world, and the Everglades' delicate ecosystem has already been overrun by Burmese pythons, so authorities are eager to prevent the same problem with Nile crocs . The croc was spotted last week by volunteers with the Swamp Apes, a team that searches for invasive Burmese pythons, reports the Miami Herald, but before that hadn't been seen since April 2012. Two days later, a team of volunteers used nets to corner the crocodile in a canal in the Chekika area in the northeast corner of the park then tranquilized it. The croc was taken to the Everglades Alligator farm in Homestead, where it will remain while officials determine its fate. Crocodiles have been around for more than 200 million years. The average lifespan of a Nile crocodile is about 45 years, but can be much longer in captivity. It's not unusual for Nile crocodiles to kill huge prey such as young hippopotamuses, giraffes, lions, buffalo, and on rare occasions, humans.","A juvenile Nile crocodile has been captured in Florida's Everglades National Park .

"By . Richard Spillett . A witness at the trial of PR guru Max Clifford has told the court he has a 'freakishly small' penis. The woman, who is not one of the publicist's seven accusers, spoke about the size of his manhood after conflicting claims earlier in the trial. The court also heard claims Clifford . promised to introduce one of his secretaries to pop icon David Bowie in . return for sexual favours. Jurors were then told he posed as the film director Michael Winner and told young . women to go into his offices in short skirts and no knickers. The size of Clifford's penis was discussed today after a former model giving evidence last week claimed he had showed her his genitals and said: 'How can I satisfy a woman with this?' Publicist Max Clifford arrives at Southwark Crown Court this morning, where he denies 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls . Clifford's legal team had insisted that his penis was 'average-sized' and the witness must be lying. Speaking today, another woman told Southwark Crown Court she had described Clifford’s penis as 'freakishly small'. Asked by Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, to give more details, she wept and said: 'I feel like I’m being really rude about someone.' She added: 'It’s no more than two and a half inches.' She also told the court that during a meeting at Clifford's office in 1982, he walked around his desk, took his trousers down and stood with his back against the door. She said she complied with his wish for her to masturbate him, saying: 'I was out of my depth, it seemed like the easiest option, to comply.' She said the incident made her angry, adding: 'I’ve been angry about it, more than upset, because of the way I’d been coerced, used, and I had been a laughing stock.' The court heard claims that Clifford pushed a woman up against a wall near his office and moved his hand up her side . Cross examined by Richard Horwell QC, defending, she added: 'He was a powerful man, and I was a failed model.' Another woman, one of the alleged victims in the case, also told the court today that Clifford pinned her against a wall and pushed his tongue into her mouth when she was 19. She said he put his hand on her waist before moving it up towards her breast in the incident just outside his office. The woman, who managed to wriggle free, then saw him on a later occasion apparently being given oral sex by his secretary, the court heard. The woman told the court she used to work in an office near Clifford’s in the 1970s and would show people to Clifford’s office when they had meetings with him. She said that one evening at about 5pm, she went to collect any post from Clifford’s office before going home. She said: 'As I was walking down the corridor, he came out of his office, walked a couple of steps, and then suddenly veered towards me, quite quickly, pushed me up against the wall, and sort of pinned me there, with his body. 'He pushed his tongue into my mouth and tried to French kiss me.' She added: 'He had one hand on the wall, and the other started moving up my side, and started to touch me. 'I made an effort to wriggle and turn and I went under his arm, which was up against the wall, and I walked off and back to my office.' Clifford's trial is being heard at Southwark Crown Court in central London . After that, she felt uncomfortable at work, the court heard, but she was buying a house and did not want to cause any trouble. Not long afterwards, she walked to his office again, and pushed open the door, which was slightly ajar, she said. 'I saw his secretary, she was on her knees, she appeared to be giving him oral sex while he was in the chair,' she told the court. 'I was quite shocked, backed away very quickly, and went back to my desk.' Defence QC Mr Horwell, cross-examining, suggested that she had not worked in an office that shared space with Clifford, but the woman replied: 'Yes, I have.' Mr Horwell then suggested that the incident outside Clifford’s office had never occurred and she responded: 'I’d have to be completely mad, wouldn’t I? I’m not mad, and it did happen.' One of Clifford's former secretaries, whose allegations do not form part of the charges against Clifford, later gave evidence. She told the court Clifford would often expose himself and bragged about 'screwing women'. She said the office was 'very sexually orientated' and 'sexual banter' was rife. She said: 'Sex appeared to be on his mind most of the time. 'I would sometimes listen to him on the phone and he would pretend to be Michael Winner. 'He would say to them (women) he wanted to play a trick on Max, and if they went into the into the office and were wearing a really short skirt and no knickers and a low top it would help with his trick he wanted to play on him.' She added: 'He would brag quite a lot about how he screwed them.' She said there was an unwritten rule that you never opened Clifford's door if it was shut. But she once accidentally saw the media mogul having a sex with a woman in his office when late comedian Lennie Bennett opened the office door. She said: 'There was one occasion when the door was shut and Lennie Bennett came into the office and had marched into the office opening the door and he (Clifford) was up against the wall with a girl. 'The girl was leaning against the wall. I remember she had her legs around him and his trousers and pants, I don't know whether they were off.' The woman said that Clifford once said he would introduce her to David Bowie in return for sexual favours. She said: 'I was a massive David Bowie fan and I went to two of his concerts during the time I was working there. 'He offered for me to meet to meet David Bowie but only on the condition I have him a blowjob. 'I didn't give him a blowjob and I didn't meet David Bowie.' She claimed she had to pleasure Clifford on a string of occasions when they were alone in the office, and he once 'fondled' her breasts. The woman, who is now in her fifties, said: 'I felt I had no choice, I was very naive...I had come straight from school and with the whole atmosphere in the office I felt I had no choice.' During cross-examination, Mr Horwell QC, defending, accused the woman of making the stories up. But she insisted she was telling the truth, telling jurors: 'I wouldn't tell any lies. I don't lie.' Clifford, 70, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls. He denies all the charges. The trial continues.

"By . Martin Allen . Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football. In this week’s column, Martin talks about his controversial cardigan, why an old rift means he can't get along with Keith Hackett and how he was nearly scared out of the ITV studio... MAD DOG'S MAD CARDY . I hear my multi-coloured cardigan caused quite a stir when I wore it as a pundit on ITV’s FA Cup highlights show on Saturday night. I’ve just moved house and half of my stuff is in storage, so I got it in the Boxing Day sales from Hackett London. I thought it looked 'Mad'! It was bright, had character and personality. It’s not like the dull, bland, boring clothes you normally see on TV. The other option was a Marks & Spencer navy-blue V-neck sweater, but I suppose that’s just not me. You can’t beat a bit of colour and a bit of positive energy; I thought it suited me perfectly. What are you saying about my cardy? Martin Allen thought the knitwear matched his personality . OUT OF MY LEAGUE . I was at the ITV studios from 2pm through to half past midnight - we were watching all of the games and then recording the show. In between games a young man called Jordan who is the ‘runner’ showed me to my dressing room.I could not believe it. As I walked down the corridor there was a room each for the Loose Women, there was one for Jonathan Ross, one for Alan Carr and another for Graham Norton. The next room I came to, the name read: Martin Allen. I smiled, shook my head and thought: ‘I am well out of my league here.’ High company: Allen had his own dressing room, like TV personality Jonathan Ross (pictured centre) THE 'ALLEN FAMILY' FA CUP DRAW . About two months ago, I got a call from a man at the FA asking if I would like to do the FA Cup draw. You know, pull the balls out of the bag. He said he wanted it to be on the ‘Allen Family’ theme. I replied: ‘I think you want my cousins Clive and Paul, not me.’ But he insisted he wanted me to come in and do it. Well, I’ve admired, adored and cherished the FA Cup competition throughout my life, and what an honour, what a privilege, to be invited to Wembley to draw the balls for the first time. I always thought they had former international players or famous people. I never played for England. Keeping his eye on the ball: Allen was proud to be able to take part in the FA Cup draw . You know it’s live, you know millions of people are watching and you just don’t want to mess it up. It’s straight forward, picking a ball out and then announcing it, anyone can do it. The instructions are: Keep your hand shoulder level and hold the ball out for three seconds, then put in the tray. After the reaction from Saturday night I thought the cardigan should get a second airing. I had a text message after the draw from a friend asking if I’d got it 'buy-one-get-one-free'. I see that Adrian Chiles mentioned it, too. I’ll go back to the shop to see if I can pick up a double XL for him. The whole experience was amazing. Watch out, Adrian! Chiles may find himself with a matching version of Mad Dog's cardigan if he's not careful . NOTHING SURPRISES ME IN THIS MAD WORLD OF FOOTBALL – EXCEPT A SPIDER! My son George, who, believe it or not, is an extremely talented mathematician and qualified chartered accountant, is always on at me to get a place on that TV programme in the jungle, called 'I’m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here'. George knows my deepest fears and how scared I am of spiders, mice, snakes, and anything creepy-crawly. I got a text late on Saturday night from George, telling me a spider was creeping up my arm as I was talking about Leeds on the FA Cup highlights show. I had absolutely no idea. If I’d known a spider was there, I would’ve been out of that studio in no time at all. Scary times: Allen hates spiders and if he'd spotted this one crawling all over him he'd have fled the scene . RICH OWNERS RUINING THE CUP . The magic of the cup was there for all to see at the weekend. There were 5,500 Sheffield United fans going crazy at Villa Park, there was relief on Mark Robins’ face when Huddersfield escaped from courageous Grimsby with a late win and the pained look on Brian McDermott when Leeds lost to Rochdale was unmistakable. Last week, Paul Lambert made a point that every Premier League manager is thinking when he said the FA Cup is not as important as the league. But Paul could’ve chosen his words more carefully. Football club owners, financial directors, shareholders and stake holders in Premier League clubs only have an interest in the bottom line. All about survival: Paul Lambert is not the only manager who doesn't make the FA Cup a priority . Their priority is not silverware, their priority is to make money, make their club a global brand and cash in on the Premier League TV rights deal. There’ll be managers only intent in staying in the Premier League. There are a group of managers trying their best to get the fourth Champions League place and of course there are three or four clubs attempting to win the Premier League title. The FA Cup, for these managers and these clubs, is most definitely second on the agenda, and even third, for those competing in the Champions League. But for all the other Football League and Conference clubs it is the opportunity to go scalp hunting. HACKED OFF WITH HACKETT . The furthest I ever managed to get in the competition was the semi-final at Villa Park, playing for West Ham against Nottingham Forest in 1991. The referee that day was Mr Keith Hackett. He was a decent referee and a good man. However, after 22 minutes our centre-back Tony Gale challenged Gary Crosby and Mr Hackett deemed it to be a straight red card. The decision was ludicrous. Forest knocked the ball about in typical Brian Clough style and we lost 4-1, conceding two late goals. But the Wembley dream was over with that red card. Dreams smashed: Keith Hackett made a mistake when he sent off Tony Gale in the FA Cup semi-final . To be fair to Keith, we had a good chat afterwards and he explained to me that he realised he had made a mistake and just how costly it was to everybody at West Ham United. He was genuinely sorry and I shook his hand and thought to myself: ‘Fair play to him for apologising.’ Not many people are man enough to stand up and admit they were wrong. Last year, at the beginning of the season, I was invited by the League Manager’s Association to meet the head of the referees to go through the new rules and regulations and ask any questions. I arrived bang on time, and a nice lady gave me a nice cup of coffee with a saucer. I pitched myself quietly on the back row. Low and behold, sat twenty yards in front of me was their general manager, and he was introduced as Mr Keith Hackett. I couldn’t stop thinking about that red card. My cup and saucer started to shake, the eyes got frosty and the froth and saliva was dripping down my chin. I never heard a word that was said for the next three hours as I sat there and stared out Keith Hackett. Not forgiven: Allen seethed all the way through a briefing from Hackett because of this incident . SOUTHAMPTON’S SOUR GRAPES . Talking of referees, I can’t believe Southampton made a complaint about what Mark Clattenburg said to Adam Lallana. He supposedly told the player he’d changed since he played for England. So what? In all honesty I find it quite ridiculous, and respect should be shown to the referee. Ridiculous: What Mark Clattenburg supposedly said to Adam Lallana was not worth mentioning . The improvement in refs in the last 10 years has been amazing. With the speed of the game and the scrutiny through the media, it’s important these men and women are protected and looked after. They do a good job in difficult circumstances. Let’s face it we have the opportunity to lie on the sofa and watch replays from the front, from the back, from the side, from above, in slow motion, and most of the time it’s still difficult to decide whether it was a right or wrong decision. Managers are far too critical of referees after matches nowadays. It should be stamped down on by the LMA, the FA and the Premier League. Referees have got a hard enough job as it is. DISTRACTED BY DIVERS . Referees are not helped by all this diving, either. Almost 11 years ago I watched Jose Mourinho’s Porto take on Celtic. Deco, the Portugal midfielder, was absolutely outstanding. He professionally played for fouls to break up the rhythm of the game and take away the intensity of the Park Head supporters. He did this skilfully and craftily. By putting his body between the ball and the defender, and waiting for the player to make the challenge for the ball, he was fouled repeatedly. Back in the day: Deco, left, was a talented player and had a knack for winning free kicks . Afterwards Martin O’Neill, in charge at Celtic, slammed Mourinho for his tactics and style of play. It would be something that the legend Brian Clough, with his good English values, would have despised. European players know how to win a free kick. It’s creeping in more and more to our football, especially when teams have adapted their style of play to pass their way through the middle of the pitch, similar to Arsenal and Barcelona, rather than just look to get crosses in for a man at the near or far post. It’s here to stay and I’m sure the referees will be clamping down on it and doing their utmost to stop it spreading through the game. No way: Ramires was never going to win a penalty with this awful dive against Derby County .","I bought the knitwear in the Boxing Day sales but it caused a stir .

The Cup is being ruined by rich owners and clubs who have other aims .

Friends have said the former model - known for her headstrong ways - had always refused financial help from her multi-millionaire partner of 13 years. Speaking about L'Wren's fashion label, which she started in 2006, a source told MailOnline: 'L'Wren was in a lot of financial trouble.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . He celebrated the birth of his son late last year with his wife, 51-years his junior, and now former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards has decided to run for election to US Congress at the age of 86. Edwards, a Democrat and four-term Louisiana governor, who served an eight-year prison term on racketeering charges, launched his candidacy for a seat currently held by Republican Bill Cassidy, who is running for the U.S. Senate. 'I've given a great deal of thought to this ... and I acknowledge that there are good reasons why I should not run ... but there are better reasons why I should,' Edwards told reporters at the press club in Baton Rouge, part of the district he is seeking to represent. 'I haven't had this much attention since the trial,' he quipped. Happy family: Former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards, 86, his wife Trina Scott, 35, and their baby Eli attend a luncheon where Edwards announced his run for congress in Baton Rouge, Louisiana on March 17, 2014 . Edwards was accompanied by his wife Trina, who is more than half-a-century his junior and their baby, Eli Wallace , who was being looked after by Edwards' two adult daughters from his first marriage. Running again: Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, 86, walks with his wife Trina Scott Edwards, 35, and his son Eli Edwards before announcing his run for U.S. Congress this morning in Baton Rouge, Lousiana . Edwards served two terms as governor in the 1970s and was re-elected in 1983. He then managed a comeback for a fourth term in 1991. It was during that term that he came under federal scrutiny in connection with the state's licensing of riverboat casinos and was convicted by a jury on charges of racketeering. Despite the convictions, the colorful politician still has strong support in the state. Edwards, his wife and his daughters - both of whom are older than Trina - were the stars of a short-lived reality television show called 'The Governor's Wife'. A felony conviction arising from the licensing of riverboat casinos in his fourth term led to eight years in prison. His announcement Monday came during a Press Club luncheon at a Baton Rouge casino. Edwards was the dominant figure in Louisiana politics for much of the late 20th century despite a series of scandals that resulted in numerous investigations and four federal trials, one of which resulted in conviction. He retired from politics in 1996, before it became clear that he was again under investigation in the case that would result in his imprisonment. Before and after his prison term, he defended himself as a victim of an unfair federal judge in Baton Rouge, perjured testimony by former friends who had sought casino licenses and an overzealous federal government. Fit as a fiddle: Edwin Edwards, 86, spent eight years in prison following a felony conviction arising from the licensing of riverboat casinos in his fourth term as Governor . Formidable team: Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, 86, walks with his wife Trina Scott Edwards (2R) and his son Eli Edwards this morning - Edwards' family are the stars of their own A&E show . Father: Edwin Edwards, his wife Trina Scott and their baby Eli  attend the luncheon where he ended months of speculation and announced his run for the US Congress . Federal prosecutors have denied all of those accusations. Indeed, the political firebrand had his own reality show air on A&E which featured the quirky relationship between former Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards and his 35-year-old wife Trina Scott. The show's run ended after eight episodes. The 51-year age gap is not the strangest part in the Edward’s unusual love story. The pair actually met while Edwards was serving time on racketeering charges. The show featured the drama of the blended family and showcased how Edwards is picking up the pieces from the political shenanigans that landed him in prison. Known for his charisma in politics, Edwards was sentenced to prison on racketeering charges in 2001. He was in jail from 2002 to January 2011 for his role in a bribery and extortion scheme to rig riverboat casino licenses during his fourth term in the early 1990s. Parents: Trina Edwards, his third wife, gave birth to their child, Eli Wallace Edwards, last August . After prison: Edwards regained the public eye soon after leaving jail in 2011, marrying a woman five decades his junior and starring with her in a short-lived reality TV series . Husband and wife: Edwin Edwards, (left), poses with wife Trina Scott Edwards, (right), for photo, before speaking at the Baton Rouge Press Club, Monday, March 17, 2014, in Baton Rouge . Trina, who was in school at the time, picked up a copy of Leo Honeycutt’s biography of the former governor and became fascinated with her future husband’s story. She began writing to Edwin who then arranged for her to visit him in prison. Edwards explained how they met in an interview with Fox411. 'I was in the last year of my prison term…and after she read the book, she became interested in my career and asked to visit me. And I arranged for her to visit me and after that we got to know each other well and she came to visit me every visiting day thereafter. 'And that’s an unusual story for a man my age and a beautiful young woman her age,' Edwards continued. 'But thank goodness it happened. They sent me to prison for life, look what I came back, a good-looking wife.' Father and son: Former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, 86, walks with Eli Edwards before announcing his run for U.S. Congress . Both Trina and Edwin admit their story is 'unique,' but insist their relationship works for them. 'My husband is an amazing husband,' Trina Edwards said. 'He’s a wonderful father. Our marriage is better than most people’s marriage when they’re the same age.' 'I don’t know how it happened or why it happened but I absolutely fell in love with him,' Trina said. 'And besides that, he doesn’t have as much money as most people think. So I’d be a pretty poor gold digger if that’s what I was in for.' The show was billed as featuring the interesting dynamic between Edwards' other children.

Scott also has two teenage boys, Trevor and Logan, from a previous marriage who will also be included in the reality program. 'People are going to be surprised at how normal in most respects our lives are,' the former Governor said before the show launched. 'And given, in spite of the fact that there’s this great difference in our age, the fact that I have 4 children over 55-years-old and now a 3-month-old baby and she’s got two teenage boys. A situation that the average person, not knowing or having been with us would raise his or her eyebrows and say that’s never going to work but believe me it has worked and I’m very proud of it.'","Former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards says he will run for US Congress at the age of 86 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . iPhone users love – or loathe – Siri, the ‘intelligent personal assistant’ that recognises voice commands. And so far Windows Phone owners have had to live without a similar feature to the one that Apple rolled out in October 2011. But a video that claims to show Microsoft’s forthcoming digital assistant has been leaked online. Scroll down for video . The leaked video shows Microsoft's digital assistant, called Cortana, running on what seems to be a Windows Phone 8.1 handset (pictured) Windows Phone 8.1 is the upcoming third generation of Microsoft's Windows Phone mobile operating system. It is expected to be unveiled next month and is rumoured to feature a swipe-down notification centre and the Siri-like personal assistant, according to The Verge. The digital assistant is expected to be called Cortana and this video leak adds weight to the rumour. Cortana is said to be poised to replace Bing Search. Just like Apple's Siri, users will be able to talk to it and ask questions. The assistant has a start-up process that asks users lots of questions to tailor its suggestions from the onset. Windows Phone 8.1 is expected to make its debut at the Build Developer Conference in April, where it is rumoured that Nokia will also launch two new Windows Phone handsets. The UnleashThePhones video shows Microsoft's assistant, called Cortana, running on what seems to be a Windows Phone 8.1 handset. Microsoft describes the personal assistant as ‘a personal assistant on your phone, ready to help with reminders, suggestions, tasks and lots more’. Cortana seems to make use of location, voice input, text messages email information and contacts as well as browser and search history to learn about a user’s habits after they sign into their Microsoft account. It asks questions such as ‘What are a . couple of the most enjoyable parts of your everyday evenings?’ and ‘When . you think about food, what’s most important to you these days?’ so it . can offer tailored suggestions. This . set-up feature is different to Apple’s Siri or Google’s Now, which asks . questions to tweak suggestions later on instead of asking a user’s . preferences from the outset. Cortana seems to make use of location, voice input, text messages email information and contacts as well as browser and search history to learn about a user's habits, after they sign into their Microsoft account. After learning all it can about a user, the digital assistant offers its services (pictured) If the video is to be believed, Cortana only kicks in when a person asks it to, either by accessing the assistant from the start screen or at the press of the search button. The website claims that the assistant is still ‘a work in progress’ so its appearance may change. Cortana has long been rumoured to be added to Microsoft’s operating system and there have been numerous leaked screenshots, but this is the first video of the fabled feature, which is expected to make its debut next month at Microsoft's Build Developer Conference in San Francisco, California.

Christo responded by saying: 'Look I'm just going to tell you what I've told everybody. As far as I know we're just good mates and Harry and Bianca... good friends.' Bad blood? Christo, 26, hinted that there were tensions between the boys and twins Helena and Vikki . The former MKR cook also suggested that there were tensions between the boys and twins Vikki and Helena who knocked them out of the competition.

"By . Bianca London . Two siblings and best friends discovered they were pregnant on the same day - and gave birth on the same day nine months later. Step-sisters Lydia Crispin and Dawn Bamber - who also share a birthday of April  1 - each discovered they were mothers-to-be by chance on June 18 last year. And the pair both gave birth to their daughters on February 28 this year -  despite both having different due dates. Step-sisters Lydia Crispin and Dawn Bamber each discovered they were mums-to-be by chance on June 18 last year and both gave birth to their daughters on February 28 this year . It means the next generation of their family will be able to celebrate their  birthday together - just like best friends Lydia and Dawn, of Euxton, Lancs. Lydia, 24, who lives with husband Danny, said: 'I had spoken to Dawn, because I  always confide in her, and told her I was thinking of having a baby. She said she had been thinking about it too. We said we would always tell each  other if anything happened. 'On June 18, I did a pregnancy test and found out it was positive, and the  first person I phoned was Dawn. 'That night, she texted me to see if I was still awake and if she could phone  me. She was crying her eyes out and told me she was pregnant.' They decided not to tell anyone until after their scans and got their parents,  Sue and Keith Bamber, together for a family meal. Despite both having different due dates, they beat the odds, which means the next generation of their family will be able to celebrate their birthday together - just like they did . They told them they had won a prize and presented each parent with a gift bag  containing a picture of the babies from the scans. The step-sisters went through pregnancy together, sharing each milestone and  preparing for the future. They both planned to give birth at Chorley And South Ribble Hospital, Lancs.,  with Dawn's baby due on February 15 and Lydia's on February 20. Dawn, 25, who is engaged to Duncan Riding, said: 'It was unbelievable. I didn't  think for a minute that they would arrive on the same day.' Both pregnancies went past their due dates and plans were made for Dawn's baby  to be induced at Royal Preston Hospital, Lancs., on February 28. And the day before, Lydia went into labour at Chorley Hospital. Baby Summer was born at 12.30am on February 28, weighing 7lb 12oz and Dawn's daughter Courtney was delivered at 7.50pm that day, weighing 10lb 11oz . Lydia said: 'I was looking at the clock at 11.30pm hoping it would go into the  next day, because I knew Dawn was being induced.' Baby Summer was born at 12.30am on February 28, weighing 7lb 12oz. And Dawn's daughter Courtney was delivered at 7.50pm that day, weighing 10lb  11oz. Lydia said: 'When we finally got the phone call to say she had had a little  girl, we were over the moon. 'For our girls to have the same birthday, like us, is lovely. They will grow up  together and probably go to the same school.'  Dawn, who works at Cheeky Monkey's play centre in Chorley, added: 'I think they  will be best friends like me and Lydia.' Experts say the odds of two sisters discovering they are pregnant and giving  birth on the same days are a million to one. The step-sisters went through pregnancy together, sharing each milestone and preparing for the future - they can't wait for their daughters to do the same .","Step-sisters Lydia Crispin, 24, and Dawn .

"By . Associated Press . The top executive of General Motors apologized for deaths linked to the delayed recall of 1.6 million small cars, saying the company took too long to bring the cars in for repairs. CEO Mary Barra, who is in her third month leading the company, also named a new global safety director to help prevent further recall problems. In her first meeting with reporters since last month's recall, Barra stopped short of saying the company would compensate families of those killed in crashes caused by faulty ignition switches. But she said GM would do what's right for customers after it completes an internal investigation. Answers? GM CEO Mary Barra addresses the media during a roundtable meeting with journalists in Detroit. Barra says it's likely she will testify before congressional committees investigating the company's handling of a faulty ignition switch that is tied to 12 deaths . ‘I am very sorry for the loss of life that occurred, and we . will take every step to make sure this never happens again,’ she said. Tuesday's 50-minute meeting with reporters was part of . Barra's damage control effort as she tries to distance the GM from the . pre-bankruptcy company that buried the problem in bureaucracy. GM has admitted . knowing about the problem switches for at least 11 years, yet it failed to . recall the cars until last month. The company also has promised an ‘unvarnished’ investigation and a new dedication to safety. GM has to protect its safety reputation to keep sales from . falling and cutting into earnings. The company has been profitable for 16 . straight quarters since emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2009. Barra said no one at GM has been fired or disciplined . because of the recall delays, but Mark Reuss, the company's product development . chief who also spoke with reporters, said appointing a safety chief is only the . beginning. ‘This is the first change of things that need to change,’ Reuss said. During the meeting, Barra and Reuss appeared composed. But . they often refused to answer questions, saying they wanted to wait for the . results of the investigation by an outside attorney before giving details. Millions of recalls: The grill of a 2013 Chevy Traverse. General Motors is recalling more than 1.5 million vehicles, including SUVs, vans and Cadillacs, for defective air bags and other problems.  The recalls announced Monday, include the Traverse from the 2009-2013 model years . GM is recalling over a million cars built as long ago as 2003 due to an ignition switch that  suddenly change from the ‘run’ position to ‘accessory’ or ‘off.’ What's being recalled: . Barra said GM is looking through its database for more crash . deaths that could be tied to the ignition switch problem. That number is likely . to rise above the 12 currently cited by the company as GM and the National . Highway Traffic Safety Administration review accident reports and consumer . complaints. Barra said it's also likely she will testify before two . congressional committees investigating the company's handling of the problem, . probably in early April. The Justice Department also is investigating whether . any laws were broken in the way GM handled the recall. Before the meeting with reporters, GM named a veteran . company engineer, Jeff Boyer, as its new safety chief, placing a single person . in charge of recalls and other safety issues. Reuss called Boyer a ‘safety zealot’ and Barra said she has . known him since the 1980s. ‘He will have no qualms if he has an issue or . concern, of raising that forward,’ she said. On Feb. 13, GM announced the recall of more than 780,000 . Chevrolet Cobalts and Pontiac G5s (model years 2005-2007). Two weeks later it . added 842,000 Ion compacts (2003-2007), and Chevrolet HHR SUVs and Pontiac . Solstice and Saturn Sky sports cars (2006-2007). All of the recalled cars have . the same ignition switches. The company said the ignition switches can wear from heavy, . dangling keys. If the key chains are bumped or people drive on rough surfaces, . the switches can suddenly change from the ‘run’ position to ‘accessory’ or ‘off.’ That cuts off power-assisted steering and brakes and could cause drivers to . lose control. Also, the air bags may not inflate in a crash and protect the . driver and passengers. GM is urging people not to put anything on their key rings . until the switches are replaced. Barra said she expects all the cars to be repaired by . sometime in October. Shares of General Motors Co. rose 46 cents, or 1.3 percent, . to $35.09 in afternoon trading Tuesday. Its shares had fallen almost 2 percent . since the February recall announcement.","GM failed to recall the vehicles until last month, when 1.6 million small cars were recalled for faulty ignition switches .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A paragliding pensioner was left dangling 60m (200 feet) above the ground for three hours when he collided with a cable car wire. Too high to be reached by ladder, he eventually had to cut himself free and lower himself down under guidance from rescuers. The high drama played out in the Swiss Alps and began when 74-year-old Martin Bumgarner was blown off course in strong winds and became entangled in the support wire of a cable car at Wolfenschiessen, a village in the canton of Nidwalden in Switzerland. Perilous: Martin Bumgarner was blown off course in strong winds and became entangled in the support wire of a cable car at Wolfenschiessen . Extreme danger: Mr Bumgarner was too high up to be rescued by ladder . Happy ending: Rescuers slid Mr Bumgarner a knife, rope and harness and in the end he was able to lower himself down . He would have fallen to a certain death if his parachute had come free. Fortunately, there was a happy ending, but it was agonisingly touch and go for a while. Mountain rescue boss Josef Odermatt said: 'Firemen did manage to put up a rescue cushion but it was always touch and go whether it would actually catch the man if he fell. He managed to get a shoe free and throw that down and based on where that landed was where the cushion was positioned, but again with the wind and other factors it was still very risky.' Soft landing: A huge rescue cushion was placed under Mr Bumgarner in case his parachute worked free . Firemen then managed to get the rescue vehicle below the hanging paraglider and put up a ladder but it fell short and so that plan had to be abandoned as well. In the end rescuers slid a radio, rope, harness and a very sharp knife along the wire to Mr Bumgarner in a small bag. They then talked him through putting the harness on and cutting himself free from the parachute so that he could rescue himself.","Martin Bumgarner was entangled on a cable car wire in Wolfenschiessen .

"By . Leon Watson . Former pizza delivery man Ala Uddin, 44, who worked for Domino'­s despite his violent past and appalling driving record . A pizza delivery driver has kept a job with Domino's despite finally being banned from the road after clocking up an astonishing 35 points on his licence and being exposed as a convicted child murderer. Ala Uddin, 44, was given a job delivering pizzas in Aberystwyth, west Wales, despite his violent past and appalling driving record. He was one of just 10 drivers in the UK who managed to stay on the road despite racking up 28 or more points. On one occasion he was handed 18 points in one go after he pleaded guilty to a string of motoring offences. But he avoided a ban after making an exceptional hardship plea in his court hearing, claiming he . would lose his job and ultimately end up losing the home he provides for . his wife and children. In court it was revealed Uddin . was jailed for murder in 1993 for knifing a 15-year-old boy to death in . a row sparked by religious differences. He served seven years and . remains on licence for life for the murder. Uddin was jailed again in Swansea, in 2009, for two years - reduced to one on . appeal - for knifing a colleague at a meat processing plant in Llanybydder the . face. Uddin has worked as a pizza delivery driver for Domino's takeaway in Aberystwyth for more than two years. Since his ban last week he's been moved to a job behind the counter. Domino's . pizza chain refused to comment. But the local franchise-holder confirmed that Uddin is still employed inside the takeaway outlet. He said: 'I have been told by Domino's that I must not say anything more.' As a murder conviction is never spent, . it would have had to have been declared to an employer. Criminal records checks on takeaway . delivery drivers are not generally made by employers and it raises the . question of how many other drivers have serious criminal convictions. Ceredigion MP Mark Williams said: 'I was concerned to read . about this case, and believe sufficient safeguards should always be in . place to protect the public. 'It . is important that companies ask enough information about their staff to . make an informed decision about their suitability for the role, and . most importantly any risk that they may pose.' A . spokesperson at Domino's head office said: 'As a franchised business, . we rely on our franchisees to recruit and manage team members in stores, . and we can not comment on individual cases.' Uddin appeared in court in January when he was allowed to keep his licence despite building up 29 penalty points. He had claimed a ban would see him suffer exceptional hardship. The Domino's pizza shop where Uddin still works. It has a 'drivers wanted' notice in its window . Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court, where it was revealed Ala Uddin was a convicted child murderer . But last Wednesday, Uddin, of Ffosyffin, near Aberaeron, west Wales, was finally banned from driving for six months after pleading guilty to further charges of driving with a defective tyre and without insurance . The previous convictions were not mentioned when he appeared before Aberystwyth magistrates for the motoring offence. Prosecutor Ellie Morgan said Uddin was stopped by Pc Phil Westbury on January 28 at Heol y Bont in Penparcau, Ceredigion. Ala Uddin is not the only serial offender who the courts allowed to continue driving on British roads. The Institute of Advanced Motorists said DVLA figures show that one woman from Isleworth in west London amassed 42 points last year. In that case, the 42 points were all dished out for failing to disclose the driver’s identity. The second-highest points total - 36 - for a person still allowed to keep their license were given to a man from Warrington, Cheshire, who was caught driving without insurance six times in less than two weeks between February and March last in 2012, the IAM said. A spokesman for HM Courts & Tribunals Service said: 'The vast majority of drivers who get 12 or more penalty points are fined and disqualified from driving. 'Magistrates can use their discretion to not enforce a driving ban if doing so would cause exceptional hardship, such as losing a job or the ability to care for a dependant. A fine will still be enforced.' A DVLA spokesman said: 'The DVLA’s role is to record the information . provided by the courts. The courts are able to use their discretion to . decide whether or not to disqualify a driver.' Checks showed the tread on the front nearside wheel of the Honda Civic he was driving was worn. Further checks also showed that an insurance policy Uddin had was invalidated by the insurers and backdated to when the policy was first taken out, after he failed to declare prior convictions. Defence solicitor Alison Mathias said Uddin had realised he had to be careful after escaping a ban initially. She said he had checked his car, but that even Pc Westbury had not been able to tell at first the tyre was defective and only realised it was after using a gauge. Ms Mathias said Uddin had an insurance certificate that covered him on the day, but that his insurers had invalidated the policy and backdated that invalidation after learning he had not informed the company of previous convictions. She said that Uddin hoped he would be able to keep his job at Domino's and work in the takeaway itself. But he realised that if the company could find a staff member who was not banned, he was at risk of losing his job, which would have a major impact on his family. Ms Mathias added: 'He wishes to apologise to the court for coming before the court in respect of motoring offences.' Uddin was given six points for the no insurance charge, taking him to 35 points, and was banned for six months under the totting-up procedure. He was also fined £220 and will pay costs of £97. According to the most recent DVLA figures only five people in Britain have been allowed to keep their licence with 30 points, one driver is on 31 points, one is on 34 points, one is on 36 points and one driver in the Liverpool area has a whopping 45 points on his licence but is allowed to remain driving.","Ala Uddin, 44, was jailed for murder in 1993 for knifing a boy to death .

"By . Candace Sutton . and Nathan Klein . Mick Jagger spent an idyllic day in Perth on Monday visiting a park, a sculpture exhibition and having a relaxed late dinner of seafood with a beer, before he was left shattered by the news that his longtime girlfriend L'Wren Scott had taken her own life.

Relaxed: Mick Jagger spend a relaxing at Cottlesloe beach just hours before learning the news that his girlfriend L'Wren Scott had taken her own life . Later, he visited Cottesloe beach, before returning to his hotel in the late afternoon. His hotel, The Hyatt Regency, then booked him a table for two at Coco's Restaurant under a false name. Jagger turned up at 9.45pm with a younger man, who was believed to be his British business manager. He ordered a seafood entree and the two men spent an hour chatting over a relaxed dinner at a secluded table overlooking a magnificent view of the Swan River. Happy to be back: The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts, arrived in Perth, Australia, early on Monday morning and looked thrilled to be back in the country - but they are now expected to cancel their six-show tour following the death of Jagger's girlfriend .

After an hour at his table, Jagger had just finished his main course when a woman rushed in and  whisked Jagger and his business partner away. The news of Ms Scott's death was broken to them both outside of the restaurant, before the English rocker left - his face carrying an unmistakable look of grief. As the night went on, further details emerged about Ms Scott's death - including that the 49-year-old had hanged herself inside her Manhattan apartment. Scott's body was discovered in her Manhattan apartment around 10a.m. Monday, which is 10pm Monday in Perth. Devastated: Jagger said he was 'devastated' and in shock after hearing the news about Scott, whom he'd dated since 2001 . Soon after leaving the restaurant, Jagger said through a spokesperson that he was 'completely shocked and devastated' after hearing the news and the rep replied 'of course' when asked if the pair were still in a relationship when she took her life. One report in the New York Post claimed the couple had called it quits, which Jagger's rep slammed as '100% untrue. 'There is absolutely no basis in fact to this story. It is a horrible and inaccurate piece of gossip during this very tragic time for Mick,' the spokesperson told JustJared.com in a statement. Shocked and devastated: Mick Jagger leaves Coco's Restaurant in Perth, Western Australia, after finding out his girlfriend L'Wren Scott had committed suicide in New York . One U.S. fashion source told MailOnline: 'Everybody who knows L'Wren and Mick are totally and completely shocked. Neither of them drink and do drugs, and they were always really affectionate with each other. There were no signs of problems in their relationship.' It's expected the Rolling Stones will cancel the Australian tour on account of the fashion designer's death. Scott was found by her assistant early Monday after hanging herself. There was no immediate suspicion of foul play though the Medical Examiner has not yet released the formal report. In love: Mick Jagger and L'Wren Scott . pictured at a fashion event in London in July 2013 . Police said she had left no note - but she had sent a text to her assistant to 'come by.' On Tuesday, the MailOnline revealed that the talented fashion designer was $6million in debt to her creditors when she died and was distraught and 'embarrassed' over her failing business. L'Wren, who had been dating the rockstar since 2001, first broke into the fashion industry as a stylist before launching an eponymous line in 2006 that was a major hit with celebrities. Fans included Oprah Winfrey, Nicole Kidman and Michelle Obama. She had even been tipped to design Angelina Jolieâ€™s wedding dress.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . They sell cookies, work for pledges and attend summer camp, but unlike other troops, these Girl Scouts meet behind a razor wire fence. Two days a month, Girl Scouts are shuttled to a women's correctional facility to spend time with their mothers who have been locked up. But unlike a normal visit where minimal touching is allowed, girls can cuddle and play with their moms for several hours after they're screened at the prison gates. The Girl Scouts Beyond Bars began in 1992 as a way to strengthen the bond between girls aged five to 17 and their incarcerated mothers, and break the cycle of crime. Now the program operates in several women's facilities across America, and while specific statistics have not been developed to gauge its success, Scout leaders say it's given hope to many imprisoned women. 'It gives daughters a chance to know . their moms,' Ava-Lisa Macon, a volunteer Scout leader from . Catonsville, said. 'I see the difference it makes.' Scroll down for video . Girl Scouts Beyond Bars: Inmates and their daughters meet in the gym for a troop meeting at the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women in Jessup, Maryland . Bonding: Officials say the program has helped women inmates work on their relationships with the children they've left behind, including mother Monnek Hall (left) and her 13-year-old daughter Ayona Hall . The program began as a partnership between the National Institute of Justice and Girl Scouts of Central Maryland. On February 1, Capital Gazette joined the scout troop's meeting at Maryland Correctional Institute for Women, where it has run for 22 years, documenting the incredible bond between mother and daughter. Two troops comprising 19 offenders’ daughters were shuttled to the Jessup facility to bond with their . mothers. Girls as young as seven walk ed through a metal . detector and were patted down before being escorted through the electric fence to a gymnasium. Moms - some in gray moms wore gray sweat suits, others in casual clothes - formed a friendship circle, eagerly awaiting the moment their daughters would run into their arms. The reunions were incredibly emotional for mother and child. Scout's honor: Ayona Hall, age 13 (from left), her mother Monnek Hall, Alexis Jones, age 15 and her mother Shalonne Jones take part in the Friendship Circle at the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women in Jessup, Maryland . For 13-year-old Ayona Hall, the simple things like sharing a manicure or spending a day at the movies is what she finds the hardest about her mom being in the slammer. 'I miss special time, like having a girl’s day out,' Ayona said. Her mom, 32-year-old mom Monnek . Hall, has been incarcerated since 2008 for assault. She has enrolled in Goucher College courses at the prison to earn a bachelor’s degree in sociology to become a social worker. 'I try to be as real with my daughters as I can because I want for them to learn from this as well,' Hall, who could be released in 2024, told Capital Gazette,. 'I still try to lead by example. I want them to know that everybody makes mistakes. It’s what you do after that.' To participate, mothers must display exemplary behavior and miss out if they've acted out.

Scouts of Central Maryland spokeswoman Danita Terry said the meetings are the only times some of . the offenders see their daughters. In a survey last March, 67 percent . said it was the only time they had with their children. Although the program is well-regarded, Capital Gazette reported funding has dried up. The Department of Justice has ceased funding and the Girl Scouts covers the $50,000 annual cost through donations and grants.

Chippendale wants more people to see the program in action to understand its impact. She recalled a pregnant inmate who delivered her baby shortly after . incarceration. Thanks to Girl Scouts, the woman was able to build a relationship with her daughter, and when the girl was old enough, she participated in the troops’ annual . sleepover. 'It was the first time she had spent the night with her daughter - at nine,' Chippendale said. 'Can you imagine?'

"By . Ben Spencer . Schools, hospitals and prisons should buy British food even if it is more expensive, new Government guidelines will say. Current rules which make price the overriding factor in public sector purchasing will be scrapped this summer. They will be replaced by new guidance designed to boost British agriculture and improve quality, under which public bodies will be obliged to prioritise other factors, including local sourcing. Hospitals and schools will be encouraged to buy UK food rather than simply going to the cheapest source . The public sector currently spends £2.1billion a year on food, and the Government is keen to reduce foreign imports and boost farming. Britain imports 40 per cent of its food - including many products which could be produced domestically. Farming Minister George Eustice told the Daily Mail: ‘The Government spends more than £2billion on food and we’re keen to improve procurement so that British agriculture gets a proper shot at that business. ‘Price is clearly an important factor that needs to be taken into account, but it won’t be the overriding factor. ‘If you have better food, wholesome food, produced to a better standard, that is the kind of thing people who are doing the buying should be weighing up. ‘We don’t think it should necessarily be that much more expensive.’ The current Government Buying Standards document emphasises the importance of quality, locality and animal welfare - but it includes an overarching rule which says the cost of food trumps all other factors. That rule will be taken out of the guidelines when they are reissued in the summer, Mr Eustice said. Britain imports 40 per cent of its food - including many products which could be produced on British farms . The move follows an impassioned plea in January by Environment Secretary Owen Paterson for families to cut down on foreign food. He was then challenged by the National Farmers’ Union to push hospitals and schools to buy UK food rather than simply going to the cheapest source. At the time Peter Kendall, then NFU president said: ‘If Owen Paterson is going to get the public to buy British then he should also get the Government to buy British. We had an event at the House of Commons in May last year and they could not come up with an entirely British menu for us.’ Last night  Phil Hudson, head of food and farming at the National Farmers Union, said: ‘Finally the Government is putting its money where its mouth is when it comes to British agriculture. ‘We have campaigned against the Government caveat that food can be sourced locally, as long as it isn’t more expensive. Farming Minister George Eustice wants British food producers to get a 'proper shot' at public sector business . ‘If the minister is saying that caveat will be removed, that is very positive news.’ Conservative MP Neil Parish, who sits on the Rural Affairs Select Committee, said British farming needed a boost after a terrible winter of floods and storms. ‘This is very good news,’ he said. ‘Farming needs to be supported when we have had these weather extremes.‘What is also key is that we don’t want to be reliant on food imports from abroad.’ Last month Environment Secretary Owen Paterson appointed Peter Bonfield, who led the procurement strategy for the 2012 London Olympics, to carry out a review of the Government Buying Standards document. He will report back in July. A stumbling block to the drive for British-grown food includes an anti-protectionist EU directive which does not allow public bodies to simply favour products from their own country. But Mr Eustice said there are easy ways to ‘navigate’ the directive. The minister, who himself comes from a farming background, said: ‘You can’t just say “you have to only buy British” but you can say that publicly-procured food should comply with certain standards, standards that are consistent with welfare standards here in the UK. ‘You can look at whether the food is seasonal, whether it is local, you can look at the length of journey it has had, the impact on the environment, the impact on the benefit to local communities of food being sourced locally. ‘And you can in some circumstances include the social benefits locally. You can have a more balanced approach to procurement, that do not favour the massive companies that operate on a pan-European basis but that factor in smaller suppliers. ‘It’s about trying to get the balance right. ‘That is what we have to try to navigate through.’ He added: ‘Sometimes local authorities, for example, can get rather spooked by EU procurement law. We are keen to have a close look at EU law and see if we can work around that.’ Farming bosses say supermarkets also need to play their part by stocking more British food. A poll conducted by YouGov on behalf of the NFU said 79 per cent of shoppers want to see more locally-sourced food on shop shelves. Former NFU president Peter Kendall, who this week ended his eight-year term at the union, said: ‘I’m constantly told by some supermarkets that their sourcing policies are determined by what their customers want. This survey shows very clearly that consumers want more British food, so I hope they will take this on board and act on it. ‘We’re not saying that supermarkets should not stock any foreign produce. But we would urge the retailers to listen to what consumers are saying. ‘British farmers and growers provide some of the highest quality produce in the world produced to high standards of quality, welfare and traceability and consumers want to buy it.’ The Mail revealed last month that quarter of food imported into Britain could be produced on home soil. Some 81 per cent of tomatoes consumed in Britain are foreign-grown, as are 59 per cent of mushrooms. Just 30 per cent of cucumbers are grown here, down from 55 per cent 14 years ago.","Government is keen to boost farming and end reliance on foreign imports .

"By . Pat Hagan . Eating tomatoes just a few times a week could halve the chances of suffering depression, a study claims. Researchers analysed the mental health records and diet habits of just under 1,000 men and women aged 70 or over. The results found those eating . tomatoes two to six times a week were 46 per cent less likely to suffer . the blues than those eating them less than once a week. Researchers found eating tomatoes just a few times a week could halve a person's chances of suffering the blues . But other fruits and vegetables do not have the same benefits, the study found. Eating healthy foods like cabbage, carrots, onions and pumpkins appeared to have little or no effect on psychological well-being. Up to 20 per cent of people suffer depression at some point in their lives, with women affected more than men. The elderly are at high risk because of the effect on mood from declining health, bereavements and loneliness. Tomatoes are rich in antioxidant chemicals that are thought to protect against some diseases. They are a particularly good source of lycopene, an antioxidant that gives them their deep red colour and has been linked with reducing the risk of prostate cancer and heart attacks. British consumers get through half-a-million tonnes of tomatoes every year - the equivalent of 19 pounds per person a year. However, this is still much less than in some Mediterranean countries. A team of researchers from China and Japan, led by Dr Kaijun Niu from China’s Tianjin Medical University, wanted to investigate preliminary reports that lycopene might also promote psychological and well as physical health by reducing oxidative stress, or damage to healthy brain cells. They analysed the mental health records and dietary habits of just under 1,000 elderly Japanese men and women aged 70 or over. The results, published in the Journal of Affective Disorders, found those eating tomatoes two to six times a week were 46 per cent less likely to suffer depression than those eating them less than once a week. Eating tomatoes every day slashed the risk by 52 per cent. But there was no obvious advantage to mental health from other vegetables. The researchers said they cannot be sure if lycopene in tomatoes directly affects the mind, or whether it simply protects against the depression caused when people develop potentially fatal diseases like cancer. In a report on the findings they said: ‘These results suggest that a tomato-rich diet may have a beneficial effect on the prevention of depressive symptoms. ‘In contrast, no relationship was observed with intake of other kinds of vegetables.’","Eating tomatoes just a few times a week could halve a person’s chances of suffering the blues .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . President Obama thought he was taking a hard line when he issued sanctions against Russian officials following the Crimean vote to leave Ukraine. But Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin thinks the sanctions are hilarious. Rogozin was one of 11 Russian and Ukranian officials hit with economic sanctions today, and responded on Twitter calling whoever drafted the list a 'prankster'. In his tweets, Rogozin asks 'Comrade @BarackObama' how the sanctions will affect him since he doesn't have 'accounts or property abroad'. Not worried: Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin was one of 11 Russian and Ukrainian officials hit with U.S. sanctions today, but he seemed unfazed in remarks made on Twitter . Comrade Obama: Rogozin claims he doesn't even have property or bank accounts abroad . Very funny: In one of his tweets, Rogozin seems to call the president a 'prankster' Vladislav Surkov, one of President Vladimir Putin's top aides, was also included on the list and just as ambivalent about his new restrictions. 'It's a big honor for me,' he told a Russian newspaper. 'I don't have accounts abroad. The only things that interest me in the U.S. are Tupac Shakur, Allen Ginsberg, and Jackson Pollock. I don't need a visa to access their work. I lose nothing.' Those included on the list will now not have access to any assets under American jurisdiction and American banks will not be able to do business with them. Additionally, they will not be allowed to travel into the United States. The sanctions were designed to dissuade President Vladimir Putin from annexing Crimea after the Ukranian region passed a vote to join Russia. Those targeted in the sanctions were 'key ideologists and architects' of Russia's ploy to regain Crimea and some are even accused of curbing 'human rights and liberties' in their home country. Laying down the law: President Obama has issued sanctions against 11 individuals in Russia over the country's move to take back part of the Ukraine amid massive political turmoil . Political pals: Rogozin shakes the hand of Russian President Vladimir Putin in January 2008 . Mr Obama issued the sanctions to make it clear 'that there are consequences for their actions in Crimea. He also warned that sanctions issued on Monday are not necessarily the end, stressing that the U.S. stands ready to impose further sanctions if necessary. 'Russiaâ€™s decision to send troops into Crimea has rightly drawn global condemnation,' President Obama said at a White House press conference Monday. 'As I told President Putin yesterday, the referendum in Crimea was a clear violation of Ukrainian constitutions and international law, and it will not be recognized by the international community.' Obama said the government has the authority to go after officials in the Russian arms sector and those who support Russian cronies if the government doesn't pursue a diplomatic solution to the crisis in Ukraine. No surprise: President Obama has been threatening to order sanctions against Russia for two weeks . Obama on Monday froze the U.S. assets of seven Russian officials for their support of Crimea's vote to secede from Ukraine in the most comprehensive sanctions against Russia since the end of the Cold War. The Treasury Department also is imposing sanctions on four Ukrainians involved in the separatist effort including former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych. The White House accused Yanukovych as being the one to invite Putin's troops into Crimea after he fled Kiev and headed to Russia himself. 'Now, I believe thereâ€™s still a path to resolve this situation diplomatically in a way that addresses the interest of both Russia and Ukraine,' President Obama said. Senior administration officials also said they are developing evidence against individuals in the arms industry and those they described as 'Russian government cronies' to target their assets. Fearing the spread: Ukrainian forces are guarding other major government buildings in other parts of the country, like these soldiers protecting the Ukrainian Ground Forces Academy in Lviv . The administration officials said Putin wasn't sanctioned despite his support of the Crimean referendum because the U.S. doesn't usually begin with heads of state. But the officials, speaking to reporters on a conference call on the condition they not be quoted by name, say those sanctioned are very close to Putin and that the sanctions are 'designed to hit close to home.' The U.S. announcement came shortly after the European Union announced travel bans and asset freezes on 21 people they have linked to the unrest in Crimea. Obama administration officials say there is some overlap between the U.S. and European list, which wasn't immediately made public. Biden was heading to Europe Monday and Obama plans to go next week. The president said that demonstrating a 'solemn commitment to our collective defense' as NATO allies will be at the top of the agenda. Tense: Armed service men who are believed to be Russian are seen patrolling a military base in the Ukraine . The sanctions were expected after residents in Crimea voted overwhelmingly Sunday in favor of the split. Crimea's parliament on Monday declared the region an independent state. The administration officials say there is some concrete evidence that some ballots for the referendum arrived pre-marked in many cities and 'there are massive anomalies in the vote.' The officials did not say what that evidence was. The United States, European Union and others say the action violates the Ukrainian constitution and international law and took place in the strategic peninsula under duress of Russian military intervention. Putin maintained that the vote was legal and consistent with the right of self-determination, according to the Kremlin.","Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin was one of 11 Russian and Ukranian officials hit with U.S. sanctions today .

"By . Ruth Styles . It's one of the most unique and deeply personal experiences you'll ever have; a private moment where time and vanity disappear in a haze of pain and euphoria. For those reasons perhaps, few of us would be willing to share it with the world. But Zoe Simpson, a 35-year-old former nursery nurse and mother-of-one, feels completely different. For Ms Simpson is one of the stars of cult Channel 4 series One Born Every Minute and says that giving birth in front of the TV cameras was one of the proudest moments of her life. Thrilled: New mother Zoe Simpson with her daughter Dana Ivy Frances Cook and her partner, Anthony . Although the presence of the cameras would suggest the opposite, Zoe is no exhibitionist desperate for her 15 minutes of fame. Instead, her appearance on the show was the culmination of a seven-year battle against infertility and her daughter, 6lb 12oz Dana Ivy Frances Cook, the much-longed for result. 'My partner and I started talking about [going on the show] and we decided we should have her birth filmed,' explains Zoe. 'We thought, ""she's probably going to be the only baby we ever have, so wouldn't it be nice?""' Filming itself proved easy and Zoe says the experience of working with documentary makers was 'fantastic'. Euphoric: Zoe with baby Dana and Anthony moments after her birth - and still being filmed . Nearly there: Zoe says she enjoyed a wonderful pregnancy until being diagnosed with diabetes . 'We got a continuity of care with the . producers,' she explains. 'Every time I went for a scan or a consultation, they were there. 'We built a . friendship up with them, so when we were doing the interviews, it didn't . feel like a film crew. Even though there was a massive camera in my face, it felt like we were doing it with friends.' Zoe's road to motherhood began seven years ago, when, at the age of 28, she and her partner Anthony Cook decided to start trying for a baby. After two fruitless years of trying, the couple visited the doctor to find out what had gone wrong. 'Anthony was fine,' remembers Zoe. 'It [infertility] was down to me.' Discovering that she had endometriosis, a condition that results in womb tissue growing in other parts of the body, was a devastating blow. 'I . didn't know too much about it to begin with,' she explains. 'I'd always had heavy and painful periods . but I thought it was just one of those things. 'I suppose . my heart sort of sank, and then it got worse because I went and Googled it and read that people who . have it often have polycystic ovaries too.' Luckily for Zoe, her worst fears proved . unfounded and doctors were able to cut the endometrioisis away before giving . her drugs to turbo-charge her ovaries. Worth it: Despite the trials and tribulations, Zoe says she would do everything again if she had to . Endometriosis is a common condition where tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb (the endometrium) appears in other parts of the body.Although they can be found anywhere, most occur on the ovaries, on the lining of the pelvis behind the uterus and the top of the vagina. According to the NHS, the condition affects around two million women in the UK. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 25 and 40.Symptoms include painful or heavy periods, and pain in the lower stomach, back and pelvis. A lack of energy, fertility problems and depression are often linked to it. Source: NHS Choices . 'They put me on clomid but that didn't . work either so eventually, we spoke to a consultant who put us on a IUI [Intrauterine insemination] treatment. That . was very invasive; I had injections through the stomach every day and there were a lot of nasal sprays.' Despite their best efforts, the first round of IUI treatment was a failure. 'It was most gut-wrenching . thing I've ever been through,' says Zoe. 'It was soul-destroying and I wasn't sure . whether to do it again. It put a real strain on my relationship too.' The couple chose to persevere and on the 16th January 2013, discovered that she was expecting - 'the best feeling ever', says Zoe. Her elation continued as she enjoyed a 'lovely pregnancy' with no morning sickness and the unexpected bonus of wonderfully thick glossy hair. But despite her joy, the road to motherhood proved bumpy once more and she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes. 'I knew more about it . [than the endometriosis] and I wasn't too worried to begin with but as the weeks went on, the tablets I was given stopped providing my body with enough support. They put me on insulin and that did frighten me a bit.' New series: The new series of One Born Every Minute was filmed at Southmead Hospital in Bristol . Best moment: Zoe with Dana in her arms a few moments after giving birth to her . By the time she went into labour, Zoe was a veteran of multiple hospital visits but admits, as a first time mother, to having some qualms about giving birth. 'My sister and . all their friends have had babies and I've heard all the horror stories but . I had extra worries about going into labour because of all the problems,' she reveals. 'I didn't . want an epidural,' she adds. 'I wanted to go au naturel but as you'll see [in the show] that didn't happen.' Despite being able to hear the cameras whirring behind the walls, Zoe says her televised birth was a 'fantastic experience' and hopes baby Dana will one day see the tape. 'It is a really private, intimate . moment but watching One Born Every Minute, I've always thought what a lovely thing it is to share and what a lovely . moment it is. 'Going into labour, there's so much . going on that you forget about them. They're tiny so you do forget they're there.' She adds: 'I wasn't . very worried about being filmed in labour. It can be a bit gory but not . a lot of people tune in to see the bits. 'It's more informative and I cry every time I watch it. Without these programmes, women who don't have children don't get . to see or hear about these experiences. 'I don't mind that . it's out there. It's a moment that I'm proud of.

I have a beautiful family that I just want to provide for. ‘I know publicity stunts won’t get me a job, but may get the attention of the right person so I can prove I have the skills.’ Tough times: Mr Conway was made redundant just days before his wife Natalie (top right) gave birth to their second child Jack (bottom left) in June last year and has been surviving on benefits . Helping daddy: Daughter Lucy featured in a YouTube video appeal, Mr Conway's first attempt to catch employers' attention . Mr . Conway graduated with a degree from Leeds College of Art and Design . studying creative advertising but began working as a youth support . worker four years ago. He was a senior project manager at a school for . children with additional needs when he was made redundant in June last . year. After responding to hundreds of job adverts and sending out CVs, Mr Conway found he barely received one response. Mr . Conway said: ‘It was soul destroying. I was desperate to find work but . couldn’t even get a foot in the door. I knew I had to try and tackle it . head on or lose my confidence all together.’ Sell yourself: Mr Conway even posted an advert on ebay selling himself for £25,000 in a bid to get a job until the site took down the ad, which breached their guidelines . Sweet bribery: Mr Conway landed a work placement after mailing a box of donuts with an offer to work for free. He hopes this will lead to his dream job . When he set up the website, his first appeal was a video made with his daughter in which the toddler helps her father chalk messages onto the floor explaining why he would make a good employee. He said: ‘I know not everyone likes this approach, in fact I think you love it or hate it. But the field in which I’ve studied and trained is creative so I figured I had nothing to lose by trying to demonstrate how creative I can be.’ After several other stunts he decided to start the competition. The jobseeker said: ‘People hear about jobs but I needed an incentive for them to take the time to tell me about them or tell their employers about me. Everyone wants an iPad mini so I started the competition to win one and had a brilliant response.’ ‘I would love to take someone into the Apple store and buy him or her a tablet for helping me get a job,’ he says. 'Money talks': He even sent out Monopoly money with covering letters and hid CVs in party pinatas in his hunt for a job . His distinctive idea of hiding his CV in piñatas, inspired by his daughter’s birthday party, led to an appeal on radio but no job offer. He said: ‘Everyone loved the piñata and I was looking for a way to make my CV stand out. I was writing and sending so many covering letters that I was bored of reading them myself so I imaged how bored the employers must be.’ Dan has been offered a work placement after mailing a box of donuts with an offer to work for free. He hopes it will help him land his dream job. Other stunts include sending Monopoly money with his covering letters and a covering letter jokingly warning employers they need to employ more red heads by law and offering his services. He said: ‘This is one of my favourites because it jokingly suggests they will get fined if they don’t have the right number of ginger employees and urging them to take me on quickly to avoid prosecution.’ He’s currently dreaming up more stunts and plans to continue posting stunts until he gains employment. He said: ‘I have to stay confident that I will eventually get noticed by the right person. In the meantime the support from all my followers helps keep me positive and give me fresh ideas.’ Employ more red heads: Mr Conway also sent this cover letter, warning potential employers that they must by law employ more workers with red hair, offering his services .","Dan Conway was made redundant in June last year and survives on benefits .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A social media consultant who claimed she was attacked for wearing Google Glass last month, was accused two years ago by neighbors of secretly recording them, court documents have revealed. Sarah Slocum was served a restraining order in August 2012 after admitting to secretly pointing her smartphone at her neighbors’ open window in Santa Cruz, California and recording their conversation. Jessie Lilley Campbell told CBS San Francisco she has made her scuffle with Slocum public 'because I wanted people to know that Sarah Slocum is no victim'. Campbell said she and her husband David Campbell have since relocated to another part of Santa Cruz, even though the restraining order against Slocum is still in effect, just to 'get away from her'. Scroll down for video . Accused: Sarah Slocum (pictured) was served a restraining order in August 2012 after admitting to secretly pointing her smartphone at her neighbors' open window in Santa Cruz, California and recording their conversation . Court action: Slocum's former neighbors, Jessie Lilley and David Campbell, took a restraining order out against Slocum in 2012 which is still in effect . Slocum, however, maintains the recording she made was from a place that was legal and she did it because her 'hippy biker neighbors' were talking about her. Slocum, 34, was living on a cabin on the same property as the Campbells, Baltimore Sun reported. 'It was a spat with . neighbors. That lady also recorded her husband (with her . cellphone) chasing a friend of mine with an axe,' Slocum told CBS San Francisco. 'I walked by their place on the way to my cabin, their window was open . and I could hear them from the driveway. I heard them talking about me . and conspiring against me so I started recording to capture what they . were saying so that I could show it to my friends and family.' ' Slocum gained internet notoriety last month after claiming she was attacked at Molotov's, a punk rock bar in San Francisco. She said a small group of people began to insult her and shout obscenities because of she was wearing Google Glass. 'They called me a bitch, they yelled, ‘F*** Google!'' Slocum said. 'One of the women shouted, ‘you guys are killing the city'.' She filmed at least two people attacking her, including a man who allegedly ripped the Glass off her face. Footage: Slocum captured the images of people she accused of attacking her in a San Francisco bar with the Google Glass she was wearing . She said also said a woman flipped her middle finger and invaded her personal space. Slocom claimed she was simply showing friends how to use the new technology when the attack happened out of the blue. However, a witness, Brian Lester, told CBS San Francisco that Slocum was being irritating, filming people on the device without their consent. 'The crowd was jeering as any last call crowd would do with a fight outside of a bar,' Lester said. 'She was running around very excited ... and people were telling her, 'you're being an *** take those glasses off'. 'I think everybody was just upset that she would be recording outside of a bar this late with obvious embarrassing behavior going on. And just rather insulted that someone thinks it's okay to record them the entire time they're in public.' The altercation came just a week after Google released a list of dos and don'ts for Glass users including 'don't be creepy or rude (aka, a 'Glasshole').'

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Tragic: Sydney Kustu was a former professor of biology at UC Berkeley. She killed herself Tuesday by mixing common chemicals and creating toxic gas that caused an entire San Francisco Bay area hotel and the surrounding block to be evacuated . A respected UC Berkeley sciences professor has now been identified as the woman who committed suicide in an historic San Francisco Bay Area hotel room using toxic gas on Tuesday, her 71st birthday. The landmark Berkeley City Club was evacuated around 2pm after Sydney Kustu mixed common chemicals to produce deadly sodium azide gas, authorities said Wednesday. Kustu, a member of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, was discovered dead by a maid and had reportedly left notes warning of the dangerous chemical. Colleagues said she was divorced and had a son. The club and hotel were immediately emptied and the surrounding streets and sidewalks closed to vehicles and pedestrians. Authorities treated it as a hazardous materials situation from the beginning thanks to Kustu's notes, the San Francisco Chronicle reports, but it took hours to ride the building of the substance. 'We treated the situation with an abundance of caution given the nature of what we were dealing with,' BPD spokesperson Officer Stephanie Polizziani said. According to Berkeleyside, coroners will conduct an autopsy to determine the exact cause of death unless 'a risk of exposure of the chemicals to employees' is determined. Kustu was at one time a member on the faculty of Berkeley's Plant & Microbial Biology Department, where she was recruited in 1987. Hotel guests and residents at the landmark Berkeley City Club were evacuated on Tuesday afternoon after an 80-year-old resident committed suicide in her room using a toxic chemical . The victim reportedly left a suicide note outside her apartment alerting first responders to the hazardous situation, police said. Other residents and guests were evacuated, but there no one else was injured. 'The known quantity of what appeared to be a hazardous material has been removed,' Sgt Okies BPD Sergeant Joe Okies said at the time. The Julia Morgan-designed Berkeley City Club is a hotel and private social club with an indoor swimming pool and a restaurant, as well as a hair salon and meeting spaces. The victim reportedly left a suicide note outside her third floor apartment alerting first responders to the hazardous situation .","Sydney Kustu mixed common products to produce deadly sodium azide gas in her hotel room on Tuesday afternoon .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 33-year-old man who at his heaviest weighed in at a colossal 962 pounds has undergone an astounding transformation in the last five years that has seen him emerge a fraction of his former self. At 205 pounds, Robert Walls is less than a quarter of the man he used to be and now he hopes that his amazing journey will help inspire others. At his heaviest, Walls, an aspiring chef who works as a line cook in Lawrence, Kansas, was confined to a nursing home surrounded by elderly people waiting to die. Not the man he used to be: Robert Walls now weighs about a quarter of what he did before he underwent gastric bypass surgery in 2008 . When he took the decision to undergo gastric bypass surgery in 2008 he had to because otherwise he was likely going to die. ‘Gastric bypass is not a magic fix,’ he told LJWorld.com. ‘Just because you have weight loss surgery doesn't mean you can continue to live the life you're living.’ In addition to his weight loss, he also had to undergo additional surgery to remove the hundreds of pounds of excess skin that hung of his body after he lost all the weight. He is quick to point out that an operation isn’t a simple fix and he has put in long hours at the gym and on the basketball court since his operation to reduce his weight. When Walls underwent the five-hour bypass operation in September 2008 he weighed 844 pounds after he had to loss 100 pounds to be able to have the surgery . Now he hopes that his hard work will inspire others to lose weight and get in shape. ‘I'm willing to do anything I can do to help others not get to where I was,’ he said. He has already counseled several teens and adults struggling with obesity, as well as people set to have gastric bypass surgery. 'Don't listen to anybody, if you think you can do it, do it,' he told WIBW. ‘I'll speak to any group of people, whether it's kids or adults. But they have to be prepared to hear the truth. I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I'm going to tell them I was so big I couldn't fit behind the wheel of a car. I'm going to tell them the real horrors of where obesity could get them.’ When Walls graduated from high school in 2000, he weighed 330 pounds. He was always a big guy; his problem wasn't so much with the foods he ate, he says, but portion sizes. ‘I was always a bigger guy, and I gradually started getting bigger,’ said Walls. ‘I had issues just like any other big person did, but I never thought there was anything wrong with me. I was happy being Big Rob. But as I started getting bigger and sicker, I started becoming more ashamed.’ When Walls had lost about 400 pounds, it became apparent he would need surgery to remove the loose, hanging skin on his body . As an aspiring chef, Walls had to leave culinary school because he was too sick. At his peak weight of 962 pounds, he moved to Illinois to take up a graphic arts job. ‘The job didn’t work out - it got to a point where I couldn’t physically handle the job,’ he told the Midland Reporter-Telegram. ‘I didn’t have any family where I was. Before you know it, I found myself homeless.’ Walls attempted different diets and weight-loss plans, but the pounds never stayed off. ‘I was trying all this different stuff. I lost a couple hundred pounds from different diets, but even then, I couldn’t sustain it. I would lose 200 pounds and then gain 50.’ Eventually, Walls ended up in the hospital, where they made the decision to admit him to a nursing home. ‘I couldn’t go out and work. I couldn’t stand on my feet 10 hours a day,’ he said. ‘It was like being in prison - not being able to do anything for yourself.’ Walls was in and out of nursing homes for a few years, a time he described as ‘very, very lonely.’ Robert Walls, laughs with friends and tosses a football around in Lawrence, Kan., on Friday. He wants to use his story to help others prevent or overcome obesity . ‘I spent a lot of time in those nursing homes by myself, staring at the walls, online chatting, doing graphic design work, even online dating,’ he said. ‘I was very standoffish with family and friends. I would go months, sometimes years, without talking to family. I would never visit family and friends because I was so ashamed. I went from being a very rah-rah, outgoing, front-of-the-crowd person to being more withdrawn.’ But there was an upside to all the loneliness. Though he was stuck in hospital and nursing home beds, Walls decided to continue his education. He obtained a bachelor’s degree in hotel restaurant management and degrees in culinary arts and graphic design. Then, he met two people who he said saved his life. Ron Goodman and Paige Whitney were both nurses at Walls’ nursing home, and they introduced him to the gastric bypass surgery. 'They were telling me how they felt I was too young to be in a nursing home,' said Walls. Walls said he has already counseled several teens and adults struggling with obesity, as well as people set to have gastric bypass surgery . 'I was 27, and I was seeing people die every day. I would go to breakfast with a lady who’s 75 or 80 years old and have a conversation with her, and then I would go look for her at lunch - and she’d be gone. I was living in a place where people go to die.' Walls was approved for the gastric bypass surgery, a procedure that divides the stomach and leads to a smaller functional stomach volume. When accompanied with diet and exercise, patients lose a large amount of weight over time. Dr. Subhash Nagalla, a bariatric surgeon at Odessa Regional Medical Center, said people with a body mass index (BMI) over 40, or over 35 with life-threatening conditions, qualify for the gastric bypass surgery. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9. First, Walls had to lose more than 100 pounds to prepare for the surgery. When he underwent the five-hour operation in September 2008, he weighed 844 pounds. Weight loss after gastric bypass surgery varies widely depending on how seriously the patient follows a proper diet and exercise, Nagalla said. Most patients typically lose about 40 pounds by the second month after surgery and 100 by the sixth month. Walls says his battle didn't end with weight-loss surgery and he still struggles with his health and with his self-image following the startling change . By Walls’ first month check-up, he had already lost 100 pounds. However, that weight didn’t come off easily, Walls said. The gastric bypass surgery involves special diets that must be followed, or patients could gain back all the weight they’ve lost. Walls was put on a diet where he was only able to eat two-ounce portions of food at a time. 'I went from being able to eat KFC every day to eating puréed food and protein shakes,' he said. 'All of my favorite things were pretty much nonexistent.' Walls continued losing weight over the next few years. When he had lost about 400 pounds, it became apparent he would need surgery to remove the loose, hanging skin on his body. More than 90 percent of patients who undergo weight loss surgery experience loose skin, Nagalla said. The skin loses its elasticity because of significant stretching to accommodate excessive weight gain. Eventually, it reaches a state where it cannot recoil after dramatic weight loss. Walls is quick to point out that an operation isn¿t a simple fix and he has put in long hours at the gym and on the basketball court since his operation to reduce his weight . Though Walls has been interviewed by Lifetime Television, A&E and Food Network to appear on various shows, he said he doesn’t want to glamorize the weight loss process. 'I feel they don’t give a very accurate glimpse, a real enough glimpse, of what a person goes through,' he said. 'I don’t want to tell my story from a glitzy, glamoury, ""it was easy"" perspective. Because it’s not. It’s not easy.' As for reality weight loss shows like The Biggest Loser - Walls said they’re a 'total crock.' 'Those people have every celebrity fitness trainer, every celebrity dietitian, every celebrity everything,' he said. 'They lose 100 pounds, they go off the show and then six months later, you see them on the red carpet somewhere enjoying their 15 minutes of fame - and they’ve gained it all back, plus 20 pounds. 'I’d really just like to stress that it does not happen overnight. It’s not easy. Don’t believe what you see on TV - with the magic diets and people having these weight loss surgeries and all of a sudden they’re smaller.' Walls says that reality weight loss shows like The Biggest Loser are a 'total crock' For Walls, his battle didn't end with weight-loss surgery. He said he still struggles with his health, and has even lost jobs because he was too ill to show up. And the body-image issues don't go away, either. 'There's still times today I'm totally not comfortable with the fact that I've lost all the weight. I look at myself in the mirror and think, ""Damn, I look sick, or, Man, I need to eat something,'"" he said. 'It's just such a change. 'It's a hard adjustment for me every day. But every day, I get a little more comfortable with myself.'

"By . Ryan Gorman . A married Manhattan anti-aging doctor has been accused of sharing naked pictures of patients and trading Botox for sex. Former Cenegenics employee AnnMarie Miglorino says Dr. George Shapiro, 53, often bragged about ‘Botox for b**w j***s’ and made unwanted sexual advances towards her last year in a harassment complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Miglorino, 32, says the father of five even showed her a picture of a woman ejaculating and asked ‘if I could do that,’ the New York Daily News reported, citing the complaint. At odds: Former nutritionist AnnMarie Miglorino (right) claims Dr George Shapiro (left) often made sexual advances and showed her naked pictures of patients . ‘They were allegedly for his medical journal, but they were in the camera roll on his cell phone,’ she told the paper. Miglorino objected to being shown the filth and ‘he’d laugh and try to make a joke out of if it,’ she added. The supposed pervert is also accused by Miglorino of showing her texts from women he had sex with and asking if she wanted to join them for threesomes, as well as making ‘creepy comments’ about how she looked in yoga pants. Shapiro made ‘repeated, frequent comments to me about what he thought about my anatomy (mostly my rear end and how he likes the way it looks in the yoga tights I was required to wear to work),’ she said in the complaint, according to the paper. He ‘tried to kiss me on the mouth several times, and hugged me inappropriately a few times in a sexual manner, pushing his hips into me,’ the complaint reportedly continues. Fired: Miglorino claims she was fired for spurning his multiple attempts to have sex with her . The final straw was last August when Shapiro cornered her in the Cenegenics office on Wall Street and said he wanted to ‘put her on the window sill’ and perform oral sex on her, Miglorino told the paper. ‘I immediately left the office and complained,’ she recalled. A manager soon became involved and went to Shapiro, but he responded angrily. ‘You have a big mouth,’ he snarled at her, according to the complaint. Shapiro is head of the national chain’s New York office. She soon became an outcast and by December was out of a job, fired without cause, she insists. ‘I’ve never not had a job before,’ she lamented to the paper. Better times: Shapiro and wife Celeste pictured at a 2006 benefit . Miglorino’s complaint is the first step towards filing a federal sexual harassment lawsuit against both Shapiro and Cenegenics. She is looking to be ‘compensated for the loss of work, stress and anxiety, and so that they learn their lesson from this,’ she explained. This is not  the veteran doctor's first brush with trouble. He pleaded guilty in 2006 to giving out unauthorized samples of Cialis, Viagra and other drugs, records showed. He received a year of probation and a $500 fine but was allowed to continue practicing medicine. Multiple messages left seeking comment from Shapiro were not returned.","Former Cenegenics nutritionist AnnMarie Miglorino says Dr George Shapiro often bragged about bedding patients .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Sales of existing homes have slipped to their lowest level in about two years as severe winter weather, rising prices and a tight supply of homes discourage buyers. The National Association of Realtors has revealed that sales declined 0.4 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6 million. That was the sixth decline in the past seven months. Freezing temperatures and snowstorms likely kept many buyers from visiting open houses, with higher mortgage rates weighing on sales since last fall. Calculatedriskblog.com mapped the new data in the following graphs. Modeled: The National Association of Realtors today revealed homes have slipped to their lowest level in about two years as severe winter weather, rising prices and a tight supply of homes discourage buyers . Behavioral mapping: Using NAR data, this graph by calculatedriskblog.com shows US home sales generally peak in the warmer months . Still, there were some signs that the market could pick up in the coming months. Sales improved in the South and West, where weather was less of a factor. And more people decided to sell, boosting the supply of available homes 6.4 percent to 2 million. 'Once we get past this messy period, housing should assume its role in supporting overall growth,' Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. Home prices are rising despite the sluggish sales, a sign that the number of homes for sale remains low. The median sales price has risen 9.1 percent in the past year, the Realtors said, to $189,000. Investors are accounting for an increasing share of purchases, while first-time buyers remain historically low. All-cash sales, which are mostly by investors, rose to 35 percent of purchases in February, up from 32 percent a year ago. Statistics: National Association of Realtors data shows sales declined 0.4 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.6 million - the sixth decline in the past seven months . First-time buyers accounted for only 28 percent of sales in February, slightly more than in January. That's far below the 40 percent that's typical of a healthy market. First-time buyers are being held back by tight credit standards and high levels of student loan debt, the Realtors said. Sales of existing homes climbed steadily in the first half of last year, reaching an annual pace of 5.38 million in July. And sales totaled 5.1 million in all of 2013, the most in seven years. That's still below the 5.5 million that is consistent with a healthy housing market. Dampened market: The latest National Association of Realtors data has revealed sluggish house sales during the winter period . But sales slowed in the fall as rising mortgage rates and higher home prices began to squeeze some buyers out of the market. Freezing temperatures and winter storms also kept prospective buyers away from open houses. Sales have fallen 14 percent since July. The average interest rate on a 30-year mortgage slipped to 4.32 percent last week from 4.37 percent. Rates have risen about a full percentage point since hitting record lows last spring.","National Association of Realtors data shows sales dropped 0.4 percent in February to 4.6 million .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Panicked: Driver Scott Tucker tried to hide from police who were pulling him over for a faulty tail light because he was wanted by officers . When Scott Tucker got behind the wheel of a car last week, he didn't have a license and was wanted by police on six warrants. So when an officer tried to pull him over for a faulty tail light, the 39-year-old went into panic mode, allegedly leaping from the driver's seat into the back seat of the moving car in an attempt to hide. The driverless 2003 Chevrolet Malibu careened, out-of-control, at 40mph on Main St in Maine as the front seat passenger attempted to steer while buckled into his own seat. Police say the car nearly collided with another vehicle before it finally stopped near the Parks Road intersection about 1am as officers followed. Richmond Police Chief Scott MacMaster told Portland Press Herald that Tucker then tried to get out of the car and flee on foot, but 'could not do so because the child safety locks were engaged'. MacMaster said Tucker, from West Gardiner, was deeply apologetic when he eventually got out of the car. 'He said, ‘I panicked',' MacMaster said, repeating what Tucker allegedly said to him. 'I hopped into the back seat hoping you wouldn’t see me driving.' Tucker was arrested on . charges of operating after suspension, driving to endanger, failure to . stop for an officer and violating conditions of release. He was also charged on six warrants out of Somerset County. Tucker was taken to Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset, but later freed on $250 cash bail.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An innocent bystander was shot and killed by a 14-year-old boy on a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus in Brooklyn, New York, on Thursday evening. The victim, identified by the police as Angel Rojas, 39, of East Flatbush, was rushed to Woodhull Medical Center, where he died a short time later, the police and emergency workers said. The shooting occurred shortly before 6:30 p.m. on a B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. Married father-of-two Angel Rojas, 39, was declared dead at a Brooklyn hospital after he was shot by a 14-year-old boy following a disagreement on a Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus on Thursday evening . The . victim was shot in the back of the head after tragically being in the wrong place at . the wrong time when a dispute involving several teenagers broke out on . the bus. The alleged killer and some other . teens were sitting at the rear of the bus when an apparent rival . boarded and started walking toward them, sources said. 'One kid pulls out a gun and he lets off a couple of rounds,' the source told the New York Daily News. 'He’s . running out of the bus, still letting rounds go, and this poor guy gets . shot in back of the head. He wasn’t the intended victim.' The victim was shot in the head following a dispute involving several teenagers on a B15 bus in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood on Thursday evening .

He worked at two grocery stores and would take the bus home in between shifts to hug his children and get something to eat, according to his family. 'That was very bad of him,' son Saury said of his father's killer. 'He’s too small to be with a gun. If he didn’t have that gun, my dad would be alive now.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A morbidly obese 12-year-old Texas girl suffering from a rare medical condition will undergo a gastric bypass surgery Friday aimed at giving her a new lease on life. Alexis Shapiro, from Cibolo, Texas, made headlines earlier this year when her health insurance company had refused to pay for the $50,000 life-changing operation. TRICARE eventually relented, agreeing to foot the bill for the doctor-recommended surgery that is expected to help the 4-foot-7, 203-pound teen lose weight and lead a normal life. Last-minute checkup: Alexis Shapiro, 12, is getting examined by Dr Thomas Inge Thursday, 24 hours ahead of her gastric bypass surgery . Just a kid: Alexis, pictured at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center Thursday, has been plagued by severe medical problems over the past two and a half years . Nervous, but excited: Alexis will undergo a weight-loss surgery in order to order to survive . Health problems: Alexis required medical attention earlier this week on her way to Ohio (left), and she landed in the Er last month (right) after complaining of chest pains . Step by step: Alexis, pictured here with her parents earlier this week, will remain hospitalized for a week after the surgery . Second chance: Alexis' mother said she hopes her daughter finally would be able to ride a bike and go swimming in the summer like other kids her age . Alexis suffers from hypothalmic . obesity related to an earlier brain surgery, which had caused her to . pack on more than 140lbs in two years. The . three-hour operation will take place at Cincinnati’s Children’s . Hospital Medical Center, which will be live-tweeting the procedure . beginning at 7.30am local time Friday. Alexis' mother, Jenny Shapiro, told NBC News that her daughter is both excited and nervous ahead of the operation. The 12-year-old's father, Ian Shapiro, described the experience as a roller coaster ride for their family. According to her doctors, without the surgery Alexis would continue to put on 2lbs a week, despite a strict daily regimen comprised of diet and exercise. Standing at only 4 feet 7 inches, Alexis wears women's size 2XL clothing . Rosy future: The hope is for Alexis to lose 40lbs in the first year after the gastric bypass . Preparing for her journey: Alexis is seen looking at the map to chart her route from her home state of Texas to Ohio, where she will undergo surgery Friday . Fan mail: Alexis' parents said that she has no friends, but since her story has gone viral, the girl has been receiving letters from supporters from all over the coutnry . If her condition is left untreated, Alexis would soon tip the scales at whopping 400lbs. The weight-loss surgery, which diminishes the size of the stomach and shortens the vagus nerve that control appetite, will help the girl feel more sated with less food. After the operation, Alexis could lose 5lbs a week, which would go a long way toward curing her diabetes and curbing her enormous appetite. But the procedure performed on such young a patient is not without its risks, chief among them is the fragility of the metabolic system in children suffering from hypothalamic obesity. However, Dr Thomas Inge, who will lead a team of doctors during the operation, expects everything to go smoothly for Alexis; she is expected to be out of surgery by noon Friday. The 12-year-old will remain hospitalized for a week. Once she is back home, Alexis will be put on a liquid diet for a month to allow her smaller stomach to adjust to the change. Eventually, the girl will be able to eat a full range of healthy foods. Complications: Alexis Shapiro has faced a host of medical problems stemming from a benign brain tumor she had removed two years ago . Remarkable: The family's cries for help raised more than they ever could have hoped, far exceeding their goal of $50,000 . Dr Inge estimates that his young . patient will be able to lose 20 per cent of her weight - about 40lbs - . in the first year after the surgery. Alexis' parents, who also have two younger daughters, say they do not consider . the surgery a magic bullet that will solve all of their daughter's . health problems at once. Miracle worker: Doctor Thomas Inge, from Children's Hospital Medical Center, will lead the team of surgeons who will operate on Alexis . Mrs . Shapiro says she simply wants her 12-year-old to be able to ride a bike . like other kids, go swimming with her siblings and walk around without . drawing stares from strangers. The . family said they have been overwhelmed with support from well-wishers . from around the world, who have donated more than $82,000 toward Alexis' medical care, travel costs and living expenses through the Shapiros' online fundraising campaign. Whatever remains of the fund will go towards helping other sick children, Jenny Shapiro said earlier this year. Alexis' life-threatening condition was triggered by surgery she had two years ago to remove a benign brain tumor. During the operation, her hypothalamus and pituitary gland, which help govern appetite and weight, were damaged. She now feels constantly hungry and her weight has caused other medical conditions. After her brain surgery, Alex's parents had to take extreme measures to keep their daughter from eating herself to death. 'She’s always hungry,' her father Ian Shapiro said. 'In the past, we’ve had to padlock the cupboard.' In . just the past four months, Alexis was hospitalized for a kidney . infection and developed Type 2 diabetes that requires nightly insulin . injections. This is Alexis before she had brain surgery that caused her to develop hypothalamic obesity after doing damage to her hypothalamus . More than half of children with the specific form of tumor Alexis had experience similar post-operative symptoms. Alexis may be a child, but she wears a women's size 2XL . and she goes up a size every month. When asked by psychologists about . how she is coping with her condition, she has told them she 'wants to . die.' After TRICARE, a . military health insurance, rejected the family's initial request for . coverage, citing a lack of detail in the application about Alexis' condition, the young girl's family was afraid the appeal process would . take longer than she had. 'These kids will literally eat themselves to death,' Jenny Shapiro said. 'That’s what I’m scared of.' The . outpouring of love and funds on the 'Hope for Alexis' GoFundMe page . gave hope to Alexis, whose condition has caused her to withdraw into her . shell. She is now home-schooled and has no friends. 'I hope this Friday will be the beginning of the end of all of her . pain and insecurities,' Jenny Shapiro wrote in a blog post this week. 'I hope she won’t have to endure another day . feeling like she is starving. I hope she will be able to think about fun . things, not just when she will get to eat next.' If Alexis gets the surgery she may be able to lead a normal life again and keep off the weight .","Alexis Shapiro, 12,  has a rare medical condition that causes her to feel hungry all the time .

"By . Associated Press . An Army general who carried on a three-year affair with a captain and had two other inappropriate relationships with subordinates was reprimanded and docked $20,000 in pay on Thursday, avoiding jail time in one of the military's most closely watched courts-martial. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair, the former deputy commander of the storied 82nd Airborne Division, was believed to be the highest-ranking U.S. military officer ever court-martialed on sexual assault charges, but earlier this week those charges were dropped when he pleaded guilty to inappropriate relationships with the three women. Sinclair smiled and hugged his two lawyers in the courtroom. Outside the building in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, he made a brief statement. Scroll down for video . Brig Gen. Jeff Sinclair arrives to the Fort Bragg courthouse, for his sentencing hearing on Wednesday in Fort Bragg, North Carolina . 'The system worked. I've always been proud of my Army,' he said. 'All I want to do now is go north and hug my kids and my wife.' The case unfolded with the Pentagon under heavy pressure to confront what it has called an epidemic of rape and other sexual misconduct in the ranks. As part of the plea deal, Sinclair's sentence could not exceed terms in a sealed agreement between defense lawyers and military attorneys. The agreement, unsealed on Thursday, called for Sinclair to serve no more than 18 months in jail, but the judge's punishment was much lighter. Prosecutors did not immediately comment. Capt. Cassie L. Fowler, the military lawyer assigned to represent the accuser's interests, had a grim expression after the sentence was imposed and declined to comment. Sinclair's wife Rebecca has not been present during the court-martial proceedings . In closing arguments, prosecutors argued Sinclair should be thrown out of the Army and lose his military benefits, while the defense said that would harm his innocent wife and children the most. The two sides also offered contrasting arguments about the seriousness of the misdeeds that felled the general. 'It's not just one mistake. Not just one lapse in judgment. It was repeated,' said prosecutor Maj. Rebecca DiMuro. 'They are not mistakes. We are not in the court of criminal mistakes. These are crimes.' The . defense had called a host of character witnesses this week to laud . Sinclair as a selfless leader in hopes of getting a lenient punishment. Defense attorney Richard Scheff said Sinclair will retire from the military. 'He has new mountains to climb,' he said. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Sinclair, left, who admitted to inappropriate relationships with three subordinates, leaves court while talking with his defense attorney Richard Scheff on Wednesday . Scheff said the case against Sinclair was one of pure adultery, which is a crime in the military. 'People ought to be encouraged to come forward and the right cases brought. This was not the right case,' Scheff said. Prosecutors . did not ask the judge to send Sinclair to jail, even though the maximum . penalty he faced on the charges to which he pleaded guilty was more . than 20 years. The judge . could have also dismissed Sinclair from the Army, which would have . likely wiped out his Veterans Administration health care and military . retirement benefits. The . general also pleaded guilty to adultery and using his government-issued . credit card to pay for trips to see his mistress and other conduct . unbecoming an officer. Sinclair had been accused of twice forcing the female captain to perform oral sex during their affair. The . Army's case against Sinclair started to crumble as questions arose . about his primary accuser's credibility and whether military officials . improperly rejected a previous plea deal because of political concerns. A . military lawyer representing Sinclair argued that his wife, Rebecca, . had made a significant investment in the Army herself by holding . leadership positions in organizations that helped soldiers' families. Maj. Sean Foster said Rebecca Sinclair and the couple's two sons would . be hurt the most if the general lost benefits. Sinclair, pictured on Wednesday, wept and hugged his lawyers in court today as it was ruled he would receive no jail time . 'These three are the only truly innocent people in this case,' he said. Sinclair's wife has not been present during the court proceedings and was not there on Thursday. Sinclair broke down in tears multiple times during Wednesday's hearing. When . a letter from his wife was read aloud, Sinclair buried his head in his . hands, appeared to cry and dabbed his eyes with two tissues. In . the letter, Rebecca Sinclair said she hasn't fully forgiven her husband . but doesn't want the Army to punish him and his family further with a . significant reduction to his pension and other benefits. 'Believe . me when I tell you that the public humiliation and vilification he has . endured are nothing compared to the private suffering and guilt that he . lives with every day,' wrote Rebecca Sinclair, who hasn't attended her . husband's hearings. Jeffrey . Sinclair also broke down at several points as he read a statement to the . judge, pausing to collect himself. He apologized to his family and the . women with whom he admitted inappropriate relationships. 'I've . been frustrated and angry, but I don't have to look any further than . the mirror for someone to blame,' he said, noting the hearing came . exactly two years after the captain came forward with allegations on .

"By . Damien Gayle . Toronto's gregarious mayor Rob Ford may yet regret being such a naughty boy. One of the city's top fetish queens is planning on whipping its administration into shape by challenging Ford for the mayoralty. Carlie Ritch - known to her clients as Mizz Barbie B**** - is a professional dominatrix and believes she can run Canada's most populous city better than the controversial incumbent. Scroll down for video . Mayor Ford, you've been a very naughty boy: Professional dominatrix Carlie Ritch is to challenge Rob Ford in Toronto's upcoming mayoral elections after getting fed up with his 'arrogance and abuse of power' Ms Ritch, a mother of two grown up children and grandmother of one, runs a busy Toronto dungeon and her plans to open a chain of dominatrix schools are being looked at by the angel investors of Dragon's Den . The 43-year-old says the confidence she has gained as a dominatrix has made her the perfect candidate to challenge Ford's 'arrogance and abuse of power'. Ms Ritch, a mother of two grown up children and grandmother of one, runs a busy Toronto dungeon and her plans to open a chain of dominatrix schools are being looked at by the angel investors of Dragon's Den. She even claims to have clients at City Hall, although she declines to name them. With campaign slogans including 'I'll . whip this city into shape' and 'I mean business', Ms Ritch says she is . 'a warrior' who will 'change things at City Hall.' 'If . I get elected I'd clean house, councillors who've been there 30 years . have got to go. Any bureaucrats not doing their job will be re-assigned . or moved out,' she told the Toronto Sun. And . in case Toronto's citizens were worried that they might end up with . another mayor hitting the front pages for all the wrong reasons, she . insisted: 'I don’t have any skeletons in my closet. 'I AM the skeleton.' 'I AM the skeleton': The successful businesswoman even claims to have City Hall officials among her clients . Mayor Ford laughs in front of a 'Keep Calm and Carry On' sign at City Hall yesterday: After being elected on a Right-wing ticket in 2010, he has been under pressure to resign since admitting smoking crack last year . Ms Ritch doesn't think her career as a dominatrix should put people off her, claiming she is as normal as anyone else. I'm a single mum and I've worked for everything I have. I'm really that blue-collar, normal, ordinary person,' she said. Indeed, after the scandal-ridden tenture of crack-smoking incumbent Mayor Ford, even the candidacy of such a flamboyant character as Mizz Barbie Bitch might seem to Toronto's voters like a return to relative political normality. The mayor has become notorious for his associations with alleged drug dealers, drunken outbursts and unpredictable behaviour - but has consistently dismissed calls for his resignation. Controversial: Mayor Ford wades through a media scrum outside City Hall . Just yesterday Mayor ford fled journalists after Toronto's police released a detailed description of a video which shows him smoking the highly addictive cocaine derivative. That embarrassment came just two days after the party-loving politician was filmed apparently drunk and swearing at passing cars during Toronto's St Patrick's Day celebrations. In January he was filmed in a Toronto restaurant ranting obscenities in Jamaican patois. After being elected on a Right-wing ticket in 2010, Mayor Ford has been under great pressure to resign since he admitted smoking crack last year. Toronto's City Council stripped him of many of his powers but does not have the authority to remove him. Undaunted, he has vowed to run for re-election this autumn.","Pro dominatrix Carlie Ritch says she is fed up with Ford's 'arrogance'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . As college basketball dominates the cable line-up this month, sports fans are looking for any excuse to catch all the action - including by scheduling a vasectomy. Urologists report a spike in men getting the 'snip' in the first week of the annual March Madness tournament, so patients can spend their recovery time watching TV completely guilt-free. 'We do have (in March) typically about 50 percent more vasectomies than in other months,' Dr Ed Sabanegh, chairman of the Department of Urology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, told CNN. 'A lot of patients come in and say, ‘I have to have this during March Madness, you have to talk to my wife about it. Tell her what my limitations are and that I need to be on the couch'. They’ll even tell us to exaggerate a little about how long it takes to recover.' March Madness: Urologists report an increase in vasectomies during the annual basketball tournament . While the American Urological Association says it doesn't have data to back the claims, doctors across the country have attested to the 'vasectomy vacation' trend during major sporting events. This includes 'March Madness', or the annual NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, which this year runs from March 18 to April 7. The department of urology at the Cleveland Clinic is already preparing by opening up extra appointments to handle the higher number of vasectomies. 'At least half the guys that I’ve got scheduled for later in the week acknowledge that they are here specifically here for that reason,' Dr Stephen Jones, from the Cleveland Clinic, said. 'And in fact the guy this morning said ‘absolutely, that’s why I’m on the schedule for Friday.’ This was my first consultation with him. But as soon as I asked him about it he was a little sheepish to recognize that’s why he’s off work that day.' During the 15 to 20 minute surgical procedure, tubes are tied to block the release of sperm when a man ejaculates to prevent pregnancy. Recovery times range from a day to a week, depending on the type of surgery chosen, but rest and ice are generally the recommended treatments. On the ground: Texas urologist Dr Grant Fowler (left) and Dr Stephen Jones of the Cleveland Clinic (right) both report a spike in vasectomy patients during March Madness . Dr Sabanegh from the Cleveland Clinic . claims some enthusiastic fans stroll into their appointment sporting the jerseys of their favorite teams. 'This patient in the past few years came in with his team's logo on an ice bag, Ohio State,' he said. 'He was just excited about the game, and I said, 'We are all Ohio State fans today'.' Texas urologist Dr Grant Fowler also reported March Madness spike at his clinic, telling CBS the days needed to recover from the procedure coincide with the basketball games. Although he noted he is performing less vasectomies now than during the recession. In Los Angeles, Mike LaSalle, a 40-year-old father of two, had a vasectomy on Friday. 'If you are going to be laid up on the couch for a few days, you might as well get (a vasectomy) done when there is some great college basketball on TV,' he told CNN. 'You had all the conference championship games over the weekend and the NCAA tourney starts this week.' Procedure: A vasectomy involves cutting and sealing the vasa deferintia, tubes in the reproductive system that carry sperm . Daily Herald reported that during last year's tournament, Urology Associates of Cape Cod in Massachusetts gave away 41 coupons for free pizza to . vasectomy patients as part of a promotion. It declined to repeat the deal this year. 'Want to watch college basketball guilt-free?' the cable ad stated. 'Camp out on the couch for uninterrupted basketball.' The clinic's practice coordinator, Ethan Cohen, reported an 'uptick' in business. 'The promotion gave the wife an opportunity to take about vasectomies, because in our experience usually the guy doesn't bring it up, it's the wife,' he said.","Doctors report a spike in patients who time their 'snips' to coincide with the annual NCAA basketball event .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Acquitted: Joshua Tate, 22, has been found not guilty of assaulting a drunk classmate in 2012 . A U.S. Naval Academy football player has been found not guilty of sexual assaulting a drunk classmate at an off-campus party. Joshua Tate, from Nashville, Tennessee, had been accused of having sex with the woman at a party in 2012 even though she claimed she was too drunk to consent to having sex with him. Following a three-day trial on Thursday, military judge Col. Daniel Daughtery acquitted Tate, 22, of aggravated sexual assault, saying prosecutors had not proved their case beyond reasonable doubt. One of Tate's attorneys, Jason Ehrenberg, said his client's reaction to the decision was 'one of great relief' and called him a 'good young man'. But an attorney for the woman said in a telephone interview after the judge's verdict that 'deeply disappointed doesn't adequately describe' his client's reaction to the case's outcome. Ryan Guilds said his client was 'appalled by the lack of accountability' and said the case's outcome was a result of a 'flawed military system' and a failed investigation. The woman, who testified for more than five hours, said she drank heavily before and during the 'Toga and Yoga' party, which was held off-campus near the school in Annapolis, Maryland. She said she couldn't remember having sex with Tate - but when she found an open condom wrapper and began hearing rumors about her having sex with multiple people at the party, she asked him. Scene: The party was held at a house near the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, pictured. The woman said she was so drunk that she could not have consented to sex with Tate . 'What you don't remember?' he said, she claimed. 'I'm going to have to refresh your memory.' Initially, she did not cooperate with investigators and held back information because she wanted the case to go away and did not want to disappoint her mother, she said. But after the investigation was closed, she had a change of heart and it was reopened. Prosecutors had tried to show that the alleged victim was too drunk to consent to sexual activity - and was so drunk she could not walk, talk or make decisions clearly. But two men who had been initially accused in the case denied that she had been that drunk. One of the men, Eric Graham from Eight Mile, Alabama, told the court that the woman had also performed oral sex on him in a car at the party. During . the incident, which occurred after she had allegedly had sex with Tate in the car, . the woman also asked Graham to have sex, he claimed. He added that the woman did not appear 'dangerously intoxicated' and was in control of her body. Teammate: Football players Tra'ves Bush, left, and Eric Graham, right, were also initially accused of sexual assault after Bush had sex with the woman in a bathroom and Graham received oral sex from her . Another football player who was also initially accused, Tra'ves Bush from Johnston, South Carolina, agreed that she was 'in control of her movements and her speech'. The couple, who had recently ended a casual relationship, had also had sex that night. The morning after the party, she woke up on a couch with an aching back and asked another Navy football player to feel the knots in her back. About 45 minutes later, she and the player had consensual sex. Afterwards, he suggested they take a ride back to the Academy with his friends and when she climbed in the car, she recognized it from the night before - and saw an opened condom wrapper. When she returned to campus, she confronted Tate, who admitted they had had sex. Bush and Graham were also initially . accused of sexually assaulting the woman but Tate was the only student . ultimately brought to court-martial, the military's equivalent of a . trial. The military held an Article 32 hearing, which resembles a preliminary hearing in civilian court, in August and September of 2013. Not charged: Bush and Graham, pictured, denied that the woman was 'too intoxicated' to consent . Following that hearing, the academy's head, Vice Admiral Michael H. Miller, decided not to pursue charges against Bush, saying there were no 'reasonable grounds' to believe he committed a crime. Charges against Graham were dropped in January, which prosecutors had recommended after a military judge said statements he made during an investigation would not be admissible during a military trial. Just hours before the verdict on Thursday, a separate court-martial unfolding in Fort Bragg, North Carolina also ended in favor of the defense. Brig. Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair was reprimanded and docked four months' pay . but avoided prison time for carrying on a three-year affair with a . captain who later claimed she had been sexually assaulted. The . two cases underscore the military's attempts to grapple with sexual . misconduct within its ranks. A Pentagon report released last year . estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually . assaulted in the prior year and that thousands of victims are unwilling . to come forward out of fear their careers might be derailed.","Joshua Tate was acquitted of aggravated sexual assault on Thursday .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . A 36-year-old woman who escaped police custody at a Pennsylvania hospital while pregnant has pleaded guilty to kidnapping a woman and her infant at knife point last year. Billie Jo Ribble faces at least 20 years in prison when she is sentenced on June 25. The New York woman was arrested last March in Mansfield on charges stemming from a 2012 burglary near her hometown of Bath. Ribble, who told police she was seven months pregnant, was taken to the hospital in Wellsboro after complaining of stomach pains. Police say Ribble assaulted her hospital guard, then jumped out a third-story window to a second-story rooftop and climbed down. She kidnapped a Wellsboro woman and her six-month-old baby at knifepoint and made the woman drive her to New York, where she was captured in Corning. Pictured: Billie Jo Ribble, 36, has pleaded guilty to kidnapping a woman and her infant at knife point last year . Ribble's extensive criminal history first unfolded in March last year, when she was arrested in Mansfield on charges stemming from an October theft of 15 rifles and shotguns from a home in Howard, New York. Steuben County sheriff's investigators had been tipped off she was meeting someone at the Walmart in Mansfield to receive 'travel money', Steuben County Undersheriff Jeffrey Allard said. He said that when she arrived, she was taken into custody by Pennsylvania State Police. After being arraigned in a Tioga County court on fugitive-from-justice charges, Ribble was being taken to jail that night when she complained of stomach pains related to her pregnancy, the undersheriff said. Ribble, who told Allard she was seven months pregnant, was taken to a hospital in nearby Wellsboro. At the hospital, officials said, she grabbed a chair or stool and hit a county correction officer. Ribble then jumped out a third-story window onto a second-story roof, where she used a ladder to reach the ground, authorities said. She broke into the basement of a Wellsboro home where a woman and her six-month-old daughter were sleeping. The woman was awakened by Ribble who was standing over her daughter's crib with a large butcher's knife. Charged: Billie Jo Ribble was arraigned in Rochester Supreme Court (pictured) on two counts of kidnapping last year . Police said Ribble threatened to kill the woman, the child and herself if the woman didn't take her where she wanted to go. The woman got into the driver's seat of her car and Ribble got into the front passenger seat, still holding the woman's daughter and the butcher's knife. At Ribble's direction, the woman drove from Pennsylvania to an exit off Route 15 in Lindley, where Ribble was dropped off. En route, Ribble used the woman's cellphone to call someone in Corning, New York. Ribble disabled the woman's phone, he said, but the woman contacted police once she was back in Pennsylvania. New York State Police were able to track Ribble's call to a home in Corning where she had lived previously. It was allegedly the home of her alleged boyfriend, Robert Bavisotto. When police arrived at the home, Ribble fled to the attic, where she threatened to harm herself and her unborn child, Allard said. After about an hour of talking with police, Ribble surrendered, he said. Bavisotto was last year charged with hindering prosecution. Charged: Robert Bavisotto (pictured), believed to have been Ribble's boyfriend, was last year charged with hindering prosecution, accused of  helping Billie Jo Ribble to evade police last year . Corning police said Ribble's arrest record in the city dates back to 2006, mostly for crimes involving drugs, weapons or assault. Her New York prison record shows time spent at Albion Correctional Facility for a robbery conviction in 2003 and another stint for a parole violation. She was released from prison in January 2012. Allard said she tried to elude arrest for the parole violation by jumping out a home's second-story window. 'She has a pretty good history of flight,' Allard said, adding that a network of family and friends helped her elude police over the past several months. Allard said Ribble reported being pregnant with her first child. He didn't know if she was married. The Leader of Corning reported that Ribble was a standout basketball player in the 1990s at nearby Campbell-Savona and Alfred State College in neighboring Allegany County.","Billie Jo Ribble, 36, was arrested last year for allegedly stealing weapons in October 2012 .

"By . Ashley Collman . A Washington mother who was told her daughter died in a car accident over the weekend, got a shock of relief when she went to examine the young woman's body on Wednesday and realized it wasn't the 24 year old. Lori Baker was told by a police chaplain Monday that her daughter died in Spanaway on March 14 when a soldier driving a pick-up truck hit her crossing the street. At the time, Baker asked to see her daughter but was told it was a 'bio-hazard' and that she would have to wait for the body to be released to a funeral home. Scroll down for video . Bad news: Authorities in Pierce County, Washington told Lori Baker (left) on Monday that her 24-year-old daughter Samantha Kennedy (right) had been killed in a car accident in Spanaway . So Baker went on with the funeral preparations, writing an obituary and the painful process of informing family - including her 7-year-old granddaughter Abigail - that she had died. Baker went to Mt View Funeral home in Lakewood on Wednesday with her sister when the body was finally realeased by the medical examiner. 'My sister went in with me holding my hand and we both screamed at the same time, it’s not her!' Baker told KIRO TV. Her shock quickly turned to outrage when the weight of her premature mourning washed over her. You can't see her: When Baker asked to see her daughter, the medical examiner said no because it was a 'bio-hazard'. She had to wait for the body to be released to a funeral home and that's when she realized the victim wasn't Kennedy . Inked: The medical examiner identified the car crash victim's body as Kennedy using descriptions of the young woman's tattoos her friends gave . 'How can you go around telling people their kid is dead without proof?' Baker asked. The body was later returned to the medical examiner's office and properly identified as 25-year-old Jane Aubrey Peterson. The Pierce County Medical Examiner's Office released a statement following the misidentification Wednesday, explaining the mix-up. The medical examiner was contacted by friends of Kennedy after the crash, who believed the victim was their friend since she had been missing for a few days. One of her friends described a tattoo Kennedy had and the medical examiner matched it on the victim's body and identified her that way. While the medical examiner's office does use more precise ways of identifying dead bodies, such as through fingerprinting, dental records and DNA, they are not used unless necessary because they 'are time-consuming,expensive and create delays that are burdensome on families'. Still missing: Lori Baker (right) says she's had sporadic contact with her daughter since she left the home at age 16. Kennedy is still missing and Baker is now aiding in the search . Lori Baker pictured with some of her other children . 'In most cases, identification can be resolved by driver's licenses and family identification of distinctive features, such as tattoos.' However, the medical examiner says they will be adjusting their practices in light of this incident. 'I don’t think anyone did anything wrong. It was a simple misunderstanding,' Dr Thomas Clark told the News Tribune.  'The appropriate response is to adjust your policies and practices to ensure something like this does not happen again. We are reviewing the circumstances and will adjust our practices.' Meanwhile Samantha Kennedy is still missing. Baker says she's been in sporadic contact with her daughter since she left home at the age of 16, but is now aiding in the search for the missing woman. 'I still don’t know where my daughter is, but at least I know she’s not the one who was killed,' Baker said. 'I’m really relieved.'","A police chaplain told Lori Baker that her 24-year-old daughter died in a car crash on March 14 .

"Republican Senator Rand Paul walked into enemy territory Wednesday night – the often-dubbed 'People's Republic' of Berkeley, California – and castigated America's spying apparatus before an unlikely constituency of well-wishers: college students from one of the most liberal universities in the U.S. About 400 crowded into a UC Berkeley auditorium to hear the Kentucky civil libertarian rail against a National Security Agency that shows 'sheer arrogance,' and whose leaders are 'only sorry they got caught' when leaker Edward Snowden spilled his guts. 'No one on the [Senate] Intelligence Committee was even contrite,' Paul recalled, jabbing also at his colleagues. 'Their only regret was that the program was no longer secret.' 'Your rights, especially your right to privacy, are under assault,' he told the audience, in between stretches of sustained applause. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . 'If you own a cell phone, you¿re under surveillance,' U.S. Sen. Rand Paul told a capacity crowd at the Berkeley Forum on Wednesday . Will he or won't he? Paul says 'maybe' he'll run for president, but spent his time lecturing about the importance of siding with privacy over domestic government surveillance . Referring to published claims that the Central Intelligence Agency spied on California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein’s staffers, Paul said: 'I think I perceive fear of an intelligence community that’s drunk with power, unrepentant and uninclined to relinquish power.' And appealing to college students' unalienable right to mobile phone calls and text messages, he laid a major applause line on the table during the 40-minute event. 'I am here to tell you that if you own a cell phone, you’re under surveillance,' he declared. 'I believe what you do on your cellphone is none of their damned business.' Paul slammed both the CIA and the NSA, saying they had concluded 'equal protection means Americans should be spied upon equally.' Asked by the event's moderator whether his outreach was part of a play for the presidency in 2016, the strategically coy senator uttered only one word. 'Maybe.' 'Part of it might be that,' he admitted. 'Part of it might be that. Part of it might be that the Republican Party – I’ve said they either have to evolve, adapt or die.' Paul is believed to be laying he groundwork for a White House run, attracting new constituencies with a shrewd personal-privacy message that crosses party lines . Ron Paul (R), the senator's father and a former Texas congressman, attracted legions of 'Paulite' fans on the 2012 presidential campaign trail; Rand may be able to mobilize a similar sleeping-giant groundswell of support . Paul compared his own GOP to the Domino's chain, which admitted in its 2010 'pizza turnaround' ad push that it had been selling mediocre crust. 'I think the Republican Party finally admitted it: ""OK, bad crust, we need a different kind of party.""' he quipped. Since the beginning of 2013 Paul has tried to extend his appeal from the GOP's libertarian wing to what he calls 'liberty-minded' Americans of all political stripes. That includes students at the university once known for hosting anti-establishment protests, not Republicans. Last month he won the straw poll at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, and this month he topped the tally at the more moderate Northeast Republican Leadership Council. In April 2013 he strode into a lecture hall at Howard University, the historically black college in Washington, D.C., and outlined a case for why young African-Americans shouldn't reflexively vote for liberals – despite being disproportionate beneficiaries of government entitlement programs endorsed by the Democratic Party. He made a similar pitch in February at Simmons College in his home state. Days later the interim president of the NAACP said during a C-SPAN interview that she would like Paul to speak with her group about his plan for rescuing the financially devastated city of Detroit. 'Berzerkeley': The campus where Sen. Paul spoke on Wednesday is known for its flavor of outspoken liberalism, but he drew consistent applause and a standing ovation from hundreds there . Kumbayah, 164 edition: Joan Baez sang to hundreds of Berkeley students 50 years ago during a rally inspired by the radical group Students for a Democratic Society . He has outlined a program of 'economic freedom zones' where bankrupted and economically depressed cities could operate under dramatically lowered tax rates and broadly loosened government regulation, in order to revitalize commerce and stop mass-stampedes to the suburbs. But Paul's chief message was that 'no one – no one should be allowed to invade your privacy.' He announced that he would push for a new and independent congressional committee including members from both parties, with 'full power to investigate and reform those who spy on us in the name of protecting us.' 'It should watch the watchers.' He took one slap at President Barack Obama, calling it 'ironic that the first African-American president has, without compunction, allowed this vast exercise of raw power by the NSA.' 'Certainly [former FBI Director] J. Edgar Hoover's illegal spying on Martin Luther King and others in the civil rights movement should give us all pause.'","Kentucky senator blasted the CIA, NSA and Senate Intelligence Committee for working overtime to hide snooping programs from US taxpayers .

"By . Associated Press . and Ryan Gorman . A scorned ex-boyfriend sent a birthday card laced with ricin to his former girlfriend's current boyfriend, according to police. Nicholas Helman, 19, of Hatboro, Pennsylvania, was arrested Wednesday on an attempted murder charge and other counts after testing confirmed the deadly poison was inside an envelope he reportedly stuffed in his target's mailbox. His plot was foiled after he bragged to a Target co-worker earlier this month that he sent a poison-laced scratch-and-sniff card to his ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend and that the man would die if he opened it, sources told WCAU. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Locked up: NIcholas Helman was arrested after sending a ricin-laced scratch-and-sniff card to his ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend, police said . The co-worker notified police, who called the recipient's home and spoke to his mother, who said her daughter was outside getting the mail at that moment. Authorities then went to the home to confiscate the card. Footage from the scene showed several officers in hazmat suits as a precaution. Helman told investigators during initial questioning March 7 that he had coated the card with a substance that resembled anthrax, authorities said in an affidavit of probable cause. The deluded man told investigators he intended to scare his ex-girlfriend in hopes of reconciling with her, police said. He also sent threatening messages to the pair last November as well, police told WCAU. A longtime friend of Helman's was shocked by the accusations . Dangerous: A hazmat team was called in to confiscate the poison letter from the rival's home . Arrested: Helman was first arrested and charged with harassment . 'I really couldn't imagine him doing something like that,' the man told WCAU. 'I've known him since Middle School. 'He was an odd kid, the friend continued. 'I would say he wasn't always the most social kid. He was very tech savvy. He was probably the smartest kid I've ever known but he never really applied himself.' The deranged man was initially was charged with terroristic threats and harassment and spent four days behind bars before making bail. Authorities said Helman had ingredients for making ricin, a poison that occurs naturally in castor beans, but that initial tests didn't turn up the toxin itself. The card was then sent away for more lab tests that revealed traces of ricin, the district attorney's office said. 'Lab results on the white powder that was found in the correspondence did prove to test positive for the toxin of ricin,' an official told WPVI. Toxic standoff: Officers showed up to Helman's home in hazmat gear after tests showed the letter contained ricin, he was arrested only after an hours-long standoff, authorities said . Police accompanied by hazardous materials teams and the FBI then arrested Helman a second time after a multi-hour standoff to add attempted murder and other related charges to his rap sheet. A neighbor of Helman's was upset over the poison being in the same neighborhood as his children. 'That's really disturbing,' Fred Zimmerman told WPVI. 'I have a 9-year-old, and the kids outside play and ride bikes around here. To hear something like that going on so close is really troubling.' Bucks County District Attorney David Heckler told The Philadelphia Inquirer that the toxin was 'very potent.' 'He made ricin, and if you lick that card, you're dead,' he said. Court documents don't list an attorney for Helman, who was jailed without bail after his arraignment Wednesday night. He has a March 27 preliminary hearing. His father, Douglas, told The (Doylestown) Intelligencer that he knew nothing about the charges. He said his son had been good at science and math in school and made Eagle Scout last year.","NIcholas Helman, 19, has been charged with attempted murder and harassment for sending the poisoned card to his ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Swedish superstore Ikea has recalled nearly three million baby bed canopies over fears they could strangle children. The furniture maker took action today after receiving reports of young children becoming entangled in the product. The company has asked parents who have bought the canopies, which look like mosquito nets and are designed to be draped over a child's bed, to stop using them immediately. Recall: Swedish furniture maker Ikea has recalled nearly three million baby bed canopies (pictured) over fears they could strangle children, it has emerged . Ikea spokeswoman Ylva Magnusson said: 'We have had some reports of young children getting entangled in these canopies.' She said some children have suffered minor injuries as a result of getting caught in the canopies. 'However there is no child that has had permanent injuries ... and as a safety measure we are recalling the products,' she added. The company asked customers who have bought the canopies to return them to Ikea stores around the world for a full refund. 'We apologise for any possible inconvenience this may cause, but safety is always the highest priority for Ikea,' the company added in a statement listing eight different canopy models. The worldwide recall concerns more than 2.8 million products sold since 1996. The affected models are Legendarisk, Minnen bed canopy set, Barnslig Boll, Minnen Brodyr, Himmel, Fabler, Tissla and Klammig. Ikea gave no explanation as to why the products were on the market for so long before a recall was deemed necessary. Apology: A spokeswoman for the company said any parent whose child has the mosquito net-like canopy hanging above their bed, should stop using the product and return it to their nearest store .","Swedish furniture maker took action after receiving reports of injuries .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The army private convicted as Bradley Manning for releasing US diplomatic and military secrets to Wikileaks has officially petitioned a Kansas court for a name change to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning. Manning who announced last August that she identifies as a woman and wants to be called Chelsea has a hearing scheduled at Fort Leavenworth, where Manning is serving his 35-year sentence. The news was announced on Wednesday by the Private Manning Support Network, which also said it is changing its name to the Chelsea Manning Support Network. Name change: Chelsea Manning, who was tried and convicted for leaking U.S. secrets to WikiLeaks, is petitioning a Kansas court for an official name change, to Chelsea Elizabeth Manning . Officials at Fort Leavenworth have said Manning would have to get a legal name change to be known as Chelsea. Media has referred to Manning as Chelsea since shortly after she announced in August her desire to be known by that name and treated as a woman. Manning has been diagnosed by at least two Army behavioral health specialists with gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder. In addition to the name change, Manning has asked to receive hormone replacement therapy and live as a woman while incarcerated. She and Coombs have said they will go to court, if necessary, to obtain the hormone treatment. Civilian federal prisons are required to provide such treatment, if deemed medically necessary, for inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Trial: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning is escorted out of a courthouse in Fort Meade, Maryland, during the fifth week of his court-martial in July 2013 . Unlike in military prisons, the policy also allows inmates who believe they are the wrong gender to dress and live accordingly as part of their individual treatment plans. The military has said it does not provide treatment for gender dysphoria because Pentagon policy dictates that transgender soldiers are not allowed to serve. But Manning can't be discharged until she's released from prison and exhausts appeals of her criminal convictions. The former intelligence analyst was sentenced in August to 35 years for leaking battlefield video and hundreds of thousands of classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and State Department diplomatic cables while serving in Iraq.","Bradley Manning was convicted in July to 35-years for releasing the largest cache of files in American history to Wikileaks .

"By . Richard Spillett . The town of Dorking has become a laughing stock online because of a nearby woodland which jokers say looks like a penis. Social networks were buzzing with jokes after it was noticed that a woods in the south west of the town looked like male genitals on satellite images. American Dmitiri Vorontsov, 26, from North Carolina, USA was one of first to spot the similarity. Online jokers say the woods near Dorking, Surrey look like a penis on satellite images . He said: 'What is the fascination with penises in Dorking? Is that where Viagra was invented?' After the images went viral, residents in the town also took to Twitter to poke fun at the shape of the small forest. Gavin Critchley tweeted: 'Lovely to see a nice bit of wood' And resident Helen joked: 'Knew I moved here for a reason! Wood hoo!' Others said they hoped it would make the town a new tourist attraction. The similarity was spotted after residents in Hoylake, Wirral, were mocked after a similar comparison was made about their street last year. Residents in Hoylake, Wirral, feared house prices in their streets would tumble after it was noticed their homes also looked like a penis from space . Those living in the area's George Road, Edward Road and Yeoman Cottages even considered moving for fear the joke would hit house prices. Satellite shots from Google Maps and Google Earth have often led to internet mischief. Last April there was widespread online speculation that a vicious crime may have taken place in the Dutch city of Almere. Pictures taken from space showed an apparent bloody trail leading along a waterside pier towards a local lake. But the mystery was later cleared up when the owner of a dog came forward and said the 'blood' was actually the wet trail left by the pet after his swim. And in 2012 a Sydney-based group, called the Glue Society, tweaked satellite imagery to portray four Biblical events, including Noahâ€™s Ark, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden and Moses the parting the Red Sea.

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . Killer: Jordan Graham, 22, should get life in prison for pushing her husband of eight days Cody Johnson off a cliff during an argument, prosecutors say . A young bride who pushed her new husband off a cliff eight days after they were wed should be jailed for life, prosecutors have demanded. Jordan Graham, 22, admitted shoving her 25-year-old husband Cody Johnson to his death from a precipice at the Glacier National Park, Montana, during an argument. His battered body was only found at the bottom of a ravine after he was reported missing by a friend and co-worker. At her trial in December, Graham entered a guilty plea to second-degree murder in exchange for waiving charges of first-degree murder and lying to investigators. First-degree murder means the crime is premeditated. A sentencing hearing is set for March 27 before U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy in Missoula. Graham's attorney said the 'extremely reckless but unintentional act' merits 10 years in prison. Graham said at her trial that she was having second thoughts about getting married so young and that she and her husband had gone to the park on July 7 to talk about it. They argued heatedly at the edge of a steep cliff, she told the court. When Mr Johnson grabbed her by the arm, she became angry and she 'just pushed' without thinking about where they were, Graham said. She didn't tell anybody what had happened, instead making up a story that Johnson had gone for a 'joyride' with friends from Washington state. That story unraveled when the versions she told to friends, relatives and authorities didn't match. Newlyweds: Graham, 22, pictured with Mr Johnson, 25, who she married only eight days before killing him . 'Dangerous, predatory and unrepentant': Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus said Graham showed no remorse, left Mr Johnson's mother without a child, upended a community and had no respect for the law . In court filings yesterday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Zeno Baucus asked Judge Molloy to impose a life sentence or else no less than 50 years in prison. Graham showed no remorse, left Mr Johnson's mother without a child, upended a community and had no respect for the law in the process, Mr Baucus argued. 'Through her actions, including the murder of Cody and conduct that followed, the defendant has demonstrated that she is extremely dangerous, predatory and an unrepentant murderer,' he wrote. Anguish: Cody Johnson's mother Sherry (left) has been left with no child after her son's murder . Federal public defender Michael Donahoe said in his recommendation for a 10-year sentence that Graham ultimately accepted responsibility and is sorry she didn't come forward sooner. She did not obstruct the investigation, and her fabrication of an email designed to support her story that Johnson had driven away was 'the emerging cry of defendant's conscience,' Mr Donahoe said, noting that Graham was the one who led authorities to Johnson's body. If Graham 'was a cold-blooded killer, she could have left Mr Johnson at the bottom of that ravine. He would have likely never been found,' Mr Donahoe wrote.","Jordan Graham, 22, admitted killing Cody Johnson, 25, during an argument .

"By . Sarah Bridge . His father and his sister both died young because they were morbidly obese. And . at 52st, James Jones, 38, from Frankston, Texas seemed certain to follow in their . footsteps. He was unable to exercise and subsisted on a diet of fatty takeaways. But . a warning from his doctor that he would not live to 65, the age his . father died, was the jolt that James needed to lose the weight he needed . to be eligible for bypass surgery. Scroll down for video . James, 38, knew that drastic action was needed when he weighed in at 728 pounds . James, who lives with his mother Maggie, had been a 'skinny' child when growing up but started piling on the pounds when he was a teenager. By the time he was 16 years old he already weighed 280lbs (20st). When he left college he went to work as a mechanic but his growing addiction to fast food only served to increase his size. He moved to work to a desk-bound job in an accountancy firm but found that he found that he used food to unwind from listening to people's problems all day. 'Most people when they get off work want to go grab a beer,' he said. 'I just want to eat.' James visits the cemetery where his father and sister are both buried . However as his weight increased, his health deteriorated. 'I feel like I’m trapped, like I’m useless,' he said. 'It’s depressing. My knees are just aching. I try not to move too much. I get out of breath, like I’m going to pass out.' The programme shows James picking up a large amount of fast food on the drive home from work, and then eating another meal at home. His mother Maggie cooks for him, and said tearfully: 'I guess James blames me for his weight. But I cooked how I knew how to cook. I hope he’s not too bitter at me.' She added: 'It's not really his fault that he’s overweight – it’s our family history. His dad died and then his sister six months later. Him and her were like twins.' Eerily, James's sister moved into the bed that her father slept in after he died, and then James moved in once his sister died. Asked his mother fearfully: ‘Is he the next in line?’ James and his mother Maggie wait to see if he is eligible for weight-loss surgery . Weighing in at 728lbs, James is told by surgeon Dr Nowzaradan that he is unlikely to make it to the age of 65, the age his father died, but that he is too heavy for weight-loss surgery. However after losing 53lbs in a couple of weeks due to a diet consisting mainly of eggs and toast, he sheds the required weight and has a stomach bypass operation. Said James: 'I know I’ve been hiding behind my weight for too long. It’s killing me – I know it’s time to change. I hope that this surgery will jump start my new life. He added: 'I can’t fail because there’s a lot of people I don’t want to disappoint.’ His mother Maggie watched him go into the operating theatre. 'I can't lose another child to obesity,' she said tearfully. 'I want my son to be successful and live.' James found love with Summer, a women he met online and who also had gastric bypass surgery . Said Dr Nowzaradan: 'Because of James’ weight and his family history, nothing but surgery is going to help him. He is one of the largest patients I have ever operated on.' Within five months James had lost 148llbs and started dating Summer, a woman he met online and who herself had had weight-loss surgery, previously weighing 350lbs. However the weight-loss slowed down as James gave into his cravings for fast food. The pair are now house-hunting and talking about marriage and spending the rest of their lives together . But a visit to his father and sister's graves at the local cemetery reignited his determination. After more surgery to remove his excess skin - which alone weighed a whopping 76lbs- he is back on track, playing golf, joining the local gym - and even doing acqua-aerobics. A year on and James and Summer are house-hunting. James now weighs just 376lbs, having  lost 352lbs, nearly half his body weight. 'I'm excited about the future,' says James. 'I'm in love with Summer and we're talking about getting married. I feel there's a whole new world out there.'","Was a skinny child but piled on the pounds when his father and sister died .

In a rare insight into his personal life, the Microsoft founder and his wife, Melinda, have opened up about how they are raising their family. The couple, speaking at a TED conference in Vancouver, said their children will be encouraged to make their own way in the world without the help of billion-dollar trust funds. Family values: Melinda and Bill Gates say they will not leave their three children billion-dollar trust funds . Gates said that instead of money, they had given their two daughters and son a good education so they can learn how to rely on their own abilities rather than their parents' fortune. 'You’ve easily got enough money . despite your vast contributions to the foundation to make them all . billionaires,' conference organizer Chris Anderson said. But, according to Wired, Gates responded by saying: 'They . won’t have anything like that. They need to have a . sense that their own work is meaningful and important.' 'You’ve got to make sure they have a sense of their own ability and what they’re going to go and do,' he added. Anderson likened raising three children in the world's richest family 'to a social experiment without much prior art' before asking the couple, who run the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, how they had decided to raise their family. 'We want to strike a balance so they . have the freedom to do anything but not sort of a lot of . money showered on them so that they can go out and do nothing,' Gates said. He added that they have told their children most of the fortune would be left to . their charity, which tackles poor health and poverty. Melinda Gates also used the TED talks to give details about a trip to Tanzania she made with her eldest daughter Jen. Forward thinking: Bill and Melinda Gates, pictured with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, plan to leave most of their $76 billion fortune to their charity . The mother and daughter stayed with a family in a rural area, which helped them better understand the barriers to education faced by girls in the country. During her description of the trip, Melinda Gates showed slides of their time in Tanzania, as well as pictures of her children. The couple rarely discuss their private life, but she said the children had agreed to their pictures being shown to show their support for the charity. They added that their parenting style was inspired by philanthropist Warren Buffett, who has taken a similar approach with his children. Like Buffett, the Gates have joined the Giving Pledge, which is committed to diverting wealth to philanthropy. The friends agree leaving a huge sum to their children was no good for their families or society.","Microsoft founder says most of his $76bn fortune will go to charity .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . More than 70 cats have been taken from the Florida home of an elderly woman, who had been rescuing the animals for ten years. Conditions inside the Fort Myers Shore home were so bad that animal control officers wore hazardous-waste suits during the seven-hour rescue operation. The homeowner, Sandra Berkshire, is living with friends, and her 72 cats are being cared for at a shelter after her house was declared unlivable. Tough conditions: Animal control workers wore face masks and hazardous-waste suits as they carried the cats outside . Tip off: The 72 cats were found in the house after an anonymous caller contacted animal control . The stash of cats was discovered after an anonymous tip off, and animal control officers say conditions inside the home were horrifying. 'The house is absolutely jam-packed with . cats stacked on cats, in cages, and a house full of feces, urine,' Lieutenant . Tony Backhurst, of Lee County Domestic Animal Services, said. He told NBC 2 that it was hard to breathe inside the home, and said those removing the cats were unable to stay inside for long. Neighbors of Ms Berkshire say she had taken the cats in as an attempt to help them, but that the situation had got out of control. 'She's loving, caring. And she talks about how she's saved a few and gives them away, finds loving homes,' Adam Rudd said. Another . neighbor, Geof Greene, also defended Ms Berkshire, saying: 'She was . taking care of the cats, she was feeding them every week... no matter . how many were in there. She was on top of it.' Good intentions: Sandra Berkshire has been rescuing cats for 10 years and was trying to find them new homes .

'I'm not just sitting there hoarding them. I'm trying to find good homes.' Many of the cats removed from the house were found to have respiratory infections and fleas, as well as signs of neglect. The . animal shelter they have been taken to has been overwhelmed by the . number of cats it is now caring for and urged potential adopters or . foster families to get in touch.

"By . Joshua Gardner . A Virginia college sophomore used the simple disguise of a suit and orange tie from Walmart to sneak onto the court with University of Virginia basketball staff just before their historic win against Duke in Greensboro, North Carolina on Sunday. Just before the Cavaliers clenched the ACC title for the first time in 40 years, the teen named Danny marched past an usher and proceeded to enjoy the thrilling championship game alongside coaches and players alike. He even joined a team huddle. In the game: Danny takes a selfie as confetti rains down after the team's win . Blending in: Danny's disguise gave him a close up view of the action, including this team huddle . Danny Foley, who attends James Madison University, shared his story, along with the hilarious photos that prove it, to sports blog Barstool. He said he noticed that all the UVA assistant coaches wore the same suit with orange tie getup while watching the team play Pittsburgh the day before. He and friends immediately went searching for some cheap knockoffs. 'Goodwill was closed but we bought everything at walmart,' he told Barstool. He purchased everything there: 'Everything Includes: suit jacket, suit pants, dress shoes, dress socks (3 Pack), white dress shirt, orange tie,' Danny said. Brazen: 'Buzzer sounds and i walked onto the middle and confetti was falling,' he said. 'I just hop in the back of the handshake line, first one is coach K, followed by Jeff coaches and all the players. After that I went and ran into UVA manager passing out hats and shirts.' The next morning, he bought $30 nosebleed tickets just to get him in the door and headed to the game. During a TV timeout, Danny made a move. 'I walked right behind the cheerleaders and onto the court and joined the UVA huddle on the court,' he said. With the help of his 6ft 2in stature, not to mention brazenness, Danny managed to do something basketball fans everywhere could only dream. For the rest of the game, he went back and forth between sitting courtside and enjoying the game with his family. Following the teams big win, he went in for an even bigger thrill. Team player: Danny wears a T-shirt handed out by team staff over his Walmart suit in this picture . Hidden in plain sight: Danny holds his arms in the air as the team and coaches celebrate the win . 'Buzzer sounds and i walked onto the middle and confetti was falling,' said the UVA fan. 'I just hop in the back of the handshake line, first one is coach K, followed by Jeff coaches and all the players. 'After that I went and ran into UVA manager passing out hats and shirts.' Photos from the end of the game show Danny wearing a championship t-shirt over his suit and smiling in the middle of the confetti-covered arena. After celebrating with coaches and players, Danny was caught by a member of the UVA staff, but before he could get into any trouble he climbed some railings into the stands. Disguise: Danny poses in the Walmart outfit he used to sneak into the game . 'Found my family a minute later and within 10 minutes we were in the car and on the way home,' he said. As astounding as Danny's feat was, he told WWBT that he did it once before when his brother played basketball for Princeton. Years earlier, he donned his brother's practice jersey and watched a game that was coincidentally also against Duke. He said no one said a thing, but admits last week's game crash was a much bigger deal.","College sophomore Danny Foley from Henrico, Virginia noticed that all the Cavaliers staff members wore suits and orange ties .

Smart: The Duchess of Cornwall visited a school in support of a scheme to boost literacy skills . She joined students taking part in ""Words For Work"" programme run by the charity to teach them business and communication skills. The Duchess sat in on a question and answer session with Nick, who used to run his own PR company before becoming Lord Alan Sugar's right-hand man on The Apprentice. Warm welcome: The Duchess was greeted by pupils on her arrival . Business talk: She then joined the panel quizzing Nick Hewer . Grilling: The royal asked the Apprentice star, 'what makes you laugh?' The Countdown presenter was quizzed by a panel of teenagers while Camilla watched on about a range of issues including dealing with responsibilities. He said: 'I've been an employee and I've run my own company. Your responsibility when you run your own company is looking after your employees. You feed them before you feed yourself. Your job is to go out there and win business and disperse it among the people that work for you - and hopefully make a profit.' Camilla then chipped in with a question of her own asking Nick: 'What makes you laugh?' He replied: 'I laugh very easily, humour is the bedrock of a happy life - I have a silly sense of humour.'

Katie Blyth, 14, part of the panel quizzing Nick, said: 'I thought he gave us some really good answers and some good advice.' Words For Work was created to meet the concerns of business chiefs who were worried about the lack of communication skills and work readiness among young people. Under the scheme, business volunteers work alongside 13 to 14-year-olds, helping to raise their confidence and aspirations and give them the literacy skills they need to get a job. Now in its fifth year, 2,500 children across England have taken part in the programme but the National Literacy Trust is appealing for business donors to help them reach their target of 10,000. Nick, an ambassador for the Trust, praised the scheme. 'I thought the panel was very good, they worked as a team and asked sensible questions - but I don't know if I got the job,' he joked. He added: 'They were good - the big thing is confidence. Kids are so unconfident and if they can be given those communication skills they can do well.'","Camilla visited City Academy in East London .

"By . Margot Peppers . A runner kept herself - and her Instagram followers - entertained during the New York City half marathon by snapping selfies with unsuspecting 'hotties' in the background. Brooklyn resident Kelly Roberts, 24, spent the bulk of the March 16 race making funny faces in photos she took on her phone, sneakily capturing good-looking fellow runners behind her. She used the hashtag '#hottguysofthenychalf' for each of the hilarious 13 photos - one for every mile in the race. Caught in the act: Brooklyn resident Kelly Roberts, 24, spent the bulk of the New York half marathon on March 16 making funny faces in selfies with hotties in the background . Silly series: She used the hashtag '#hottguysofthenychalf' for each of the hilarious 13 photos - one for every mile in the race (pictured at the finish line) Miss Roberts told Good Morning America that she thought of the idea for the series when she spotted a cute guy running behind her. 'I thought, ""Oh my God, I should make a hashtag #hottguysofthenychalf,""' she explained. So each time she saw a good-looking man from afar, she'd sprint to get ahead of him and then snap the shot. In one photo, she looks wide-eyed at the camera, her mouth agape as she ogles the brown-haired man strolling in the background. 'Oh yeah walker,' she captioned the image. Another sees her striking a pose at the finish line, her tongue sticking out. In the background are two men in neon T-shirts that seem to have caught her attention. Inspiration: She'd spot good looking men from afar, sprint to get ahead of them and then snap the shot. 'Ladies and gents I present to you, hott guys of the nyc half,' she captioned this gem . Red-handed: While some of Miss Roberts' subjects appear oblivious to the fact they're in her photos, others stare confusedly at the camera, making for an even more hilarious snap . Number one hottie: Her favorite selfie was with an older man in bright blue shorts, which she captioned: 'Who doesn't love short shorts' While some of Miss Roberts' subjects appear oblivious to the fact they're in her photos, others stare confusedly at the camera, making for an even more hilarious snap. In one such photo, she puckers her lips and squints her eyes as the camera focuses in on a man in the background, his brow furrowed as he realizes he's in the shot. 'Dat headband,' Miss Roberts captioned the photo, which amassed 79 'likes'. On the lookout: Miss Roberts wrote beneath this image: 'Mile 12 eye candy!' On the run: 'Some beard action for 5,' she said of this bearded runner . No age limit: Miss Roberts pulled a humorous face in front of thsis 'dad' runner . Another one shows her jogging during mile five in front of a man in glasses who seems to notice that she's snapping a selfie. She wrote on this one: 'Some beard action for 5'. Her favorite selfie, though, was one taken in front of an older man in bright blue shorts, which she captioned: 'Who doesn't love short shorts'. Miss Roberts explained that this particular 'hottie' was 'a hoot and a half'. 'I love sweaty men!' Nine miles down, she snapped a photo of this man as he went about his business . Tourist attraction: She dubbed this runner 'Times square handsome' The look of love: Miss Roberts looked particularly excited to see this handsome guy running behind her .

Millie, 24, played the role of supportive spouse to perfection at the court, where her rapper beau Professor Green - real name Stephen Manderson - was fined £525 and banned from driving for a year after pleading guilty to one charge of drink-driving. Millie even tweeted details of her outfit to her followers: '#ootd Zara blazer, river island jeans, oasis jumper, top shop hat and miu miu glasses' [sic]. Scroll down for video . Rapper Professor Green - real name Stephen Manderson - was joined by supportive (and stylish) wife Millie Mackintosh at Bromley Magistrates court today . Fashion fan and model Millie was spotted making a quick dash to the shops yesterday, perhaps to pick out a new outfit. Zara, of course, was her first port of call, having that sober yet sophisticated feel that a court appearance demands. The former Made In Chelsea reality TV star posted a photo of herself on Instagram yesterday in the changing room of the Spanish-owned store. She was trying on a cream crop top with a pencil skirt (accessorised by a set of killer abs) so may well have picked up this Zara Multicolour Woven Fabric Jacket, £89, which she's wearing today. Black out: Millie wore a Zara jacket with a suitably sombre black top and a pair of figure-hugging leather pants, she accessorised with her favourite fedora . Putting her fashion foot forward: Millie's jacket may have been high street but her handbag was a £895 offering from Aspinal of London . She teamed the jacket with a suitably sombre black top and a pair of figure-hugging leather trousers. She accessorised with simple black stilettoes, one of her signature fedoras, a suitably stealth wealth tote by Aspinal of London (which costs a cool £895) and a pair of Miu Miu’s Noir Glitter sunglasses. The overall look: a more rock ‘n’ roll version of Breakfast at Tiffany's Holly Golightly accused with giving the ‘weather report’ to Sally Tomato. All smiles: Millie, 24, accessorised with a simple black pump, one of her signature fedoras, and a pair of Miu Miu's Noir Glitter sunglasses .

"By . Sean Poulter . Nearly half a million people are to receive surprise bank refunds averaging £300 on charges and interest rate debts run up on credit cards, loans, HP and store cards. Seventeen leading banks and building societies have agreed to pay up after making a blunder on the wording of credit agreements and penalty notices, the Office of Fair Trading revealed yesterday. Some customers who were hit with penalty charges and interest rate fees over a long period could receive more than £1,000. Bank refunds: Some customers who were hit with penalty charges and interest rate fees over a long period could receive more than £1,000 (file picture) While the OFT has not named them, the 17 lenders involved are believed to include most, if not all, of the big high street names. Their £149million bill comes on top of around £370million that Barclays and Northern Rock have agreed to pay, plus an undisclosed sum from the Co-op Bank. In total, the finance industry faces a bill of more than £600million because executives failed to ensure documents complied with the Consumer Credit Act 1974. Many people who were hit with the charges, which have now been ruled illegal and unfair, will have suffered real hardship as a result, perhaps struggling to put food on the table or pay the mortgage. The fact that they were not keeping up with debt repayments means they are likely to have been suffering money troubles that will only have been made worse by the punishing late payment fees and interest charges. The revelation represents a new blow for the banking industry, which already faces a bill of more than £20billion to refund charges linked to the sale of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI) alongside loans, cards and mortgages. While the average refund will be some £300, some people who were hit with penalty charges and interest rate fees over a long period could be entitled to payments of more than £1,000. Since October 2008, lenders have been obliged to send periodic statements to customers containing specific information and wording. Revelation: The Office of Fair Trading said seventeen leading banks and building societies have agreed to pay up after making a blunder on the wording of credit agreements and penalty notices . However, a bank or finance company that fails to provide the periodic statement using the correct wording is not entitled to enforce the agreement and the customer is not liable to pay interest or default sums. The money is to be repaid after the OFT wrote to 50 banks and building societies in November 2013 asking them to confirm that they had fully discharged their obligations to provide post contract information under the Consumer Credit Act. 'These issues were not deliberate misconduct, but the institutions concerned should have ensured they were complying with the law' David Fisher, Office of Fair Trading director of consumer credit . David Fisher, the OFT’s director of consumer credit, said: ‘These issues were not deliberate misconduct, but the institutions concerned should have ensured they were complying with the law. ‘The OFT welcomes the proactive steps taken to return money to customers where it was incorrectly charged.’ The OFT said customers do not need to take any action because the banks and building societies involved have agreed to contact all the customers involved. That raises the question as to whether consumers can trust the banks to do the right thing and take reasonable steps to trace all the people who are out of pocket and due a refund. There is also a question as to whether the refund will only cover the specific charges and not any additional compensation to hardship and inconvenience. High street names: The banks' £149million bill comes on top of around £370million that Barclays and Northern Rock have agreed to pay, plus an undisclosed sum from the Co-op Bank . The OFT said it is up to the bank to decide whether to add interest to the value of any refund of fees and charges. It said customer who feel aggrieved and would like to pursue additional compensation should contact the bank concerned and then, if necessary, the Financial Ombudsman Service. The OFT has not named the 17 banks and building societies involved, however the group is believed to include most if not all the major high street names. 'We want regulators to clamp down on excessive fees and charges so that borrowers are treated fairly whatever form of credit they’re using' Richard Lloyd, Which? executive director . Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: ‘It’s good to see the OFT taking this action but it should name and shame the 17 lenders involved so that customers are aware that they might be due compensation. ‘We’d also like some assurances about how lenders will contact people who were affected but are no longer their customers. ‘We want regulators to clamp down on excessive fees and charges so that borrowers are treated fairly whatever form of credit they’re using.’ Lloyds confirmed it will be making refunds, but refused to say how many customers are involved. It said: ‘We are committed to ensuring that we provide our customers with the right information about credit agreements they have with us. ‘We have taken part in the OFT exercise and are now working to address cases where this has not happened. We will contact any affected customers in due course.’","Some customers hit with charges over long period could receive £1,000 .

"By . Rob Davies, City Correspondent . The boss of ITV has been handed a pay packet worth more than £8million, including a £3.9million 'golden handshake' simply for agreeing to take the top job at the broadcaster. Adam Crozier, former boss of the Football Association and Royal Mail, saw his pay deal nearly treble from £2.9million to £8.3million last year. His basic salary was £841,000, while he also picked up an annual bonus in cash and shares of £1.4million and a long-term award in shares worth £2million. ITV boss Adam Crozier was given a £3.9 million golden handshake for just taking the job, after his successes with turning the channel around . But the lion's share of his bumper deal came from a 'joining award' of £3.9million, used to entice him to join ITV from Royal Mail in 2010. Mr Crozier, 50, was recruited to turn ITV around, as it struggled during the recession due to its heavy reliance on a fragile advertising market. He has since presided over a renaissance that has seen the public service broadcaster's stock market value surge from £2billion to £8billion. His tenure has proved largely successful, in stark contrast to a more rocky record at the Royal Mail and the Football Association. As boss of the FA, he stirred controversy by hiring the England team's first foreign manager, Sven-Goran Eriksson. Mr Crozier garnered criticism when he handed managership of the England team to Sven Goran Ericksson . Mr Crozier was also criticised for allegedly coining the term 'golden generation' to refer to the England football team that went to the 2002 World Cup under the Swede. England and Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard later revealed that the tag became an albatross around the players' necks. 'If it was Adam Crozier who said it, it was said much too early,' Lampard said. 'It is good to have pressure on you as individuals and on the team as a whole. But calling us a golden generation, it was almost as if people were waiting for us to fail.' Mr Crozier was also accused of presiding over a 'car crash' seven-year reign at Royal Mail, where his efforts to modernise the service left many customers exasperated. Under his leadership, around 5,800 post offices shut down and the second post was axed, while the price of a first-class stamp jumped by 12p. A long-running-dispute with union leaders over pay and conditions, which triggered strikes and postal chaos, was left unresolved when he joined ITV. On his departure, Labour MP Lindsay Hoyle said Royal Mail was 'a company that has been put through a car crash'. But his performance at the broadcaster behind Downton Abbey and Coronation Street has been much admired in the City of London. Realising that the TV advertising market was in long-term decline, he has invested millions in production division ITV Studios, allowing the broadcaster to sell programmes around the world. He has also poured money into improving ITV's online presence, a strategy that has seen ITV steadily increase revenues from its digital division. Since 2009, the year before he joined ITV, profits have risen more than fivefold to £581million, while the company's debt mountain of £612million has become a cash surplus of £164million.","Adan Crozier previously saw his pay triple from £2.9 to £8.3 million .

"By . Damien Gayle . A hockey superfan with a rare heart condition broke down in tears when he was allowed to take to the ice with his favourite team. Sam Tageson was met with roars from the more than 17,000 spectators at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, when he skated out with players from the San Jose Sharks. As he waved to the crowd, the 17-year-old was overcome with emotion at the moment that doctors who treat his hypoplastic left-heart syndrome said he'd never be able to experience. Touching moment: Sam Tageson lives the Sharks fan's dream as more than 17,000 spectators cheer him at the SAP Center in San Jose, California, after he took to the ice with the players from his favourite NHL team . Against the odds: As he waved to the crowd, the 17-year-old was overcome with emotion at the moment that doctors who treat his hypoplastic left-heart syndrome said he'd never be able to experience . Special day: Sam's moment in the spotlight on Tuesday night came after a full day training with the Sharks, who had officially signed him up on a special one-day contract so he could experience life in the NHL . 'It's really awesome. I like it a lot,' Sam told NHL.com. 'It's a once-in-a lifetime experience.' Despite warnings from doctors, Sam has been playing ice hockey since he was six years old. A birth defect means his heart has just two chambers instead of four, but he has refused to allow the supposedly debilitating condition to hold him back. Sam's mother, Lisa Mills, told the San Jose Mercury News: 'They said he would be the child that would never ride a bicycle, never do any of that. He rides a skateboard. He plays hockey. 'The doctors all through the years have said give him golf clubs, take the hockey stick away. We tried. It doesn't work. 'Now they've given up telling him no. They say he'll stop when he knows it's time.' The climax of Sam's day came when he donned a No. 20 shirt and skated onto the ice with his new teammates through their shark's head tunnel to line up with them before their league game against the Florida Panthers . Land of the free and the home of the brave: It was the first time in the history of the San Jose Sharks that anyone other than an active player had joined the team on the ice for the singing of the national anthem . Sam's moment in the spotlight on Tuesday night came after a full day training with the Sharks, who had officially signed him up on a special one-day contract so he could experience life in the NHL. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the condition that Sam was born with, is a rare congenital heart defect that affects just 960 babies every year in the U.S. In babies with the condition, the aorta and left ventricle are underdeveloped, and the aortic and mitral valves are either too small for enough blood to flow, or are closed off altogether. As a result, the right ventricle must pump blood to both lungs, as it would normally, and to the rest of the body as well, a situation that can't be kept up for long without intervention. While infants treated for HLHS usually survive, they often experience chronic health problems for the rest of their lives. Eventually, they will need to have a heart transplant. Usually a goalie for his local youth team, Sam got the chance to take part in all the team's regular drills, including one-on-one rushes against Sharks own goalkeeper Alex Stalock. He even managed to score by flicking the puck between the pro-keeper's legs - a thrilling moment captured on camera and posted to the Sharks' Instagram page, along with close to a score of other photos of Sam's day. But the climax came when he donned a No. 20 shirt and skated onto the ice with his new teammates through their trademark shark's head tunnel to line up with them before their league game against the Florida Panthers. It was the first time in the history of the San Jose Sharks that anyone other than an active player had joined the team on the ice for the singing of the national anthem. Sam's special day was made possible with the help of the Make-A-Wish Foundation working alongside the Sharks Foundation. San Jose coach Todd McLellan said: 'The Make-A-Wish Foundation does another tremendous thing for people that need it. We're happy to participate in that. We're glad that we can be part of his day.'","Sam Tageson was born with debilitating hypoplastic left-heart syndrome .

'The assailant screamed at him to let him through, but he didn't, so he pulled a gun from his waistband,' a spokesman for Stockholm police told the Aftonbladet newspaper. Terrifying: A fare-dodging commuter points a pistol in the face of a ticket office worker on the Stockholm metro after he was prevented from leaping the barriers . Threats: The assailant screamed at the inspector to let him through, a police spokesman said . The gun threat happened on a busy evening just before last Christmas, but footage has only now been released after a court granted permission because all other leads had been exhausted. Stockholm police spokesman Peter Tapper said: 'We have released the video which shows the man pulling out the gun because he was not allowed to go through the barrier without a ticket. 'He was demanding to be let through but when the ticket inspector refused, he pulled out the gun.' Police believe that the gun was loaded, which means the man is wanted on suspicion of making aggravated illegal threats. As their suspect was carrying the gun, officers believe he may well be involved in other crime. The incident happened at about 8.30pm on December 19, The Local reports. CCTV footage shows the gunman trying . to leap over the barriers, which on Stockholm's metro are above head . height, before threatening the ticket office inspector with a pistol to . let him through. He made off after his attempt was unsuccessful. All police efforts to track down the suspect since then have proved fruitless. Hidden: The unknown gunman had the pistol hidden in the waistband of his trousers . Criminal: The fact that he had a gun has led police to suspect the man may have been involved in other crime . Mr Tapper said police suspect that the man might be from overseas so they are hoping that the picture is used internationally in a bid to find a name. He said: 'We want to know who he is and where he is. We suspect that the gun was certainly illegal and may well have been used in other crimes. 'From what we can see the gun was loaded so the threat was probably very real.'","Gun-toting commuter was caught on CCTV at Rågsved station, Stockholm .

"By . Ben Spencer . Littering and fly tipping has cost the Woodland Trust over £500,000 in the past four years (library image) Burned out cars, a dead horse and an entire fitted kitchen are some of the items recently dumped in British woodlands, a conservation charity has revealed. Clearing up fly tipping and littering in forests has cost more than half a million pounds in the past four years, according to the Woodland Trust. The charity said that at one site in Cumbria, it had been forced to clear up 100 bags of rubbish and items including a car seat, a space hopper, a pram, a door, two mountain bikes, and eight musical drums since last summer. At woods in Ambergate, Derbyshire, an entire bulk bag of pornographic magazines had been dumped. Illegal fly tipping cost the charity £90,000 in clean-up costs in the past four years, while picking up litter at its 1,200 woods across the UK cost more than £430,000. Littering not only diverts money from caring for woodlands to clear-up work, it also damages wildlife, the Woodland Trust said. The report, released to mark the International Day of Forests today, calls for stronger deterrents for fly tipping. The charity, which owns and manages 1,200 woodlands covering 20,000 hectares, has recorded dozens of incidents of fly tipping across its estates. Discarded rubbish includes burned-out cars, a caravan, mattresses, animal carcasses and chemical waste. Norman Starks, Woodland Trust UK operations director, said: ‘Not only is fly tipping illegal, costing us tens of thousands of pounds which could be spent on caring for woods, but it provides a real danger to our native flora and fauna. ‘Trees are facing an unprecedented level of threat from disease, pests and development and we need people to help protect them, rather than add to this threat. ‘We cannot assume trees and woods will be around forever if we keep treating them this way.’ He added: ‘It’s also important to remember that ‘natural’ litter such as dead wood is a unique habitat for a large number of wildlife species so if people come across fallen timber when visiting a wood, please leave it where it lies.’ A selection of items, such as pornographic magazines, car seats and bags and bags of rubbish were found at sites across the country, the charity said (library image)","Fly tipping and littering in forests cost half a million pounds in four years .

"By . Daily Mail Reporters . Ex-SNL star turned Christian crusader Victoria Jackson is running for a county commission seat in Tennessee and has opened up about her past and why she loves her adopted state in a revealing new interview. 'Nashville has two of my favorite things: Jesus and show business,' she said as she revealed that the Holy Bible she found sitting in her dentist's office has her thrilled she moved to the state. Whether personally or as a commissioner, saving souls is on Jackson's to-do list, something she admits once drew the ire of her SNL cast mate Al Franken. Scroll down for video... Crusader: SNL actress turned Christian crusading Tea Partier (pictured here protesting taxes in 2010 with a ukelele) is running for local office in Tennessee and recently gave a revealing interview as part of her campaign . The Tennessean sat with Jackson at her Thompson's Station home for an interview printed Tuesday. And a look into her recent activities suggests another pet project could be ridding her new home of Muslims who might disagree. 'Civilization Jihad Hits Home (my back yard, literally),' the 54-year-old former actress wrote on her website after a Muslim man named Daoud Abudiab moved into her neighborhood. After Abudiab, who is director of the Islamic Center of Columbia, shot back at the comedienne, she posted a list of terror attacks committed by Muslims in the name of their religion. 'He's afraid of me!?' she balked. One of Jackson's pet projects is battling against plans to put a mosque in nearby Murfreesboro. She's also pitted herself against a local school district after she believed it taught from a sex ed textbook called It's Perfectly Normal that she found too explicit. The district has denied using the book in 'fourth grade classrooms' as Jackson had publicized on her blog. Diverse platform: Jackson, seen here with Catholic former presidential candidate Rick Santorum, has pet projects in her adopted county that include stopping Muslims from moving in and ending sex education in local schools . Hell bound: Jackson revealed in an interview out this week that her former cast mate turned U.S. Senator Al Franken once quit speaking to her when she told him he and the rest of the SNL cast were going to hell . Though she's only brought her ditzy blonde brand of high-pitched moral outrage to Tennessee in recent years, she's a life-long devout Christian who even tried proselytizing to her SNL peers during her time there in the late 1980s and early 90s. After current U.S. Senator and former late night funny man Al Franken told her the cast didn't buy her ditzy act, she shot back: . 'I told him maybe I am overcompensating because everybody here is going to hell and Iâ€™m supposed to tell them about Jesus.' She said he turned white and quit speaking to her. She also recalled a female cast member who angrily returned a Bible on tape, one of the ones she'd decided to leave at the dressing room doors of each of her co-stars. 'I already have one,' the unnamed actress yelled. Jackson promises she won't be a traditional candidate and will rely on 'word of mouth' rather than actively fundraising, and possibly buying campaign stickers and shirts with her own money. Though once known for her parts in popular skits like 'Toonces the Driving Cat' and appearances on Weekend Update, in more recent years Jackson has been in the public eye as an outspoken Tea Party activist and conservative Christian. In 2011 she sparked controversy when she blasted television show Glee for airing a same-sex kiss between two male actors, calling the program 'sickening' and 'a mockery of Christians.' Fair? Though Franklin and Jackson were on SNL together for years, Jackson says the funny man turned politico stopped speaking to her because of her proselytizing . 'I think the key to saving America is normal everyday citizens getting involved because we the people are supposed to be in control, not the government,' Jackson said. 'I had a political awakening in 2007. I'm tired of complaining. I want to do something.' Jackson admits she didn't vote in any election until she was 37. Jackson moved to Tennessee last year with husband Paul Wessel, a retired helicopter pilot with 35 years experience with the Miami Police Department. Despite her newness to both Tennessee and the political sphere in general, the self-described Tea Party conservative believes things will go smoothly once she's won office. 'I think I will fit in quite easily with (the current county commission),' she said.","Jackson is running for Williamson County Commission in Tennessee .

"By . John Hall . An elderly couple suffering from ill health embarked on a joint suicide pact after telling relatives they 'could not live without each other', a coroner heard today. Retired nurse Olive Climpson, 82, wrote a note to daughter Nicola stating the couple's intention to take their own lives at their home in Earley, Berkshire on September 28 last year. Mrs Climpson and her husband James, 82, had both been suffering from deteriorating health and were found dead at their home by their daughter and a friend. Pact: Retired nurse Olive Climpson wrote a note to daughter Nicola stating the couple's intention to take their own lives at their home in Earley, Berkshire (pictured) Mr and Mrs Climpson both suffered from poor health and told relatives they 'couldn’t live without each other.' Ms Climpson had visited her parents the previous day and although Mr Climpson seemed his normal self, her mother was 'more touchy feely' and thanking her 'for all the help and support.' The inquest heard how the couple had been devastated by the recent death of their other daughter, Mandy, which Mr Climpson, a retired accountant, described as 'the biggest disaster he had known.' They were both also suffering from deteriorating health, with Mrs Climpson, a type-two diabetic, having recently spent 11 days in hospital with high blood pressure. During this time Mr Climpson had struggled to cope without his wife and had not been able to have a bath or shower while she was away. Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford was told that on September 28 last year, Ms Climpson tried to call her parents but got no answer and eventually went around to the house with her friend, Lynden Lee. She found her mother wrapped in a blanket on the sofa, bent forward, with the TV turned on. 'It just looked as though she had been watching TV,' said Mr Bedford. 'On touching her she was cold and you feared the worst.' Ms Climpson then went into the bedroom and found her father lying dead on the bed. - Mr and Mrs Climpson's daughter Nicola . An ambulance was called but the couple were declared dead at the scene. The inquest heard that since Mandy died, the couple had talked a lot about death and said they would not want to be kept alive. Describing the moment she found her parents dead, Ms Climpson said: 'I wasn’t as shocked as I thought I would be.' 'The fact that they went together, that’s what they would have wanted. As far as I’m concerned they both took their own lives.' 'I think they were just very concerned that they couldn’t look after each other. They were miserable.' 'I think my mum knew she would cope without my dad but she knew my dad wouldn’t cope without her.' Mr Bedford said: 'Both Mr Climpson and his wife had expressed a wish in life not to live without each other.' Addressing the couple’s daughter, the coroner added: 'You have no doubt what happened here. Between them they’ve said ‘is this worth continuing?' Mrs Climpson had recently asked the local council about care that could be provided for them, but the coroner said nothing could have been done to prevent their deaths. Mr Bedford recorded a narrative verdict on the deaths.

"By . Lucy Crossley . A nursery school owner who left a three-year-old girl strapped inside a car for more than five hours - after ‘completely forgetting’ about her - has been struck off the childminder’s register. Carol Cort, 67, was giving the little girl a lift to the Barn Nursery School, in the Cotswold village of Bourton-on-the-Water, as a favour for her mother. When she arrived at the nursery early on February 18 last year, she automatically picked up her handbag, locked the car and went to work - leaving the toddler, referred to only as as 'E', strapped into her car seat. Carol Cort, 67, was giving the little girl a lift to the Barn Nursery School, located on this business park in Bourton-on-the-Water, as a favour for her mother . Mrs Cort, who had worked in child care for 46 years, went back to her car at 3pm and drove to an after-school club to pick up other children before realising what she had done. By that time E had been trapped in the car for more than five hours, without food, water or toilet facilities. The Care Standards Tribunal heard Mrs Cort 'found the child sitting exactly as she had been when her mother strapped her in'. Judge Meleri Tudur said: 'Initially, she didn’t realise what had happened, assuming the child had been placed in the wrong vehicle by a member of staff. 'Only when the child told her that she had been forgotten did she realise that she had been there all day.' E had been away from the nursery the previous week, suffering from chicken pox, so her absence went unnoticed. Her mother had phoned the nursery at the end of the day to ask after her - but thought a member of staff was ‘joking’ when he said he hadn’t seen her. Mrs Cort offered the little girl, who has been named only as 'E' a free place at the Barn - but her mother withdrew her child from the nursery (posed by models) Mrs Cort, who lives in Beckford, drove straight to E’s parents’ home in a ‘very distressed’ state and immediately confessed all. The . mother said tearful Mrs Cort was in shock and told her: 'I’ve done . something awful. I’ve ruined the nursery and let everybody down. 'I’ve ruined it for the children.' A . 'very distressed' Mrs Cort then offered E a free place at the nursery. But the mother later withdrew her daughter from the Barn and reported . the matter to the local authority. The nursery owner, who was on the verge . of retirement and handing over the business to her daughter, was . immediately suspended by Ofsted. 'Only when the child told her that she had been forgotten did she realise that she had been there all day' Judge Meleri Tudur . Her lawyers told Judge Tudur she was under severe strain due to concerns over her mother’s care in a nursing home and presented psychiatric evidence that she was depressed at the time. They pointed out that, since the incident, Mrs Cort’s daughter had put in place a rigorous regime of checking vehicles in the nursery’s car park to ensure that no children had been left inside. What happened was a 'one-off and inadvertant absent-minded mistake', described as 'an aberration' by her legal team. However, Judge Tudur said the incident was so grave that Mrs Cort’s registration as a childminder had to be cancelled. It was only by 'good luck and chance' that E had not come to serious harm. Although she had made an immediate confession to E’s mother after driving her home, Mrs Cort had not told even her own family about the incident - and more importantly had not reported the incident to Ofsted herself. Mrs Cort had been given a number of glowing references by other parents with children at the nursery 'expressing their satisfaction' with her work and praising her contribution to the community. But Judge Tudur said the nursery 'was not expecting E to attend' and expressed 'serious concerns' about the ad hoc arrangement for giving E a lift to the Barn and the absence of her name from the register that day. She addeed: 'A professional offering child care for up to 100 children at any one time should be able to say with certainty which children will be attending on any particular day. 'The sequence of events leading to E being left in the vehicle simply highlighted the risks presented from lax conduct around children’s attendance which placed children at unnecessary risk of harm or neglect.' Despite Mrs Cort’s long and unblemished history as a child carer, Judge Tudur concluded: 'The incident and the surrounding issues identified are sufficient to merit the cancellation of Mrs Cort’s registration.'","Carol Cort, 67, was giving the girl a lift to Barn Nursery School as a favour .

"By . Dan Bloom . A manager called a female sales executive 'pissy pants' and told her she was up all night having sex after she informed him about her bladder problem, a tribunal has heard. Diana Nicholl-Pierson, 24, and Anna Mazover, 29, also a sales executive, have taken Darren Scott to an employment tribunal in London, claiming they were subjected to sexual harassment during the month they worked at Entico Corporation Limited last year before they were both dismissed 'without notice'. In her witness statement, Ms Nicholl-Pierson said that along with Ms Mazover, she was 'subjected to constant sexual comments, sexual advances and sexual innuendos' on a daily basis by sales director Mr Scott. Threesome: Diana Nicholl-Pierson (far left) and Anna Mazover, pictured outside the Central London Employment Tribunal office today, claimed Darren Scott (right) made sexual advances including the offer of a threesome . On one occasion, Ms Nicholl-Pierson . said she apologised to Mr Scott, who is 'around 55' according to her . statement, about having to come later to work due to seeing her doctor . about a bladder problem. She told the tribunal that what followed was 'the most humiliating experience of my life'. In her statement, she said Mr Scott said to her: 'If you think I believe this for one minute, I don’t.'I know you were up all night f******.' Anna Mazover, right with Diana Nicholl-Pierson, said Mr Scott claimed he was very important . Ms . Nicholl-Pierson said he called her 'pissy pants' over and over, and in . an open office said: 'You know what is wrong with you? Too much of . this.' And while he said . this, she alleges he repeatedly punched his fist against the palm of his . hand, which she says was him referring to sex. Ms Nicholl-Pierson also claims Mr Scott would go over to her desk and hand her pieces of tissue. Mr Scott’s lawyer, Adam Gadd, said of the allegation: 'That didn’t happen.' He . even followed Miss Mazover to a tube station on a lunch break, trying . to cuddle the blonde Ukrainian former synchronised swimmer and touch her . legs, she claimed. The pair appeared again today at the Central London Employment Tribunal, where they are seeking a combined £110,000 for sexual harassment, victimisation, race discrimination and poor treatment after whistleblowing. Both women say they were unfairly sacked after complaining about married Mr Scott’s lewd behaviour. Miss Mazover told him she was satisfied in her relationship and asked him to stop following her, she said in evidence today. She continued: 'I then further added, ""If you start doing this again, I will complain to [company director] James [Ramsay], and if necessary, I will leave my job.' But she said that in June last year, Mr Scott told her it would not matter if she went to Mr Ramsey - as the company director was 'too preoccupied' with his boyfriend. She claimed Mr Scott told her: 'I know James’ boyfriend and he always cheats on James with another man, and James is always upset.' She added: 'He said to me James is nothing. I am here making all the decisions - James is nothing in the company. He is always very upset his boyfriend cheats on him. 'He said to me: ""I am the main and most important person in the company, you can’t go over me.""' When it was put to her that this was a 'complete fabrication', Miss Mazover responded: 'How would I know that James has a boyfriend, who is gay or not?' Miss Mazover and Ms Nicholl-Pierson both claim Mr Scott bragged to them about taking cocaine and hiring prostitutes, and showed them photos of scantily-clad women on his work computer. Adam Gadd, representing Mr Scott, asked Miss Mazover why she had left it so late to tell his client she would complain to company director Mr Ramsay. She replied: 'I worked there only three weeks and I wanted to achieve something at my work. 'And why should I leave if something is wrong? Maybe justice should exist in that world... Why [could] nothing be done to protect me at my work place and protect my rights?' Miss Mazover claimed that on May 21 last year, her second in the job, Mr Scott propositioned her and Ms Nicholl-Pierson with a threesome. She also said she had raised concerns earlier in the evening about his behaviour with human resources employee Sara Goerg. Mr Scott, 55, is alleged to have told the women: 'It would be nice if we go back together to my penthouse and have a threesome. Anger: Together the pair, pictured at yesterday's hearing, are claiming £110,000 against three respondents . 'If you have a threesome, you both would prosper within the company and get promoted.' The panel heard that even after Miss Mazover threatened to go above Mr Scott’s head, he followed her to the tube station a few days later. She told the panel previously that he had offered her a spending spree at Harrods, adding: 'He harassed me and asked to me come to his penthouse to have oysters and champagne with him. 'The second respondent [Mr Scott] then again said, ""maybe your boyfriend’s d*** is big, but my wallet is bigger"".' Both women complained to HR, the panel heard, but at the beginning of June when no action had been taken Ms Nicholl-Pierson went to the police and made a formal complaint. Director Mr Ramsay then called both women into his office and told them there were no grounds for their complaints, she said - before they were both dismissed with no explanation. Claims: The pair are also lodging their claim against James Ramsay, the director of publishing firm Entico . Both women, who earned up to £3,000 a day, are bringing the claims on the grounds of sexual harassment, victimisation, race discrimination and whistleblowing. Ms Mazover is claiming £41,000, while Ms Nicholl-Pierson is claiming £67,000. Their tribunal claim is being made jointly against Entico, Mr Scott and Mr Ramsay. Miss Mazover, the daughter of a Ukrainian businessman, also said Mr Scott mocked her accent and made derogatory comments about Russian women, implying they were easy, and one day greeted her with, ‘Good morning, Red Army’. Mr Scott denies all of the allegations against him. The hearing continues.","Darren Scott allegedly said: 'If you have a threesome, you would prosper'

"By . Sam Webb . Monster: Care worker Colin Stokes who has admitted raping three women in a Gloucestershire care home. He was arrested for a sexual offence in 2007 but continued to work in care after the case was dropped . A care worker who raped three vulnerable women could have been brought to justice nearly a decade ago if a sex abuse prosecution had not been dropped. Colin Stokes, 48, attacked the victims - who all lived in supported accommodation in Gloucestershire - when he was supposedly looking after them. The victims, aged 32, 50 and 54, all have learning disabilities, difficulties communicating and require 24-hour care. He was today jailed for 14 years. Now it has been revealed that in April 2007 Gloucestershire Police arrested him on suspicion of inciting sexual activity with a mentally ill woman. The alleged victim had severe communication difficulties and there was also no witnesses to support her account - meaning it was her word against Stokes, who lives in Dursley, Gloucestershire. He was released on bail and police presented a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service but four months later lawyers decided there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction. The case against Stokes was dropped and he continued to work in the care industry. But Gloucestershire Police admitted it did not tell social services of the allegations made against Stokes - leaving him free to rape his victims. Detective Chief Superintendent Bernie Kinsella, head of specialist crime operations at Gloucestershire Police, said the force had carried out a comprehensive inquiry into Stokes in 2007. 'There was a very full and thorough investigation and we liaised with the Crown Prosecution Service and gave them a file of evidence,' he said. 'They have to make an assessment and they decided there was insufficient evidence on this particular occasion to support a prosecution.' Photos of forensic examinations carried out in the bedroom of one of the victims of Stokes . Stokes was employed to work the night shift and help with day-to-day tasks. Due to staff cut backs he worked alone, Gloucester Crown Court heard. In April last year a second investigation into Stokes began when one of his colleagues reported that a resident had told them they had been abused by him, the court was told. Stokes, who had worked in the care industry for 13 years and in his current job since 2007, was immediately arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault and suspended. Detectives used a specialist intermediary with Makaton cards (a visual language system used to communicate with people who have learning difficulties) to question residents who Stokes had been in contact with, after the first victim suggested there were others who had been abused. Those inquiries found the second victim and forensic inquiries linked Stokes to a third vulnerable adult. In August he was charged with three counts of rape and three of sexual assault. Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Stokes 'These three ladies had the bodies of adults but the minds of children and little children at that. 'They were every bit as vulnerable as little children and in some ways they were more vulnerable. estimony: An example of a Makaton card used to communicate with the victims of Colin Stokes, so that they were able to give an account of what he had done to them . 'Whereas a child might later have been able to explain what had happened to them when they had reached maturity these three ladies will never be able to explain fully either what happened or how they feel. 'I have no doubt you chose them as your victims because of their respective vulnerabilities. 'You had sex with each of them. Such behaviour was cruel and depraved. None of those ladies was capable of giving consent as you well knew. 'Although they find it difficult to explain what happened there is no doubt that your behaviour has left them very disturbed and deeply upset.' Mr Kinsella said there had been many changes to the way crimes against vulnerable adults were now investigated by the police both in Gloucestershire and nationally. 'We now have a specialist team of officers investigating offences such as this,' he said. 'But we also have much closer working with Gloucestershire Safeguarding Adults, so we have a much more effective exchange of information. 'So any incident involving any potential abuse in a care home setting, we will be exchanging information about that, so we are much better placed to be able to prevent any further incidents from occurring. 'I think we are much better placed now and it is much less likely that offending such as that will be able to continue because we do have the effective warnings and information exchange between the police and Safeguarding Adults.' Rachael Scott, head of the CPS South West rape and serious sexual offence unit, explained why Stokes had not been prosecuted in 2007. 'All offences of a sexual nature are considered serious and every effort is made to prosecute such cases subject to the Code for Crown Prosecutors being met,' she said. 'In 2007 a complainant made an allegation of a sexual assault by Colin Stokes. Stokes was interviewed and denied the offence. This was one person's word against another. 'In the absence of any corroboration the decision was made that there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.' Stokes had been subjected to an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check by his employer, which means police would have been able to disclose information about the 2007 invetigation because it was relevant to his employment. 'Police informed his employer of the allegations and it was his employer’s responsibility to inform social services,' a force spokesman told the Press Association. Gloucestershire County Council said it did know about the allegations against Stokes and has now commissioned a serious case review. 'The county council was aware of a police investigation in 2007, but no charges were brought and the case was closed,' a spokeswoman said. 'However, we have now asked the Safeguarding Adults Board to carry out a serious case review to understand exactly what happened in the past and to check we are doing all we can to keep our vulnerable people safe.' Stokes pleaded guilty to three counts of rape, which were all committed between January 1 2012 and April 1 2013. He denied two offences of sexual assault and they were ordered to lie on file by the judge. Distressed parents and relatives of Stokes’ victims were in court, several in tears, as prosecutor Sarah Regan detailed Stokes’ offences. She read statements from the mothers and sisters of the victims describing how their lives had been devastated by what Stokes did. One mother said that her daughter had not been expected to live more than a few days after birth but had survived - only to become a victim of Stokes. 'I vowed as long as I lived that no-one would hurt her,' she stated. 'How wrong was I?' She said her daughter went into the home in 2009 after her father had a heart attack. On April 15 last year when she was told what Stokes had done to her daughter ‘our world fell apart,’ she stated,. 'I felt numb and shocked and physically sick. My husband had to go outside to get some air. I wanted to hold her tight but I was in such a state that she would have been upset to see me like that. 'We thought she would be safe and would never come to any harm.' 'Predator': One of the detectives who brought Colin Stokes said he has not shown a shred of remorse for his sickening actions . One of the detectives who brought Colin Stokes to justice branded him a 'sexual predator' who has not shown a shred of remorse for his sickening actions. Detective Sergeant Mike Rich was the second-in-command during the inquiry and interviewed the perverted care worker. 'He is somebody who gave me a great deal of concern,' the officer said. 'Clearly he is a sexual predator and one of the things that struck me was that at no point did I see anything that suggested any kind of remorse for what he had done. 'I still don't think that he can understand the ramification of his actions. 'These victims already face some pretty difficult challenges in their lives and then they find themselves being abused in this callous and cruel way by a man supposedly looking after them. 'It is not just the victims who he has hurt but the families who have to live with this for the rest of their lives. 'He did deny these offences and it was quite frustrating for the investigating officers that as the evidence mounted against him, and that evidence was put to him, he maintained his position. 'I can't account for why he did that but perhaps he thought it was something he might get away with. 'I think he might have thought that because his victims were very vulnerable getting accounts from them can be quite challenging. 'But we managed to do that with the use of intermediaries to interview the victims and when he came to court in January he was left with no option but to plead guilty.' Det Sgt Rich added: 'I wish he had done it earlier so that the victims would not have this hanging over them for so long. 'I think it was a combination of the amount of evidence that was against him. 'I'd like to say it was compassion for the victims but I still see no reaction from Colin Stokes.' The detective, who has worked in public protection for two years, said the three victims were relieved when told Stokes would be going to prison for a long time. 'I am told at various stages some of the women have been quite disturbed by it,' he said. 'When he pleaded guilty in January officers from Operation Innisbrook went to speak to the victims and told them that 'Colin' would never be coming back and could not hurt them again. 'I am told there were lots of smiles and lots of relief.' But their families have been left devastated at what Stokes has done to their loved ones. 'When you have vested your trust in somebody to look after your daughter, your auntie, your mum and they are exploited like this, I think it is very difficult to comprehend how they must have felt,' he said. 'The families have been very supportive of our investigation and have been very patient, very brave and very resolute.'","Colin Stokes was today jailed for 14 years for sexually abusing the women .

"By . Paul Donnelley . A police crackdown on burglary in the Northeast has resulted in more than 400 arrests and sentences totalling 100 years being handed down. Northumbria Police launched Operation Soundwave in July last year in a bid to tackle opportunist crime. The measures have had some success with burglaries in Newcastle down 4 per cent on the same period last year. Partners in crime: Sarah Bunting and Kirk Watson broke into a nightclub intending to steal alcohol but were caught in the venue's loading bay. Watson had been sentenced for breaking into another club last year . Among those now behind bars are Sarah Bunting, 30, and Kirk Watson, 29, both of Howe Street, Gateshead. On January 7, they broke into Digital nightclub in Times Square via a rear door and stole spirits, liqueurs and beer with a value totalling more than £1,500. The incompetent thieves were quickly apprehended in the club’s service area. Pleading guilty to burglary at Newcastle Magistrates’ Court two days later, they were both sentenced to 44 weeks’ imprisonment. Watson had not long been out of jail after being sentenced for stealing spirits from Beyond Bar, in the Gate, in Newcastle city centre on April 17. He was jailed for four months to run consecutively, as a previous suspended sentence was activated, resulting in an eight-month prison sentence in total. Crime scene: Bunting and Watson broke into Digital nightclub via a rear door and stole spirits, liqueurs and beer with a value totalling more than £1,500. The incompetent thieves were quickly apprehended in the club's service area . Salvatore Musumeci, of Trentham Avenue in Newcastle, was jailed for 12 months on December 11, 2013 for various burglaries . Former waiter Salvatore Musumeci of Trentham Avenue, Byker, Newcastle, was jailed for 12 months on December 11, 2013 after pleading guilty to a burglary a month earlier and three other similar offences. Musumeci, 44, told police that he became a heroin addict after losing his job at Francesca’s, in Jesmond. He was caught after taxi driver Kenneth Davidson saw Debra Dunthorne in distress when she found a burglar in her home in Benton, Newcastle. Mr Davidson rang the police on his mobile and then chased after the man, giving a running commentary on his phone. When he caught up with Musumeci, Mr Davidson sat on him until police arrived to make an arrest. Judge Guy Whitburn QC, at Newcastle Crown Court, said: “I award Mr Davidson £200 out of the public purse for his public-spirited actions in helping Miss Dunthorne and in restraining the defendant until the police arrived.” Behind bars: Patrick Jobson (left), 26, of Eastern Way, Newcastle, was jailed for two years on January 27; Richard Hunter (right), 28, of Bentinck Terrace in Newcastle, was sentenced to 29 months on February 12 .

Newcastle Chief Inspector David Felton said: ‘Since last July dozens of people have been put behind bars, receiving sentences totalling 100 years. ‘That’s a significant amount of time and every time we put a burglar before the courts and they get jailed, it makes Newcastle a safer place for law-abiding residents. ‘We’re well aware the impact burglary has on residents and communities and that’s why we continue to focus on tackling those bringing misery to our communities. ‘I hope the fact these offenders are spending 100 years behind bars reassures people we take it extremely seriously. Burglars can be sure there will be no let-up – efforts are continuing to target suspects to prevent offences from taking place.’ Northumbria’s Police and Crime Commissioner, Vera Baird added: ‘This operation shows the terrific commitment Northumbria Police has to tackling house burglaries and reducing crime.’ Behind bars: Robert Nicholson (left), 32, of Carrville Road in North Tyneside, was jailed for seven years and six months on January 27 for a robbery in North Tyneside and a burglary in Newcastle; John Simon (right), 31, of Bentinck Terrace, Newcastle, was sent to prison for two years and eight months on March 3 .

"By . Anna Pursglove . Ask me if I’m a bag or a shoes girl and I’ll say shoes every time. They are the first thing I notice about another woman’s outfit and the one thing in my own wardrobe I’ll splash money on. Furthermore, after years working on glossy women’s magazines, I like to think I can spot designer shoes at 30 paces. From the cut of the leather to the detailing and shade of the dye, I’ve always believed it was easy when it came to sorting budget from luxury labels. Or so I thought. In the past few months I’ve been taken in by more bargain basement styles than I care to mention. So, am I wasting my money on designer footwear? Should I be heading for the budget shoe departments this spring? And can cheap shoes ever be as comfortable as expensive ones? I decided to find out. My challenge was to road-test five key styles for this season  - in each case trying on one pair costing less than £30 and another with a three-figure price tag. Could you tell the difference? French Sole (right) failed to live up to its £10 competitors from BHS (left) SNAKE BALLERINA PUMPS . BHS: £10  French Sole: £120 . STYLE: French Sole is the Rolls-Royce of flats, loved by Kates Moss and Middleton. I buy a pair every spring and wear them so often I feel I can justify the cost. So, it’s remarkable BHS’s snake-effect fabric (left) looks very like the French Sole leather (right) and is almost as butter soft. Who’d have thought cheap shoes could be so chic? CUT & FIT: The front of the BHS shoe comes much higher up the foot, which could cause blisters. But they are wide across your feet, meaning you will keep the circulation in your little toes. As with a real ballet shoe, the drawstring on the French Sole style can be tightened to give a perfect fit. Winner: BHS . Almost identical to its Asos (left) rival the Russel and Bromley (right) kitten heels are over six times the price . KITTEN HEELS . Asos.com: £27 Russell &  Bromley: £175 . STYLE: The Asos heels (above left) are a more flattering nude shade than the more expensive pair (right). They’ll bring a bit of warmth to a pale skin tone. The strap sits across the front of the foot rather than around the ankle, which is better for someone with curvy calves as it lengthens the leg. I’m disappointed in the oddly cheap looking Russell & Bromley pair. CUT & FIT: The Asos leather might not be real, but it’s baby soft and these shoes feel like slippers. I’m guessing they wouldn’t stand up to rough treatment but they’re a joy to walk in and a perfect size 5. Though the shoes are pointy, the front is cut low so there’s no uncomfortable rubbing across the big toe joint. The fit of the Russell & Bromley pair is good, but I’m not sure what justifies the hefty price tag. Winner: Asos . Although the overall look of Lucy Choi pair (right) was more sophisticated Anna says the fit was awful . GLITTER COURTS . Graceland: £14.99 Lucy Choi London: £195 . STYLE: The Graceland glitter (left) is much more obvious than on the Lucy Choi pair (right), which have a sophisticated sheen rather than in-your-face sparkle. The cheap ones look as if they belong in a strip club and the platform sole at the front isn’t helping. CUT & FIT: The Graceland shoes look like something you’d see on a panto dame, but they are remarkably comfortable. But I’d challenge anyone who knew their shoes not to pick these out as the cheap ones. However, the Lucy Choi heels are absolutely tiny. My feet are on the small side of size five, but this pair is virtually impossible to get on. When I do manage to shoehorn my feet in, my little toes scream in agony. I can barely walk. Yes, they may be beautiful, but sadly they are totally unwearable. Winner: Graceland, available at Deichman.com . Anna says the Dorothy Perkins pair (right) cut in uncomfortably and gape around the side of the foot . WEDGED HEELS . Dorothy Perkins: £25 Nine West: £100 . Style: The Dorothy Perkins suedette (left) feels and looks saggy. As for the height - oh dear, what is going on here? It’s almost as though the designers were going for a flatform (a one-height raised sole), but they chickened out at the last minute and went for a wedge instead. The Nine West wedges (right) in attractive red patent have a cork look sole. Cut & fit: The Dotty P peep-toe cuts in uncomfortably just at the base of the nail of my big toe and the suedette bags and gapes around the side of my foot. Sorry - I can’t see a reason to buy these shoes when there are plenty of good wedges out there. The Nine West slingback sits comfortably at the top of the heel and doesn’t dig into the tendon (which can be a problem with cheaper, badly cut styles). The peep-toe is well-cut, too. Though these shoes will give you lots of height, they also feel secure. I could run for a bus in this pair. Winner: Nine West . Anna said that the New Look pair looked promising but scuffed almost immediately after putting them on . HEELED STRAPPY SANDALS . New Look: £14.99 LK Bennett: £195 . Style: The New Look suedette fabric (above left) is a nice inky black in the box, but they scuff almost as soon as I put them on. And I find myself continually adjusting the double-straps to get them an equal distance apart.The wider heels and more sensible single ankle strap of the LK Bennetts (above right) make them more of a day/work sandal than glamorous evening shoes. A real wardrobe essential. Cut & fit: The New Look sandals are unforgiving across the front, leading to dead little toes. This is a bit of a let-down as lots of the cheaper shoes I’ve admired on friends have turned out to be from New Look, so I’m disappointed these ones weren’t better. The LK Bennett leather is strong enough to make your feet feel as if they’re going to stay put (important when you’re wearing a heel this high), but is equally soft enough to be comfortable.There’s nothing wrong with these shoes, but they’re rather run of the mill to justify the nearly £200 price tag. Winner:  LK Bennett .","Anna Pursglove tries some of the most popular styles available .

"By . Bianca London . Mod fashion queen Mary Quant invented hot pants and the Chelsea Girl look, helped . popularise the mini skirt, created the skinny rib sweater and changed . the face of make-up for ever. And now, a sketchbook of fashion designs that a young Mary threw at her tutor in a rage for dismissing her ideas has emerged and is for sale. Quant, famed for inventing the mini skirt in the 1960s, was a young college student when she went to Alfred Page with the book full of outlines of dresses. A sketchbook of fashion designs that a young Mary Quant threw at her tutor in a rage for dismissing her ideas in the 1940s before she shot to fame has emerged for sale . She sought his opinion on a particular coloured fabric design but didn't like the answer that came back. The designer in the making became hot-headed and hurled the hefty document at Mr Page before storming out. The college lecturer kept hold of it . and after Quant became a famous designer in the 1960s he passed it down . through his family, telling them the story of how he came by it. His granddaughter has now unearthed it and has made it available for sale in Dorchester, Dorset. Mary Quant was credited for inventing hot pants and the Chelsea Girl look and changed the face of make-up for ever . Amy Brenan, from Duke's Auctioneers of Dorchester, said: 'This is a fascinating document that comes with excellent provenance. 'Although Mary Quant was a student at Goldsmith's College in the 1950s, students from all London art colleges socialised together and she met Alfred Page who was a lecturer at the Royal College of Art. 'According to the vendor, the granddaughter of Alfred Page, he told her that Quant asked for his opinion on one of the coloured fabric designs in the sketchbook. Alfred Page, her college lecturer, kept hold of the sketches and after Quant became a famous designer in the 1960s he passed it down through his family . Quite a few of them have been coloured using gouache paint whilst others, like this, are just very basic pencil outlines including one of a wedding dress . 'He told Quant that he didn't think it was very good, at which point she hurled the sketchbook at him and walked out in a huff. She never came back to collect the book.' There are designs and outlines on every sheet of the 20 page book. Quant completed each design in pencil and they depict female models wearing designs for full-length evening dresses or suit combinations. Quite a few of them have been coloured using gouache paint whilst others are just very basic pencil outlines including one of a wedding dress. The sketchbook is being sold with a pre-sale estimate of £200 on April 10 . Another few pages appear to be designs for printed fabrics. Although none of the sketches are signed or dated, a simple drawing of a box of Icimla face cream has helped to date it. It shows the new floral design of the cream's packaging which came into being in the 1940s, previously, the face cream had been in a jar. Amy Brenan said: 'These sketches are likely to have been done by Quant in her early years as a student, before she became famous, making them quite significant. Quant designed the kind of sexy, affordable clothes her arty friends wanted to wear; tiny tunic dresses, knickerbockers, flared hipster trousers. Then everyone else wanted them, too . 'It is clear from the quality of them that they are by a very well trained and skilled hand. It is a great collection of working ideas and designs. 'It is likely Mary Quant still holds most of her own designs which makes this sketchbook quite a rarity.' The sketchbook is being sold with a pre-sale estimate of £200 on April 10.

"By . Lizzie Parry . Jailed: Jean Robinson, 62, was sentenced to 12 months in prison, after admitting abusing her adopted son Joseph for more than a decade. File picture . A mother who abused her adopted son for more than a decade, beating him and locking him in darkness for a year, has today been jailed. Jean Robinson beat her son Joseph for 11 years, after adopting him as an 18-month-old baby. The 62-year-old locked him away without access to a toilet, caging him in total darkness for a year. Robinson was today sentenced to 12 months in prison after pleading guilty to two counts of wilful assault at Preston Crown Court. Speaking after the hearing, Joseph, now 27 and a dad himself, said: 'It started when I was adopted at 18 months old and went on until I was 11. 'She did awful things to me, and I used to wonder why she hated me so much. 'She’d lock me in my room with just a mattress on the floor. 'She’d take the lightbulb out of the light so I’d be in total darkness and there weren't any toilet facilities, so I’d have to go to the toilet in the room. 'Then she’d beat me for that. I used to cry into my pillow, wondering what I’d done to deserve it.' The abuse took place over a 10-year period between 1988 and 1998. Police officers investigating the case said the accounts were 'deeply moving'. Detective Sergeant Jamie Lillystone, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a complicated and deeply moving case. 'The victim was a very young, vulnerable child who was systematically abused and neglected over a number of years by his adoptive mother.'

"By . Jill Foster . Ben and Will are bright, sporty boys. Seven-year-old Will is a fan of martial arts while his elder brother Ben, 12, would love to be a rugby player when he grows up. But, like many children, one of their favourite pastimes is playing computer games, and they spend hours every week playing on the family's iPad. Like most modern parents, Nicky Hayes, 39, and her husband Simon, 45, admit there's a convenience factor in allowing their sons to play these games. But the couple, from Ashtead, Surrey, are now fastidious about the security settings on their iPad, having learnt their lesson the hard - and expensive - way. Concern: Kathryn Bennett and her grandson Alfie, who unwittingly spent . £3,500 playing games on her iPad . 'We've changed our password and disabled a setting which allowed the boys to purchase games or credits for a game without us knowing,' says Nicky. 'We've added every parental control you can think of.' The couple are ever-vigilant because, two years ago, Will racked up a debt of £1,200 on his mother's debit card by playing a supposedly ‘free’ game on the iPad. Only five at the time, the youngster had no idea that the game, which encouraged him to purchase 'virtual zombie brains', would result in his parents paying real money. While they were stunned that their young son could run up such a debt, Nicky, a business consultant, and Simon, a property developer, were lucky to be able to take the financial hit. But not every parent is as fortunate - and the consequences can be tragic. Last month, an inquest heard how 13-year-old Lancashire schoolboy Henry Tattersall hanged himself after spending £422 online on Xbox games. While the coroner ruled that Henry had intended to be found, the tragic incident happened after his mother confronted him over the bill. It makes me so cross that Apple target . children with so-called ""free"" games then enable them to buy ""add-ons"" for extortionate sums of money . Numerous other children have unwittingly spent fortunes on their parents' credit or debit cards. Last summer, eight-year-old Lilly Neale, from Somerset, ran up almost £4,000, while Theo Rowland-Fry, eight, from Bristol, spent £1,000. Danny Kitchen, also from Bristol, was five when he racked up a £1,700 bill on a zombie game. The first time Nicky Hayes realised something was wrong was when she went to the cash machine and discovered her balance was £1,000 short. Her bank told her the purchases had been made on iTunes, Apple's media player which lets you download music, games and videos. 'I knew it wasn't me - I hadn't bought anything from iTunes recently,' she says. 'Then I went into my account online and saw dozens of purchases. Over a two to three-day period, one of my sons had spent £1,200 on a game where they had to pay to acquire virtual zombie brains. 'It was part of a free game we'd downloaded. I wasn't aware you could spend money on it. I rang Apple, who were remarkably unhelpful. They said that as the purchases had been made legitimately, they couldn't refund the money. Innocent: Many children aren't aware they are spending money when playing iPad games (posed by models) 'I told them it had been spent without my authorisation, but they just weren't interested. 'We'd always been careful to protect our iPad with a password and not to tell the boys what it was but, like every customer, we'd had to input our card details to sign up to iTunes, and these details were stored. 'It turned out Will had watched me inputting the password and memorised it. The game kept asking him if he wanted to buy more for £50 and he kept pressing the ""yes"" button. He didn't think he'd spent ""real money"".' Dr Kevin Curran, a lecturer in computer science at the University of Ulster, says incidents such incidents are common - and a major problem. 'Of course, a password is required, but even if a parent never lets their child know it, there are loopholes which allow a child to purchase without a parent's knowledge,' he says. Louise Worth, 50, found this out when she let her ten-year-old son, Alex, play a free game called Six-Guns last year. When I got the bill, I was furious, but Alex genuinely didn't realise he'd been spending money . The housewife from Barnet, north London, realised he'd spent £250 only when she checked her email and found 28 iTunes invoices. 'Alex doesn’t know my password, but one evening he'd been playing a game with my permission and it kept asking if he wanted to go up a level, so he kept pressing ""yes"". 'When I got the bill, I was furious, but Alex genuinely didn't realise he'd been spending money. He thought the game was offering him ""prizes"". I rang Apple who said their terms and conditions meant they didn't have to give the money back. I was furious. 'That's when Apple checked my account and found a 15-minute time-limit setting on it, which allowed for purchases without a password as long as they were all made within 15 minutes of the first password being entered. 'They said that Alex must have made all 28 purchases within that 15-minute time-frame, but I thought that was impossible. 'For two weeks I fought the decision, and three times Apple came back and said they would not refund the money. Eventually, they backed down and paid it. 'But they made it clear this was a once-only offer. They were very arrogant about it. It makes me so cross that Apple target children with so-called ""free"" games then enable them to buy ""add-ons"" for extortionate sums of money.' Lesson learnt: The Bennetts eventually got their money back . Around 90 per cent of apps are now ""freemium"" - which means that the app is free to download but payments are required to unlock features or purchase extra items. Many of these items are attractive to children, such as virtual jewels, sweets or zombie brains. A study last year revealed that parents had lost £30 million thanks to children's unauthorised purchases. It's a problem that extends far beyond the UK. Recently in the U.S., Apple agreed to refund at least £66 million to parents whose children had racked up in-app bills. Now, the UK's Office of Fair Trading has announced the introduction of new in-app purchases standards, so that from April 1, all apps should clearly disclose information about the costs associated with a game before it’s downloaded. This all comes too late for Roger Bennett, 66, whose grandson Alfie, eight, spent £3,500 on his iPad last year while playing games such as Clash of the Clans, Beat the Boss and Temple Run. Roger, a retired fire officer from Worcester, says it was his wife Kathryn, 63, a retired teacher, who noticed that something was awry. Living online . Two in five children have internet access in their bedrooms by the time they leave primary school . 'Our Apple iTunes account is connected to a bank account that we don't use very often, and when Kathryn realised we were £1,300 overdrawn on it, we knew something was wrong,' he says. The couple asked their grandchildren whether they had been buying anything online. 'Alfie looked a bit sheepish. He has ADHD and can be manic at times, but when he's playing on the iPad, he's calm. So we downloaded some free games, not realising there is a 15-minute slot when you can buy extras without having to put the card details back in. 'When I found out what he'd done, I was furious, but we couldn't shout at him because he hadn't realised what was happening.' When Roger contacted Apple, they offered to refund just £500 because of Alfie's special needs. It was only when a journalist friend became involved that they agreed to pay back the full amount. 'It's a lot of money, so we were very grateful,' says Roger. 'It's a lesson for all of us. I've heard of many others who have been in a similar situation. One friend's son spent nearly £8,000 on his dad's credit card. 'I blame Apple, not the children. They've made a lot of money out of it.' The Mail contacted Apple, but the company declined to comment.","Office of Fair Trading has announced new in-app purchases standards .

At this time of year, my mind also goes to the many lovely and amazing women I know who are currently working very hard to become a Mother themselves. And so, in advance of this lovely occasion, I would like to take this moment to encourage you.  In fact, there is lots of good news out there –and things are only getting better. A new treatment coming to the UK is said to be just as effective as IVF but for a fraction of the price . First and foremost, IVF is getting less invasive and less expensive. A ‘no frills treatment costing under £1,000 will be available to British women within weeks. Despite its low-tech approach, a pilot study showed the treatment to be at least as effective as traditional IVF, and a hell of a lot less pricey. Further in the good news category, Dr Geeta Nargund, of the Walking Egg foundation, who is bringing the procedure to Britain, believes it will allow the NHS to pay for more IVF treatments. Which is great news. And in terms of the risk to your health, many fertility clinics are now offering a ‘kinder, gentler’ IVF.Known as ‘minimal stimulation’ IVF, it uses fewer, and milder drugs and requires less frequent trips to the Doctor's Office. It’s also something like 50 per cent to 60 per cent cheaper than a full stimulation cycle. It uses milder injectables, oral drugs or a combination of both. This Mother's Day, Ashley wants to remember all the women who are still trying to have a baby . You get fewer eggs each cycle, but it’s more patient-friendly, less costly and with lower risk to the patient; experts say it’s a great alternative for older women, who produce fewer eggs anyway in response to drugs, regardless of the dose. And there are hundreds of really encouraging case studies. In this week’s Wall Street Journal, real life mum-to be Neeburbunn Lewis, a 35-year-old nurse living in America, recounts how she spent around $25,000 for the single cycle of conventional IVF that produced her and her husband’s first child. When the couple wanted a second, 'financially, going through another cycle was not feasible,' she told the paper. She also experienced ovarian overstimulation that put her in the hospital when she went through IVF. 'I could not put my body through that again,' she said. She heard about minimal-stimulation IVF from her OB-GYN and did one cycle at the Maine location of Boston IVF. Her cost this time: $5,000. She is currently eight months pregnant with her second child. And whilst women in their 30s or 40s are frequently harangued about the odds of delivering a baby with birth defects, new research suggests that the opposite may be true in certain cases. In the new research, second-trimester ultrasounds for more than 76,000 women showed that older mothers (35 and over) were 40 per cent less likely to have a child with major congenital malformations. And despite alarming headlines to the contrary, if you are contemplating IVF, the biggest comparative study of its type in the world just found that young adults who were conceived through IVF have similar health patterns and success at school as those who were conceived naturally. And be assured, new advances mean you may not have to go through IVF at all. There are currently advances in fertility acupuncture, diet and lifestyle research that can all work together to help you conceive. Fertilty Expert Emma Cannon who runs London’s Fertility Rooms and is author of Total Fertility sees many of her fertility acupuncture patients become pregnant. She has had great success with an integrated approach – looking at diet, acupuncture, lifestyle, even happiness levels, and the effect that they have on fertility. She was the woman I went to who offered me hope and positive thinking at a time when it was much needed. 'Things are looking good for couples wanting to have a baby; IVF is improving all the time and there are more options available to (hopefully) reduce the amount of IVF cycles couples do.' This new method of IVF is said to be far less invasive than current treatments available . The Baby-Making Bible author adds, 'The endometrial scratch, prior to transfer, is a relatively non invasive procedure and IMSI is  a non-invasive method for selecting the best sperm: both show promise. We are seeing over 100 couples every year looking for lifestyle or acupuncture  support during or as preparation for  IVF. Many couples conceive naturally while waiting to start which is always a lovely surprise.' And there are great advances being made in the field of male fertility as well. Clinical scientist Dr Sheryl Homa operates the only HFEA licensed UK fertility clinic dedicated entirely to men. (www.andrologysolutions.co.uk) She says: ‘Having worked in academia and then at IVF clinics, it struck me how marginalised the male side of things is.  In this country, 95 per cent of IVF clinics, (or more) are run by gynaecologists. And yet 50 per cent of the genetic material that makes up a baby is derived from the male. Why are we so obsessed with women and fertility?' She help couples get pregnant without having to go down the IVF route. She cautions: 'If faced with an unexplained infertility diagnosis- don’t go straight to IVF. Infertility is unexplained in around 25 per cent of cases. 'However, there is now good evidence to suggest that sperm DNA damage and oxidative stress in semen may be significant factors contributing to unexplained infertility cases - and the good news is that there are now tests available to assess both of these factors.' Diet, acupuncture, lifestyle, and even happiness levels, can affect fertility success. Medical Director at the Poundbury Clinic and at King Edward VII Hospital Central London and in Dorset, Michael Dooley concurs that there is reason to be optimistic for women trying to become pregnant. ‘The techniques that we’ve been doing are getting better, and by using an integrated approach, addressing lifestyle and relationships at the same time, we are getting higher rates of success.' The Consultant Gynaecologist adds, ‘Solid evidence-based good help is available and success is improving. We have seen advances in egg storage for younger women who are thinking of delaying pregnancy, and egg donation is becoming more available and more acceptable.  We also have more information about how to improve success rates of embryo and egg freezing.’ Reproductive Endocrinologist David Sable recently wrote, speaking about IVF: 'I dislike the way the term “miracle” (as in “miracle baby” or “miracle procedure”) is used…What happens when a cycle fails and a patient thinks,”Maybe I don’t deserve the miracle?” 'If a patient believes that the outcome of an IVF cycle is a miracle, and is therefore not based in very real and very limiting probabilities, then she is going to very naturally feel that the outcome will reflect whether she is worthy of such a miracle or not….The truth is, when IVF fails a patient, IVF has failed. Not the patient.' If you are someone who desperately wants to become a mother this year, at the very least, know that you are not alone. There are thousands of other women who are right there in the fight along with you, or the rest of us who stand beside you in solidarity; there is hope.","Ashley Pearson says that IVF is getting less invasive and less expensive .

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . After being criticised for her  ‘shrill’ voice, Margaret Thatcher, encouraged by actor Laurence Olivier, enlisted a vocal coach to help soften her speaking tone. She went on to win the 1979 General Election – and a study from British Columbia University hints at one reason why. According to researchers, women prefer softer ‘breathier’ voices to ‘creaky’ or sharp voices – associating the former with  youth and vitality. To be preferred: Women prefer Marilyn Monroe's softer, husky voice over Kim Kardashian's 'creaky' tones . Female participants in the study were played tapes of Marilyn Monroe and Kim Kardashian, and the majority said they preferred Monroe. The creakier Kardashian tones are associated with health issues such as smoking or a cold. Men preferred larger-sounding voices, such as that of Barry White. The findings were published in the journal Plos One. Best known to TV viewers as the  Oxo . Mum, actress Lynda Bellingham has given her support to a nutritional . supplement aimed at helping stroke and dementia patients. The powder was . created by aromatherapist Barbara Hobbs, 68, who suffered a stroke 12 . years ago. Now recovered, . Barbara worked with a biochemist to create Neurocare 21, which contains . extracts of vegetables she keeps in her garden. She credits the . supplement with returning her to health. Cooking up a cure: Lynda Bellingham, pictured in the Oxo commercial, credits nutritional supplement  Neurocare 21 with helping her recover from a stroke . Lynda – pictured with her screen husband from the Oxo ads – met Barbara when she handed her an Adult Achievement Award from the Stroke Association in 2007. Lynda was so impressed with Barbara’s work that she and husband Michael decided to invest in what eventually became Neurocare. Lynda, 65, says: ‘We agreed to provide the start-up costs and use my profile to endorse the product. 'It took three years to get licensed but now we’ve launched on the internet. It is not a miracle cure but it is a fantastic natural product to assist those suffering with stroke symptoms or dementia.’ Pecnominated: Fitness trainer Shaun Stafford . The Neknominate craze, where participants film themselves binge-drinking, has sparked a potentially dangerous spin-off. Personal trainers and ordinary gym-goers are attempting the Pecnominate challenge, in which they have one minute to lift their own body weight as many times as possible. The exercises take the form of a bench press, where the user lies flat and pushes a barbell containing the specified weight away from their body. This targets the pectoral, or chest, muscles – hence the name of the fad. Videos are being uploaded on websites such as YouTube. Celebrity trainer Shaun Stafford, who helped Made In Chelsea’s Spencer Matthews shed weight recently, joined the challenge. But lifting extreme weights carries a high risk of serious injury, as orthopaedic surgeon Adrian Wilson explains: ‘Losing control of the bar and dropping the weight on to your body could lead to a major injury  to the ribs or ripping of the chest tendons. 'It takes significant time to recover from these.’ A self-care ‘toolkit’ aimed at helping chronic pain sufferers cope better has been launched by the NHS. The tips on paintoolkit.org are also available as a smartphone app and offer advice to eight million Britons who are in persistent pain due to conditions such as arthritis and fibromyalgia. For children suffering from kidney stones a new, less invasive procedure has been introduced at Southampton General Hospital. A . tiny tube is inserted into the patient’s side to  ‘laser away’ the hard . deposits that can cause agony. Southampton is the only hospital outside . London using this method, called Ultra-Mini PCNL. The technique results in less bleeding and less pain relief is . required. Patients can be discharged after one night, instead of three. Two operations have already been performed and Stephen Griffin, . consultant paediatric surgeon, says the procedure will be of ‘great . benefit’.","Women prefer to have a softer 'breathier' voice, like Marilyn Monroe .

The iPad 4 was discontinued in October following the announcement of the flagship iPad Air, leaving the iPad 2 as the cheaper, entry-level device.

This is in addition to the iPad mini with Retina Display which has a 7-inch screen, compared to the iPad’s 9.7-inch display. This announcement, coupled with Apple’s earlier statement about the 8GB iPhone 5C, signals a fundamental shift from Apple to widen its appeal and attract more customers, especially in emerging markets. The iPad 4, pictured, was discontinued in October following the announcement of the firm's flagship iPad Air, leaving the iPad 2 as the cheaper, entry-level device. With this latest announcement, Apple's iPad 4 becomes an entry-level 9.7-inch tablet but with higher specifications . Both devices appear to be Apple's way of offering devices with higher-end specifications to people with smaller budgets - although the prices are still much higher than products from Google, Motorola and other rivals. Casting its net wider, and appealing to mid-tier and high-tier customers, is a tactic succesfully used by its major rival Samsung. Reports claim Apple introduced the 8GB version and dropped because the colourful device is now price selling as well as expected. The new model comes with 8GB of storage and costs £429 - half the size of the next model up, and £40 cheaper. It is available directly from Apple's online stores in the UK, France, Germany, Australia and China, but not the U.S. Apple's latest version of its iPhone 5C comes with 8GB of storage and costs £429 - half the size of the next model up, and £40 cheaper.  It is available directly from Apple's online store but is only appearing in certain regions, including UK, pictured, China and Australia, but not in the U.S. Manufacturer Pegatron is said to be gearing up to start production of Apple's next handset, dubbed iPhone 6. Reports claim production will begin in the 'second quarter' of this year ahead of a September launch. The iPhone 6 is expected to launch in two different models - one with a 4.7-inch display and one with a 5.7-inch display. There are also claims the handset will have a display made of super-strong sapphire glass after Apple announced plans to open a mineral plant in Arizona, in conjunction with sapphire crystal makers GT Advanced Technologies. Images of a so-called Apple Healthbook leaked earlier this week, hinting the tech giant might follow Samsung's lead and add fitness and health tracking features to an upcoming device. It is not yet clear why this is. Network operator O2 has also released tariff prices, starting at £28 a month for 500 minutes, unlimited texts and 500MB data – although customers will need to pay £49.99 for the handset upfront. Aside from the drop in memory, the 8GB iPhone 5C is identical to the 16GB and 32GB models in terms of other specifications. There is an £80 price difference between the 16GB and 32GB versions - £469 and £549 respectively. The iPhone 5C was launched at the same time as Apple’s high-end model, the iPhone 5S, in September. Despite the company posting record sales figures for the final quarter of last year, it’s believed the bulk of these were made up with the iPhone 5S, which starts at £549 for 16GB. Further reports claimed at least a million of the cheaper models are sitting in warehouses because demand is lower than anticipated. Aside from the drop in memory, the 8GB iPhone 5C is identical to the 16GB and 32GB models in terms of other specifications. The iPhone 5C, pictured, was launched in September. Reports earlier this year claimed at least a million of the cheaper handsets are sitting in warehouses because demand is lower than anticipated . By comparison, Motorola's Moto G, pictured, released in August, comes in a range of colours, like the iPhone 5C, has a 4.5-inch screen, compared to Apple's 4-inch display, and comes with 8GB of storage for just £135. This is a more than third of the price for Apple's latest low-end handset . Since 2007, Apple’s handsets have been seen as high-end devices. The release of the iPhone 5C signalled a move away from this and saw the Californian-based firm take aim at emerging markets such as China. Despite Apple posting record sales figures for the final quarter of last year, it's believed the bulk of these were made up with the iPhone 5S, pictured . Apple’s biggest rival Samsung is popular in Asian markets particularly because of the lower prices, colourful and plastic designs, and larger screens. The iPhone 5C ticked only one of these three boxes and is still more expensive and smaller than its rivals' handsets. The California-based company is also expected to add a new iPhone to its smartphone line later this year, dubbed iPhone 6. Fewer phone manufacturers are releasing phones with 8GB storage because demand is a lot lower. Handsets come pre-installed with the operating system, and various files, and this immediately reduces the amount of available storage. On the larger iPhone 5C and 5S models, these built-in files take up around 4GB. If the 8GB model follows suit, users will get just half of the allocated space. By comparison, Motorola’s Moto G handset, released in August, comes in a range of colours, like the iPhone 5C, has a 4.5-inch screen, compared to Apple’s 4-inch display, and comes with 8GB for just £135. This is a more than third of the price for Apple’s low-end handset. However, Apple may have targeted these areas due to the rising popularity of LTE, also known as 4G. LTE is pretty well established in the U.S., for example, but it is still being gradually introduced across the UK and other similar markets. By dropping the price of the iPhone 5C, Apple may be trying to attract people who want an LTE handset without paying the top prices. Analysts have also claimed Apple's iPhone mid-tier market is showing signs of growing year over year, and may be another reason for the launch of the iPhone 5C and change in the iPad line-up.","Apple is bringing back its iPad with Retina display, also known as iPad 4 .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . At first glance this map might look like a Catherine Wheel spitting out colourful sparks, but this stunning image in fact shows the routes of millions of commuters who journey into London every day. The map was created by an academic who used data collected by 50 million Oyster card journeys to investigate how people arrive at their workplace in capital. The result is fresh look at the busiest stations used by commuters and while there are some notoriously hectic spots like Bank listed, there are also some surprising omissions, including King’s Cross station. Dr Manley's map shows the connections formed between all London stations and their most popular destinations.  A link has been drawn between the two places, and the link and points coloured according to the destination. Each destination is given a different colour . Dr Ed Manley, a research associate at University College London's Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (Casa) created the map based on data collected at the busiest times on weekday mornings – between 7am and 10am. ‘Looking at morning peak, as we have done here, we can start to understand a little more about the relationship between where people live and where they work,’ he told the Standard. His map suggests that City workers are most likely to live in east London or Essex, while people living south of the Thames tend to use Waterloo, London Bridge or Victoria to get to get to work. The trends indicated by the map (pictured) hint at the interdependencies that underlie the relationships between places in London.  It is clear, for example, that much of travel from south London is focussed on just three end points ¿ Waterloo, Victoria, and London Bridge. He told MailOnline: 'I think the map shows some well understood and some not-so-obvious trends. The fact that travel from south London is attracted to only three main stations - Victoria, Waterloo and London Bridge - is maybe predictable, but the map reflects well the dependency that south London holds on these few stations. 'Likewise, the strong connections between the City and east London may be well known, but the map shows how widely this influence spreads.' The data represents 48.9 million journeys documented over 49 days in the summer of 2012 - which average out at one million morning peak trips per day and night. Strikingly, King’s Cross station is missing from the map. Dr Manley explained in a blog post that despite popular perceptions, the station is not a popular end-point for commuters as there are currently not many offices nearby, but it remains one of London’s busiest stations.

Dr Manley explained in a blog post that despite popular perceptions, the station is not a popular end-point for commuters . ‘This may not be where people end their trips. They [commuters] may well pass through King’s Cross St Pancras – indeed, a failure at King’s Cross could be catastrophic for many travellers – but it is not where the leave the system,’ he wrote. ‘In this sense, King’s Cross is an important point on the network but not a place that many people actually get off.’ 'The same might be said for places like Baker Street and Green Park - important points on the network, but not the final destination for many,' he told MailOnline. Some of London’s tourist hotspots and business hubs have unpredictable travel patterns as they attract people who live all over London and its sprawling suburbs. Locations such as Oxford Circus and Canary Wharf attract travellers from all over the city, Dr Manley explained. Dr Manley said: 'I think the map shows some well understood and some not-so-obvious trends. The fact that travel from south London is attracted to only three main stations - Victoria, Waterloo and London Bridge - is maybe predictable, but the map reflects well the dependency that south London holds on these few stations . He said that the popular shopping destination’s star-like distribution of links indicates that it is attractive to commuters from all over the capital. ‘Canary Wharf, too, shows a spread of origin points to the east, the north-west along the Jubilee line and to the south-east,’ he wrote. Dr Murray believes the trends might show the accessibility of these stations across multiple routes and their accessibility from all over the London. 'The general assumption too is that most travel revolves around central London, but the map reflects a different story in the outer suburbs. 'As we move away from central London, the influence of places like Hammersmith, Uxbridge, Stratford, Croydon and Barking increases and there are clearly some very important local patterns in these areas.' His work is part of ongoing research into how Oyster Card data can describe travel behaviour in London. 'The aim is that the lessons we learn here can be used to inform how we improve and extend the transport network in London,' he added.","An academic at University College London investigated how people get to work around the capital and found some surprising omissions, including King’s Cross station, which is not an end destination for many commuters .

"A council has spent taxpayers' money filling in potholes along a road - just days before it was due to be ripped up and resurfaced in a £75,000 scheme.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Twitter is often used as a barometer for the popularity of celebrities and has even been used to predict flu outbreaks. Now the social network has revealed when people were late for work and horribly hungover - which could perhaps be used to spot patterns in the future. The study revealed when people were the most late for work and when they were happiest in 2013. Running late: The statistics showed that the most common day that people were late for work was mid-week in July and on Fridays in January . Twitter analysed the use of different English words and phrases in 2013 on a daily basis to find that people were particularly hungover on Fridays in November and at their saddest on a Sunday in December. Experts at the San Francisco-based company turned the data into a ratio of tweets containing certain words in English per million tweets posted to create colourful charts showing that many of us tweet the same words on the same day. Arguably proving that plenty of people dread the working week ahead, Twitter’s research found that people are more likely to tweet ‘feeling sad’ on a Sunday in December and that Mondays really are tough, particularly on a chilly day in October. Sunday in March and Thursdays and Fridays in November are the days that most people were hungover, according to the study and data visualisations .

Conversely, people were happiest on a Tuesday in December and January, which happened to be New Year’s Eve, according to the blog post by Simon Rogers, Data Editor at the social network. The statistics showed that the most common days that people were late for work fell in the middle of the week in July and on Fridays in January. Meanwhile, Sunday in March and Thursdays and Fridays in November are the days that most people were hungover, according to the study and data visualisations.

Twitter might be best known as the place to go for day-to-day updates about people’s lives and celebrity selfies, but it could also be used as a health tool, researchers claim. Geography experts discovered in December that posts on the social network predicted flu outbreaks in different parts of the U.S. They believe Twitter could help medical professionals learn where and when severe flu outbreaks are occurring in real time so they can prepare for busy periods, which typically occur during the winter months. The researchers, led by San Diego State University geography professor Ming-Hsiang Tsou, examined tweets that originated from a 17 mile radius of 11 different U.S. cities between June and December 2012. Whenever people tweeted the keywords ‘flu’ or ‘influenza,’ a computer programme recorded characteristics about the tweets, including the username and location of the people who sent them as well as whether they were original tweets or retweets and whether they linked to a website. From June 2012 to the beginning of December, the algorithm recorded 161,821 tweets containing the word ‘flu’ and 6,174 containing ‘influenza’. The researchers compared the location data of those tweets to data on the flu virus rates recorded in the relevant cities and counties. They discovered that of the 11 cities where tweets were examined, there was a ‘significant’ correlation between tweets about flu and the rates of flu-like illnesses in nine of the cities. Twitter also seemed to be able to predict outbreaks in five of the cities: San Diego, Denver, Jacksonville, Fort Worth and Seattle, as the tweets recorded instances of illness before they were officially documented and reported by cities and counties.","The San Francisco-based company analysed the use of different English words and phrases in 2013 to confirm myths and find surprising patterns .

"By . Mark Duell . Mother and daughter: Dawn Howie, of Fenham, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, 38, gave a kidney to Eryn, two . A mother has saved the life of her two-year-old daughter by giving her a kidney. Eryn Howie, of Fenham, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, was born without functioning kidneys - and her parents thought they would not see her grow up. But then her mother Dawn was told a transplant was possible - and she was the ideal donor. The 38-year-old mother-of-four said: ‘Donating a kidney didn't seem like a sacrifice to me - it was just something I needed to do. I feel privileged to be able to give her a new lease of life.’ Both Mrs Howie and her husband Mark, 40, were tested - and she was found to be a match. Mrs Howie and Eryn had surgery at different hospitals, while Mr Howie faced an anxious wait. At a 30-week scan when Mrs Howie was pregnant, she and Mr Howie, a retail manager at the British Heart Foundation, were told there was only a 50/50 chance their baby would survive. When Eryn was born in May 2011, Mrs Howie hardly had time to cradle her newborn in her arms before worried doctors whisked her away. Eryn was immediately taken into Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary's Paediatric Intensive Care Unit. Her parents were told she had end-stage kidney failure and that their newborn needed an operation.

Intensive care: When Eryn was born in May 2011, Mrs Howie hardly had time to cradle her newborn in her arms before worried doctors whisked her away . At just three days old, baby Eryn was . taken into surgery as she was too small for regular dialysis - and her . parents prepared for the worst. The . operation was a success, but the catheter they inserted became . infected, so had to be taken out to let Eryn heal - and they were told . she might die. But the family was lucky as hospital had a rare baby dialysis machine from a retired consultant, which saved Eryn's life. At seven months old Eryn was finally well enough to go home, but still had to go to hospital three times a week for dialysis. Mr . and Mrs Howie had to juggle taking their sons Niall, 14, Callum, 12, . and Kian, eight, to school, with Eryn's five-hour dialysis sessions. Mrs . Howie said: ‘A typical day for us was to take the boys to school, go to . hospital for five hours, then go and pick them up again. The boys have . been amazing and absolutely dote on her.’ Worry: Her parents were told she had end stage kidney failure and that their newborn needed an operation . First steps: Now Eryn is a happy, healthy two-year-old and should go on to live a normal life . This continued for two years until Eryn was big enough, at 22lbs, for a transplant. End-stage . kidney failure, also known as established renal failure (ERF), is a . very severe stage of chronic kidney disease - when the usual functions . of the kidney stop working. The . kidneys are meant to filter waste products from the blood and then turn . them into urine. They also help maintain blood pressure and the correct . levels of chemicals in the body. Long-term . dialysis - a method replicating many of the kidney's functions - is . necessary with ERF, and a transplant is carried out if possible. Adults . are recommended by the NHS to have a healthy diet, regularly exercise . and not drink too much alcohol, to reduce the chances of chronic kidney . disease developing. It is . estimated that around one in five men and one in four women aged between . 65 and 74 has chronic kidney disease. There is no cure, but treatment . can slow or halt its progression. Now Eryn is a happy, healthy two-year-old and should go on to live a normal life. She has just taken her first few steps. Mrs . Howie said: ‘She's eating real food now - she used to be fed through a . tube in her nose, and her medication is gradually coming down.’ Mr . Howie added: ‘Now she's a different child. She took her first full . steps yesterday, she's doing things we thought she'd never do. ‘Things . finally look like they're turning a corner and there's a light at the . end of the tunnel. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster. We've just had to . deal with what we had to deal with as it came. ‘We are eternally thankful to the amazing renal team at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, who made Eryn's transplant possible.’ The family are determined to make people aware of the difference a donation can make. Mrs Howie said: ‘There are children all over the world with kidney problems that need help, and it's not widely recognised. ‘It's a completely different world that you don't know about unless you have a poorly child. People are just not aware.’","Eryn Howie, two, was born in Newcastle without functioning kidneys .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . They may be tiny but bumblebees are capable of some remarkable learning feats, especially when they might get a tasty reward, according to new research. Two studies have revealed that bees are able to learn by themselves and from each other. The findings suggest that social learning in bumblebees is even more complex than first thought. Two studies have revealed that bees are able to learn by themselves and from each other. The findings suggest that social learning in bumblebees is even more complex than first thought. A laboratory colony of Eastern bumblebees is shown in this stock image . PhD student Hamida Mirwan and Professor Peter Kevan, of the School of Environmental Sciences at the by University of Guelph, Canada, found that bees are capable of learning to solve increasingly complex problems. The researchers presented bees with a series of artificial flowers that required ever-more challenging strategies, such as moving objects aside or upwards, to gain a sugar syrup reward. When inexperienced bees encountered the most complex flower first, they were unable to access the sweet treat and stopped trying, but bees allowed to progress through increasingly complex flowers were able to navigate the most difficult ones. 'Bees with experience are able to solve new problems that they encounter, while bees with no experience just give up,' said Ms Mirwan. Bees with experience are able to solve new problems that they encounter, while bees with no experience just give up, the study said . She and professor Kevan believe the study, which was published in the journal Animal Cognition, is an example of scaffold learning, a concept normally restricted to human psychology in which learners move through increasingly complex steps. In a second study, which was recently published in the journal Psyche, the researchers found that bees learned by watching and communicating with other bees - a process called social learning. Ms Mirwan made artificial flowers requiring the bees to walk on the underside of a disk to get a sugar syrup reward. Experienced bees foraged on the artificial flowers for several days until they became accustomed to feeding at them. To see whether other bees could learn from the experienced foragers, Ms Mirwan confined inexperienced bees in a mesh container near the artificial flowers where they could observe the experienced bees. When the naïve bees were allowed to forage on the artificial flowers, they took just 70 seconds to get the reward. Control bees that had not observed the experienced bees could not access the syrup. 'Social learning in animals usually involves one individual observing and imitating another, although other kinds of communication can also be involved,' said Ms Mirwan. 'They could try for up to 30 minutes, but most gave up before then.' In a final test, she placed experienced bees in a hive with naïve bees. When the naïve bees were allowed to forage on the artificial flowers, they gained the syrup in three-and-a-half minutes. Behavioural scientists usually assume that observation and imitation are at the heart of social learning, but social insects such as bees can also transmit information through touch, vibration and smell. The researchers said the communication method used by the bees is still a mystery. 'We can’t quite explain how bees that had never even seen an artificial flower were able to become adept so quickly at foraging on them, but clearly some in-hive communication took place,' said Professor Kevan. 'It suggests that social learning in bumblebees is even more complex than we first expected.' Earlier this year scientists in Croatia unveiled specially-bred colonies of bees that can detect buried landmines from more than three miles away. The bees are trained by being fed an irresistible sugar solution mixed with the smell of explosives. Experts have spent several years training and perfecting the training technique. A hive of bees sits at one end, with several feeding points for the bees set up around the tent. But only a few of the feeding points contain food, and the soil immediately around them has been impregnated with explosive chemicals. The idea is that the bees' keen sense of smell soon associates the smell of explosives with food. 'Eventually they come to associate the smell of any explosives with easy food and will literally make a bee line for them,' said Professor Mateja Janes, who trained the bees. Croatia is still riddled with unexploded landmines from the violent independence struggles in the Balkans during the 1990s. 'We have been refining their abilities for many years and they are faster and safer than sniffer dogs. 'Another advantage is that when they're not working they make delicious honey too,' added the professor.","Researchers at the University of Guelph presented bees with a series of flowers that required ever-more challenging strategies to gain a treat .

"By . Emma Soames . There is no doubt that older women are now living dramatically different and more exciting lives. And perhaps no one illustrates this point better than Joanna Trollope, who earlier this week opened up about the inner workings of her relationship with a man 23 years younger than her. She has been with Jason Kouchak, 47, for more than a decade, and seems to suggest that this success is partly  due to the fact they are in an open relationship. For 70-year-old Miss T confesses that she's not that fussed about fidelity. 'At my age, loyalty and trust are more important than monogamy. While women are fertile, I think sexual loyalty is crucial. But as time goes on you shrug a bit.' Joanna Trollope, 70, with 47-year-old lover Jason Kouchak . Well, I didn't shrug when I read this. I don't see many of my friends shrugging either, when they're unfortunate enough to find incriminating evidence of 'playing away' in their partner's phone or pockets. I say this as a single woman in her 60s, who has been thus since my partner, architect Christopher Bowerbank, died more than a decade ago. I admit I've no idea if I shall have a relationship again, but one thing is certain: I most  certainly wouldn't settle for a relationship which was deceitful and uncommitted. For even though Christopher and I never got as far as living together, we were partners on and off for about 10 years.  We split up twice and I loathed seeing him with other women, even when I was dating someone else. Happily, very happily, in the last few years it became a monogamous relationship and we finally reached a plateau of understanding and trust. For the brutal fact of the matter is that infidelity and open relationships never work if  you are emotionally attached  to someone, no matter how old you are. The laid-back attitude to fidelity shown by Trollope, and also by 60-year-old Monica Porter, who has written a new confessional book about a wild year spent sleeping around with  15 much younger men, shows  a strange lack of self-esteem and principle. It is not a sign of emancipation to accept your partner having other girlfriends, but a Faustian pact of the flesh. Joanna Trollope with her estranged husband television dramatist Ian Curteis . I admit when you hear it discussed by Miss Trollope, it sounds like a clever and thoroughly pragmatic way of keeping a man interested. And also a way of keeping the tap flowing for lots of enthusiastic sex at  an age when many women are happily resigned to celibacy. There must be an immense price to pay, however, for these cougars. Open relationships are emotionally draining and painful - not for nothing are they one of the great theatrical themes of all time. Any woman with children would surely find such an arrangement too painful as she and their father have so much shared experience invested in their partnership. And even with no children, the experience of an 'open relationship' would be utterly brutal. It takes a supremely confident woman not to have her esteem battered by the inevitable imaginings of where you fall in your lover's pecking order and your body being compared to other, younger bodies. It can only  end in tears. Perhaps it really is Miss Trollope who is setting the ground rules. Maybe her pragmatism in allowing him freedom - they do not live together - works very well for her, an independent woman reported to be worth Â£15â€‰million. She has two marriages and two children under her belt. She looks like she 'has it all'.But what if Joanna wanted more? What if she wanted Jason to move in? Where would the power balance shift then?  Not in Joanna's favour, I  would guess. The novelist suggests that the secret to a long and happy relationship could be infidelity . As we age, intimacy and companionship become even more vital than in our youth. I can see why many women - and men - of a certain age would consider tolerating countless humiliations just in order to have someone in their lives. When I asked a friend of mine, who is around my age, what she thought of Miss Trollope's arrangement she said: 'Does she wrap his Christmas presents?' - code in 'Aga Sagas' for a proper relationship. Women like Joanna Trollope and Monica Porter may have lost sight of such minor but telling acts of love. They are so busy being sexy and independent I wonder what they do on Sunday nights. For it is on this night of the week that I miss my deceased partner most. It wasn't so much the nights we were out at parties - I can manage those on my own perfectly well, thank you - but the companionable evenings in, when we would cook supper and watch an undemanding TV programme together. It was very cosy  and comforting. Companionship is the name of the game as we age and all my friends who have lost partners tell me that it is this they miss most. Could I enjoy such intimacy with someone if I knew he had other options the following night? I don't think so. There have been such dramatic changes in the lives of older women recently. A decade ago, women in their 60s and  70s spent their time at the bridge table and on the golf course. Now a great number of us continue to work. Attitudes to sex have also changed beyond all recognition: the bedroom is not just a place to sleep, but just as much of  a playground as it was before children came along. But equally we lose sight of  the important things in life at our peril. What baby boomers like Porter and Trollope have not worked out is how they want to spend their fourth age. When they become frail, will they still be content with no-strings relationships? The final leg of our journey still needs to be travelled. But who with? The young man from the gym or the contemporary who shares the same jokes, the same language and who will pick you up when you fall?","Joanna Trollope has been with toy boy Jason Kouchak for over a decade .

"By . Emma Innes . A former smoker is demanding the Government puts her picture on cigarette packets as a health warning - after she had to have both her legs amputated because of her 20-a-day habit. Victoria Marks, 41, had her first cigarette when she was 13 and smoked heavily through her teens and twenties. The mother-of-four gave up ten years ago when she was 31, but by then had developed a rare and devastating form of thrombosis called Buerger’s disease. Victoria Marks, 41, had to have both of her legs amputated after developing a rare smoking-related form of thrombosis. The condition means her limbs are slowly starved of oxygen, causing the tissue to die . Mrs Marks (pictured marrying husband Scott in 2004) has Buerger's disease. It is feared she will eventually lose her arms as well as her legs . The condition slowly starved Mrs Marks’ limbs of blood, meaning both her legs had to be amputated - and her arms could be next. The former barmaid now has to use a wheelchair and is so desperate to spare others the same anguish that she wants to see photos of her ravaged body on the side of cigarette packets. Mrs Marks, who lives in Liskeard, Cornwall, with husband Scott, 42, and youngest daughter Beth, 11, said: ‘There needs to be more done to inform people of the dangers of smoking - and not just the major diseases, but the rare and life-changing ones too. ‘If anything, the government should put pictures of real people like me on the side of cigarette packets if they really want the message about smoking to hit home. ‘Young people would relate far more to stories like mine than they would to a picture of clogged up lungs.’ Ms Marks was 26 when she first suffered pain in her legs and swelling in her ankles but she put it down to long shifts and being on her feet all day behind the bar. Mrs Marks (pictured with husband, Scott) believes her condition was linked to her 20-a-day smoking habit. She started smoking when she was 13 and gave up when she was 31 . The pain got worse over the following years and she decided to get it checked out and, after months of tests, was diagnosed with Buerger’s disease. By May 2006, with Ms Marks in excruciating pain and unable to walk, medics decided to amputate her lower left leg. A week after the operation she developed an infection and doctors had to remove more of the limb above the knee. Buerger's disease causes inflammation of the blood vessels in the legs and arms. It leads to narrowing and blockage of the blood vessels so blood flow to the limbs is reduced. This initially causes pain but can eventually lead to tissue death. If the tissue dies, amputation can be required. The cause of Buerger's disease is not known but it is linked to smoking. The most important step a person can take to avoid the disease, or to stop it worsening, is to stop smoking. The disease is rare but it is more common in men than women. Treatment involves antibiotics for infections and taking painkillers. Surgery may be required to amputate dead tissue. Most people with the disease avoid amputation if they give up smoking when they are diagnosed. After coming to terms with her illness and learning to walk with a prosthetic limb, Mrs Marks started feeling similar pains in her right leg in December 2012. Her doctor called her an ambulance and within hours a consultant had broken the news that the tissue was dead and she risked gangrene if the limb wasn’t removed immediately. Surgeons amputated her leg above the knee the same day. Buerger’s disease causes chronic inflammation of the blood vessels, which narrows the arteries and eventually damages and kills tissue in the limbs. The cause is unknown but medics say the use of tobacco is a key factor and it normally only occurs in men aged over 45. Mrs Marks says that, like most people, she had not come across Buerger’s disease before her bombshell diagnosis. She said: ‘I’d never heard of the disease before and there wasn’t much information about it online. ‘It wasn’t until a year later that I discovered that the condition affected smokers and the best thing to do would be to quit the habit. ‘It was the push I needed to stop the addiction and I haven’t touched a single cigarette since. ‘But it was too late, the damage was done. I gave up smoking ten years ago but had my first amputation three years later. Mrs Marks (pictured with her daughter Beth in 2003) now wants a picture of her ravaged body to be put on cigarette packets to warn young people of the dangers of smoking . Mrs Marks now requires round-the-clock care and her husband has had to give up work to look after her . ‘I’m always on tenterhooks waiting for the day when I have to have my arms amputated too. Every little pain I feel in my arms, I worry and panic.’ Mrs Marks used to enjoy coastal walks and bike rides with her husband and Beth, and her older children Chris, 24, Charlotte, 22, and Jack, 20. Now a wheelchair user, she relies on Mr Marks as her round-the-clock carer and needs Beth to help with the cooking and housework. She has undergone 14 separate operations in the past decade but there is no known cure for her condition. Mrs Marks (pictured in 1999) now needs her 11-year-old daughter to help her with the cooking and cleaning . Mrs Marks has had 14 operations in the past decade but there is no known cure for her condition . She and her husband believe every . single consequence of smoking should be listed on cigarette packets - . not just the obvious illnesses like heart disease and lung cancer. Mrs Marks said: ‘I have no doubt that Buerger’s disease was caused by smoking. ‘By the age of 18 I was addicted and smoking 20 fags a day. I knew it was bad for me, but I kept telling myself that I would give up when I was older. ‘If I read and seen that smoking could lead to the amputation of my legs as a 13-year-old girl. I would have stopped there and then. Mrs Marks (pictured in 1997) is aware that there is worse to come as her condition continues to worsen . ‘At that age you are vain and you care more about the way you look than your health. ‘Putting more people like me on the cover of the cigarette packets will raise awareness of the dangers of putting a cigarette in your mouth.’ Mr Marks, who quit his job as a fireman to look after his wife, added: ‘We have got worse to come and it’s going to kill her eventually. ‘It’s been very difficult - she doesn’t get up much and she can’t get about. She can’t be a mother to her daughter.’","Victoria Marks, 41, has Buerger's disease which is linked to smoking .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Many people risk life and limb on a daily basis scrambling across pedestrian crossings before the traffic lights turn green. But a new technology means people will have longer to cross the road if there are large crowds. Pedestrian crossing sensors will be tested for the first time in the world in London, in a bid to make it easier and safer for people walking in the capital to cross the road. The new technology means that traffic signal timings can be adjusted automatically so that pedestrians can cross the road for a longer period of time if they are in large crowds (illustrated) The introduction of Pedestrian Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique, or 'Pedestrian SCOOT', is the first of its kind in the world. The system uses video camera technology to automatically detect how many pedestrians are waiting at crossings. It means that traffic signal timings can be adjusted automatically so that pedestrians can cross the road for a longer period of time when a large number of people are waiting. The idea is that vast numbers of people walking in quickly in opposite directions to beat the ‘red man’ will be less likely to crash into each other mid-way across the road. The first trials of Pedestrian SCOOT will take place outside Balham and Tooting Bec Underground stations in south west London this summer so that TfL can test the pedestrian sensors and how well they interact with other smart traffic control systems. SCOOT systems are is already used in traffic lights, to help control traffic congestion in London as well as other cities around the world, such as Beijing. The introduction of Pedestrian Split Cycle Offset Optimisation Technique, or 'Pedestrian SCOOT,' is the first of its kind in the world and uses video camera technology to automatically detect how many pedestrians are waiting at crossings . Commenting on the SCOOT technology, Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: ‘I am delighted that London is the first city in the world to be trialling this cutting-edge equipment, which will benefit pedestrians across the city. 'This really is a fantastic example of how London is leading the way by using 21st century technology to help make it easier for people to get around our great city. ‘Innovation like this is key to keeping London moving efficiently and making our roads safer for everyone to use.’ While Pedestrian SCOOT might be slightly annoying for impatient drivers, Transport for London (TfL) has revealed that it is developing a 'call cancel' technology. This will detect when a pedestrian who has pushed the crossing button has either crossed before the signal goes green or walks away and will therefore lets traffic continue uninterrupted. TfL has recently rolled out ‘pedestrian countdown’ technology across 200 locations in London that tell people who long they have left to cross the road, in a bid to prevent last minute dangerous dashes.","New pedestrian crossing sensors will be tested for the first time in the world in Balham, south west London this summer .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . In space, the lack of gravity can stretch an astronaut’s spine causing them to grow in height by as much as 3 inches (7cm). In an effort to prevent this, scientists have developed skin-tight spacesuits that mimic the force of gravity on the human body. Using designs by MIT, scientists at King's College London are refining the tight-fitting ‘skinsuits’ for testing in space to help astronauts overcome back problems. The Skinsuit is a tailor-made overall with a bi-directional weave specially designed to counteract the lack of gravity by squeezing the body from the shoulders to the feet with a similar force to that felt on Earth . The Skinsuit is woven in two directions to counteract the lack of gravity by squeezing the body from the shoulders to the feet. Current prototypes are made of spandex although new materials are being examined. ‘Getting the suit to fit correctly was challenging,’ said Simon Evetts, Medical Projects and Technology Unit team lead at the European Astronaut Centre. Floating in space, astronauts’ bodies adapt to weightlessness in ways that are not always wanted. Bone and muscle waste away as they have less work to do without gravity (left). On the right, the force the suit is producing is being  measured at the feet with a computer using force transducers in the soles of the footwear . Imagine that the vertebrae in the human back comes in the form a giant spring. Pushing down on the spring keeps it coiled tightly. When the force is released, the spring stretches out. In the same way, the spine elongates by up to three per cent while humans travel in space. There is less gravity pushing down on the vertebrae, so they can stretch out - up to 3inches (7cm). The process gradually reverses once astronaut's return to Earth. However, the process can cause  backache and a fourfold increased chance of slipping a disc. ‘We needed to create a suit that is both tight-fitting but comfortable to wear, while creating the right amount of force in the right places.’ Floating in space, astronauts’ bodies adapt to weightlessness in ways that are not always wanted. Bone and muscle waste away as they have less work to do without gravity. As a result, astronauts suffer from backache during their missions. Back on Earth an astronaut has four times more chance of suffering a slipped disc than usual. The issues are likely to pose an even greater challenge on longer missions such as journeys to Mars. Esa astronaut Andreas Mogensen will be the first to wear the suit in space during his mission in 2015. The Skinsuit has potential for use on Earth as well as for astronauts. ‘If the technology is effective in space, it could help the elderly and many people with lower-back problems on Earth, said Mr Evetts. ‘Additionally, Skinsuit technology could improve the support garments currently used for conditions like cerebral palsy.’ Students from Kings College London, UK, wearing the 'Skinsuit' as subjects for a test of how well the suits perform .","Lack of gravity can cause astronauts to grow by around 7cm (3 inches)

"By . Mark Prigg . Mercury is shrinking far more quickly that astronomers expected, it has been revealed. Detailed maps of Mercury's cliffs and ditches show the solar system's innermost and smallest planet Mercury has lost much more real estate due to cooling over four billion years than scientists thought. Cooling of Mercury's massive iron core has pared about nine miles from the planet's diameter, more than twice as much as previous estimates. New global imaging and topographic data from Nasa's Messenger craft that show the innermost planet has contracted far more than previous estimates. Mercury is the smallest and closest to the Sun of the eight planets in the Solar System, with an orbital period of about 88 Earth days. Unlike Earth, which as several plates of crust, Mercury has just one rigid, rocky layer which bears telltale cliffs and chasms caused by global contraction. 'When you look at the actual number, it's really pityingly small, compared to the size of a planet. 'But it doesn't need to change very much to have some effect,' said planetary scientist Paul Byrne, with the Carnegie Institution's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. Scientists studied more than 5,900 surface features, including cliff-like scarps and wrinkle ridges, to calculate how much Mercury has condensed. Unlike Earth, which as several plates of crust, Mercury has just one rigid, rocky layer which bears telltale cliffs and chasms caused by global contraction. The measurements, made with NASA's Mercury-orbiting Messenger spacecraft, match computer model predictions, which scientists use to determine the planet's inner composition, chemistry and structure. The results are based on a global study of more than 5,900 geological landforms, such as curving cliff-like scarps and wrinkle ridges, that have resulted from the planet's contraction as Mercury cooled. 'An awful lot of a planet's processes are driven by its heat loss - that's a primary thing that drives a planet's evolution,' Byrne said. 'We didn't set out to prove the models right, but it turns out this number is exactly what the models have been predicting for 40 years.' Digital Illustration of the Nine Planets of Our Solar System, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. researchers now say Mercury is shrinking faster than they expected. Previous maps of Mercury's surface map date back to the mid-1970s. NASA's Mariner 10 spacecraft made three flybys of the planet, imaging about 45 percent of its surface. That data indicated Mercury had lost 1.2 to 3 miles in diameter, a finding that clashed with scientists' heat dissipation models for the planet. In addition to learning more about how Mercury evolved, the discovery has implications for assessing the compositions of planets beyond the solar system. 'It may be that Mercury is an archetypal example of what a planet does and how it behaves as it has cooled in time,' Byrne said. The research is published in the journal Nature Geoscience.","Shrinkage due to cooling of Mercury's massive iron core .

"By . Ben Spencer . Smile and the world smiles with you, the old saying goes. And it may be more relevant than ever for the internet age. It is well known that good moods can be contagious, but researchers now think that happiness can even spread through the world wide web. American researchers studied social networking interactions over three years and found that positive messages spread through contacts. Researchers think that happiness can spread through the world wide web (illustrated). American researchers studied social networking interactions over three years and found that positive messages spread through contacts . They analysed more than a billion Facebook status updates, among more than 100 million users, and found that positive statements generated similar messages among friends. The researchers, from the University of California, analysed status updates on Facebook in the top 100 most populous cities in the US between January 2009 and March 2012, using automated text analysis. And they found that happy messages spread further than miserable ones. The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, examined posts by people in cities where it was raining - known to increase the number of negative posts and reduce the number of positive ones - and the impact this had on the status updates of people in cities where it was not raining. To make sure there was no ‘topic contagion’ all weather-related status updates were removed from the analysis. Each additional positive post generated an estimated 1.75 positive posts amongst friends while each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts. University of California researchers analysed status updates on Facebook (illustrated) in the top 100 most populous cities in the US between January 2009 and March 2012, using automated text analysis. They found that happy messages spread further than miserable ones . James Fowler, professor of political science at University of California, said: ‘Our study suggests that people are not just choosing other people like themselves to associate with but actually causing their friends’ emotional expressions to change. ‘We have enough power in this data set to show that emotional expressions spread online and also that positive expressions spread more than negative.’ He added that he believed the study probably under estimated how much emotion spreads through digital social media. ‘It is possible that emotional contagion online is even stronger than we were able to measure,’ he said. ‘For our analysis, to get away from measuring the effect of the rain itself, we had to exclude the effects of posts on friends who live in the same cities. ‘But we have a pretty good sense from other studies that people who live near each other have stronger relationships and influence each other even more. If we could measure those relationships, we would probably find even more contagion.’ Each positive Facebook post generated an estimated 1.75 positive posts amongst friends while each additional negative post yielded 1.29 more negative posts, the study found . The researchers said the findings raised the prospect of ‘greater spikes’ in global emotion in the future with the growth in online communication, causing volatility in all aspects of life from political systems to financial markets. It was possible that social media could be harnessed to create an ‘epidemic of well-being’, they suggested. ‘If an emotional change in one person spreads and causes a change in many, then we may be dramatically underestimating the effectiveness of efforts to improve mental and physical health,’ Prof Fowler said. ‘We should be doing everything we can to measure the effects of social networks and to learn how to magnify them so that we can create an epidemic of wellbeing.’ Twenty five years ago today, a . proposal was sent internally at a research company in Switzerland that . was about to change the world. Dubbed 'Information Management: A . proposal', the document was created by a 34-year-old computer scientist . called Tim Berners-Lee and was sent to his boss Mike Sendall. That . proposal, which Sendall described as 'vague but exciting' led to the . development of the World Wide Web and, ultimately, the internet as we . know it today. Sir Tim said: 'In March 1989 I wrote a . proposal for a universal linked information system that became the . world wide web. '25 years later, the web is a powerful enabler of . people, economic activity and democracy - so important that some have . argued that access to the web should be elevated to a human right.' Sir . Tim's vision for universality enabled the development of a . high-level network of content that allows any document to link to any . other documents.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . They share 97 per cent of our DNA, and have expressions and gestures that resemble our own. And this strange depiction of an orangutan nearly 300 years ago reveals just how similar early explorers thought the creatures were to us. The image was uncovered in a rare 1718 first edition of English explorer Daniel Beeckman's 'A Voyage to the and from the Island of Borneo'. The first ever depiction of an Orang Utang seen in the West has been uncovered in a rare 1718 first edition of explorer Daniel Beeckman's 'A Voyage to the and from the Island of Borneo' Captain Beeckman described the animals, known then as 'Oran Ootan', as having 'tolerable good faces and handsomer than some hottentots I have seen'. 'Hottentot' is today understood as an offensive racial term. Captain Beeckman, like the European immigrants who came up with the name, was referring to the Khoikhoi people of southwestern Africa. The term was coined by imitating of the sound of the people's language. The explorer sailed to Borneo in the 'Eagle Galley' in 1713 describing it as 'the greatest island of all the Indian seas.' He claims the orangutans are very nimble footed and able to throw stones and sticks at anyone who offended them. Captain Beeckman described the orangutans (left), known then as 'Oran Ootan', as having 'tolerable good faces and handsomer than some hottentots I have seen'. The comments were made in a rare 1718 first edition of 'A Voyage to the Island of Borneo' Orangutans are born with an ability to reason and think. This large, gentle red ape is one of humankind’s closest relatives, sharing 97 per cent of the same DNA. Orangutans have four fingers and an opposable thumb on their hands. Unlike us, their arms are twice as long as their legs. An adult orangutan's arms can be well over 6ft (2 metres) from fingertip to fingertip to help them swing from tree to tree. As . well as being strong, orangutans are long-lived and have an average . lifespan of 35-40 years in the wild and up to 50 years or more in . captivity. The native . Indonesian Dayaks' myth suggested that orangutans are people who hid in . the trees. The name ‘orangutan’ means ‘people of the forest’ in the . Dayak language. ‘The natives do really believe that these were formally men, but metamorphosed into beasts for their blasphemy,’ Captain Beeckman said. During his adventures, Captain Beeckman purchased a young orangutan which a fondness for alcohol. ‘I bought one out of curiosity for six Spanish dollars,’ he said. ‘It lived with me seven months. ‘I shall only tell you that he was a great thief and loved strong liquors; for it our backs were turned, he would be at the punch-bowl, and very often would open the brandy case, take out a bottle, drink plentifully, and put it very carefully into its place again. Captain Beeckman published the book in 1718 to try to advance his ideas on trade with the exotic land. In the 17th and 18th centuries, most authors had never seen an animal from the great ape species. Carl Linnaue, a Swedish naturalist and inventor of the internationally-accepted system of scientific naming of animals, famously got his facts wrong about orangutans. Captain Beeckman published the book in 1718 to try to advance his ideas on trade with the exotic. Pictured is a map of Borneo published in the book . In his ‘System of Nature’, published in 1758, Linnaue wrote the species believed the Earth was made for it, and that it will someday be master of it again. He describes the animals as ‘body white, walks erect, less than half our size. Hair white, frizzled. Eyes orbicular; iris and pupils golden. Vision lateral, nocturnal. Life-space twenty-five years…speaks in a hiss.’ Orangutans are born with an ability to reason and think. Today we know this large, gentle ape is one of humankind’s closest relatives. Orangutans have four fingers and an opposable thumb on their hands. Unlike us, their arms are twice as long as their legs, however. An adult orangutan's arms can be well over 6ft (2 metres) from fingertip to fingertip to help them swing from tree to tree.

"By . Victoria Woollaston . It doesn't take much to get the so-called Twitterati riled up. Every day Twitter users around the world are virtually guaranteed to get upset about a particular subject and take to the social network to voice their views. Researchers in China wanted to test how much influence these 'Twitter storms' have on public opinion - and whether this opinion can be easily swayed. They discovered that not only will a dominant view eventually take over, once public opinion has been set it is almost impossible to change. Chinese researchers downloaded 6 million tweets and filtered them based on topics. They concluded that public opinion evolves rapidly on Twitter before a dominant opinion takes over. Once this public opinion stablises, the researchers said it was hard to reverse . The research was carried out by Fei Xiong and Professor Yun Liu from Beijing Jiaotong University. They . downloaded around 6 million tweets and ran these tweets through a . computer algorithm to sort them into topics, including tweets about the iPhone 4, BlackBerry and iPad 2. Each tweet was then analysed to establish the underlying sentiments of the user, and whether these sentiments evolved over time. Xiong and Liu discovered that public . opinion on Twitter often evolves rapidly and levels off quickly into an . ordered state in which one opinion remains dominant. 'Once public opinion stabilises, it's difficult to change,' Xiong added. The research was carried out by Fei Xiong and Professor Yun Liu from Beijing Jiaotong University.

'Once public opinion stabilises, it's difficult to change,' he added. The public opinion for each topic fluctuated in the early stages of a Twitter discussion, as shown in this chart, before levelling off. Ultimately, the public opinion evolved into an ordered state with one dominant view . However, the work additionally revealed that when . dominant opinions emerge they tend not to achieve complete . consensus. In fact, Xiong said when Twitter users who hold minority . views are faced with overwhelming opposition, they are still unlikely . to change their opinions. This was bolstered by the fact Twitter . users overall are more likely to want to change the opinions of others . than to admit to changes of their own. The findings were published in the journal Chaos, and the tweets were all posted during the first six months of 2011. According to Xiong and Lui, these revelations could be used to shape how political candidates run their social media campaigns, or influence the way companies market their goods and services. 'By focusing on a network application, candidates or companies can analyse the characteristics and behaviour patterns of their supporters and protesters to explore whether the measures they take can influence public opinion and which opinion may succeed,' Xiong said.","Researchers downloaded 6 million tweets to get a random sampling of data .

"By . Mark Prigg . It began as a sketch on YouTube charting the plight of a Welshman trying to make it as a band manager in London. Initially funded by a redundancy payment by writer and star Jonny Owen, it became a viral hit. As plans to turn it into a film took shape, life began to imitate art - and just as the fictional band became a hit, the sketch has been turned into a film set to be released around the world. Scroll down to see the trailer . The film follow Dixie, left, and features cameos from music industry legends such as Alan McGee (right) The Premature Congratulations, the fictional band in the film. They were taught how to act like a band by Libertines frontman Carl Barat. Now the film received has its London premiere - and is tipped to become a summer smash after Hollywood giant Universal agreed to distribute it with Munro films. It began life in 2009, when Jonny Owen has made redundant from his job in Wales and decided to move to London. 'I had £4,000 in redundancy, so moved to London with big plans - and ran out of money 2 weeks later,' he told MailOnline. 'Me and Roger Evans (who plays Owen's best friend Horsey in the film) had an idea, about this Welsh guy who came to London, his best friend was a record company boss.' The pair filmed the sketch in Soho, and uploaded it to YouTube. After an article appearing in the Evening Standard newspaper in London, it began to spread online. 'Loads of industry people wanted to get involved, including Alan McGee, Carl Barat and Martin Freeman,' said Owen. The pair then created a series of six episodes on a shoestring budget. 'I got a call from Martin Root, who wanted to set up a film company to make it into as movie, and he raised the money to do that. The film follows manager Dixie (pictured) as he tries to propel his band to stardom . 'It was really a case of life imitating art - I was playing this guy knocking on doors in the film, and was doing the same in real life trying to get the film made.' The film soon attracted major interest, and British stars Vicky McClure and Martin Freeman agreed to appear in it. ‘A friend of mine told me about Svengali after about the third episode,' said Freeman. 'When he’d described it I was actually annoyed that I hadn’t been asked to do it. Jonny Owen, the writer of Svengali - who funded the initial YouTube series with a redundancy payment . 'I went home, watched the lot, and knew I was right to be annoyed. It was charming, sussed and very funny.’ Once completed, the film was picked up by Universal, and is set for release and download on the 21st - and has already been sold in France, with plans to release it in the US underway.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The exhaustive search operation for the MH370 has resumed this morning in much clearer weather, with air teams joined by both military and commercial ships as officials scramble to cover the 600,000 square-kilometre search area. Australia is leading a new and exhaustive operation some 2,500 kilometres (1,500 miles) south-west of Perth after American satellite imagery picked up two large objects – one up to 24 metres (78ft) in length – on the outer edge of the southern search corridor. Officials are preparing for the worst possible news, with several aviation experts now claiming the remote location of the debris would almost-certainly point to deliberate cockpit intervention, either by the pilots, the crew or passengers. Scroll down for video . Two pieces of wreckage that are possibly from the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 - one estimated to be 78ft in size - have been found to the west of Australia, it was announced today. Pictured: Satellite pictures released by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority of the object thought to be related to the search for MH370 . Australian Maritime Safety Authority Emergency Response Division General Manager John Young describes to media the satellite imagery of two objects possibly related to the search for Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 . Aviation expert Neil Hansford says he's confident that, whether it's an act of terrorism or activism, the disappearance of MH370 was well planned . Neil Hansford, chairman of Strategic Aviation Solutions, told Network 10 this morning that he was convinced that what had happened to MH370 wasn't an accident, and said the evidence pointed to the plane's crew being involved. 'I think it's been put there either by one of the crew or both, and they've picked an area where the aircraft won't be found,' Mr Hansford said. 'This was a crew-related incident. It wasn't a catastrophic explosion. It wasn't hit by military ordnance. '[The debris is] in about 10,000ft of water. In that part of the world there's currents. 'Whether it's terrorism or activism, it's certainly something that has been well structured and well planned.' Mr Hansford pointed to the amount of fuel likely on board the Boeing 777-200, at nearly full capacity with 31,000 gallons instead of the 45 per cent loading required to pilot a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, as being a strong indicator that MH370's disappearance was not accidental. He added that given the location of the debris, the plane very well could have headed for mainland Australia, blaming the co-ordination effort in Malaysia for the slow and frustrating search. Under the microscope: Investigators consider the possibility of deliberate intervention by the MH370 pilots, Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah (L) and Fariq Abdul Hamid . Royal Australian Air Force pilot, Flight Lieutenant Russell Adams steers the AP-3C Orion during the search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 . 'This aircraft has been positioned to where it is; it could as easily, more frighteningly, have been positioned to the centre of Australia,' Mr Hansford said. '[Malaysian investigators] have never had control of this incident from the time the passenger manifest was never checked against the stolen passport. 'We've only seriously been involved for really five for six days. We were all out looking in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand until they realised they didn't have a clue.' A statement from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said four planes had searched an area of 8,800 square miles (23,000 square kilometres) about 1,550 miles (2,500m) south-west of Perth without success. The area is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic – one of the most remote locations on the planet. An RAAF AP-3C Orion is one of the Australian aircraft scouring the new search zone in the southern Indian Ocean . The difficult search operation, led by military aircraft from Australia, New Zealand and the US, was hampered by poor visibility, challenging weather conditions and its proximity from land. But officials said the weather had cleared considerably this morning. It takes an Australian search plane, the RAAF Aurion P3, four hours to arrive at the debris search area from Pearce air base, and the aircraft can only spend two hours scouring the area before needing to return to Perth. Mr Hansford suggests the pilots on MH370 may have used this knowledge to their advantage and dropped the plane in a part of the ocean it would never be found. 'If I was trying to lose an aircraft, and make sure there was no evidence... you'd certainly be looking to put the aircraft it in very, very deep water a long way from land,' he said. 'In the end if it is in the area it's only going to be found by sonar and other maritime assets, not by aircraft assets. 'There's unlikely to be any naval ships in the area [for days]. You've almost been able to put it (MH370) in with little chance of anything floating up too quickly to be able to isolate the wreck.' Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced in Parliament on Thursday that new and credible information had come to light in the search for MH370 .","Aviation expert says the search area increases likelihood that MH370 pilots deliberately flew plane off course .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Gloves that work with touchscreens aren’t new, but they’re usually sold at a premium and have to be bought separately from your existing gloves. A new technology claims to solve this problem by letting you turn any pair of ordinary into touchscreen ones simply by painting the fingertips with a special liquid – it also has the potential to be used with prosthetic limbs. Called Nanotips, the liquid is made of conductive polyamide that soaks into the fabric and builds a conductive 'bridge' between your finger and the screen. Scroll down for video . Nanotips turns ordinary gloves, stock image pictured, into touchscreen ones using a special liquid made of conductive polyamide. The liquid soaks into a variety of fabrics and creates a conductive 'bridge' between a finger and a screen. A pack costs $20 (£12) and is set to go on sale Thursday, with international shipping . The liquid is made of conductive . polyamide that soaks into the fabric and builds a conductive ‘bridge’ between your finger and the screen. A patch needs to cover around 1sq . inch per fingertip to work, and the liquid dries in about a minute using . a blow dryer, for example. The . liquid needs to be completely dry before being used and the drying time . varies depending on the thickness of the glove, and the material. A blue version is specifically designed . to be used on fabrics and other porous materials, while the black . version is for more durable leather and rubber gloves. The liquid is clear - the colours relate to the packaging they are sold in. The system isn’t perfect, though, and the liquid will eventually wear off, and will need to be reapplied. Tony Yu, founder of Nanotips, said the patch needs to cover just  1sq inch per fingertip to work, and the liquid dries in about a minute using a blow dryer, for example. The liquid needs to be completely dry before being used and the drying time varies depending on the thickness of the glove, and the material. Yu, 23, from Vancouver, Canada, said: ‘I initially intended to use Nanotips with my motorcycle gloves as there wasn't a huge selection of touchscreen gloves on the market. ‘But I later realised the full potential of Nanotips and all the different applications it can be applied to. ‘So far all of the people we have demonstrated Nanotips to were amazed at how well it works. ‘A lot of people were sceptical at first but immediately changed their minds once they got to try it out themselves.’ A Nanotips pack costs $20 (£12) but can . be used on multiple gloves.

The system isn't perfect, though, and the liquid will eventually wear off, and will need to be reapplied . Tony said: ‘We don't just want to limit it to gloves as we discovered many prosthetic limbs are unable to interact with capacitive touchscreen devices. ‘Because touchscreen technology is such an integral part of our society, daily interactions for anyone with prosthetic hands becomes a challenge. We would like to expand in this field by testing Nanotips on a variety of prosthetics. ‘Our goal is to give people with prosthetic limbs the ability to easily interact with touchscreen devices.’","Nanotips turns ordinary gloves into touchscreen ones using special liquid .

And now, thanks to the people at CheapAir and Skyscanner, there's finally an answer. After analysing data from more than four million airline trips over the past year, US-based CheapAir has devised a scientific formula to help holidaymakers secure bargain prices. Happy holidays: Booking five weeks in advance is the optimal time for cheap flights, says the study . The answer is - domestic flights are at their cheapest 54 days before takeoff, which could save travellers up to £190. While the worst time to book a cheap flight is last minute - with the day before departure the most expensive. The next biggest mistake travellers make when looking to book cheap flights, is buying them too far in advance, according to the findings based on travel throughout the US. CheapAir said airlines usually open domestic flights for sale 331 days in advance, with fares in the first four months 'pretty steady, and pretty high'. The cheap flights formula advises . holidaymakers to book between 225 days and 104 before flying when prices . fall to within $10 (£6) of their lowest point. Prime booking window: The CheapAir research indicates booking flights between 29-104 days in advance . Flight prices continue to fall until reaching their cheapest at 54 days before takeoff, remaining to within $10 of their low until 29 days before departure, when they start to increase again. CheapAir said: 'We found that each . individual trip had an average of 92 fare changes between the time . fights opened for sale and the time they departed. 'For . domestic flights, the average difference between buying a ticket on the . best possible day to buy and the worst was $312 (£190). 'The . $312 difference between buying at the right time and the wrong time . drives home the point that the decision of when to buy really does make a . huge impact on what you end up paying.' Big savings: Skyscanner research shows US flights can cost up to £764 less by booking at a certain time . The . findings back research by travel comparison site Skyscanner today, . which says the ideal time to bag the best-price flights is about five . weeks in advance. For UK holidaymakers heading to . Cyprus, flights are at their cheapest four weeks before takeoff (saving . £251); for Croatia it's six weeks (saving £195); for Germany it's nine . weeks (saving £185); for Turkey it's 13 weeks (saving £256); and for the . States it's 21 weeks (saving £764). Skyscanner’s . Mary Porter said: 'We analysed three years’ worth of data, representing . 200 million searches, in order to be able to provide some clarity to . the question of when is the best time to book. Cheap flights: The most expensive plane trips are booked last minute, according to the findings . 'We found five weeks is the best time to book on average, however it is very much dependent on destination. 'Of course, many people will be more comfortable booking further in advance, especially as prices close to departure can be quite volatile. 'Therefore if customers really want to get the very best deal for them our advice would be not to stick to a rigid five week rule, but instead to research prices and track fares for that route by signing up for price alerts, allowing you to see when low fares become available.'","Book flights five weeks in advance to get cheapest price .

Called 'tendrils', these strings of matter may link together in an intricate pattern, according to research by the University of Western Australia. The universe is full of vast collections of galaxies that are arranged into an intricate web of clusters and nodes connected by long strings. These huge, empty regions are called voids, and for years, astronomers have been trying to understand the small population of galaxies that inhabit them. Using data from the Gama survey, Dr Alpaslan found that the small number of galaxies inside these voids are arranged in a way never seen before. ‘We found small strings composed of just a few galaxies penetrating into the voids, a completely new type of structure that we've called “tendrils”,’ said Dr Alpaslan. The simulations are perhaps the closet you will get to experiencing warp drive on Star Trek's Starship Enterprise . A sparkling arrangement: Here, a simulation of the cosmic web is pictured, showing clusters of galaxies and a void in the middle of the image, where Dr Alpaslan and team discovered tendrils of galaxies . The . universe is full of vast collections of galaxies that are arranged into . an intricate web of clusters and nodes connected by long strings. This . remarkably organised structure is often called the 'cosmic web', with . busy intersections of galaxies surrounding vast spaces, void of . anything visible to us on Earth. To discover tendrils, the Gama team created the largest ever galaxy census of the southern skies using observations from the Anglo-Australian Telescope in New South Wales, Australia. ‘Our new catalogue has looked deeper into space and mapped each patch of sky up to ten times to make sure it's as thorough as possible,’ said Dr Aaron Robotham from The University of Western Australia node of ICRAR. ‘We weren't sure what we'd find when we looked at voids in detail, but it was amazing to find so many of these tendrils lurking in regions that have previously been classified as empty,’ said Dr Robotham. The Gama team plan to catalogue more tendrils for further study as their detailed map of the universe expands. Computer simulations suggest that matter in the universe is distributed in a 'cosmic web' of filaments, as seen in the image above from a large-scale dark-matter simulation.

"By . Neil Ashton . Arsene Wenger claimed Jose Mourinho is an embarrassment to the game after a passionate defence of his record at Arsenal. The Gunners boss was speaking after seeing his side reach the FA Cup quarter-finals following a 2-1 win over Liverpool, courtesy of goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lukas Podolski. Wenger - furious with Mourinho’s claims that he is ‘a . specialist in failure’ - hit out at the Chelsea manager. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Wenger's post-match conference . Retort: Arsene Wenger told BT Sport 1 that Jose Mourinho's 'specialist in failure' comments were 'embarrassing for Chelsea' Advancing: Wenger saw his team beat Liverpool 2-1 at the Emirates . ‘Am I afraid of failure? He is a specialist in failure. I’m not. So if one supposes he’s right and I’m afraid of failure, it’s because I don’t fail many times. 'So maybe he’s right. I’m not used to failing. But the reality is he’s a specialist because, eight years without a piece of silverware, that’s failure. ‘If I did that in Chelsea I’d leave and not come back to London. I don’t fear anything in football.’ Wenger said: ‘I am embarrassed for him honestly. I am more disappointed for Chelsea than for me.’ Wenger had claimed on Friday morning that ‘fear of failure’ was the reason Barclays Premier League managers were ruling their teams out of the title race. That prompted Mourinho’s extraordinary . response on Friday and he stirred things up again on Saturday when he . claimed Wenger’s comments were unprovoked. ‘I don’t accept that one is . always Monsieur Polite and the other one is always the bad guy,’ he . said. The Arsenal manager also confirmed that disciplinary action would be taken against Olivier Giroud after he apologised for taking a female companion back to the team hotel. Limp: Chelsea were dumped out of the FA Cup by Manchester City after failing to register a shot on target . Married Giroud had consistently denied . taking a girl to the Four Seasons Hotel in Canary Wharf the night before . the 2-0 victory over Crystal Palace on February 2. Wenger added: ‘It is an internal matter but I do not want to comment publicly because I respect his privacy.’ Giroud . came on as a second half substitute for Arsenal yesterday and will face . Roberto Martinez’s side on the weekend of March 8. Denied: Howard Webb failed to give Liverpool a second penalty after Luis Suarez was clearly fouled . Reflecting on Sunday's win over . Liverpool, which tees up a home last-eight meeting with Everton, Wenger . added: 'I'm very proud of the way we responded to the huge defeat we had . last week, and that was the most pleasing thing. 'To win makes you stronger, and that was important today. 'The FA Cup is always interesting, and now we have another big tie here. It will be an interesting game.' Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers felt his . side were wrongly denied a certain penalty kick which could well have . changed the outcome of the game. Definite: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was second to the ball and brought down the Uruguayan striker . The visitors were awarded one penalty when Podolski tripped Luis Suarez and Steven Gerrard converted, but it was another incident in the area that became the focus of much of the post-match analysis. Referee Howard Webb ruled Oxlade-Chamberlain committed no foul when he went in hard on Suarez, although replays suggested otherwise. Suarez's amateur dramatics did him no favours, but Rodgers nevertheless felt there was only one decision. 'It was a blatant penalty. I don’t know why Howard didn’t give it but . maybe it came too close to the first penalty. It should have been an . easy decision,' Rodgers said. 'The . second one is clear. I'm not sure if it was just after [the first one . being awarded], but it was a clear penalty. Luis got a touch on the ball . and young Alex has taken him out. Bitterly disappointed: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers was angry that the penalty was not awarded . 'It was a strange decision. It was a penalty... and it was a clear one.' Reflecting on the game overall, Rodgers added: 'I thought the best team lost. The very least we deserved was a replay. 'We're disappointed with the goals, apart from that we were a threat, we played with real confidence and belief.'","Arsene Wenger hits back at Jose Mourinho's 'specialist in failure' comment .

"By . Ap . Russia and the United States exchanged threats Wednesday at a tense U.N. Security Council meeting over the Ukraine crisis, with Moscow's envoy warning that the U.S. ambassador's 'insults' are jeopardizing Moscow's willingness to cooperate with Washington on other diplomatic matters. It was the council's eighth meeting in less than three weeks on Ukraine, a show of determination by Western powers to highlight Russia's diplomatic isolation over the Crimean Peninsula — even if the council is powerless to act because of Moscow's veto power as a permanent council member. The meeting came as U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon left for Russia and Ukraine in a bid to seek a diplomatic way out of the crisis. Ban will meet with President Vladimir Putin and other Russian officials in Moscow on Thursday and travel to Kiev on Friday for talks with Ukraine's acting president and prime minister, the U.N. said. Scroll down for video . U.N. Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said 'It is simply unacceptable to listen to these insults addressed to our country' Land Grab: US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power says the US rejects 'Russia's military intervention and land grab in Crimea' 'Injustice': Churkin described Crimea's vote to join Russia as a 'historic injustice [that] has been righted' 'He's made clear we're at a crossroads and ... the focus must be to engage direct dialogue between Moscow and Kiev aimed at agreeing on specific measures that will pave the way towards a diplomatic solution,' U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said. At the council, Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin was once again alone in defending his country's actions in Crimea. He began his speech by celebrating the treaty signed a day earlier by Russian President Vladimir Putin declaring Crimea part of Russia, saying it honored the will of the Crimean people and complied with international law. 'Yesterday, something truly historic happened,' Churkin declared. 'A historic injustice has been righted.' Protest: Ukrainians across the world are protesting Russia's 'land grab' in Crimea . Celebration: Crimeans celebrating the annexation of Crimea to the Russian Federation . U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power said the United States rejects 'Russia's military intervention and land grab in Crimea.' She warned that the U.S. and its allies, who imposed sanctions on Russia two days ago, 'are prepared to take additional steps if Russian aggression or Russian provocations continue.' Power also compared Russia's takeover of Crimea to theft. ""A thief can steal property, but that does not confer the right of ownership on the thief,"" she said. The Russian ambassador shot back: 'It is simply unacceptable to listen to these insults addressed to our country.' He added, 'If the delegation of the United States of America expects our cooperation in the Security Council on other issues, then Mrs. Power must understand this quite clearly.' By then, Power had left the meeting to her deputy. Churkin did not elaborate. The United States and Russia are the key players in efforts to establish peace talks in Syria, and also are involved in talks over Iran's nuclear program. Aggression: Comparisons have been made between Russia and Nazi Germany over the annexation of Crimea . The council also heard a briefing from Ivan Simonovic, assistant U.N. secretary-general for human rights, who expressed particular concern over the security of Tatars and other ethnic minorities in Crimea. He highlighted the disappearance of a Crimean Tatar activist after participating in a March 3 protest. Simonovic said the activist was found dead March 16 and his body bore marks of 'mistreatment.' Simonovic announced that the United Nations is deploying a 34-member human rights monitoring mission to Ukraine, scheduled to be in place by Friday. He said he was not able visit Crimea because the authorities there refused to receive his mission or ensure its security until it was too late. But he said he spoke to representatives of displaced Tatars and victims of arbitrary arrests, torture and other human rights violations. Churkin dismissed Simonovic's assessment as 'one-sided.' He also blamed snipers — not Russian soldiers — for the killing of a Ukrainian soldier and an unarmed member of a local self-defense brigade in Crimea on Tuesday, saying the two were deliberately targeted to provoke confrontation.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A former public works inspector has admitted stealing $460,000 in parking meter quarters over more than two years. Thomas Rica, 43, pocketed more than 1.8 million coins from the collection room in Ridgewood Village Hall, New Jersey over 25 months. The Hawthorne resident was sacked from the Village of Ridgewood in January last year after being arrested for taking $500 in coins. However, a year-long investigation by Bergen County authorities revealed the father-of-three had swiped a much larger chunk of change.

Although he will avoid jail time, Rica must pay the village $200,000 in restitution comprising an initial lump sum payment, followed by $2,000 monthly payments over the course of his five-year probation, NorthJersey.com reported. Bergen County Prosecutorâ€™s Office has also dictated that Rica can never work for another municipality. Court appearance: Thomas Rica (pictured left with his attorney)  appeared before Superior Court Judge John Conte Wednesday morning in Hackensack to accept a plea deal . Patch reported in January 2013 that authorities began investigating Rica after an employee noticed coins were missing from the room.

Authorities said Rica, who had worked at Ridgewood since 2004, frequently went into the parking meter collection room and filled his pockets with change, before depositing the stolen coins in his bank account.

"By . Sara Malm . and Meghan Keneally . A close friend of L'Wren Scott has revealed that the 49-year-old fashion designer was planning to announce the closure . of her business today. According to fashion writer Cathy Horyn, Ms Scott committed suicide just two days before she was set to go public with the news that her . fashion label would be discontinued. Scott, who was also famous for being the girlfriend of Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, was found dead in her Manhattan apartment shortly after 10am on Monday. Friends: Fashion critic Cathy Horyn (right, with L'Wren Scott at an event in October) has written a moving tribute to her deceased friend, saying how there were warning signs that she was stressed about her business . Ms Horyn, the New York Times former fashion critic, writes that she did not find out about the designer's plans to close her business until after Ms Scott's death. In an article for the paper titled  'Memories of a Friend, a Teacher and a Fighter', Ms Horyn tells of how their friendship was tested when she adviced Ms Scott to give herself a deadline to sort her financial problems, or close the business for the sake of her health. Tribute: Fashion critic Cathy Horyn revealed Ms Scott's plans in a moving tribute to her friend . 'Two years ago, our friendship was tested when, after hearing her troubles, I told her she should give herself a time limit to resolve matters or get out. Putting her health in jeopardy because of stress was not worth it, I told her,' Ms Horyn wrote. Ms Scott did not like the advice and instead worked even harder on turning her business into a success, which saw her collaborate with Banana Republic. Ms Horyn explained that they communicated on close to a monthly basis since the fall, once with Ms Scott texting her about how a fitting in London was going very well- months before she cancelled her line's fashion show in the city. Accounts . for her business, filed in the UK in October 2013, show her company, LS . Fashion LTD, had a deficit of £3,546,000 with the designer owing . creditors £4,592,000. She told an interviewer around that time she felt the . financial pressure. ‘Every cheque, every penny, I have to be responsible . for because it’s my own money.’ Ms Horyn said that the subject of Ms Scott's health came up again in February when, after sending condolences following the death of Ms Horyn's partner, a conversation made it clear that Scott was stressed. She told Ms Scott that if she put the fashion line on hold, it would not be the end of her career, . 'You’re entrepreneurial — that’s your strength. You’ll have new ideas. Just give yourself a break now,' Ms Horyn recalled telling her. Former home base: Scott used to live in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles before selling the three-bedroom home (pictured) for $860,000 in 2009 . Memorable: Horyn wrote how she had Thanksgiving dinner in 2006 in Scott's walled-in backyard with Jagger and a group of The Rolling Stones . Their last communication- a text sent from Ms Horyn- went unexpectedly unanswered just three days before the suicide. 'Her death is inexplicable to me, and it makes me angry, too. Angry . because it’s the loss of a vital, intelligent woman, and angry because, . this once, I don’t want her to be a mystery to me,' Ms Horyn wrote. The tales of financial woe at the end . of a long friendship between the two women. Ms Horyn said that they met . in the 1990s but became close around 2000. She praised Mormon-raised . Scott for being warm, protective of young designers and caring when it . came to her friends, citing a moment last fall when she offered advice . in a time of need by texting Ms Horyn 'Dr Scott is on the line'. Ms . Horyn wrote of how Scott would host dinners in her Hollywood Hills . home, including a memorable outdoor Thanksgiving dinner with a number of . Jagger's bandmates and their significant others in the home's walled . garden. According to property records and real estate reports, Scott sold the three bedroom home in July 2009 for $860,000. 'I . can’t help thinking, now, that a huge part of L’Wren’s spirit, what . gave her grit and endurance, remained in the West. And without it, maybe . she was maybe was a little lost, a little less sure of herself,' Ms . Horyn wrote. Close: Ms Horyn wrote how Scott was very encouraging of young designers, protective of her friends, and private about her personal history, joking that Ms Horyn didn't know if she had been married once or twice before . GFlossy front: Despite a long line of famous fans, including Michelle Obama, L'Wren Scott's fashion line was a financial failure and she owed creditors nearly $6million . Although it was initially reported that she refused any financial help from Mick Jagger, her partner of 13 years, it appears the did help fill the gaps. Another source today told The Mirror that Jagger, who is worth around £200m, has 'always supported L'Wren financially up to the hilt'. The . friend added: ‘He knew she wasn’t a great businesswoman, but he had no . idea about the extent of the debts. But he always supported her, . financially and in other ways.’ Since he received the news of her . suicide, the 70-year-old Rolling Stone has not slept and is allegedly so . grief-stricken that he can barely speak. Jagger's . fellow Rolling Stones have today paid their tribute to L'Wren Scott as . they join his family in supporting him through his grief.

'I am . still struggling to understand how my lover and best friend could end . her life in this tragic way,' the Rolling Stones frontman wrote on his website in a heartbreaking post titled 'L'Wren'. 'We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves. 'She had great presence and her talent was much admired, not least by me.

"By . Associated Press . The Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday reversed the convictions of a former nurse accused of encouraging two people whom he met online to kill themselves. The court ruled that the language in the state's assisted-suicide law that pertains to 'encouraging' suicide is unconstitutional. However, it upheld the part of the law that bans 'assisting' suicide. Since a lower court judge did not rule on whether William Melchert-Dinkel 'assisted' in the suicides, the case was sent back to a lower court for more proceedings. Free: The Minnesota Supreme Court on Wednesday reversed the convictions of former nurse William Melchert-Dinkel accused of encouraging two people whom he met online to kill themselves . His 360-day jail sentence had been on hold pending the outcome of the appeal. Melchert-Dinkel, 51, was convicted on two counts of aiding suicide in the deaths of two people: Mark Drybrough, 32, of Coventry, England, who hanged himself in 2005; and Nadia Kajouji, 18, of Brampton, Ontario, who jumped into a frozen river in 2008. His attorney argued that he was exercising his right to free speech, and that the law - which states that anyone who 'intentionally advises, encourages, or assists another in taking the other's own life' is guilty of a crime - was too broad. In addition to his free speech claim, Melchert-Dinkel argued that he had no influence on either person's actions. But prosecutors say his speech wasn't protected and that he played an integral role in the deaths, including giving step-by-step instructions. Tragic: Melchert-Dinkel, 51, was convicted on two counts of aiding suicide in the deaths of two people including Nadia Kajouji, pictured, 18, of Brampton, Ontario, who jumped into a frozen river in 2008 . Death: Mark Drybrough, 32, of Coventry, England, was also encouraged to kill himself by the nurse, a jury found . Evidence showed that Melchert-Dinkel sought out depressed people online. When he found them, he posed as a suicidal female nurse, feigned compassion and offered instructions on how they could kill themselves. Melchert-Dinkel told police he did it for the 'thrill of the chase.' According to court documents, he acknowledged participating in online chats about suicide with up to 20 people and entering into fake suicide pacts with about 10, five of whom he believed killed themselves. An appeals court panel ruled in July 2012 that the state's assisted suicide law was constitutional, and that Melchert-Dinkel's speech was not protected by the First Amendment. But in a case involving members of the Final Exit Network, a different appeals court panel ruled that the state's law was unconstitutional when it comes to 'advising' or 'encouraging' suicide. The Florida-based group was accused of playing a role in the 2007 suicide of a Minnesota woman, but the case was put on hold while the Supreme Court considers Melchert-Dinkel's appeal.","The Minnesota Supreme Court reversed the convictions of William Melchert-Dinkel who was accused of encouraging two .
