Not only will a record-breaking 20 female senators make up the Senate, but Congress will have a bisexual member, a Buddhist, a Hindu and two female combat veterans for the first time in history. This modern face of Congress shows how it is finally taking a stride towards reflecting the country it is voted to represent - and it's a move the female senators are thrilled about. 'I can't tell you the joy that I feel in . my heart to look at these 20 gifted and talented women from two . different parties, different zip codes to fill this room,' Sen. Barbara . Mikulksi, D-Md., told ABC. Scroll down for video . Record breaking: Diane Sawyer (center) with the women of the Senate: Top row, left to right: Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Patty Murray (D-WA), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Kay Hagan (D-NC), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH). Bottom row, left to right: Susan Collins (R-ME), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mazie Hirono (D-HI), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Mary Landrieu (D-LA) 'In all of American history only 16 women had served. Now there are 20 . of us.' As well as making a collective record, . many of the women are making history in their own right, such as Senator . Deb Fischer, the first woman to be elected as a senator in Nebraska. The . 20 female senators are divided into four Republican and 16 are . Democrats, yet the women believe they are more willing to work together . than their male counterparts. 'What I find is with all due deference . to our male colleagues, that women's styles tend to be more . collaborative,' Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told Diane Sawyer. Diversity: Sen. Mazie Keiko Hinoro, left, is . sworn in on Thursday, making her the first Buddhist Senator in U.S. history. Right, Tulsi Gabbard, right, has become the first Hindu . congresswoman . The first of many: Deb Fischer, pictured beside her husband Bruce Fischer as she is sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday, is the first female senator in Nebraska . Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., added that . women have a camaraderie which helps with negotiations - something which she says the women are more successful at than the men. 'I think there's just a lot of . collaboration between the women senators and... advice and really . standing up for each other that you don't always see with the men,' she . said. Collins added that, just because the . women all get on, it does not mean that they share the same beliefs or . do not push for what is best for their constituents. 'I always push back the idea that there are women's . issues,' she said. 'Because every issue from war to taxes to education affect women . in this country. And that's why the point of having women be represented . on all committees and leading many of them is so important.' Standing strong: U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth is pictured on Thursday. She is an active duty veteran . Representation: Nancy Pelosi (front, 8th from R) poses with Democratic women of the House on Thursday . The 20 women elected to the Senate: . Republicans . Deb Fischer, Nebraska . Susan Collins, Maine . Kelly Ayotte, New Hampshire . Lisa Murkowski, Arkansas . Democrats . Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin . Mazie Hirono, Hawaii . Elizabeth Warren, Massachusetts . Barbara Mikulski, Maryland . Barbara Boxer, California . Maria Cantwell, Washington . Dianne Feinstein, California . Kirtsen Gillibrand, New York . Kay Hagan, North Carolina . Amy Klobuchar, Minnesota . Mary Landrieu, Louisiana . Claire McCaskill, Missouri . Patty Murray, Washington . Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire . Debbie Stabenow, Michigan . Heidi Heitkamp, North Dakota . But despite setting a new record, the women are still not satisfied there are enough of them and vow to fight for 30 per cent representation in the Senate. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., told Sawyer that women are still underrepresented in the Senate. 'I think that until we get to 50, we still have to fight because it's still a problem,' Boxer said. 'I think that because of this new class and the caliber of the people coming and the quality of the people coming, I think that hopefully in my lifetime - and I really do hope and pray this is the case - we will see 50 per cent.' But progress is also underway with religion, with Tulsi Gabbard becoming the first Hindu congresswoman and Mazie Hirono becoming the first Buddhist senator. Both are from Hawaii. It signals a move from a Congress where the question has long been which Christian denomination candidates are, rather than whether they identify with a religious group. Former Deputy Historian for the House of Representatives Fred Beuttler told ABC there was a notable nod towards religious plurality among the 110th Congress, which was elected in 2006. A Muslim, Keith Ellison, D-Minn., and two Buddhists, Hank Johnson, D-Ga., and Hirono from Hawaii, were elected to the House that year. He explained that 'the House is a very representative . institution by its design,' so as the country diversifies, 'you expect to see more religious diversity in the House'. And some newly-appointed congresswoman have seen this in action. 'Tulsi never ran as a Hindu or thought of the campaign in that way,' Gabbard campaign spokesman Jim McCoy told ABC. 'However, after her victory there was a huge outpouring of joy and elation from Hindus throughout America and even in India. So although Tulsi has never seen it as a ""victory for Hindus"", it's clear that Hindus in America now feel less marginalized than they had prior to her election.' But Gabbard is also proud to be representing another group - female combat veterans. 'While I understand all of the interest . about my being the first Hindu elected to Congress, I feel that of . greater importance is the fact that Tammy Duckworth and I will be the . first women combat veterans ever to serve in Congress in our country's . history,' she told ABC. 'Thousands . and thousands of women in our armed forces have given their lives and . made tremendous sacrifices, so to have the voice of women combat . veterans in Congress is a very important milestone.' Another new congresswoman, Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat from Arizona, has been described as an atheist, but said she simply sees herself as someone who is not part of a religious group. She attended Brigham Young University . but left the Mormon church after she graduated, explaining that, while . she has a huge respect for the faith, she doesn't believe in the tenets . they do. Sinema, and a . handful of other non-theists, offer representation to the one in five . Americans who say they have no religious affiliation, according to the . Pew Research Center. Girl talk: Diane Sawyer, left in the foreground, sat down with nearly all of the female Senators of the 113th Congress .

After nearly losing control of their space capsule, private outer space shipping firm SpaceX overcame mechanical difficulties and delivered over a ton of supplies to the eager inhabitants of the International Space Station. To NASA's relief, when the company's unmanned Dragon capsule pulled up to the space lab 250 miles about Ukraine, all its systems were in perfect order. However, the timing could have been a bit better. Coming a full day late, the linkup was the culmination of a two-day chase that got off to a shaky, almost dead-ending start. Moments after the Dragon reached orbit . Friday, a clogged pressure line or stuck valve prevented the release of . the solar panels and the crucial firing of small maneuvering rockets. Scroll down for video . High risk: The SpaceX company's Dragon capsule, here above sub-Saharan Africa, nearly failed to deliver over a ton of cargo for NASA . Nearly stood up: The capsule was scheduled to rendezvous with the International Space Station (pictured) Feb. 2, but was a day late . SpaceX flight controllers struggled for several hours before gaining control of the capsule and salvaging the mission. ""As they say, it's not where you start, but where you finish that counts,"" space station commander Kevin Ford said after capturing the Dragon, ""and you guys really finished this one on the mark."" He added: ""We've got lots of science on there to bring aboard and get done. So congratulations to all of you."" Among the items on board: 640 seeds of a . flowering weed used for research, mouse stem cells, food and clothes for . the six men on board the space station, trash bags, computer equipment, . air purifiers, spacewalking tools and batteries. Helping hand: The 'Canada Arm' reached out to grab the rogue capsule, which had suffered temporary failure of its solar panels . The company also tucked away apples and other fresh treats from an employee's family orchard, a much appreciated infusion of fresh food for the six-person crew unable to drop by their local green market. The Dragon will remain at the space station for most of March before returning to Earth with science samples, empty food containers and old equipment. The California-based SpaceX run by billionaire Elon Musk has a $1.6 billion, contract with NASA to keep the station well stocked through 12 supply runs. This is the third time a Dragon has visited the space station. Sweet relief: NASA got sweet relief when the Dragon was finally plucked from space, and so will the men on board who'll be treated to fresh apples . The previous capsules had no trouble reaching their destination. Company officials promise a thorough investigation into what went wrong this time; if the maneuvering thrusters had not been activated, the capsule would have been lost. Ford said everything about Sunday's rendezvous ended up being ""fantastic."" ""There sure were some big smiles all around here,"" NASA's Mission Control replied from Houston. Proclaimed SpaceX on its web site: ""Happy Berth Day."" High priority: The capsule contained vital technology and lab equipment, over one ton of cargo all told . In a tweet following Friday's nerve-racking drama, Musk said, ""Just want to say thanks to @NASA for being the world's coolest customer. Looking forward to delivering the goods!"" Musk, who helped create PayPal, acknowledged Friday that the problem — the first ever for an orbiting Dragon — was ""frightening."" But he believed it was a one-time glitch and nothing so serious as to imperil future missions. Lofty ambitions: SpaceX launched the dragon (pictured) March 1 and hopes to start putting human beings into space by 2015 . The 41-year-old entrepreneur, who also runs the electric car maker Tesla, oversaw the entire operation from Hawthorne, Calif., home to SpaceX and the company's Mission Control. The Dragon's splashdown in the Pacific, off the Southern California coast, remains on schedule for March 25. NASA is counting on the commercial sector to supply the space station for the rest of this decade; it's supposed to keep running until at least 2020. Russia, Europe and Japan are doing their part, periodically launching their own cargo ships. But none of those craft can return items like the Dragon can; they burn up on re-entry. Russia also is providing rides for astronauts — the only game in town since the retirement of NASA's space shuttles in 2011. SpaceX, or more formally Space Exploration Technologies Corp., leads the commercial pack that is working toward launching astronauts in another few years. Musk said he can have people flying on a modified Dragon by 2015. NASA's shuttles used to be the main haulers for the space station. At the White House direction, the space agency opted out of the Earth-to-orbit transportation business in order to focus on deep space exploration.

Space probes have found a hitherto unknown third Van Allen radiation belt around Earth, which could help them understand how and when solar storms will wreak havoc on Earth. The Van Allen radiation belts are donut-shaped rings of so-called 'killer electrons' that encircle our planet. They can often swell dramatically in response to solar storms and other space weather, posing serious dangers to communications and GPS satellites, as well as humans in space. Scroll down for video . An artist's impression of the Van Allen belts: The Van Allen radiation belts are donut-shaped rings of so-called 'killer electrons' that encircle our planet, which often swell dramatically in response to space weather . It was previously believed there were two Van Allen belts, but particle detection instruments aboard twin probes launched last summer have revealed the existence of a third, transient radiation belt. Scientists were able to observe the formation of the third belt, which persisted for four weeks before a powerful interplanetary shock wave from the Sun annihilated it. 'After decades of studying the radiation belts, this was a completely new phenomenon,' said Harlan Spence of the University of New Hampshire, who is part of the team which operates the probes. 'With the Van Allen Probes' instruments we now have the ""eyes"" capable of seeing such remarkable phenomena. 'We look forward eagerly to the rest of the mission in order to establish how often such extreme radiation belt structures and dynamics may occur.' The Van Allen belts were the first major discovery of the Space Age. Data sent back from NASA's Pioneer 3 and Explorer IV spacecraft, both launched in 1958 and both carrying instruments built by James Van Allen, showed the presence of two distinct rings of high-energy electrons. At the time of their discovery, they were thought to be relatively stable structures, but subsequent observations have shown they are in fact dynamic and mysterious. A cutaway model of the radiation belts with the Van Allen probes flying through them: The radiation belts are two donut-shaped regions encircling Earth, containing high-energy particles, mostly electrons and ions . On August 30 last year, NASA launched the Radiation Belt Storm Probes mission, later renamed the Van Allen Probes mission, to learn more about the belts. They are known to be hazardous to satellites, astronauts and technological systems on Earth, so increasing our understanding of them is critical as societies become more reliant on space-based technology. A better understanding of belt formation, including the number of belts, will also help researchers refine their understanding of how and when solar storms can wreak havoc on Earth. The discovery of the third belt came somewhat serendipitously, however, as the instrument which spotted it, the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT), was turned on earlier than originally planned. 'It was a lucky decision,' Nasa said in a release. 'Shortly before REPT turned on, solar activity on the sun had sent energy toward Earth that caused the radiation belts to swell.' The data sent back to Earth from the REPT instruments during the month of September initially showed two Van Allen belts, as expected. But after a few days, the outer ring appeared to compress into an intense, tightly packed electron band and a third, less compact belt of electrons formed further out, creating a total of three rings. 'By the fifth day REPT was on, we could plot out our observations and watch the formation of a third radiation belt,' said Shri Kanekal, deputy mission scientist for the Van Allen Probes. 'We started wondering if there was something wrong with our instruments. We checked everything, but there was nothing wrong with them. The third belt persisted beautifully, day after day, week after week, for four weeks.' Energetic electron data gathered by the probes: It shows three discrete energy channels. The third belt region and second slot are highlighted, and exist until a coronal mass ejection destroys them on October 1 . Dan Baker of the University of Colorado at Boulder, whose lab designed and built REPT, added: 'It was so odd looking, I thought there must be something wrong with the instrument. 'But we saw things identically on each of the spacecraft. We had to come to the conclusion that this was real.' Harlan Spence, an astrophysicist at the University of New Hampshire, principal investigator for the Energetic Particle, Composition, and Thermal Plasma instrument suite, of which REPT is a part, said it was a eureka moment. 'We watched in amazement as the outer radiation belt disappeared rapidly, but not completely; a small sliver of very energetic electrons remained at its inner edge, which we dubbed the ""storage ring"",' he said. 'When the main outer electron belt reformed over subsequent days, it did so at a greater distance than where the storage ring was located, thus creating the transient, three-belt structure. 'The textbook was being rewritten right before our eyes.' Solar flare: On August 31 a giant prominence on the Sun erupted, sending out particles and a shock wave that traveled near Earth. This event may have been one of the causes of the third radiation belt . The middle 'storage ring' persisted as the belt furthest away from Earth began to decay away in the third week of September, until, finally, a powerful interplanetary shockwave traveling from the sun virtually annihilated both the storage ring and the rest of the outer belt. Scientists have known that the outer Van Allen belt can fluctuate wildly, at times swelling with charged particles before letting them slip away again, depending on space weather. However, this type of dynamic three-belt structure has never been seen before, or even theoretically considered. In the months since the storage belt and the outer belt virtually disappeared, the Van Allen radiation zones have re-formed into the originally expected two-belt structure. 'We have no idea how often this sort of thing happens,' said Professor Baker. 'This may occur fairly frequently but we didn't have the tools to see it.' He added: 'This is the first time we have had such high-resolution instruments look at time, space and energy together in the outer belt. 'Previous observations of the outer radiation belt only resolved it as a single blurry element. When we turned REPT on just two days after launch, a powerful electron acceleration event was already in progress, and we clearly saw the new belt and new slot between it and the outer belt.' Danger: The Van Allen belts known to be hazardous to satellites, astronauts and technological systems on Earth, so increasing understanding of them is critical as societies become more reliant on space-based technology . The Van Allen Probes are two identical spacecraft with a mission to map out the radiation belts, cataloguing the wide range of energies and particles, and tracking the zoo of magnetic waves that pulse through the area. The two probes, which are flying around Earth in an elliptical orbit, are able to send back observations for the first time from the heart of the two belts as each probe passes through. Each carries an identical set of five instrument suites that allow scientists to gather data on the belts in unprecedented detail. The information sent back by the twin, octagonal spacecraft will help researchers better understand how space weather affects near-Earth phenomena by interacting with, feeding and stripping away the Van Allen belts. A better understanding of belt formation, including the number of belts, will help researchers refine their understanding of how and when solar storms can wreak havoc on Earth. 'These events we've recorded are extraordinary and are already allowing us to refine and confirm our theories of belt dynamics in a way that will lead to predictability of their behavior,' said Professor Spence. '[That's] important for understanding space weather and ultimately for the safety of astronauts and spacecraft that operate within such a hazardous region of geospace.' The scientists detailed their findings in a paper published yesterday in the journal Science.","Van Allen belts are donuts of electrons and ions that encircle our planet .

Ann Romney has said that running for president was like their experience of serving in the Mormon church . Wife Ann compared the experience to the service that the Romneys have carried out within the Mormon church. ‘In our church, we’re used to serving . and you know, you can be in a very high position, but you recognize . you’re serving. And now all of a sudden, you’re released and you’re . nobody. And we’re used to that. It’s like we came and stepped forward to . serve. 'And you know, the other part of it . was an amazing thing, and it was really quite a lot of energy and a lot . of passion and a lot of - a lot of people around us and all of a sudden, . it was nothing,’ she said. ‘But the good news is we like each other,’ she joked. Sharing the next phase of their lives, the couple additionally took a moment to present their family's latest additions after becoming grandparents to 20 children on Valentine's Day. The couple cradled their son Craig's newborn twins before the cameras, one seen in a pink blanket and the other in blue. The Romney have kept a low profile since Mitt conceding defeat to President Barack Obama at the election in November.

Gracious in defeat: Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney, seen with wife Ann after conceding defeat to Barack Obama in November, has given his first interview since the election . Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, lost to President Obama by a margin of 332 to 206 electoral college votes. He spent the month after the failed White House bid in solitude at his beachfront mansion in La Jolla, near San Diego, reflecting upon the campaign. But almost four months on it is thought Romney is ready to return to public life and political debate. The former Republican nominee is also due to address the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington next month. He . is expected to receive a warm reception at the upcoming conference in . Prince George's County, Maryland, where he is due to deliver a speech on . the economy.

Romney aide has said the former Republican nominee would be taking the . opportunity to 'thank all his supporters and friends' following the 2012 . campaign. American Conservative Union chairman Al Cardenas has said of Romney's slot at the conference: 'We look forward to hearing Governor Romney's comments on the current state of affairs in America and the world, and his perspective on the future of the conservative movement.' Romney - who unlike other failed presidential candidates such as John McCain did not have a job in the Senate to go back to after the election - has taken up a seat on the board of Marriott hotels on a salary of $170,000. The former boss of hedge fund Bain Capital is also believed to be considering setting up an organization similar to the Clinton Global Initiative, established by former President Bill Clinton in 2005. Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin is also set to speak at the event next month, as is Romney's former running mate Paul Ryan.","The former presidential hopeful has likened the experience of running for president to a roller coaster ride .

Price: £39.99 / $63.00 (RRP) The Crysis games have always been known for their graphics and Crysis 3 is no different. Developed on the CryENGINE 3, Crysis 3 is visually stunning on the aging consoles, drawing every last drop of power from them. And thankfully, the beautiful settings and slick combat system are just about enough to distract gamers from the somewhat average storyline. Welcome to the jungle: Most of the levels look similar to the movie I Am Legend. Look closely enough, and you'll even see different animals running around . Crysis 3 takes place 20 years after Crysis 2. New York City has become an overgrown wasteland where nature has taken over. Dilapidated skyscrapers litter the land and dense foliage covers what is left of roads and pavements. Players take on the role of Prophet who wants retribution from the CELL Corporation. Whilst clinging to the remnants of his humanity he is flanked by his sidekick ‘Psycho’ who has been stripped of his Nanosuit and is struggling to adapt to his new found vulnerability. Their story is engaging if a little predictable in parts, and voice-acting is done well bar the few occasions where lips move to a different voice-over channel. Combat is slick and dynamic. Crysis 3 introduces the Tactical Bow to Prophet’s armoury alongside his Nanosuit. This lets you take out targets from a distance while staying cloaked. Fights are often carried out from far away with your tactical visor being used to tag enemies and objects of interest. Simply holding the visor's targeting reticule over an enemy brings up a host of information - from what weapons they are carrying, to the armour they are wearing. Different arrow types are readily available and easy to interchange. These range from explosive tips, useful to wipe out groups of grunts, to those that deliver a lethal electric shock - perfect for enemies unlucky enough to be wading through water. Similar to the earlier games, the Nanosuit allows you to cloak and engage an armour enhancement, both of which are subject to your energy bar that depletes the more intense your movements. There's no ability to activate 'Speed Mode' or 'Strength Mode' this time around, though. Still, combat remains very tactical. Enemies can be stealthily taken out, tight corners can be escaped, alien CEPH scared by de-cloaking right in front of them or you can run in wielding an impressive array of guns and alien weaponry. As players progress through the game, the Nanosuit can be upgraded with a variety of loadouts. Time for a change: As in the last two games, you can customise your . weapons to suit your gameplay style. A new addition is the bow, which . can be fitted with a range of tips - from explosive heads to those that . deliver an electric shock . Ammo capacity can be increased, the energy bar can made to deplete slower, and increased cloaking time are but just a few of the upgrades, all adding to a unique, enjoyable combat experience. A large part of this is down to the level design. Where Crysis 2 was largely criticised for being more linear than the original, Crysis 3 gets the balance just right most of the time. Levels are much more sandbox-like, and usually contain numerous ways to get to an objective. One level which sees you taking down a CELL dam is a particularly good example of this. Exploration is rewarded, too. Often venturing off the most obvious path rewards you with new weapons and modules you can use to upgrade your Nanosuit. Sadly, enemy AI can be hit and miss. They sometimes get stuck in the surroundings or run around like headless chickens when under fire. They also have a bizarre tendency to randomly launch grenades when searching an area. This game is extremely impressive visually, particularly on a high-powered PC. One of our testing units was running on an Nvidia 680GTX, which allowed the game to played at more than 30FPS on the highest settings. It is here where the gulf between console and PC graphics is at its largest. The somewhat blocky vistas on the console versions are replaced by intricately detailed panoramas, while up close, textures are eye-poppingly realistic. Open season: Crysis 3 represents a successful balancing act. Where gamers criticised Crysis 2 for being more linear, levels are now much larger and encourage exploration . This, coupled with superior lighting, draw distances and a host of Direct X 11 effects, means that to get the most from Crysis 3, it has to be played on PC. The game also boasts an impressive multiplayer, offering a good variety of maps and clever twists on the standard game modes. One such mode is Hunter that involves two cloaked hunters against a squad of troopers. Each killed trooper then switches sides and becomes a Hunter until there is one, scared, lonely trooper left. Crysis 3 is definitely worth getting hold of. The campaign is somewhat short but there’s plenty of excitement to be had with the multiplayer. Time to suit up. NOW WATCH THE LAUNCH TRAILER: .

A lorry driver who tipped the scales at 18.5 stone went on an extreme health-kick after he was told he was too fat to keep his driving licence. Bob Baker, 52, from Tilbury, Essex, drove for 12 hours a day and said the most exercise he got was popping into the local pub. On the road he would tuck into a fry-up so large that it covered two dinner plates and snacked on crisps and chocolate in his cab. In the evening, he tucked into takeaways and admits he could easily finish a case of lager. Mr Baker weighed 18.5st before the threat of losing his HGV licence motivated him to get fit . The father-of-two used to eat huge fry-ups for breakfast and snack on crisps and chocolate . 'I used to drive in Europe and would bring lack lots of cheap alcohol back home,' he told MailOnline. 'I would sometimes drink from one of those wine glasses that could take a whole bottle of wine.' But in February 2006, he faced losing his livelihood after he failed a compulsory medical examination at the age of 45 required to renew his HGV licence. 'The doctor told me I needed to bring my blood pressure down by September or I would lose my licence, but I didn't just want to pop pills,' he said. 'As soon as I was faced with not being able to pay the mortgage, everything changed for me.' The determined trucker, who had just started a new job as a driver for Tesco, started cycling to and from the depot every day - a round trip of 18 miles. He had to borrow his then 20-year-old son's bike as he didn't have one of his own. 'It was a simple decision, though it felt like it nearly killed me,' he said. 'The first day I cycled I had to get up at 3.30am to get in for a 5.30am shift as it took me an hour to cycle nine miles. 'Then I did a 12 and a half hour shift and cycling back it poured with rain. 'I remember lying in bed aching from my eyebrows to my ankles. But I wouldn't be beaten.' Before and after: The lorry driver lost five stone in just nine months and shrunk his waistline by 10inches . The father-of-two also overhauled his diet. He ditched bread, pizza and pasta and ate lean meat with plenty of vegetables instead. After six months, he decided to take up running, starting with short distances and took up kick-boxing. 'I enjoyed it as I could go for jogs by the Thames,' he said. In October 2006, he took part in a 45-mile bike ride from St James' Park in London to Eton College for the Prince's Trust. By nine months Bob had shed impressive five stone and lost 10inches from around his waist. 'One of the best moments of my life was being able to walk into a shop and buy a pair of 32 inch waist trousers,' he said. 'I had a 42 inch waist for as long as I could remember.' 'I looked and felt like a different person even some of my relatives did not recognise me. I felt great and looked thin. 'I then gave my self a challenge and took a biking holiday in Slovenian Alps. The views were breathtaking but the hills were big and challenging. One took me 50 minutes to get up.' What a difference: Mr Baker before he tackled his paunch (l) in 2006 and competing in a triathlon in 2011 (r) New challenge: Bob lost 9lbs on a nine-day training trip for the Clipper Venture Yacht Race . Then in 2010, Mr Baker got a personal trainer to help tone up his muscles. 'I had gone on holiday to Turkey with my wife Lilian and she said I looked like skin and bone,' he said. 'She prefers how I look now.' After completing a duathlon Mr Baker decided to tackle a triathlon at Eton Dorney in 2011. 'I had seen people doing them on TV but never thought I could do it,' he said. 'I had to get swimming lessons though as all I could do was doggy paddle,' he said. 'I know I'm too old to win anything but I'm happy as long as I don't come last.' His latest challenge will be taking part in the Clipper Venture Yacht Race this . summer. He plans to complete two legs of the round-the-world trip on a . racing yacht. He will sail 5,000miles from the west coast of America, . through the Panama Canal to New York and then travel a further . 3,750miles back to London. 'I've taken part in two training sessions and during my last nine-day trip I dropped nine pounds,' he said. 'You have to eat lots of carbs because you burn 6,000 calories a day working on the yacht. 'It's different as you are working in a team and I'm used to being on my own. They are mostly consultants, professors and engineers but we do get on. I like baking and bring along my home-made cakes, which boosts morale!' Mr Baker is fitter now (right) then he was 20 years ago (left). He still drives lorries but exercises every day . Today Mr Baker, who now works night shifts, is fighting fit. Each day he takes his two dogs for an hour and a half each day before heading to the gym or getting his wife to drop him 10km from home on her way to work. And his adventuring won't stop after he's sailed the high seas. Next, the Essex lorry driver wants to trek to the North Pole and take part in a six day race across the Sahara desert. 'I want to push my boundaries and see what I am capable of achieving,' he said. 'I want to really live my life to the full.'

It may have been a case of a lucky break, but when a grandmother asked Damien Hirst to sign her autograph book at a snooker match little did she know he would draw a sketch worth thousands. Now sports fan Sylvia King, 75, is reluctantly selling the autograph book which has been signed by dozens of star players, because of the valuable drawing. Over the last five years, the silver-haired pensioner has travelled the length and breadth of the country going to games and adding to her collection. Shark sketch: Damien Hirst's pen drawing is expected to fetch £5,000 at auction . Jaws-dropping: Artist Damien Hirst pictured in front of his famous work of a shark immersed in formaldehyde . This included an exhibition event last year at the Trafford Centre in Manchester, which the controversial artist attended in support of his friend, snooker player Ronnie O'Sullivan. The silver-haired pensioner asked Hirst to add his name to the likes of Steve Davis, Willie Thorne and Cliff Thorburn who had previously autographed her book. She was amazed when he quickly drew a sketch of a shark in Biro, which represented his famous work of art of a tiger shark immersed in formaldehyde. The keen snooker supporter is now selling the 'Hirst original' and the rest of the Winnie the Pooh-themed autograph book, because it would be too risky to rip the drawing out. The artwork is set to fetch up to £5,000 at auction. It is said the snooker player signatures, and those of some dart players, add 'about £10 to £15 to the value'. The grandmother, from Urmston, Lancashire, said she approached Hirst at last year's snooker event. Meeting the stars: Sylvia pictured with Steve Davis . Star quality: Sylvia with snooker player Peter Ebdon . In the frame: Sylvia with Irish professional player Ken Doherty . She said: 'I went to the ladies and while in there I met Coleen Nolan and got her signature. 'I came out and my partner, Howard, said Damien Hirst had just been interviewed on the stage. 'I grabbed my book again and made a bee-line for him. Dennis Taylor was on the stage with him. 'I waited for him to come off and just said to him 'Mr Hirst, is it possible for me to have your autograph?' 'He said 'certainly' and he wrote my name at the top of the page and he signed the bottom and I wondered why he left a gap in the middle and he started to doodle. 'It didn't take very long and I worked out very quickly what it was. 'I have had the book for five years and it is very nearly full. 'I am 75 and my children don't want it. I suppose the money would come in handy, maybe I'll go on a nice holiday.' Picture Pooh-fect: Sylvia King has been collecting autographs for the last five years in this book, which now also has the sketch by Damien Hirst . Bullseye: The valuable autograph book also contains a signature from darts player Eric Bristow . The book is being sold by Adam Partridge auctioneers of Macclesfield, Cheshire. Bill Forest, of Adam Partridge, said: 'We advised the vendor not to rip the Hirst page out and to leave it with the rest of the autographs because they give it some context. 'You can tell that the vendor has innocently come across Damien Hirst while out collecting autographs and has been very lucky. 'Also, she could easily have ripped the whole page the Hirst drawing is on as well. 'There are more than 30 signatures in the book although they don't add much value to it, maybe £10 to £15.' The 6ins by 5ins drawing has a pre-sale estimate of up to £2,000, but it could easily fetch £5,000.

The journalists were driving away from soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, when the men started chasing the car while journalists were filming. Video footage from a moving vehicle appears to show the soldiers break into a run, and keep pace with the car, while panicked journalists urge their driver: 'Keep driving. Keep driving, drive away.

Drive away, drive away!': The panicked instructions of journalists to their driver as they are chased . The clip has been released following revelations from U.S. security firm Mandiant that the People's Liberation Army's . Shanghai-based Unit 61398 is the most likely driving force behind hundreds, if not thousands of cyber attacks. It said a Shanghai office block is . linked to stolen technology blueprints, manufacturing processes, . clinical trial results, pricing documents, negotiation strategies and . other secret data from the U.S government and more than 100 aerospace, . communications and energy companies. More . alarmingly, it claims the unit, known as the Comment Crew, has also . made incursions into the computer networks that control oil pipelines, . power grids, water plants and other pieces of key state infrastructure. Hot pursuit: The American journalists were spotted by soldiers from the People's Liberation Army in Shanghai . Chinese soldiers chased the American journalists away from the scene on the streets of Shanghai . 'The nature of Unit 61398's work is considered by China to be a state secret,' Mandiant said in a report released in the United States. 'However, we believe it engages in harmful ""Computer Network Operations"". 'It . is time to acknowledge the threat is originating in China and we wanted . to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat that . threat effectively,' it said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry today dismissed the report as 'groundless' and said the government firmly opposed hacking. 'Source of attacks': Unit 61398 is located in Shanghai's Pudong district and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in English as well as computer programming and network operations, the report said . Ground zero: The building, used by the People's Liberation Army, is located on the outskirts of Shanghai . 'Hacking . attacks are transnational and anonymous. Determining their origins are . extremely difficult. We don't know how the evidence in this so-called . report can be tenable,' spokesman Hong Lei told a daily news briefing. 'Arbitrary criticism based on rudimentary data is irresponsible, unprofessional and not helpful in resolving the issue.' Hong cited a Chinese study which pointed to the United States as being behind hacking in China. 'Of the above mentioned Internet hacking attacks, attacks originating from the United States rank first.' China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to faxed questions about the report. Prolific: The unit, known as Comment Crew, is alleged to have stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as 2006 . Denial: The Chinese Foreign Ministry today dismissed the report as 'groundless' and said the government firmly opposed hacking . Unit . 61398 is located in Shanghai's Pudong district, China's financial and . banking hub and is staffed by perhaps thousands of people proficient in . English as well as computer programming and network operations, Mandiant . said in its report. The . unit had stolen 'hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 . organisations across a diverse set of industries beginning as early as . 2006', it said. Some 115 of the victims were located in the United States, with smaller numbers in Canada and Britain. The information stolen ranged from details on mergers and acquisitions to the emails of senior employees, the company said. Guarded: The company traced Unit 61398's presence on the Internet, including numeric web addresses within a block assigned to the PLA unit . Such is the fear of China's cyber weaponry, American companies have been warned not to do business with two of its leading technology firms because they pose a national security threat. The House Intelligence Committee said in a report in October that U.S. regulators should block mergers and acquisitions in the country by Huawei Technologies Ltd and ZTE Corp, which are among the world's leading suppliers of telecommunications gear and mobile phones. Two weeks earlier, the White House revealed that cyber attackers linked to the Chinese government attempted to hack into a computer system in the White House Military Office. While the official statement down played the attack, one report claimed that the hackers targeted the hardware which safeguards sensitive data like the nuclear launch codes. The . state-run Medicaid system in Utah was also hacked last year, prompting calls . for tightened security around any government health databases that . would be implemented in accordance with the Affordable Care Act. While attacks on state infrastructure poses the greatest risk, the effect cyber warfare in the private sector can also be catastrophic. In November 2011, the National Counterintelligence Committee released a report detailing the extent of damage done by Chinese and Russian hackers on various companies. One . example was that of a paint company called Valspar Corportation, which . had a number of its proprietary paint formulas stolen. The move cost the . company $20million. Foxconn, . a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer that produces products sold in . America including iPhones, was hacked in February by a group called . Swagg Security which then obtained and released the email and credit . card data for banking information for American companies including Apple . and Microsoft. Some experts said they doubted Chinese government denials. 'The . PLA plays a key role in China's multi-faceted security strategy, so it . makes sense that its resources would be used to facilitate economic . cyber espionage that helps the Chinese economy,' said Dmitri . Alperovitch, chief technology officer and co-founder of CrowdStrike, one . of Mandiant's competitors. Though . privately held and little known to the general public, Mandiant is one . of a handful of U.S. cyber-security companies that specialise in . attempting to detect, prevent and trace the most advanced hacking . attacks, instead of the garden-variety viruses and criminal intrusions . that befoul corporate networks on a daily basis. But . Mandiant does not promote its analysis in public and only rarely issues . topical papers about changes in techniques or behaviours. It . has never before given the apparent proper names of suspected hackers . or directly tied them to a military branch of the Chinese government, . giving the new report special resonance. The . company published details of the attack programmes and dummy websites . used to infiltrate U.S. companies, typically via deceptive emails. U.S. officials have complained in the past to China about sanctioned . trade-secret theft, but have had a limited public record to point to. Mandiant . said it knew the PLA would shift tactics and programmes in response to . its report, but concluded that the disclosure was worth it because of . the scale of the harm and the ability of China to issue denials in the . past and duck accountability. The . company traced Unit 61398's presence on the Internet - including . registration data for a question-and-answer session with a Chinese . professor and numeric Internet addresses within a block assigned to the . PLA unit - and concluded that it was a major contributor to operations . against the U.S. companies. Members . of Congress and intelligence authorities in the United States have . publicised the same general conclusions: that economic espionage is an . official mission of the PLA and other elements of the Chinese . government, and that hacking is a primary method. In . November 2011, the U.S. National Counterintelligence Executive publicly . decried China in particular as the biggest known thief of U.S. trade . secrets. The Mandiant report . comes a week after U.S. President Barack Obama issued a long-awaited . executive order aimed at getting the private owners of power plants and . other critical infrastructure to share data on attacks with officials . and to begin to follow consensus best practices on security. Both . U.S. Democrats and Republicans have said more powerful legislation is . needed, citing Chinese penetration not just of the largest companies but . of operations essential to a functioning country, including those . comprising the electric grid.","Footage shows journalists hounded by People's Liberation Army soldiers .

A man has become infected by a smallpox-like virus after coming into close contact with someone who had been recently vaccinated against the deadly disease. The infected 24-year-old from San Diego then passed the virus on to another man through sexual activity - a phenomenon known as tertiary transmission. Although smallpox has been eradicated across the world, members of the U.S military are vaccinated against it before being deployed, due to fears of bio-terrorism. The vaccinia virus (pictured) causes cowpox, which produces skin lesions in people. The condition is related to smallpox . They are injected with the vaccinia virus, which is a related form of the disease. But rather than being administered with a hypodermic needle, it is given using a two-pronged needle dipped into the vaccine solution. Because it is a live virus, the injection site remains contagious for a few weeks and should remain covered. The open wound can easily transfer . the vaccinia virus to other parts of the body or other people, so it is only safe to expose it once the scab that has formed over the injection site has fallen off. However, there have been more than 100 cases of transmission between vaccinated and unvaccinated people over the past decade. There have been reports of vaccination transmission through other forms of intimate contact, such as between mother and child and even at gyms. The vaccinia virus cannot cause smallpox, but causes a rash and fever and can be deadly if passed on to someone with a compromised immune system. Smallpox vaccines are administered using a two-pronged needle dipped the vaccine. The site must then be kept covered until the scab has fallen off . In the latest case, the 24-year-old man went . to hospital complaining of a rash, with sores on his lips and genital area. He had been in sexual contact with a man who had received the smallpox vaccination. His condition cleared up without complications, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, a second man was hospitalised after contracting the virus from sexual contact with the 24-year-old. He too had sores caused by the vaccinia virus. He was treated with immune globulin intravenous, which boosts the body's natural response in patients with compromised immune systems. After . treatment, the patient was discharged and his condition also cleared up . with no further complications. Dr Marc Siegel, from NYU Langone Medical Center in New York, said the virus the two men caught was a 'kissing cousin of smallpox'. 'It can be transmitted if you are not careful,' he added. The new report highlights the potential for the virus to be transmitted . through sexual contact and reinforces the need to keep the vaccination . wound covered, the agency said. The report was published in the March 1 issue of the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.","U.S military are vaccinated against smallpox before they are deployed abroad .

No, it’s an asteroid that will almost hit Earth – relatively speaking. Just before 7.30pm today, a 150ft wide chunk of space rock will whizz past us in the closest shave since records began. If it hit the planet, it could wipe out a city the size of London and do as much damage as 1,000 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima. Scroll down for video . Close shave: Although it will come uncomfortably close to the Earth, NASA said that 'no earth impact is possible' Nasa has stressed that ‘no Earth impact is possible’ – but scientists say there is a small chance that TV signals may be affected. The asteroid will cut through the orbit of some satellites used for weather forecasting and for satellite phones and television. Mobile phones won’t be affected as they rely on land-based masts and cables. Asteroid 2012 DA14 was discovered last year by a Spanish dentist turned amateur astronomer and has been closely tracked ever since. Hurtling through space at speeds of five miles a second, eight times as fast as a speeding bullet, it will come within 17,000 miles of Earth at 7.24pm tomorrow. Disturbance: This graphic depicts the trajectory of asteroid 2012 DA14 on Feb 15, 2013. This view looks down from above Earth's north pole and shows how the rock will hurtle past inside the ring of geo-stationary satellites . Approach: The trajectory of the asteroid as seen from horizontally from the Earth's equatorial plane. It will come within 17,000 miles of earth . Astronomy expert Daniel Brown, of Nottingham Trent University, said: ‘In astronomical terms, that’s very close.’ Too close to home: Picture shows the predicted orbit of asteroid 2012 DA 14 . Although the asteroid won’t be visible with the naked eye, it should be possible to see it with binoculars. Dr Brown recommends looking towards the north-east horizon around two hours after sunset. He added: ‘This will give us the ideal opportunity to learn more about asteroids.’ ‘If we want to protect ourselves from possible impacts in the future, we need to understand how we can manipulate them. ‘That wouldn’t be through the Hollywood option of blowing them out of the sky but by nudging them slightly out of the way. ‘We can also find out what sort of resources are in there.  There are at least two projects now talking about trying to mine asteroids for precious metals and rocket fuels.’ He added asteroids the size of 2012 DA14 race past the Earth around once in every 40 years – but there is only an impact every 100,000 to 200,000 years. ‘Humanity and civilisations have survived these over and over,’ he said. Celestial mining firm Deep Space Industries (DSI) has calculated that the massive asteroid,  could contain resources worth £125billion.

There were 2,016 confirmed cases of measles in England and Wales in 2012, the highest annual total since 1994 . Cases of measles are at a record high, health officials have warned. In 2012, there were 2,016 cases of the potentially deadly disease in babies, children and adults in England and Wales. This makes it the biggest outbreak since cases were first formally recorded almost 20 years ago. The total is more than six times that of 2002 - and almost 40 times higher than 1998, when just 56 cases were documented. With measles also rife in France, Italy and Spain, it is thought that some outbreaks were sparked by infections brought back from abroad by holidaymakers. Vaccination of toddlers is high but there is particular concern that the disease, which is spread through coughing and sneezing, is hitting teenagers who were not given the MMR jab as babies. This will include some whose parents feared the safety of the jab, following research by Dr Andrew Wakefield linking it to bowel problems and autism. This work has since been roundly discredited. There have also been small outbreaks in travelling communities. Health experts warned that measles can kill - and needs to be taken seriously. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation . at the Health Protection Agency, said: ‘Measles is often associated with . being a disease of the past and as a result people may be unaware that . it is a dangerous infection and can lead to death in severe cases. ‘Parents should ensure their children . are fully protected against measles, mumps and rubella (German measles) with two doses of the MMR vaccine. ‘Parents of unvaccinated children, as . well as older teenagers and adults who may have missed MMR vaccination, . should make an appointment with their GP to get vaccinated. ‘Measles continues to circulate in several European countries which are popular with holidaymakers.’ The UK, along with France, Italy, . Spain and Romania, accounted for 87 per cent of the 7,392 cases that . occurred in the EU last year. In Britain, there have been prolonged outbreaks in Merseyside, Surrey and Sussex. Between January 2012 and the end of . the January this year, there were 622 cases in and around Liverpool -and . around a third of these were admitted to hospital. Teenagers were most likely to be affected, while babies that were too young to be vaccinated made up the second biggest group. Lancashire is another measles hot . spot, with around 100 cases in the last year, including 28 cases in the . Morecambe Bay area in the past three to four weeks. Teenagers who were not vaccinated at the routine age are at particular risk of becoming exposed to the highly infectious viral illness (pictured) Most of these were centred on eight schools. Health officials there plan to write to the parents of 30,000 children aged five to 16 who haven’t been vaccinated. In addition, a leaflet about measles . has been written for travelling people, amid concerns about a rise in . cases in their communities. Measles is very contagious, with one . person who is ill able to infect more than 15 others, if they haven’t . been vaccinated or had the virus before. At the beginning, someone with measles can feel like they have a bad cold, with a fever, dry cough and red, or sore, eyes. A few days later, a red-brown spotty . rash appears. It usually starts behind the ears, then spreads around the . head and neck before covering the body. Potentially lethal complications . include pneumonia, hepatitis and swelling of the brain around one in . five who catch the bug will spend time in hospital. However, there have not been any deaths for several years.

Artist Steve Casino's bizarre paintings of celebrities on the side of monkey nuts are worth more than just peanuts after they become salt-after work. The inch-tall shells might look like a normal nut from the back but Mr Casino's works of art on the other side are leading to punters to shell out hundreds of pounds for them. Mr Casino has created nut versions of Alfred Hitchcock, James Brown, Johnny Cash, Frankenstein's monster and Johnny Rotten and Sid Vicious from the Sex Pistols. It's peanut's world: James Brown getting on the good foot . Live long and pistachio: Spock and Captain Kirk from the Star Trek . Time nut: Matt Smith's Doctor Who has regenerated as a peanut, and there's a peanut Dalek too . He has also made Dr Who, Wonder Woman, Andy Warhol, Spock from Star Trek, Batman, Elton John and Count Dracula on the inch-high legumes. Mr Casino makes the creations by sanding down the surface of a monkey nut and using a miniscule brush to painstakingly apply acrylic paint, a process that can take up to 10 hours. Arms, legs, and props are then created from wood, bamboo or dense foam and pushed into the shell to complete the models. Each finished design costs between 200 and 330 pounds to buy depending on how complex it is. Mr Casino, 46, a toy inventor from Ohio, U.S., said: 'One day I was eating peanuts and noticed one that was sort of shaped like me.

She is one of the world's most beautiful and recognisable women, so painting an accurate portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge will never be easy. But one woman has been praised for her 'warm' portrait of Kate - weeks after the official one was slammed by critics. Artist Norren Denzil, 47, was inspired to paint her own picture of the former Kate Middleton after the official portrait by Paul Emsley was branded 'rotten' and 'unflattering'. Praised: Norren Denzil has been praised for her 'warm' portrait of the Duchess of Cambridge - after the official one was slammed by critics . She spent three weeks perfecting her portrait of the princess, showing her looking relaxed and beaming warmly. And now Norren has grand plans to show her hard work to the Duchess. 'The official portrait is technically brilliant but I don't think it captures the true natural beauty and personality of the Duchess,' said Noreen, who lives in Moulton, near Newmarket, Suffolk. Inspiration: Norren was inspired to paint her own picture of Kate after the official portrait by Paul Emsley was branded 'rotten' and 'unflattering' and she is very proud of the result . 'She has a great deal of warmth, which is why she is so popular and I wanted to show that in a portrait of my own. 'I'm pleased with the result and I've had a lot of good feedback, saying that my picture makes her look much more human.' Perfection: She spent three weeks perfecting her portrait of the princess and critics have claimed it shows Kate looking relaxed and 'warm' Noreen, whose past pictures have been snapped up by the chief executive of advertising agency Saatchi, used a series of photos of Kate as inspiration for her portrait. In the final portrait she is shown dressed in a red suit which she wore on the Royal trip to Calgary in Canada. Lady in red: Kate is shown dressed in a red suit which she wore on the Royal trip to Calgary in Canada . Noreen now hopes to sell the portrait for £2,000, with the proceeds going to a charity of the Duchess's choosing. She said: 'I am going to contact Clarence House as I would like the Duchess to see the portrait and choose a charity for the money to be donated to.' In the past Noreen has also painted Princess Diana, Marlon Brando, Jack Nicholson, Daniel Craig, Bob Marley, Mick Jagger and Jimi Hendrix. Warmth: Norren believes that Kate has a great deal of warmth, which is what she wanted to show that in her portrait . When the first official portrait of . the Duchess of Cambridge was unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery in January it was greeted with a global eyebrow-raise you could . practically hear. Though . Kate herself, 31, said Paul Emsley's likeness of her was 'amazing' and . 'brilliant', and her husband Prince William told the artist it was . 'absolutely beautiful', critics dismissed it as unflattering, ageing and . even 'rotten'. Emsley even bit back at his critics, saying the aftermath of its unveiling . felt like a 'witch hunt', but that there is still 'nothing I would have . changed' about his painting. Critical: Paul Emsley's official portrait was met by much criticism, although both the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were impressed . Speaking to Hello! magazine, he said: . 'Some of the words written about it were so personal. I'd be inhuman if . I said it didn't affect me. When you take on commissions like this it . is hazardous and you expect a bit of flak, but I expected nothing like . the criticism I have received. I didn't expect it to go to the levels it . did. 'It felt like a bit . of a witch hunt and people who have not even seen my portrait joined in . with what quickly became a circus. The worst thing is it was not only . destructive to me, but particularly upsetting for my two daughters and . my wife.' Emsley said that the praise of the . Duke and Duchess meant more to him 'than anything else said or written', . but that he would urge people to visit the National Portrait Gallery . since he feels 'half the problem is that the portrait doesn't photograph . well'. According to the . gallery, the number of people visiting since the painting went on . display on 11 January has risen from 24,000 over that weekend, up from . 17,000 the week before. The .

A former star college quarterback accused of rape in a 'he-said she-said' sexual-assault case told jurors on Monday that he only had consensual sex with his accuser and didn't rape her. Jordan Johnson, 20, a sophomore at the University of Montana Grizzlies, was charged last Summer with having sexual intercourse without consent after his alleged victim contacted police six weeks after the incident. 'I don't think I had any intentions of a relationship,' Johnson told jurors in Missoula, Mont. Johnson, who took the stand on Monday, denies that he took advantage of his alleged victim . Johnson, who was soft spoken and demure while speaking to the court, detailed the extent of their relationship, including the nature of text messages they exchanged, which he says included innocuous questions about how she was doing and how her classes were going. Eventually, the two started seeing each other in person. 'She came to my dorm room and I came to her dorm room,' he told the court, reports ABC News. On the night of the alleged incident - February 4, 2012 - the woman invited Johnson to her room to watch a movie. In a police interrogation tape played for the jury on Thursday, Johnson said the two began kissing on the woman's bed, before things went further. 'If she had said stop or no, I would have stopped,' Johnson said during his interrogation. But shortly after the incident, Johnson's accuser texted a friend, saying she thought she might have been raped, and saying that she had said no, but that he wouldn't listen. Johnson told jurors that he had no intention of having a relationship with the alleged victim . In a Facebook conversation, however, she later told another friend that maybe she had wanted to have sex with him. Earlier in the case, his alleged victim, a 21-year-old student, had told the court how Johnson 'changed into a totally different person' before the incident. Taking the stand earlier this month, the alleged victim described how she at first enjoyed kissing Johnson, but repeatedly told him 'no' when he tried to take it further. 'He didn't say anything. He just changed – just changed into a totally different person,' she told jurors. Johnson then ordered her to turn onto her front, threatening: 'Turn over or I'll make you.' When the student refused, he flipped her over and raped her, she said. Johnson claims he had consensual sex with his accuser and didn't rape her . 'It hurt so bad, it hurt so bad,' the alleged victim said, breaking down in tears. In response to questions from both the prosecution and defense, the young woman, who hasn't been named, explained how the pair lay on her bed, kissed and even took each others tops off as her roommate played video games in the living room. But she told the seven-woman, five-man jury that she was very clear when she wanted things to stop. 'I gave him very clear instructions. I told him, ""No, not tonight."" I resisted with my arms, resisted with my knees ... I told him no,' she said. The woman told prosecutors that she had never been as afraid in her life as she was during the incident. She said she was in utter shock after the alleged rape took place, which is why she didn't call out to her roommate for help and drove Johnson home afterwards. Aggressive: The alleged victim of former University of Montana quarterback Jordan Johnson claims he 'changed' and forced her to have sex with him when she invited him to hers to watch a movie . 'You could have screamed for help,' Assistant Attorney General Joel Thompson said, according to Missoulian.com. 'Could have,' she agreed. 'You didn't,' he said. 'I . didn't. There's no real explanation other than I was terrified and in . shock. You know how when you have those dreams and you want to scream so . bad, but you can't? It was like that.' Towards the end of her . testimony, which was attended by Grizzlies football coach Mick Delaney . and former athletic director Jim O'Day, the woman accused Johnson of . having committed similar attacks against other women in the past. The trial in Missoula, has divided the local community where passions about Grizzly football run high. Prosecutor Adam Duerk said during . opening statements: 'He changed. His demeanor changed. He . became very aggressive and in her words ""it got very scary really . fast.""' However, Johnson's defense attorney Kirsten Pabst said the alleged victim 'participated' in the sex. Consensual: Jordan Johnson, center, pictured in a NCAA match against Cal Poly, says the sex was consensual . She told jurors: 'She participated. She continued. But the fact that he didn't give her a relationship . doesn't mean what happened that night was a crime.' The student was the first witness called by the prosecution. Duerk asked her: 'Did you in any way plan to have sex with him.' She replied: 'No'. When asked what her expectations were that night, the woman is heard to reply in a video broadcast by ABC News: 'I just wanted to get to know him. I didn't really hang out with him since a year prior. 'Just kind of get to know him again and see how school is going.' The case has played out against a backdrop of NCAA and federal investigation of the school athletic department and the manner in which . rape allegations are reported on campus, investigated by police, and . prosecuted by the Missoula County Attorney's Office. District Judge Karen Townsend . initially called 400 potential jurors for the high-profile case, such . was the difficulty in finding neutral jurors. Grizzlies: The Grizzlies football team, pictured, has been successful on the field. But this rape case has been played out against a backdrop of investigations of the school athletic department . An . affidavit supporting the rape charge said Johnson and the alleged . victim had known each other since 2010. Court . records show the woman texted her roommate: 'Omg... I think I might . have just gotten raped... he kept pushing and pushing and I said no but . he wouldn't listen... I just wanna cry... Omg what do I do!' Johnson says the woman flirted with him the day before and consented to sex the following night. Johnson was briefly suspended from the football team then reinstated when a civil no-contact order replaced the restraining order. Three . days after coach Robin Pflugrad welcomed Johnson back, Engstrom . announced he was not renewing the contracts of the coach and athletic . director Jim O'Day. Both were immediately relieved of their duties, without an explanation from Engstrom. Investigation: The University of Montana President, Royce Engstrom, ordered an outside investigation after two students reported being drugged and raped in December 2011 . The move came after a season when Montana advanced to the Football Championship Subdivision semifinal game. In December 2011, UM President Royce Engstrom ordered an outside investigation after . two students reported being drugged and raped. Former . Supreme Court Justice Diane Barz later said her investigation found . nine alleged rapes or sexual assaults involving students had occurred . between September 2010 and December 2011, including at least two that . hadn't been reported. One led to former Montana football player Beau Donaldson pleading guilty to rape and being sentenced to 10 years in prison. Engstrom . said in January the investigation 'indicated an association with . patterns of behavior from a small number of student-athletes.' 'We will not tolerate the tarnishing of the proud tradition of Grizzly athletics,' he said at the time. Barz . suggested training faculty and staff on how to handle and report sexual . assault allegations and rewriting student and student-athlete conduct . codes. Just weeks later, the university came . under more criticism after the dean of students notified a Saudi . national about sexual assault and rape allegations made against him. Coaches: Robin Pflugrad (left) and Jim O'Day (right) were relieved of their duties without an explanation from the university president . The student fled the country before the alleged victims could file a police report. The . Grizzlies have advanced to the national title game seven times since . 1995, winning twice. The team's success came even as players and former . players were arrested for drunken driving, assault and other charges. Last . April, the federal Department of Education announced it was . investigating a complaint alleging the university discriminated against . female students, faculty and staff by failing to address a sexually . hostile environmental caused by its failure to appropriately respond to . reports of sexual assault. Soon . after, the U.S. Justice Department announced its investigation into the . handling of rape investigations and prosecutions, and the school . announced in May the NCAA had been investigating its athletic programs . for undisclosed reasons.

Larry Flynt, who is celebrating the 25th anniversary of his landmark First Amendment court case this month, has revealed he uses a penile implant to have sex and continues to engage in open relationships at 70 years of age. The self-described ‘smut-peddler’ and the man behind the multi-million dollar Hustler empire, Flynt has been paralyzed from the waist down since being shot in 1978. He has been married to his fifth wife – and former nurse - Liz Berrios since 1998 and says the implant is a fact of life for him. Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt has revealed that he uses a penile implant to have sex . Larry Flynt and his fifth wife Liz Berrios, she is his former nurse and they've been married since 1998 . ‘Lots of men have them. There’s a little reservoir in the bottom part of your stomach, and you trigger it with a button inside your testicles that doesn’t show. Nothing shows,’ he told The Hollywood Reporter. Flynt also admitted that he has slept with other woman during his current marriage, just as he did during his four previous ones. 'I wouldn’t be in a relationship that wasn’t open,' he insists, although he says his current wife doesn’t share the same feelings. Flynt also admitted that he is estranged . from four of his five children, because he claims they just wanted his . money and weren’t prepared to show an interest in running his business. However he maintains a special place in his heart for his third wife Althea, who was bisexual and died of AIDS in 1987. 'Althea was the love of my life,' said Flynt. Outspoken Larry Flynt has described Hugh Heffner as 'boring' and said he would be willing to pay Jennifer Aniston up to $2m to pose nude for Hustler magazine . 'The love of my life': Althea Flynt whispers to her husband, Larry Flynt in their hotel room after court in 1988 . They met when the 17-year-old runaway started dancing in one of his . clubs. They married in 1976 and remained married until her death in . 1987. In the 1996 movie The People vs. Larry Flint, Althea was played by Courtney Love. With a business making profits of over $100 million a year, Flynt is pretty hands off with the magazine that put him on the map, but he said he would be willing to pay Jennifer Aniston $1 million to $2 million to pose naked. 'You’d sell a ton of magazines with her doing porn,' he said. Yet the porn king claims to have some morals and told the Reporter that he doesn’t enjoy the films of Quentin Tarantino because he find them too violent. It is a quarter of a century since Flynt’s historic victory in the Supreme Court which is now taught in law schools and was the subject of a 1996 movie starring Woody Harrelson as Flynt. In the late ’80s, televangelist Jerry Falwell sued Flynt for libel and the emotional distress caused by a Hustler cartoon that implied Falwell’s first sexual encounter was with his mother. He won in a lower court. But on Feb. 24, 1988, the Supreme Court deemed that if a public figure could receive damages for distress, any kind of satire or parody would be impossible. The case, Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, is now taught in law schools. The People Vs. Larry Flynt: In the 1996 movie Flynt was played by Woody Harrelson and Althea was played by Courtney Love . Larry Flynt claims his business empire makes in excess of $100m a year . Despite the heated case, Falwell and Flynt made amends soon afterwards and went on speaking engagements together. ‘I was sitting in my office and my secretary called me and said, “Reverend Jerry Falwell is in the lobby.” I said, “Send him in.” So he walked in the door and he held up both hands and said, ""I surrender!"" He sat down and we talked for about an hour, and then he asked me to go on a couple of speaking engagements with him, where we debated one another.' Flint was also relatively polite about his rival in porn Hugh Hefner. 'I like him; he is kind of boring, but he is a gentleman,' said Flynt. As well as his business, Flynt is also passionate about politics and is a Democrat. During the 2012 presidential election campaign, Flynt took out full-page ads - in The Washington Post and USA Today - that offered up to $1 million for details of the GOP nominee Mitt Romney's 'unreleased tax returns' and 'offshore assets.' Flynt (left) challenged Republican senate candidate Richard Mourdock (right) last year to prove that he has had conversations with God . Offer: The letter - which was posted on Flynt's website - asked Mourdock to 'be kind enough to verify [his] claim for a wondering nation' Flynt also made the headlines late . last year when he offered Republican senate candidate Richard Mourdock . $1million to prove he has had 'conversations with God.' The . bizarre challenge followed Mourdock's comment during a debate last . October that even when babies are conceived during 'that horrible . situation of rape, that is something that God intended to happen.' Flynt said in an open letter that among the evidence he would accept would be a 'verifiable transcript of [Mr Mourdock's] personal conversations with God; letters, email, text messages or videos from God.' 'I will accept for purposes . of this reward any verifiable transcript of your personal conversations . with God; letters, email, text messages or videos from God, or messages . addressed to you from God transmitted by any third party, including the . Republican National Committee or the Romney/Ryan campaign. Flynt is estranged from four of his five children because he claims they just wanted his money . Flynt says he is currently targeting a prominent unnamed member of Congress who he says is in the closet about their sexuality . 'I assume that you would not have made . this statement unless you had been authorized by God. 'No one who . believes in God would ever use the Almighty’s name in vain. That would . be blasphemy,' Mr Flynt wrote. 'I am eager to receive your proof and pay my . $1 million reward to you.' Also in 2012 Flynt offered $1 million to anyone with proof of 'an illicit sexual liaison' involving former Republican presidential candidate Rick Perry. Flynt told The Hollywood Reporter that he is currently targeting . another prominent member of Congress who he says is in the closet (he . declined to name him).

But to a young orphan called Joe, this 29-year-old nature reserve keeper has become the next best thing. The three-month-old pygmy elephant was pictured last week nuzzling his lifeless mother in a desperate attempt to revive her. Scroll down for video . Joe the baby pygmy elephant . Why won't you wake up, mummy? Joe was visibly distressed as he nuzzled his lifeless mother in a desperate attempt to revive her . His distress was so visible it moved wildlife officials to tears. The mother had become the latest victim of a mysterious spate of poisoning in the tropical rainforest of Malaysia, one of 14 now known to have died. Had Joe not been rescued he would almost certainly have stayed at his mother’s side until he starved to death. Frightened, thirsty and confused, he had lost weight and might have ingested poison through his mother’s milk. Despite 24-hour care in the nature reserve now looking after him, experts feared Joe could still die of a broken heart. Getting to know you: Little Joe and his keeper indulge in a bit of horseplay now that they have formed a remarkable bond . Bath time: Joe's new keeper Augustin seems to be enjoying it, but the elephant isn't so keen. Augustin said of the elephant that he 'has clear likes and dislikes' Feeding: Keepers have found a special formula of milk which caters to Joe's nutritional needs . Then he was introduced to Augustin David. Now, in a remarkable bond between man and beast, the keeper has become Joe’s surrogate mum. Like any parent, Augustin faces a gruelling schedule that requires feeding Joe every two hours, all through the night, with a particular mix of formula milk that the infant has a taste for. Playtime involves him running Joe around the compound at Lok Kawi zoo near Kota Kinabalu, which the little elephant loves; and persuading him to keep still for bathtime, which he loathes. ‘He has clear likes and dislikes,’ Augustin said. ‘He loves suckling people’s thumbs - just like a human baby, it calms him. But he doesn’t like showers, so we have to wash him in his pen. At the moment he is losing his baby skin so he likes to rub against anything because he’s itchy.' Bond: The keeper and the inmate have formed an unusually close relationship at the wildlife centre . Friendly: So far, Joe seems to be adapting fairly well to life among humans after his mother's death . Danger: But it is too soon to say for sure that the fun-loving elephant will survive his ordeal . He also loves attention. And when it’s not focused on him, he is not slow to let his adopted mother know. He kicks Augustin in the legs or . nudges up against him. ‘He’s active, playful and naughty,’ the keeper . said proudly. In any other circumstances, this would be simply a . delightful if rather bizarre partnership. At the moment, however, it is . still a fight for life. Dr . Diana Ramirez, the vet overseeing Joe’s recovery, told the Daily Mail: . ‘He is far from safety yet. It’s too soon to be sure that he will make . it – sometimes baby elephants can look OK and then die suddenly. ‘They . are very prone to colic and it can be fatal very quickly. Once he’s . past six or seven months, we can be more confident. But he clearly has a . strong will to survive.’ Chilling out: The elephant stretches in his new home as Augustin looks on at his protegé . Surrogate mum: Like any parent, Augustin faces a gruelling schedule that requires feeding Joe every two hours, all through the night, with a particular mix of formula milk that the infant has a taste for . About two-thirds of the world’s diminishing population of Borneo pygmy elephants can be found in Malaysia. Investigations are still being . carried out to discover what wiped out the 14 adult elephants, and . whether they were killed deliberately, by accidental contamination or . infection. Last week it was claimed that palm oil plantation workers . were responsible for poisoning the animals. Experts believe the elephants could have eaten toxic substances laid to keep away ‘pests’ from the highly lucrative crop.

All the animals that died still had their tusks and none bore gunshot wounds, indicating that poachers were not responsible. The future? If he pulls through, Joe is likely to stay at the 280-acre park for the rest of his life – rescued elephants often have difficulty adapting to life in the wild. He won’t be lonely.

A grieving father took lethal revenge on the ‘pure scum’ he wrongly blamed for his son’s death, an inquest heard yesterday. Roy Allison stabbed 36-year-old Duncan Bell to death and left a placard by his body declaring: ‘This drug dealer took my son, took our whole lives. I’ve just taken his.’ Mr Allison, who had suffered three months of torment following the drug death of his son, Roy Jr, then hanged himself. Torment: Roy Allison with his son Roy Jnr who died of en ecstasy overdose . Triple tragedy: Roy Allison Snr (left) killed Duncan Bell (right) who he blamed for selling drugs to his son . But the inquest heard that . 28-year-old Roy Jr, a cage-fighter, had provided some of the drugs he . shared with Mr Bell and another friend, Grant Maker, as they celebrated . his birthday last March. He died after overdosing on ecstasy, which they . all took. A coroner said his death was ‘a tragic misadventure’. Although Mr Bell . provided the ecstasy, no evidence was  produced to suggest that he was a . drug dealer and it is understood a police investigation found none. An inquest heard martial arts instructor Roy Jnr, left, had brought some of the drugs he took with friend Duncan Bell, right, who was later beaten and stabbed to death by his father . The triple tragedy was detailed at three consecutive inquests. Mr Bell’s mother Diane Bell and Roy Jr’s mother Mary Brunyee, who wears a . locket containing some of her son’s ashes, hugged each other after the . verdicts were announced. The court heard 65-year-old Mr Allison smashed Mr Bell’s skull before . stabbing him in the neck, chest and heart last July. His chilling . message was written on an  A4-size card placed near the body. He left an 11-page letter confessing to the murder, and asked his nephew . Jason to tell police to go to his home in Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, . where they would find Mr Bell’s body. That evening, he went to . Peterborough Crematorium, where he had buried his son’s ashes, and where . he had already had his own name inscribed on the headstone they would . share, and hanged himself from a ladder. In his letter, Mr Allison accused Mr Bell of being ‘one of the biggest . drug dealers in this area’ and insisted he caused his son’s death. Under a heading ‘Pure Scum’ it continued: ‘He will lose his life at my . hand. The law is the law but justice is another matter... I believe it . is right for me to rid this scum away from the community.’ Revenge: After he killed Mr Bell, Roy Snr went to Peterborough crematorium and took his own life . Peterborough coroner David Heming heard that in the weeks after Roy Jr’s . death, Mr Bell frequently visited Mr Allison. Detective Constable John . Cox, who investigated the deaths, told the inquest: ‘It’s possible that . Duncan may have mentioned something that took place that evening which . Roy Sr may have picked up on, and which directed him towards Duncan as . the person who provided the drugs which ultimately killed his son.’ Diane Bell, mother of Duncan Bell, who was killed by Roy Allison Snr . But Mr Maker told the inquest that Roy Jr had brought cocaine to the . gathering at Mr Allison’s house. Mr Bell had produced a gram of MDMA, a . highly concentrated form of ecstasy but ‘not an excessive amount’. Roy . Jr was ‘fully aware of what he was taking’, he said. Roy . Jnr’s friend Grant Maker, who was with him on the fatal night, told the . court from the witness box Roy himself had brought cocaine to the . gathering at the house he shared with his father. All three had drunk strong lager and rum while taking the . drugs and ‘having a good time’. 'Nobody . forced anyone to do anything,' he said. They were all grown men and had . all taken equal amounts of the drugs. It was 'not like a kiddy peer . pressure thing,' he said. 'It was a really nice evening. Not one bad thing.' Neither he nor Duncan had any concerns about Roy’s condition before they left in the early hours. Roy had sent a text to Grant saying he was sorry he couldn’t stay. 'Wish you didn’t go, bro,' it said, adding: 'Not done yet.' Next day, the super-fit martial arts instructor was found dead in his room. Neither he nor Mr Bell had any concerns about Roy Jr but next day the . martial arts instructor was found dead in his room. A post mortem . examination found alcohol, cannabis, cocaine and ‘a potentially fatal . amount of MDMA’ in his body. As well as the misadventure verdict on Roy Jr, Mr Heming recorded that . Mr Bell was unlawfully killed and that Mr Allison killed himself after . being ‘consumed by grief’. Outside court, Mrs Bell said she forgave Mr Allison and believed he . killed her son because he was ‘out of his mind’. Of her son, she added: . ‘He was not a drug dealer.

He was the art world’s king of bling – a man who devoted a lifetime to acquiring some of the most exceptional and bizarre works of gold and silver ever produced. Many of the items London dealer Michael Wellby bought were once so underrated they would have sold for little more than their value in precious metal. But times change. And yesterday historians were celebrating his gift to a museum of one of the most important collections of Renaissance and Baroque objects for more than a century. Precious: A group of German silver gilt cups of a stag by Elias Zorer (c.1605-10), an owl (c.1570), a ship model (c. 1620), a Dutch musketeer by Adriaen de Grebbe (c. 1600) and a bear (c. 1605-10) Director of the Ashmolean Museum Dr Christopher Brown (right) and Professor Timothy Wilson, The Keeper of the Ashmolean's Department of Western Art, discuss a silver gilt pitcher . His haul of nearly 500 items, valued together in the tens of millions, has been bequeathed to Oxford University’s Ashmolean museum. Among them are highly unusual works that were considered inferior or undesirable at the time he bought them, compared to more traditional or sought-after pieces. This month the spoils of his shrewd eye and travels around the continent will go on display before being housed in a permanent gallery, described as ‘a cabinet of wonders’. The collection, bequeathed after Mr Wellby’s death last year, was trumpeted as ‘the most important accession of objects of this sort to any UK museum’ since a bequest by Ferdinand Rothschild to the British Museum in 1898. Important donation: A German Serpentine ewer and basin with silver gilt mounts (c.1580) The blues: A lapis lazuli cup (pictured left) with jewelled and enamelled silver gilt mounts made with stone (c. 1560) and a bowl (right) with gold mounts from Prague (c. 1608) Admiration: A woman looks at a 'silver gilt ewer with enamelled royal arms of Portugal' that dates from around 1510 AD . Impressive: The collection of nearly 500 objects has been valued at tens of millions of pounds . Historically it spans more than 250 . years from the 1500s to 1700s. Aesthetically, however, it encompasses a . fascinating spectrum of style and craftsmanship, including works that . incorporate coconut shell, ostrich egg, ivory and mother of pearl. Such . items have come to be highly prized by wealthy collectors – but few of . his contemporaries appear to have had Mr Wellby’s unerring nose for a . bargain. According to . one friend, he was expert in securing under-priced items – but, the . friend added: ‘He bought a great many things simply because he liked . them, not because they were sought-after or fashionable.’ Mr . Wellby, who died aged 84, was driven by a passion for craftsmanship. He . joined the family silver-dealing business at 18 and built it into one . of the best known in Europe, with premises in Mayfair. His . private collection, acquired during more than six decades of travel and . trade, also reflected his fascination for exotic materials, especially . from the Africa and the East.

For more than half a century they shared the accolades as the greatest actors of their generation. They first appeared on stage together in 1935 and were once photographed chummily arm in arm. But behind the scenes, a poisonous rivalry appears to have soured  Alec Guinness’s view of Laurence Olivier. Party snub: Sir Alec Guinness's (with wife Merula in 1964) opinions of fellow actor Laurence Olivier have been revealed in his personal diaries, part of an archive acquired by the British Library . For privately, Sir Alec thought his fellow thespian cruel, unpleasant, destructive and pretentious. The deliciously un-luvvie spat was revealed in Guinness’s personal diaries, part of an archive acquired by the British Library. Although he praises Lord Olivier as ‘technically brilliant’ and ‘a total actor’, he adds: ‘He was always very conscious of the audience and his own powers over them.’ Arm in arm: Sir Guinness (right) branded Sir Olivier (left) 'unpleasant' in his diary despite sharing accolades as the greatest actors of their generation . Even on the day after Olivier’s death . in July 1989, Guinness apparently couldn’t bring himself to join the . public tributes unreservedly. In his diary, he branded Olivier . ‘unpleasant, possibly even vindictive’. Later . entries included snide observations about Olivier’s performances, . notably his ‘trick’ for making Shakespeare memorable by reading it like . ‘flashes of lightning’. ‘He would chose an obscure line and give it extraordinary emphasis,’ Sir Alec wrote. ‘His “I defy you, stars” in Romeo was memorable. And so was his “Poor naked wretches etc” in Lear. ‘But his famous howl in Oedipus I thought just tiresome.’ In a waspishly barbed compliment, Guinness pays homage to his fellow actor’s acknowledged mastery of production: ‘He knew every trick of the trade and used every one, including when he made his first entrance, the lights coming up a few points and going down again when he left.’ An indication that the venom and . cattiness was not simply one way came when Guinness recalled a clash in . 1983, when Olivier either failed or feigned not to recognise his wife at . a party. Guinness thought Olivier was joking at first when he asked her name. ‘Oh yes,’ Olivier had said. ‘Merula Salaman. Isn’t she some sort of relative of yours?’ Warpishly barbed compliment: Guinness (left) pays homage to Olivier's acknowledged mastery of production, writing: 'He knew every trick of the trade and used every one' Sour: Sir Alec Guinness (pictured in Our Man In Havana) described Sir Laurence Olivier as 'possibly vindictive' ‘My . wife for the last 45 years,’ Guinness replied. He duly records: ‘I . could see Joan Plowright [Lady Olivier] in the room, and, bitchily, I . couldn’t resist asking, “Is Joan here?” “Over there,” he said. “Do point . her out,” I said, and then moved away.’ Guinness’s 900 letters and more . than 100 volumes of diaries were compiled during a lifetime in acting. They . were bought recently from his family as part of an archive released . more than 12 years after the death of the actor, who won an Oscar for . his role in The Bridge On The River Kwai and went on to play spymaster . George Smiley in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy and Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star . Wars. Guinness once appeared in a photograph – not in the archive – that showed him arm in arm with Olivier, alongside fellow actor Sir Ralph Richardson. The trio posed for photographer Terence . Donovan in the 1980 portrait on condition that it was not published . until all three were dead. The archive also reveals Guinness to have . been deeply superstitious. Ambitious: Sir Laurence Olivier (pictured in Henry V in 1944) was said to have a cruel and destructive streak . He . describes having a misplaced premonition while serving as an officer in . the Royal Navy during the war that he would ‘die tomorrow’. In . 1983 he recorded his sorrow at the death of his friend Richardson – and . described an experience of feeling that someone invisible was helping . him on with his coat one day. ‘I . felt a shiver of fright, made the sign of the cross, and then . laughed... Because I thought it was the sort of thing Ralph might have . done,’ wrote Guinness. The archive will be open to researchers next year – alongside that of Olivier.

Stunned detectives suspect the gifts may have already been sold for as little as a few hundred pounds to buy drugs. Det Chief Insp Les Newman said he and his colleagues were ‘utterly disgusted’. Mr Newman, whose son visits the hospital every year for tests for a kidney problem, said some of the intended recipients may not see another Christmas. ‘This is a despicable crime committed by heartless individuals,’ he said. ‘I urge the thief to think about their actions and do the decent thing and return them. ‘I would like to think they had a heart, especially around this time of year. Despicable crime: Due to the location of the presents at the time of the theft it is feared they were taken by a member of staff . Helping hand: Employees from a London business deliver Christmas presents to the children's hospital . Toy service: London crewing company Pinnacle were among many businesses and members of the public who offered help in replacing the stolen presents . ‘For some of these kids, it could be their last Christmas. Anyone with kids will feel for this crime and if they have got a suspicion, I suspect they will contact us. ‘There is no honour among thieves and I think we are going to get a phone call telling us who it is. ‘Frankly, I am willing to launch a national manhunt to catch the person responsible. If it means putting their face on lorries and driving them around London, that is what we will do.’ Mr Newman has told his team of 12 officers, who specialise in thefts, robberies and burglaries, that the crime is their ‘No 1 priority’. Police believe the thief was caught on camera but face a substantial task because the presents went missing during a three-day window before the discovery on Monday afternoon. Well-wishers flooded the hospital with offers of cash and replacement gifts as news of the theft spread. Staff said they had been ‘overwhelmed’ with generous offers, with one adding: ‘There are some bad people out there but there are a lot more good ones.’ Heartbreaking: The presents, which were bought by the hospital's charity and were meant for children in intensive care, were stolen over the weekend . One nurse who has worked at the hospital for two years said: ‘It’s despicable. We could hardly believe it when we heard. Even if the thief didn’t realise the presents were for the children, they were clearly Christmas presents. ‘It must either have been someone who didn’t understand the significance of Christmas, or someone who just didn’t care. It’s heartless beyond belief.’ Lord Sugar, a long-time supporter, said he would foot the bill for more presents. Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, also donated gifts, while Celtic FC, Currys, PC World and Blockbuster offered to replace the DVD players and games consoles that were stolen. Relatives of patients said the theft was the ‘lowest of the low’. Det Chief Insp Les Newman speaks about the Great Ormond Street Hospital Christmas present robbery . Jessica Barnard, 29, told how her three-year-old daughter Rosie, who suffers from cerebral palsy, spent her first Christmas in hospital. She said: ‘The staff really make an effort and the children have pillow cases of toys on Christmas morning. It’s so good what they do and to think someone could do this, it’s disgusting.’ Pamela Clark, 71, added: ‘My granddaughter has been in and out the hospital for eight years so she’s spent many Christmases here. To take the kiddies’ presents, you can’t get much lower than that.’ Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe branded the theft ‘disgusting’. He said: ‘You can’t imagine anything worse in a way – children who are very ill and at Christmas. ‘Somebody’s taken the time to buy them something to cheer them up and somebody’s stolen them. It’s pretty awful.’ Revered care: The work of Great Ormond Street Hospital was honoured during the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games . A hospital spokesman said: ‘We can confirm there has been a theft and are fully co-operating with the police. We have been overwhelmed by generous offers from individuals and companies to replace the missing items. ‘These items have now been replaced by a long-term supporter. Thank you to everyone who has contacted us for their concern and kindness.’ Great Ormond Street Hospital was set up in 1852 and is celebrating its 160th anniversary. It treats 300,000 children every year, including many with rare and life-threatening illnesses. Its work was honoured during Danny Boyle’s Opening Ceremony at the London Olympics.

In what is best described as a labour of love, Jude Beard has delivered six of her own grandchildren. She also acted as the birthing partner for the other two when they were born by Caesarean section. Family ties: From left, Billy Herbert, 2, with mum Lisa Herbert, 28, Charlie Herbert, 4, Emily Herbert, 8, Amy Webber, 28, holding son Alex Hancock, 4, Jac Herbert, 10, Max Hancock, 5, Jude Beard, 49, holding Annie Owen, 4 mnths, Oliver Moir, 7 (Leigh Webber's son), and Leigh Webber, 30 . The 49-year-old qualified as a nurse in 2002 and became a midwife two years later. A coincidence of timing (plus a little gentle badgering of her bosses at the hospital where she works) allowed her to take charge of the deliveries. It is probably fair to say opinion among those about to give birth is divided between women who would love their mother to be present, and those who could think of nothing worse. But yesterday Jude surrounded herself with her family and declared: ‘The girls would have wanted me to be with them anyway, but this was much more special. ‘It’s important that an expectant mother has trust in their midwife, and it’s always easier if they have their mum with them too.

'I’ve been very lucky to be able to combine the two – on six occasions.’ The rewarding role of the midwife has been highlighted lately with the BBC1’s Call The Midwife drama, starring Miranda Hart. Jude’s twin daughters Amy Webber and Lisa Herbert, 28, are the proud mothers of the six children she delivered. Lisa was first to call on mum’s expertise to deliver Emily, the second of her four children. 2002: Jude Beard qualified as a nurse and assists during Caesarean section delivery of Jac Herbert, eldest son (now 10) of daughter of Lisa Herbert .

Mum-of-three Jude said: 'Births don't always go according to plan, but fortunately they were all nice, normal deliveries' Her first child Jac, now ten, was born after an emergency Caesarean as complications threatened them both. She was not expected to have her second child naturally – but Jude got the call to say she was in labour as she headed off to her first day at work at University Hospital of Wales, near the family home outside Cardiff. Jude said: ‘I rushed to be with her as a mum but she asked my supervisor if I could be her midwife. My boss said I could, so I did. My beautiful granddaughter was born without any complications.’ Granny knows best: Jude Beard with the six grandchildren she delivered herself - from left, Max Hancock, 6, Billy Herbert, 2, Emily Herbert, 8, Alex Hancock, 4 months, Annie Owen, 4 months - on Jude's lap -and Charlie Herbert, 4 . She added: ‘Births don’t always go according to plan, but fortunately they were all nice, normal deliveries. I was over the moon when I held Emily for the first time.’ When Amy became pregnant a couple of years later she also asked for her mum. Maternity staff gave her the go-ahead to help at the birth of grandson Max, now five. Jude has since gone on to deliver Lisa’s sons Charlie, four, and Billy, two, plus Amy’s son Alex, four, and baby daughter Annie – the newest addition to the close-knit family. Double act: Twin sisters Amy Webber, left, with her baby Alex Hancock, and Lisa Herbert with her baby Charlie Herbert, born seven weeks apart in 2008 . The only other grandchild she has not helped deliver is Oliver, the seven-year-old son of her eldest daughter Leigh Webber, 30. He was a Caesarean birth but Jude was on hand as a birthing partner. Amy said: ‘We’re all really close – we’ve always been more like sisters than mother and daughters.’ However, the arrival of baby Annie, now four months old, looks set to signal the end of Jude’s midwifery services.

While wartime prime minister, Winston Churchill, and Alexander Fleming, the inventor of penicillin, managed to get away with it, new NHS advice has revealed that those with less than lovely desks are much less likely to triumph in the workplace than their tidier counterparts. According to NHS life coach, Jayne Morris, a cluttered desk leads to a cluttered mind, meaning those who work in the midst of a mess are less likely to get things done - and will be less successful as a result. The same goes for anyone whose home or office is a disorganised mess - even if you've had a cleaning binge and stashed the clutter out of sight in the attic. Mess not success: According to NHS life coach, Jayne Morris, a messy desk can seriously hinder your career . While it might sound ridiculous, Morris might well be right. Microsoft boss, Bill Gates, is famously tidy, as are fellow tycoons, Richard Branson and Donald Trump. Morris said: 'Having an untidy desk covered in clutter could be stopping you achieving the business success you want.' The life coach, who claims to have worked with everyone from celebrities to major business figures, added: 'Clearing clutter from your desk has the power to transform your business. 'How? Because clutter in your outer environment is the physical manifestation of all the clutter going on inside of you. 'Clearing clutter has a ripple effect across your entire life, including your work.' Morris also said that women were more responsible for clutter than men because women are less likely to make room for themselves and have too many other commitments to tidy up. Among other recommendations, Morris says that simply tidying a desk at work and an overflowing filing cabinet will instantly have a positive impact on 'your internal world.' Untidy: Wartime prime minister Winston Churchill was notoriously messy but still enjoyed a successful career. Richard Branson, however, is both tidy AND successful . Anything that is no longer used should not be put into storage but thrown away completely. Keeping something in the loft, garage or other part of the house, does not help because it is still connected to the person 'by tiny energetic cords' she claims. She continued: 'The things in your life that are useful to you, that add value to your life, that serve a current purpose are charged with positive energy that replenishes you and enriches your life. 'But the things that you are holding on to that you don't really like, don't ever use and don't need anymore have the opposite effect on your energy. 'Things that no longer fit or serve you, drain your energy.'","NHS life coach Jayne Morris has worked with a veritable who's who of businessmen and celebrities .

Dotting the sphere were 300 Chanel flags representing each of the fashion house's boutiques around the world. Creative director Lagerfeld said 'the spirit of the show was Chanel's globalisation'. They've expanded around the world since the first boutique was opened in the Normandy seaside town of Deauville by the legendary Coco Chanel a century ago. But the show was surely also a celebration of the German-born designer. He celebrates three decades at the creative helm this year, during which he's overseen the transformation of the house into a truly global empire. Scroll down for video . Peek-a-boo!

Wintry: Hints of pink, purple and metallics featured in the predominantly black and grey collection . 'I can be very happy. When I started we had three or four (boutiques) 30 years ago,' said Lagerfeld. 'But it's not an ego trip.'' The show's 79 varied looks brimmed with ideas, classic and new, and showed that the designer is still a creative force to be reckoned with. Models, including Cara Delevingne and Stella Tennant, walked around the circular globe runway sporting stylish new winter concepts in tones of predominantly black, blue and grey with splashes of pink, purple and metallics. Biker chic: Thigh-high boots with chains, choker necklaces and black gloves featured in the Paris Fashion Week show .

Biker chic was also prevalent with chained over the knee boots, black gloves and furry helmet style hats. Numerous models also wore zip up leather leg sheaths - like leggings that start at the thigh and end at the ankle. Modern re-workings of some of Chanel's classic looks including the LBD and skirt-suits ensured the core clientele weren't left behind. The models' hair was kept simple and loose, at times chain choker necklaces were worn over long locks, while the make-up included glittery silver eyeliner.

Per year, around 1,000 meteorites weighing less than 100g are found, and about 100 less than 1kg. They described their find as 'special', and hope it could help explain how the solar system formed. 'To find something this large was very exciting for us - you can see it from very far away,' said Vinciane Debaille, a . geologist from Université Libre de Bruxelles, who led the Belgian team . during the expedition. 'That’s why we look for meteorites in Antarctica, because you can easily find the black spots on the white snow - but when it’s huge like that you can see it from 50m away or more.'

You might expect a fair bit of the food to end up smeared over the guests’ faces – or your floor. But that’s no reason to leave quail’s egg croustades off the menu, according to Pippa Middleton. In the Party Times, the online magazine of Middleton family business Party Pieces, editor Pippa has given her tips on how to organise a ‘fun’ first birthday celebration. Pippa Middleton's suggestion for quail's egg croustades is also included in her book Celebrate . She includes the recipe for the fiddly finger-food – garnished with Hollandaise sauce and pan-fried crispy pancetta – but helpfully recommends that ‘to keep expense down’ you should limit canapes to two per person. And her wisdom doesn’t end there. ‘Most of your guests will probably be crawling,’ the Duchess of Cambridge’s sister points out. ‘Create a baby-proof play zone with plenty of cushions.’ The 29-year-old has written a party planning book, Celebrate, which includes the very same recipe for croustades. She was recently appointed as a columnist for Waitrose Kitchen magazine. The April issue of Waitrose Kitchen will feature Pippa's first column . The magazine features the recipe alongside an advert for the book urging readers to ‘buy signed copies now!' It also suggests making your offspring’s first milestone memorable by decorating the room with balloons because ‘babies all love balloons!’ Miss Middleton also advises: ‘Play some nursery and party music in the background... Or peek-a-boo is always a winner.’ And the grown-ups are not forgotten, either: ‘Set chairs around the area for parents to relax and watch’. Doubtless none of this will whet the appetite of the shoppers who have flooded Waitrose’s Twitter and Facebook accounts with complaints after Pippa replaced Delia Smith, 71, whose cookery books have sold 21 million copies, as a columnist in the supermarket’s magazine. The first column by Pippa, will be published in the April edition of Waitrose Kitchen, on sale from the end of this month. The magazine’s editor has promised she will dispense sage advice on how to prepare a ‘Friday night feast’, and said her ‘wealth of experience’ will be ‘loved’ by readers. For the record, quail’s eggs are about a quarter of the size of hen’s eggs - and a dozen quail’s eggs costs £2.35 from Waitrose.","Pippa has given her tips for organising a fun celebration in The Party Times .

"By . Brian Viner . PUBLISHED: . 18:19 EST, 4 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:26 EST, 4 March 2013 . Off at university: Brian Viner does not want to know what his daughter Elly, pictured, gets up to during term time, let alone under his own roof . His name was Tom. He was bright, attractive, confident and likeable. Yet even if he had been an armed robber high on drugs, I could not have found his presence under my roof more unsettling. He was my teenage daughter’s first proper boyfriend, or at least the first that she had brought home. She had met him at a rugby tournament. He lived miles away. And he was staying the night. What does a father do? All I know is what I did. I greeted him warmly, and made a rather flamboyant point of picking up his overnight bag and inviting him to climb the stairs with me. My daughter Elly, just 17, watched us go, partly amused, but mostly horrified. I showed Tom, also 17, into the spare room. ‘This is where you’ll be sleeping, Tom,’ I said, holding his gaze for a few seconds longer than was comfortable for either of us. I didn’t want to deal with him like Harry Connick Jnr’s character in the film New In Town, who waves his daughter off to her first dance with a menacing warning for her escort: ‘Just remember, anything you do to her, I do to you.’ But I felt I had a firm message for him, all the same. Later, while Tom was playing cricket in the garden with my two sons — now that was more like it — Elly, my wife Jane and I held an emergency tripartite summit in the kitchen. Elly was indignant almost to the point of tears that I had consigned Tom to the spare room. I said that I would not countenance the idea of any other arrangement. Jane, the dove to my hawk, told her that she and Tom should do what teenagers have been doing for generations — and at least pretend to abide by the house rules. Family outing: Protective father Brian Viner, centre left, at a party with his daughter Elly, centre right . In other words, if he was going to pad across the landing in the dead of night, they should make sure that a) nobody heard, and b) he woke up where he was supposed to. That was my cue to be indignant. In my house? It was unspeakable. Later though, I realised, with a heavy heart, that my wife was right. If my daughter wanted to have sex, there was little I could do to stop her. I could erect as many barriers as I liked — and trust me, I would have put up barbed wire if I could — but she would have found a way around it. To this day, I’m not sure if she and Tom ever did the deed under my roof, but I like to cling to the faint hope that my stern look put them off. I’m not the only man to feel like this. Indeed, mothers are better at these things. For fathers, the thought of their teenage daughters having sex triggers the most visceral, primal feelings. After all, from prehistoric times the principle role of a father has been to offer protection, and there are endless examples in popular culture of fathers eyeing with deep suspicion, if not outright hostility, young men with designs on their daughters. Nothing is more likely to turn even a mild-mannered man homicidal than a threat to the physical or emotional well-being of his children, and rightly or wrongly, that threat includes sex. When meeting the heartthrobs from a boy band called the Jonas Brothers, even that supposed paragon of liberalism, President Obama, made a joke about wiping them from the face of the earth because his daughters were so enamoured with them. ‘Sasha and Malia are huge fans, but boys, don’t get any ideas,’ he said. ‘Two words for you. Predator drones. You will never see them coming.’ Doting father: Brian Viner with his daughter Elly as a toddler . In my home, in the absence of predator drones, a cricket bat might have done the job. But I didn’t want to kill Tom for transgressing the house rules, not least because I had no real proof that he did so. I’d shown him to the spare room, given him what I thought was a hard, meaningful look, then proceeded to bury my head in the sand and hope for the best. In fact, behaving like an ostrich is the closest I’ve ever come to the birds and the bees. I have never had a discussion with my daughter about sex, or with my sons, who are 17 and 14, come to that. Whatever they’ve learnt, it hasn’t been from me. Anyway, isn’t that what TV shows like The Inbetweeners — which shows a riot of teenage hormones in every episode — are for? It’s not, of course. Indeed, perish the thought. But it is certainly true that sex education rarely comes from parents any more. In my case, it never did. One of the most vivid memories I have of my own father, who died when I was 14, is of him changing the subject when, aged about 11, I asked him what a ‘Johnny bag’ (a phrase I’d heard at school) was. It was the perfect opportunity for him to explain the rudiments of contraception. Instead, he rebuked me for uttering a ‘very rude’ word, then said: ‘Now, I wonder what’s for lunch?’ I always hoped that I would be more relaxed and open about sex with my own children, but I’m not. To an extent, I’ve been let off the hook by the new school curriculum, which covers all of this and more. Even when they were at primary school, in rural Herefordshire, they were visited by a friendly nurse who talked frankly about sexual intercourse. The equivalent, when I was growing up in the early Seventies, was a film of a labrador having puppies. My attitude to my children having sex is clearly influenced by my own adolescence, which doubtless explains why I feel differently about my daughter losing her virginity, as opposed to my sons losing theirs. Elly is beautiful, vivacious and popular, and from the time she was about 15 I’ve known that at least some of the boys in her social circle must have harboured the same lascivious thoughts about her that I had for girls at the same age. Most of them I haven’t seen for 35 years, yet I can still name them all — Suzanne, Nicola, Mandy (oh God, Mandy) — and remember that I wanted more than anything to share a bed with them. Blissful ignorance: Brian Viner, centre left, at a party with his daughter Elly, centre right. He says he would rather not know the details of his daughter's love life . But if it’s my boys having those thoughts about the girls they know? Well, I want them to treat girls with respect, of course, but on the whole, good on them. They don’t have girlfriends at the moment, but if they did, I wouldn’t have a problem with them staying over, and can’t imagine I’d lose sleep over what they were getting up to under my roof. Call this hypocrisy, or double-standards, if you like. To me, it’s just part of the strange condition, universal yet unique, of fatherhood. And as I say, motherhood is different on this subject. At any rate, I’d consider it strange if a teenage girl confided more readily in her dad than her mum about sexual matters, which is no doubt why so many mothers are able to keep fathers blissfully in the dark about their daughter’s love lives. The protectors protected. I’m sure that Jane has shielded me from the realities of Elly’s romances, by talking to her about contraception and consoling her when boys didn’t call. Indeed, she only broke it to me a few months ago — with Elly now aged 19 and off at university — that our daughter is, indeed, sexually active. While, rationally, I’d suspected this must have been the case, a part of me was clinging onto the illusion that my little girl was still untouched by teenage boys’ sweaty paws. In the case of a friend of mine, this extended to his wife telling him that their daughter Annie, in her mid-teens, was spending every Saturday night at her friend Lily’s house. For more than a year, he assumed she and Lily had a really wonderful friendship. It wasn’t an outright lie. But what his wife knew and he still doesn’t is that Annie was sleeping with Lily’s older brother. Annie is 24 now, and Lily’s brother is history, but that particular cat is still not out of the bag. Perhaps for us, what’s also worrying is that we live in the middle of nowhere, where the convention is that parties, even for young teenagers, turn into sleepovers. When we moved from London to the countryside 11 years ago, we assured ourselves that we would be extending our children’s childhoods. In some ways, that proved to be the case. They carried on playing in the woods, climbing trees, making dens. But whatever they are doing at parties, they aren’t singing Ging Gang Goolie round a camp fire. Sometimes it’s best for dads not to know. Even when, heaven forbid, it might be happening under your own roof. The Good, The Dad and The Ugly: The Trials of Fatherhood by Brian Viner, will be published in May by Simon & Schuster.","Brian Viner was keen to show his daughter's boyfriend the spare room .

A newlywed mourning the death of her husband said she feels like she's 'jinxed' after he died from the same heart condition that previously killed her boyfriend. Karen Matthews, 31, from Bristol, found her husband Ryan, 36, face down on the sofa after she left him playing a computer game while she had a shower. He had suffered a catastrophic heart attack as a result of left ventricular hypertrophy - an enlargement of the muscle tissue that makes up the wall of the heart's main pumping chamber. A fit and healthy newly-wed husband Ryan Matthews (pictured on his wedding day) suddenly died as he played the computer game, Call of Duty. Incredibly Ryan Matthews, 36, was struck down by the same heart condition that killed a boyfriend of his wife, Karen (pictured), nine years previously . The same condition had claimed the life of Karen's previous long-term boyfriend, footballer James Gray, 24. He had been playing in a Somerset FA Challenge Cup match in Bath when he suddenly collapsed in 2003. Karen said: 'I think I must be the unluckiest woman alive. I definitely feel like I am jinxed. I am still living in disbelief. This does not seem like my life. it just seems crazy. It seems ridiculous that it could happen twice.' Karen, a senior meetings and events co-ordinator at The Bristol Hotel, had been dating James for for six years and had moved with him a week before he died. 'I must be the unluckiest woman alive... It seems ridiculous that it could happen twice' A year later she then met Ryan, a popular cyclist described as a 'real gentle giant who liked to keep fit' by his friends. After . tying the knot in August, Karen and Ryan had been married for less than . four months before his life was tragically cut short. Like James, he was fit and healthy but in a repeat of the previous tragedy, he died suddenly after suffering a heart seizure. Karen described the horror she felt at finding him collapsed in their living room. She said: 'That night he was fine and was playing on his Xbox. He had eaten his and most of my dinner because he was hungry. I got in a bath at around 8.30pm and after I finished, I shouted to say the bathroom was free. 'I think I must be the unluckiest woman alive. I . am still living in disbelief. This does not seem like my life. It seems ridiculous that it could happen twice,' said Ms Matthews ( pictured) 'I got no response so just thought he was engrossed in his game. I went downstairs and he was face down on the sofa. He was just lifeless and I rang 999 and was hysterical.' Karen ran to her neighbours for help but despite their, and then paramedics, attempts to revive him, he was declared dead at the scene. 'The ambulance service came and they tried to resuscitate him but in my heart I knew he was gone, but they were amazing and just kept on trying to save him,' Karen said. The death has shocked Ryan’s many friends and family who knew him as a fit and healthy young man, who as a broadband engineer for Virgin Media. 'He would go to the gym three or four times a week and would go bike riding,' said Karen. 'He was very fit and healthy and worked very hard so none of it makes any sense. I miss him terribly, the house is so quiet.' Left ventricular hypertrophy is an enlargement of the heart that can develop in response to factors such as high blood pressure. In Ryan's memory, his friends and family now hope to raise £8,000 for the British Heart Foundation with a sponsored Weymouth to Bristol bike ride.

On trial: Mark Lackenby (pictured outside Sheffield Crown Court) has been accused of murdering his newborn daughter Ruby after she collapsed at home and died the following day . A five-week-old baby girl died from a head injury allegedly caused by her father as he watched football on television, a court heard today. Mark Lackenby, from, Goldthorpe, Barnsley, has been charged with murdering his daughter, Ruby, after she collapsed at home and died the following day. Sheffield Crown Court heard tests revealed the baby suffered brain damage and bleeding around the brain. Doctors also discovered she had two broken ribs caused about a week earlier. Prosecutor Bryan Cox QC told a jury Lackenby, 32, was alone with the child while its mother, his partner Gemma Coates, had a bath upstairs. 'Mr Lackenby was alone with the girl watching football on television,' said Mr Cox. 'The prosecution case is that Mark Lackenby inflicted the injury that caused the sudden collapse that led to Ruby's death.' Rail worker Lackenby denies murdering Ruby and causing her grievous bodily harm with intent in the week before her death. Coates, 31, a former nursery worker, also from Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire, denies attempting to pervert the course of justice by giving a false account to medical staff as to how Ruby came about her injuries. Mr Cox said an ambulance was called to the defendants' home by Coates at 8.37pm on February 16, 2011. She said the baby was not breathing and her boyfriend was performing CPR. Ruby died 24 hours later at Sheffield Children's Hospital when her life support was removed. Investigations found Ruby was a perfectly normal baby with no health problems and there was nothing initially to explain her sudden collapse. But at post mortem a pathologist found bleeding around the surface of her brain and brain damage 'consistent with non-accidental head injury', according to Mr Cox. Examinations: Ruby died when her life support was removed, 24 hours after she was taken to Sheffield Children's Hospital (pictured) There was also evidence of an earlier assault when two broken ribs were found. This was dated by experts to about a week before the fatal incident and the prosecution said it was 'consistent with very forceful gripping.' Further bleeding around the brain which probably occurred at the time of the rib fractures was also discovered. Accused: Lackenby, from Goldthorpe, South Yorkshire denies murdering Ruby and causing her grievous bodily harm with intent in the week before her death . 'This bleed, together with the rib fractures, indicated an assault about seven days before death and before the assault that caused her death,' said Mr Cox. 'There were two separate independent episodes of violence.' The prosecution claim Lackenby was responsible for the broken ribs assault as 'it is inconceivable that two different people inflicted serious assault on Ruby within seven days.' It is alleged that Coates lied to doctors treating her daughter and later to the police. 'She changed her account as time progressed,' said Mr Cox. 'Her motive in not telling the truth was to protect Mark Lackenby.' Neither midwives, health visitors or the local GP expressed any concerns over Ruby's care before the tragedy and one professional said 'she seemed to be thriving.' Paramedic Andrew Dunn found Lackenby performing CPR on Ruby with Coates relaying instructions from the emergency operator on the phone. The baby was 'motionless and blue' and her eyes were fixed and she was not breathing. Coates told him the baby had awoken and stopped breathing five minutes earlier. She said the child had not fallen. No external bruises were found on the baby at hospital. The parents told doctors Ruby had taken her feed, slept then awoken crying at 8.30pm. The baby then went floppy in her arms and stopped breathing, according to Coates. She said there was no cough or fit and the baby's legs started shaking before she began CPR on the infant. But a day later she changed her account telling another doctor the baby awoke 45 minutes earlier. Scans at the Children's Hospital revealed the bleeding on the brain and damage to the brain itself. Further tests after death also showed five small bruises to the back of the skull and one bruise on top which were only visible internally. Hearing: Sheffield Crown Court (pictured) heard the baby suffered brain damage, bleeding around the brain and doctors also discovered she had two broken ribs caused about a week earlier . Pathologists dated the bleeding on the brain to having been caused 24 hours before death. In summary, the expert evidence, said Mr Cox, showed the broken ribs had been caused by 'squeezing or gripping with very significant force' and were non-accidental. Examination of the brain revealed extensive recent surface bleeding 'the most likely cause of this was a traumatic head injury,' he said. The trial continues.

A pub landlady who underwent a gastric bypass operation has become so thin she must eat a mountain of food every day to stay alive. A rare complication of the slimming surgery caused Julie Dunbar’s body to stop absorbing the nutrients it needs. In 12 months, her weight plummeted from 20st 7lbs to a skeletal 6st – and she ended up in hospital dangerously malnourished and close to death. Scroll down for video . Piling it high: Julie Dunbar has to eat 5,000 calories a day after weight loss surgery left her severely undernourished . Full-time job: Ms Dubar says her daily calorie requirement (pictured) means she is 'constantly eating' and spends at least £200 a week on food . Doctors told her the only solution was . to eat 5,000 calories a day – more than double the recommended daily . amount for women and far more than she ever used to eat – because her . body can ingest only a fraction of the nutrients she takes in. Her daily menu includes half a block . of cheese, a packet of smoked salmon, a packet of biscuits, nuts, fruit, . cake, a curry or shepherd’s pie for dinner and bags of sweets. Miss Dunbar, 51, of Leeds, West . Yorkshire, said: ‘It’s a full-time job. Our food bill is phenomenal. It . must cost about £200 to feed me a week. ‘It was enjoyable at first but now it’s a pain and I hate it. Even if I don’t feel like it I still really need to eat.’ Ms Dunbar, 51, decided to have weight loss surgery after her weight crept up to 20st 7lb . Malnourished: Ms Dunbar's weight plummeted to 6st after surgery and she had to be fed through a tube . In 2010, Miss Dunbar paid £10,000 to . have the biliopancreatic diversion with a duodenal switch operation at . the private Spire Hospital in Leeds. In this type of weight-loss surgery . a large part of the stomach is removed and the small intestine . re-routed. The object is to reduce the amount of time the body has to capture  calories and absorb fat. Following the operation, her weight dropped so quickly that her sister Karen, 50, was inspired to have the same procedure. But while the sister’s weight levelled . off at 10st, Miss Dunbar’s continued to drop at an alarming rate. She . said: ‘It was an absolutely awful time. In the pub, people looked at me . and thought, “She is not going to make it”. Then and now: She says she now eats far more than when she was overweight . ‘My face was like a skeleton and it was totally sunken in. There wasn’t an ounce of flesh on me.’ She was so malnourished she developed Wernicke Encephalopathy, . normally seen in alcoholics, people with HIV or those who have been . starved, leaving her with memory loss and balance problems. BREAKFAST: . Three cups of coffee with milk . Two egg omelette with 175g of cheese (around about half a block) Two yoghurts . Bowl of crunchy nut cornflakes . DINNER: . Thai curry with rice, roast dinner, shepherd's pie . SNACKS THROUGHOUT THE DAY: . A whole packet of parma ham or smoked salmon . Chicken liver parfait on toast . Cheese and biscuits . 100g of cashew nuts . Biscuits and chocolate . Lots of fruit . Water, milk and Lucozade . Bags of sweets, especially jelly beans and fruit pastels . A huge piece of cake in the middle of the night . Miss Dunbar added: ‘Looking at . pictures of myself is like looking at a picture of an African child that . is starving. I’m just bones. ‘I went into hospital to lose weight and I came out as a different person.’ Miss Dunbar underwent two more . operations last year to increase her stomach size to aid the intake of . nutrients, but nothing else can be done to maintain a healthy weight . apart from eating. She is now a healthy eight stone but has to continue to eat as much as she can to ensure she continues to gain weight. 'To combat the illness, I need to absorb as much as I can from food,' she said. 'For example, whereas a normal person would consume about 30-40g of protein a day, I need to take 125g in to get my levels up to where they should be. 'It has completely changed me as a person. 'At the beginning I was really happy, because I was dropping lots of weight. 'But then it's supposed to stop and it just didn't.

One woman who hasn't been able to enjoy sex with her husband in over three years is looking forward to enjoying a normal sex life again after a surgical procedure on Embarrassing Bodies has helped treat her painful vagina. Sian, 31, from South Wales visited Dr Dawn in the portable clinic when it visited the Big Cheese Festival in Caerphilly. She explained that every time she and her husband have sex she develops pain like a friction burn at the entrance to her vagina making the area red and sore. Seeking help: Sian visited Dr Dawn in the portable clinic when it visited the Big Cheese Festival in Caerphilly to seek advice about her painful sex life . She said: 'I haven't been able to have sex without pain in over three years. 'Whenever I do actually have intercourse it goes very red and sore, it's like you're having friction burn. 'It started intermittently and it basically went on to be every time we tried.' This had put a massive strain on Sian’s marriage and she told the TV doctor that it made her feel less of a woman. Craving normality: Sian explained to Dawn how she hadn't had pain-free sex in over three years . Sian then went to see Consultant Gynaecologist, Miss Gabrielle Downey at the BMI Priory Hospital in Birmingham, who specialises in vulval pain. Miss Downey gave Sian some different thrush medication, a local steroid cream and a numbing gel to help improve her symptoms. Miss Downey said that if the oral medication and cream didn’t work that she would offer Sian a quick surgical procedure to remove the sensitive, painful skin. Successful surgery: Sian had the painful area of skin on her vagina removed and five days later was feeling much better . Sadly, the medication didn’t fully work so Sian had an operation to surgically remove the abnormal skin. Miss Downey said: 'Sian has a well defined discreet . area of inflammation at the entrance to the vagina so I am going to . remove it and isolate exactly where the pain comes from.' Just five days later, Sian was back at Dr Dawn's clinic to see how she was healing up. Amazing: 'This is amazing,' added Sian who is very happy, healing well and excited about rekindling her sex-life with her husband . Dr Dawn said: 'There is at least a 90 per cent chance of being completely pain free without the need for any more treatment. 'When she recovers, she will be nice and healed and ready for action.' 'This is amazing,' added Sian who is very happy, healing well and excited about rekindling her sex-life with her husband.

A cook shrunk by an impressive seven stone after she stopped tucking into her own homemade dishes and took to the treadmill. Emma Jones tipped the scales at a dangerous 17st when she made the life-changing decision to stop tasting her own culinary delights, and slimmed down by six dress sizes in just five months. The 42-year-old primary school cook couldn’t resist getting her fingers into the pupils’ pies and soon saw her size 14 frame reach new boundaries as she pulled on a pair of size 22 chef’s trousers. Emma Jones lost an extraordinary 7st, dropping from a size 22 (left) to a trim size 10 (right) by ditching her own delicious cooking and hitting the treadmill regularly . After she made the life-changing decision to stop tasting her own culinary delights, and slimmed down by six dress sizes in just five months, Emma can now fit into a single leg of her old trousers . Emma, a mother of two, said: 'I cook for a living and I love making new dishes, but I enjoy my own food just a little too much. 'After I had my second child Charlie, three, I wasn’t thinking about what I was eating. 'I had a new baby and I wasn’t paying any attention to my weight and I wasn’t taking any care of myself. I just ballooned.' Following Charlie’s birth, Emma also suffered from post-natal depression, which led her to comfort eat. She said: 'I had some help for the depression and I started to feel better about life in general. 'My weight was starting to get me down and I knew I had to do something about it.' Emma went to collect a prescription from her doctor, and saw her age written out in full on the form. She said: 'It suddenly struck me that I was approaching 42. I just had to do something about the way I looked, as I was beginning to let myself go. It was scary.' Emma says that since dropping the weight she feels fabulous - and now runs a marathon a year . Emma, who has been with her partner Ian for 10years, said: 'He knew I wasn’t happy with the way I looked. 'He has always taken me for who I am so I never felt pressure to lose weight for him, but I had to take control of my life.' Emma, from Otley, West Yorks, always had an excellent relationship with food, and always ate fresh fruit and vegetables. But, she found it difficult to stick to three meals a day and would snack heavily in between, as well as finishing off her children’s meals. She said: 'One of the things I cook at the school is fresh bread. When it would come out of the oven, I just couldn’t resist gnawing away on it. 'It was bad habits like that that meant the weight just piled on.' Joining Weight Watchers and controlling her diet through a points system meant the weight quickly fell from Emma, who quickly began to recognise her old self. She said: 'I began to look at food in a completely different way and I changed my whole lifestyle. 'Taking into account how much I was eating in a portion showed how much I was eating before, and I turned to snacking on fruit as I could eat as much of it as I wanted.' Emma also began to exercise to gain more Weight Watchers points, and this revolutionised the way she looked at being active. 'I realised I could eat more if I did some exercise, and that I would feel better for becoming fitter,' Emma added. 'I began running on a friend’s treadmill and then I took to the outdoors. I live in a rural area, which fields close-by so I had no excuse for not getting out there. 'It was really tough to begin with but I started by walking and then running for short distances, and I soon built my stamina up. Emma credits joining Weight Watchers and ditching her own delicious dishes for her staggering transformation . 'I have a chocolate Labrador Archie, who became my reluctant running partner, so the pair of us would run around the Yorkshire Dales together.' Within a couple of months, Emma decided to set herself a goal and enter into a 10km race to test how her running had come on. 'I felt amazed by how far I had come on,' said Emma. 'Ian and my sons Charlie and Dan, 15, stood on the sidelines to cheer me on and I don’t think they could believe that they were seeing.' Emma, who is now a size 10, and weighs just 10-stone, has turned her life around and enjoys wearing clothes that make her feel and look good. She said: 'Gone are the days where I resigned myself to stretchy waistlines and sacks for t-shirts. 'I can now wear clothes that have shape and fit me well. It’s great being able to shop on the high street again for things that I like.' Incredibly, Emma now runs a 10km race every month, and has now entered into two marathons and The Great North Run, which she is racing to raise money for NSPCC later this year.

A teenager told a court today that a Metropolitan police officer stamped on his back while he was in custody, 'dropping his whole body' on him. PC Joseph Harrington, 29, from Walthamstow in east London, denies assaulting the boy in a caged area at Forest Gate police station days after the London riots in 2011. The teenager, who was 15-years-old during the alleged attack, told Southwark Crown Court: 'It was painful, I’ve never felt like that before. I couldn’t breathe properly.' He also said that PC Harrington had also put his hands round his neck a few days before in a London park. 'I couldn't breathe properly': A 15-year-old boy alleges that PC Joseph Harrington assaulted him at Forest Gate Police Station, in east London in the aftermath of the London riots . The teenager said: 'I was in a park with my friends, police were coming in with cameras, taking pictures, and we walked away. 'They came back in riot uniforms and were running towards us. 'I stayed where I was, and waited for them to come towards me, and Joe Harrington said I needed to go. I said, ‘my friend’s house is here, I have nowhere else to go’. The teenager said that PC Harrington then pushed him up against a wall. A few days later on August 11 the teenager was arrested for an alleged public order offence and was taken from Stratford police station, east London to Forest Gate police station. He was in the caged area when PC Harrington walked in. The teenager said he asked if PC Harrington remembered him. PC Harrington said no. Then the boy acted out putting his hands around his own neck with his handcuffs on and said, ‘do you remember when you did this to me?”’ According to the boy, Harrington replied, ‘it wasn’t me, I wasn’t there, I wasn’t working those days’. Then Harrington said 'do you want it to happen again?’ The teenager said that he laughed at him: 'I thought. I’m already arrested for something I haven’t done, I’m handcuffed, in a police cage, what could get worse?' Then an older policeman grabbed him by his jacket, which ripped, and they dragged him across the floor, the teenager said. Harrington then stamped on his back, he added. Assault accusations: A 'tired' Metropolitan Police officer who allegedly stamped on a teenager in custody told the Independent Police Complaints Commission that he had been working a 24-hour shift in the run-up to incident . 'He stamped on me with his foot and held me there with his foot, then dropped his whole body on me.' This continued for eight seconds. The teenager said: 'A lady came and said, ‘get off him’, I couldn’t really see what was happening, because my vision was blurry.' He remained in custody overnight and went to a GP three days later: 'I was still in pain, on my spine.' PC Harrington denies the charge, saying that he dropped his right knee on to the teenager's back so he could reposition his handcuffs to behind his back. He told investigators from the Independent Police Complaints Commission that in the run up to the incident he had been working a 24-hour shift and had worked 100 hours in five days.

A crime lord mocked by a judge who told him he had lost his 'street cred' following a petty fuel theft has been hauled back into court and jailed for 16 years for masterminding a major drugs racket. Gang boss Aaron Giacopazzi, 47, had been nicknamed 'The Godfather' for building a crime empire in his hometown of Carlisle, Cumbria. In his most recent ploy the criminal was identified as being a link . man between a north east-based drugs gang and another criminal group in . Lancashire, following a major . police surveillance operation named . 'Operation Chamonix' last February . Officers watched the gang carry out . major drug deals at Cumberland Hospital car park in Carlisle and at a . McDonald's restaurant in Carlisle city centre. Giacopazzi was caught on film meeting accomplices in an Audi at Morrisons . supermarket car park in Blackburn town centre to arrange a £43,000 exchange for 4.4lbs of cocaine. Christopher Brookes, 53, Ayab . Khansai, 54, and Shabaz Choudrey, 34, were part of the Lancashire gang there to buy cocaine. North east contact Curtis Waite, . 24 was also seen at the in an Astra van. Police swooped just as the drugs deal was about to be completed. Police found £560,000 of the drug in the . rear of a Vauxhall Astra van and £43,000 in cash stuffed in a shoebox in . the back of an Audi. Officers said the gang were 'drugs . wholesalers' responsible for flooding towns with Class A drugs. Giacopazzi admitted conspiracy to supply drugs and perverting the course . of justice. Caught on camera: Police surveillance photo shows Aaron Giacopazzi acting as a link in a drugs deal which was foiled by police . On Friday at Carlisle Crown Court, . Giacopazzi was brought back before Judge Paul Batty who told him: 'You were . the godfather of this operation, the essential broker who brought the . two sides together. 'You were the central figure, closely . involved in organising the buying and selling on a commercial scale. You . have chosen to pursue a life of crime as a dealer in drugs. 'The high level of purity, particularly of the cocaine, indicates the closeness of your contacts to the source of supply.' Giacopazzi was branded one of . Carlisle's most notorious criminals by police and was said to be . 'someone who wields considerable influence over others.' A total of £43,000 cash in a shoebox was seized from the back of an Audi by police during Operation Chamonix . Police seized £43,000 cash and cocaine worth £560,000 when they swooped on the drug deal in Blackburn . Accomplices Choudrey, of Bradford, West Yorkshire, and Khansia, 54, of Blackburn, Lancashire, were each jailed for 10 years. Brookes, 53, of Blackburn . was sentenced to nine years, Waite, 24, of . Billingham, Cleveland was jailed for six years, while Giacopazzi was handed a 16-year sentence. Acting Det Supt Paul Duhig of Cumbria . Police said: 'The sentences passed in court speak for themselves. Our . highly committed and effective officers and staff continue to focus on . the criminals posing the biggest threat to the communities of Cumbria. 'Anyone who thinks that getting . involved in drug supply or serious crime can pay, should think again. This case is the latest in a long line of successful investigations . which send a clear message to organised criminals in Cumbria - you will . end up in court and waste a large part of your life in prison.' Joanne Cunliffe, Crown Advocate from . the CPS North West Complex Case Unit, said: 'These criminals were . responsible for the large scale supply of drugs throughout Cumbria and . the North of England. 'By securing their conviction, the CPS . and police have dismantled this supply chain and removed a prominent . source of drugs from the region.' Two years ago Giacopazzi was jokingly branded a 'silly fuel' by locals after the same judge ridiculed him after he took part in a bungled attempt to steal diesel from a farm with his brother. Judge Batty said given Giacopazzi had a . long record for serious crimes like armed robbery, drug dealing and . firearms offences, he would have been 'embarrassed' at being arrested . over the foiled theft. He was given a 12-month . suspended prison term and placed under a curfew by Judge Batty who told . him: 'With your record you were probably embarrassed at being arrested . for this. Your street credibility is significantly reduced now.' His previous jail sentences include nine years for a bungled raid on a Securicor depot in 1991, five years for heroin dealing in 1997 and four years for firearms offences in 2000. In 2004 Judge Batty jailed him for ten years for supplying 33,000 worth of heroin and told him: 'You are a professional career criminal who started off as an armed robber, but because armed robbery has risks, you moved to drug dealing where the risks are far less for those at the top and the profits are greater. 'You are someone who wields considerable influence over others.'","Aaron Giacopazzi, 47, caught on camera in £43,000 drugs deal in Morrisons .

A court had heard that 29-year-old Gillian Meagher (also know as Jill) was raped three times before she died. Adrian Bayley, who was initially charged with murder and one count of rape, now faces a further two rape charges in relation to Mrs Meagher . Irish journalist Jill Meagher, who moved to Australia to start a new life, was raped three times before she was murdered and left in a shallow grave, a court was told today. Her accused killer, 41-year-old Adrian Bayley, who had initially been charged with murder and one count of rape, had the two rape charges added when he applied to the Melbourne court for a delay in his committal hearing, due to start next week. The two new charges relating to Mrs Meagher followed three other unrelated charges of rape in three Melbourne suburbs. Mrs Meagher's husband, Tom Meagher, was in court today when Bayley appeared via a video-link from prison. Defence lawyer Helen Spowart told the magistrates’ court that on January 19 this year, when Bayley appeared in court and indicated he would be fighting the initial murder and rape charges, police had charged him with two further counts of raping Miss Meagher. Miss Spowart said the evidence of a police forensic scientist who analysed the accused man’s DNA sample would be relevant to the further two rape charges. Miss Meagher, 29, moved with her husband from her home in County Louth, Ireland, three years ago and started a job as a journalist with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in Melbourne. At 1.33am on September 23 last year she left a bar in Melbourne after drinking with ABC colleagues and planned to walk home to the apartment she shared with her husband. Accused: A Facebook picture of Adrian Bayley. He allegedly took police to the place where her body was found in a shallow grave . Adrian Bayley, 41, pictured just after Australian homicide detectives charged him with the rape and murder of Jill Meagher in September. He also faces three charges of rape unrelated to Mrs Meagher . She never arrived and after intensive police work Bayley was arrested and allegedly took police to the place where her body was found in a shallow grave some 35 miles from Melbourne. Deputy chief magistrate Felicity Broughton refused to delay next week’s committal hearing, saying she was satisfied the defence experts would have enough time to inspect reports and clothing they required. The laying of two extra rape charges against Bayley involving Miss Meagher, she said, did not ‘particularly add anything in terms of the specific issues’. The court has been told that Bayley intends to plead not guilty to the charges relating to Miss Meagher. Following the discovery of Miss Meagher’s body in September, thousands of people marched through Melbourne in her memory and demanding greater safety in the streets. Tom Meagher, husband of Jill Meagher, leaves Melbourne Magistrate's Court after an earlier court hearing in September .

Syrian rebels have torn down a bronze statue of President Bashar Assad's late father and predecessor as they pushed government troops from most of the northern city of Raqqa. Scores of cheering protesters ripped down the statue in scenes reminiscent of Iraq in 2003, when angry civilians toppled a giant statue of Saddam Hussein. Rebels hold control in parts of several major . Syrian cities - several neighborhoods in Aleppo, Homs and Deir el-Zour, . as well as suburbs of the capital, Damascus. But if they seize control of Raqqa, it would be the first time an entire city had fallen into the hands of anti-Assad fighters. Syrian rebels have torn down a bronze statue of President Bashar Assad's late father and predecessor as they pushed government troops from most of the northern city of Raqqa . As the statue of President Bashar Al-Assad's father, Hafez Al-Assad, is pulled down, people celebrate in Raqqa . Rebels hold control in parts of several major Syrian cities - several neighborhoods in Aleppo, Homs and Deir el-Zour, as well as suburbs of the capital, Damascus . They also control large areas in the countryside, particularly in the north. The rebel advances are a significant blow to Assad, although during the past week his forces have regained control of several villages and towns along a key highway near Aleppo International Airport. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebels are now in control of 'large parts' of Raqqa, a city of around 500,000 on the Euphrates River, which flows through Syria into Iraq. A top police officer was killed and intelligence officers were detained, the group said. Activists declared Raqqa 'liberated' on opposition social media websites Monday. A photo posted on several pro-rebel Facebook pages showed people tearing down a huge poster of Assad and hitting it with their shoes. The activists said the picture was taken inside the feared Air Force Intelligence headquarters in Raqqa. An amateur video posted online shows a large, bronze statue of Hafez Assad being torn to the ground with a rope tied around the statue's neck. The video shows people in the crowd taking photos and video on their mobile phones as the statue crashes into the side of a fountain, while others fired guns into the air in celebration. People then rush to jump on the statue and hit it with their shoes. 'God be with the Free Army!' they shout. The video appeared consistent with other reports. Amir, an activist in Raqqa, who agreed to give only his first name for security reasons, said rebels were now in control of the city but that there were pockets of pro-regime elements still fighting. The mood was 'euphoric' in the city when residents and rebels toppled the statue in the main square, but 'then the shelling began and everyone fled home,' Amir said via Skype, with the crackle of gunfire audible in the background. There were also airstrikes on the city and many casualties, he said. Rebels have been making headway in Raqqa province for weeks, capturing the country's largest dam. On Sunday, anti-Assad fighters stormed the Raqqa central prison. Earlier on Monday, rebels launched an offensive to try to seize the military air base of Mannagh near the Turkish border and clashed with government forces at an historic mosque in the nation's largest city of Aleppo, activists said. Rebels have been making headway in Raqqa province for weeks, capturing the country's largest dam. On Sunday, anti-Assad fighters stormed the Raqqa central prison . People hit a statue of President Bashar Al-Assad's father, Hafez Al-Assad, with shoes and an axe after it was pulled down in Raqqa . In Saudi Arabia, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal both warned Assad that they will boost support to rebels unless he steps down. Saudi Arabia has been one of the region's harshest critics of Assad's regime. In his discussions with Kerry, Saud said he stressed the importance of enabling the Syrian people to exercise their 'legitimate right to defend itself against the regime's killing machine.' Saud also complained that the Assad regime continues to get weapons from 'third parties,' a veiled reference to Russia and Iran, which have backed Assad through the conflict. Kerry criticized Iran, Hezbollah and Russia by name for giving weapons to Assad's forces. Monday's fighting came as a pro-government newspaper reported that opposition fighters killed 115 police and wounded another 50 in a battle on Sunday over a police academy in the north. The daily Al-Watan reported that 'terrorists committed a massacre' at the academy near Aleppo. Scores of cheering protesters ripped down the statue in scenes reminiscent of Iraq in 2003, when angry civilians toppled a giant statue of Saddam Hussein . A government official, however, denied the report, and said instead that 27 government troops were killed and that seven were still missing. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. The report came a day after the Observatory said the rebels seized the police school in Khan al-Asal after entering the sprawling government complex with captured tanks. The Observatory said the battle left at least 120 soldiers and 80 rebels dead. The Syrian conflict started two years ago as a popular uprising against Assad's authoritarian rule, then turned into a full-blown civil war after the rebels took up arms to fight a government crackdown on dissent. The United Nations estimates that more than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict. Assad maintains his troops are fighting 'terrorists' and Islamic extremists seeking to destroy Syria, and he accuses the West and its Gulf Arab allies of supporting them. The Observatory said clashes also were raging inside Aleppo's landmark 12th century Umayyad Mosque, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the walled Old City. The mosque was heavily damaged last year after a fire gutted the city's famed medieval market. On Saturday, the Syrian army command said it captured areas in Aleppo opening a road between the government-controlled central city of Hama with Aleppo's international airport. The airport, the country's second largest, has been the target of a rebel offensive for weeks. The Observatory said rebels on Monday destroyed the Assan bridge near the airport. An amateur video showed rebels blowing up the bridge, creating a thick black of smoke amid chants of 'God is great.'","Cheering protesters ripped down statue in scenes reminiscent of Iraq, 2003 .

All pilots and cabin crew operating in the UK are governed by the aviation section of the Railways and Transport Act 2003. Drunk on duty: Air stewardess Stephanie Partington admitted being unable to perform her duties due to drink on a flight from Dubai to Birmingham last year . Under the legislation, they must abide by much tighter alcohol intake restrictions than those imposed on car drivers. The limits are 9mg of alcohol in 100mL of breath - for driving it is 35 - and 20mg of alcohol in 100mL of blood, against 80 in driving. Thomson is one of the biggest operators flying out of Birmingham, with at least six flights a day to destinations around the world. It transports passengers to holiday hotspots in Spain, Greece, America, the Caribbean and Mexico. The pilot was arrested less than six months after an Emirates stewardess on a flight from Dubai to Birmingham was sacked for being drunk on duty. Stephanie Partington, aged 24 and from Liverpool, admitted being unable to perform her duties due to drink when she appeared at Solihull Magistrates’ Court last September. She was fined £110, with £85 costs, and the court heard she had been dismissed by the airline. The 24-year-old was so loud as she served passengers at the back of the 300-seat Boeing 777 that the purser had to ask her to 'quieten down'. Suspicions were raised further when routine paperwork she filled out at the end of the seven-hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham was illegible. In February drunk airline pilot Radu Cristea, 38, allegedly tested positive for alcohol as he carried out pre-flight checks on his Bucharest-bound Airbus plane from London Heathrow. Police swooped on him just half an hour before he was due to take off on the three-hour flight at 7am and state-run Romanian airline Tarom was forced to cancel the flight, with 33 passengers on board, Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court in Middlesex heard.","The pilot, 51, was detained by police at Birmingham Airport on February 10 .

Argentina yesterday dismissed the Falkland Islands referendum as an illegitimate ‘publicity stunt’. But Alicia Castro, Argentina’s ambassador to Britain, was criticised for her ‘offensive’ comments days before islanders hold their first vote on whether they want to remain British. The historic referendum, which is being held this weekend, will be overseen by international observers. It is expected to send a clear message to Argentina to keep its hands off. Britain has insisted that those living on the Falklands – called Las Malvinas by Buenos Aires – have the right to decide which country they want to govern them. Britain triumphed when the two nations fought a ten-week war after Argentina invaded the islands in 1982. Miss Castro said: ‘This referendum has no legal grounds. It’s not approved, nor will it be recognised by the United Nations or the international community, so this referendum is little more than a public relations exercise. ‘This referendum in no way changes the essence of the Malvinas question and its predictable result will not bring an end to the dispute.’ Miss Castro also warned that UK firms would find it difficult to drill for oil off the windswept South Atlantic outcrop unless there were better ties to the rest of South America. But Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Tory vice-chairman of the Falkland Islands All-Party Parliamentary Group, said: ‘The Falkland Islands is part of the UK and the population has wanted this opportunity to clarify their position. ‘They want to show the strength of feeling that they wish to stay linked to Britain. It is neither right nor fair for Argentina to keep claiming that the referendum is illegitimate. Argentina would be quite offended if we interfered in their referendums or votes.’ Britain . says the islanders have a right to self-determination, and insists they . be present at any talks with Argentina over the future of the islands, . but Buenos Aires says the matter should only be discussed by two . sovereign states. 'The Argentine government has already . dismissed the referendum before it has even taken place, a position . that runs counter to the universal principles of democracy and . self-determination,' a British Foreign Office spokesman said. Decisions: The inhabitants of the islands, 300 miles (480 km) off the Argentine coast are due to take part in a referendum on March 10-11 to find if they want to remain British .

"By . Gerrard Couzens . PUBLISHED: . 13:31 EST, 4 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:42 EST, 5 March 2013 . A British dad-of-two went on trial in Spain today over the holiday drowning of an Irishman 16 years ago. Kitchen fitter Darren Sapstead, from Chelsmford, Essex, faced a jury accused of pushing Garry Walton to his death during a pleasure boat booze cruise in November 1996. Garry, 21, from Tooreneena near Dungarvan, County Waterford, died after falling from a boat called Albatros off the Tenerife resort of Playa de Las Americas in an incident originally written off by Spanish police as an accident. Trial: Darren Sapstead, pictured left in court yesterday, denies pushing Garry Walton, right, to his death over the side of a pleasure boat in Tenerife 1996. The trial began on Monday, 17 years after Mr Walton died . In the dock: The incident was treated by officials as an accident for nearly two decades . State prosecutor Deborah Padilla, calling for Mr Sapstead to be jailed for 12 years if convicted of killing the apprentice builder, said: 'Towards the end of the trip as the boat neared port and the defendant was with a young girl at the stern, Garry stumbled drunkenly towards them. 'The defendant said to the girl, ""Shall I throw him overboard?"" and then, without giving the girl time to reply and with the clear intention of ending Garry's life, he bent down, grabbed Garry by his legs at knee-height, stood back up and threw him over the side, fully conscious of his state of drunkenness. 'All this occurred in a matter of seconds, without Garry being able to act.' Blaming the delays in getting the case to trial partly on the fact a British eye witness only started incriminating Mr Sapstead a year after Garry's death, she said: 'This has been a long process but bearing in the mind the difficulties we have had I believe this has been an example of perseverance in the face of a serious crime which could not be forgotten. 'This wasn't just any day, it was the day on which a boy aged just 21 died.' Agony: The victim's father Robert Walton was in the Tenerife courtroom to watch the trial . Fight: Robert and Catharine Walton have been seeking justice for their son's death for 17 years . Garry's campaigning parents Robert and Catherine were among those in court. They held hands as lawyers for both sides put forward their versions of the last moments of their son's life on November 7 1996. His body was found by another vessel two hours later. The state prosecutor said Garry, who was enjoying his first sunshine holiday, was in a 'serious state of ethylic intoxication' after an afternoon of drinking games on board Albatros and was unable to react to Mr Sapstead's 'sudden and surprise attack.' Defence lawyer Carlos Valenciano told . the jury of five men and four women his client had sought to save the . dying man after an 'unfortunate accident.' He said the court would hear from a single 'contradictory' eye witness now claiming his client pushed Garry after giving five statements in Spain and the UK insisting she saw him fall and Mr Sapstead was the only person who threw the drowning man a life ring and try to jump in the sea to help him. He told the court: 'We're not here today because of the prosecution's perseverance. We're here today because of an obstinacy I would say was cruel. 'In my opinion, Mr Walton's death was a tragic accident, not the work of another person and certainly not the result of Darren Sapstead's actions.' Return: Mr Sapstead voluntarily returned to Spain to stand trial and could face 12 years in prison . Hearing: Proceedings opened on Monday after a long-running legal battle over Mr Walton's death . Mr Sapstead returned to Spain voluntarily to stand trial. He was extradited to Spain in 2005 after a botched Spanish police investigation which saw just five of the 45 British and Irish tourists on the booze cruise questioned in the aftermath of Mr Walton's death. An investigating judge charged him with homicide after having him extradited from Britain in 2006 - and then allowed him to return to the UK on bail pending a full probe. Homicide, a charge that does not exist in English law, is a halfway house between manslaughter and the more serious charge of murder which in Spain is a wilful killing which must also be premeditated. Mr Sapstead, protesting his innocence from the witness stand during cross-examination, told the court: 'It wasn't me that threw Garry overboard. I was the only person that went to help him. 'I threw a life ring to him and I was taking my shoes and T-shirt off to jump in after him when the guy arranging the party games stopped me.' Asked by the state prosecutor why he thought Katie Smethurst, one of two sisters on board Albatross due to give evidence against him tomorrow, is now accusing him of pushing the dead man, he said: 'It's something I want to find out as much as you do. I don't know either.' Blaming inconsistencies in some of his statements on poor translators, he added: 'The translator I had in Madrid after I was extradited was Chinese and didn't speak proper English or Spanish. She just nodded her head a lot. 'The duty lawyer they gave me was drunk.' Garry Walton died after falling from the Albatros off the coast of Tenerife, pictured . Mr Sapstead has voluntarily returned to stand trial on homicide charges in Tenerife . Mr Sapstead's trial followed an exhaustive 16-year-campaign by Garry's builder father Robert, 60, and his Irish mother Catherine, 59, to get answers to his death. They had to exhume his body 10 months after his burial when evidence came to light casting doubt on the original ruling his death was an accident. An investigating judge in Tenerife shelved the case against Mr Sapstead three times - only to bring charges against him after repeated appeals by the couple's lawyer Pedro Ripoll. Mr Ripoll retired in 2007 - and both he and Garry's parents only found out by chance today's trial had been scheduled. The Waltons have become grandparents five times since the death of their son - and Mr Sapstead has become a father twice with his 16-year-old daughter now studying for her GSCEs. Speaking outside court today out-of-work builder Mr Walton, who moved with his family to Ireland from Leeds when Garry was 13, said: 'It's mixed feelings at the moment. 'We're over the moon on the one hand. We'd given up on things ever getting this far after so many kicks in the teeth and we've been pinching ourselves the last few days to make sure it's true. 'But we're also disgusted it's taken so long. It's inexplicable. We've been treated like dirt by the Spanish authorities. My son deserved better than this.' As well as demanding a 12-year jail sentence for Mr Sapstead if convicted of homicide, state prosecutors also want him to pay his alleged victim's family €120,000 (£104,000) in compensation. The trial, expected to last three days, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Darren Sapstead denies pushing Garry Walton from boat off Tenerife coast .

Courageous: Farm worker Paul Gray, 50, died as he bravely tried to rescue his unconscious colleague Craig Whipps, 27, pictured, from waist-high slurry. Both men died at the scene . A courageous farm worker died as he bravely tried to rescue his unconscious colleague from waist-high slurry, an inquest has heard. Paul Gray, 50, twice went back into an aging slurry tank at to rescue Craig Whipps, 27, despite the slurry and noxious gasses. But despite his heroics, both men died at the scene in Albyns Farm, Stapleford Tawney, Essex . Farm worker, Richard Brown, was met with the horrifying scene at about 5pm on July 15, 2011, after returning from spreading slurry on a nearby field. He told Chelmsford Coroners' Court: 'There was slurry gushing all over the place and running down the farm. When I walked in there it was near enough waist deep. 'Craig was laying on his back unconscious in the slurry. Mr Gray hopped over the wall and jumped down onto the concrete to get him. 'I went in and tried to get Craig but I could feel my chest tightening up and felt sick and dizzy. 'We all got told to leave the scene because of the gasses. It wasn't until after that I found out Paul was still in there and that he'd died.' The jury of six men and five women heard how a number of farm workers who had been milking cows nearby, including Mr Gray and Calvin Otto, had attempted to rescue Mr Whipps but had been overwhelmed by the noxious gasses. Robert Torrance, who has run the farm since taking it over from his father in 1971, rescued Mr Otto from the slurry before seeing Mr Gray attempting to rescue of Mr Whipps. He said: 'I got a phone call from Richard saying there was a disaster and slurry was running everywhere. 'I ran there and could see slurry flowing down. 'I could see Craig submerged - his left boot has on top on the shoot and the rest of his body was submerged. 'I ran down into the slurry but to my horror I saw Calvin submerged in fast running slurry. Between me and Richard we dragged him out and put him in the recovery position. 'I then went back into the slurry to do the same for Craig. I was able to get to Craig and tried to pull him up with his left arm but I couldn't manage it. 'I saw Paul jump into the slurry and I said ""Get back - there is nothing that can be done"". 'At that point I lost consciousness - that was the last time I saw him.' Mr Gray was later pronounced dead at the scene, alongside Mr Whipps, by ambulance crews at around 6.10pm. Firefighters had also tried in vain to rescue the men as they pumped 120,000 litres of slurry from the pit on to a nearby field. After the tragedy, it emerged married Mr Whipps, a dad-of-one, had been expecting another child with his wife, Vicky. Mrs Whipps previously paid tribute to her husband, saying: 'Craig was a lovely husband, who should have had many years of family life ahead of him. 'His whole family are very proud of what he achieved in the time he was with us. 'Now we just want to try to raise awareness of some of the hidden dangers of working in an agricultural environment in the hope that the same thing will not happen to anyone else.' Michael Wangermann, a personal injury specialist at solicitors Ashton KCJ, is representing Mr Whipps's family. He said after the incident: 'Craig's family are keen to highlight the issue in the hope that other families will not have to go through the ordeal they are currently enduring. 'In this case the volume of slurry and the fumes released were overpowering, even though the tank was stored outside.' A health and safety report into the incident concluded Mr Whipp had removed bolts on the four metre high slurry tank in an attempt to fix a broken slurry release valve causing 'a massive and unstoppable leak'. Susan Matthews, health and safety inspector, said: 'Some bolts were found in the slurry and also a spanner from Craig's tool kit. 'It was a process of deduction.' Robert Dawton, specialist inspector for the Health and Safety Executive, went on to explain to the court about the dangers of hydrogen sulphide - a potentially deadly gas produced by farm slurry. In large quantities the gas - which in low levels resembles the smell of rotting eggs - can paralyse the respiratory system in the brain. He continued: 'It is a very toxic gas. 'I am aware of an incident in the U.S. where a family of five died in similar circumstances. 'People go to rescue them as they don't realise the situation they are putting themselves in.' Pathologist Dr Nathaniel Carey found the cause of death for Mr Whipps and Mr Gray to be emersion in slurry. Abundant quantities of swallowed slurry were found in Mr Gray's stomach. The inquest is due to conclude tomorrow.","Paul Gray twice went back into an aging slurry tank to rescue Craig Whipps .

A coroner banned the naming of bungling firearms officers in a triple murder inquest to protect their human rights. In the latest secret justice farce, officers who wrongly allowed Michael Atherton to own guns were given anonymity to respect their ‘right to privacy’. Police lawyers said their clients were worried about ‘the way in which they were talked about’ and feared ‘media pointing the finger’. Inquest: Michael Atherton (left) killed himself and three victims. During his inquest the coroner banned the naming of officers involved in the case, including Damien Cobain (right) The ban was overturned following an appeal by the Daily Mail and it soon emerged that one of the officers dealing with Atherton, 42, had been selling on confiscated firearms while serving with the police. It is the latest in a long line of orders banning journalists from reporting on the courts, which are supposed to be open to the public. The order was made by Coroner Andrew Tweddle during the inquest into the death of Atherton, who killed himself, and three victims. The taxi driver, who legally owned six guns, opened fire at his home in Horden, near Peterlee in County Durham, on January 1 last year. He killed his partner Susan McGoldrick, 47, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and Alison’s daughter Tanya Turnbull, 24, before turning the gun on himself. He also wounded his step-daughter Laura McGoldrick, 19, as she fled. Sole survivor: Laura McGoldrick, 19, who was injured as her mother's partner Michael Atherton opened fire at their home in County Durham . The inquest in Crook, County Durham, heard Atherton had successfully applied for a licence for a shotgun in 2006 and five further guns in 2008. Officers in the firearms licensing unit at Durham Constabulary knew he had a history of domestic violence and self-harm but decided to grant his application. One of them was Damien Cobain, a firearms inquiry officer later convicted of selling guns. In his evidence, Cobain said he had never seen guidance by the Home Office or the Association of Chief Police Officers on the issuing of gun certificates. Although he found Atherton had not disclosed his history of domestic violence he recommended that his application be accepted. Mr Tweddle describe the force’s procedures as ‘ad hoc ’. An investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission into the shootings found that Atherton’s applications had not been properly scrutinised by Durham Police. Six officers were to be made anonymous by Mr Tweddle. The order to hide their names was made under article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights despite there being no legal precedent for it in the UK courts. But after reading submissions by the Daily Mail and other media outlets, the coroner overturned the ruling, saying that open justice was more important. Cobain has since left the force after his conviction in 2010, where he was given a suspended sentence for selling guns that were due to be destroyed after being surrendered by the public.","Police lawyers said their clients feared 'media pointing the finger'

High street shoppers: Men are more likely to fall for red price labels while women see through the marketing ploy . Ask a man to go shopping with you and he really might see red – but not in the way you might expect. Researchers have discovered that men are seduced by red price labels, while women see through the marketing ploy. Faced with sales prices written in red, men in the British study believed they were saving nearly twice as much as when the cost was laid out in black and white. Lead researcher Dr Nancy Puccinelli, of Oxford University, said: ‘Essentially, women are better shoppers than men and spend more time shopping. ‘They appear to be immune to the effects of prices in red because they tend to process advertisements in greater depth, and are more sceptical. ‘But when men see prices in red they feel more positive and think there are greater savings to be had. ‘Men appear to be particularly susceptible to the effects of red colour, possibly for evolutionary reasons.’ The study, published in the Journal of Retailing, involved three experiments with around 400 people who looked at price labels and advertisements, rating them for the amount of money they would save. In each case, the men thought they were saving more when the price was in red and believed those products offered savings 85 per cent greater than the black-priced items. For women there was no difference between the colours. When researchers told the men the decision was important and they looked more closely at the labels, the ‘red effect’ disappeared. The researchers also found that looking at red prices put men in a more positive mood. Oxford University researchers found that men believed they were saving more when the price was on a red label . Previous research has shown that men are more attracted to women who wear red, that waitresses in red get bigger tips and that women hitchhikers are more likely to be picked up when wearing red. It has been suggested that this is because in evolutionary terms a rosy complexion in a female can be a sign of increased fertility. Dr Puccinelli said: ‘Men seem to respond to red as a superficial cue. They literally see red and have a more positive attitude. ‘Other research has shown that men are attracted by the colour red. In . one experiment, women who wore red shirts were considered more . attractive and were likely to be asked out.'","Oxford University researchers say red prices make men feel more positive .

'The Reverend': Fake vicar George Gordon faces jail after he stole up to . £30,000 from a charity for victims of depression, sexual abuse and . mental disorders . A man, who falsely claimed he was a vicar, stole up to £30,000 in charity funds after buying a clerical title online. 'Clever trickster' George Gordon, 51, faces jail after he siphoned off European grant funding for voluntary groups set up to help some of the most vulnerable people in Britain. Calling himself ‘The Reverend,’ Gordon falsely claimed to be a Cambridge-educated Church of England clergyman and also won widespread sympathy by allegedly pretending to suffer from cancer and manic depression. When his scam was uncovered by police, he went on the run for up to three years until he was tracked down following a nationwide appeal. After obtaining the clerical title from a Canadian website, Gordon got a job in charge of a charity fund which gave money to victims of depressions, sexual abuse and mental disorders. It has since emerged that Gordon had been repeatedly jailed for fraud in the past including a stretch in the 1990s after he posed as a priest to steal £21,000 in charity cash intended for handicapped children and young sex abuse victims. At Liverpool Crown Court, Gordon, from Toxteth, Liverpool pleaded guilty to nine counts of obtaining money by deception and 11 counts of fraud. Six other charges were left to lie on the file. He is due to be sentenced later this month. Gordon had been previously described as the judge as a ‘clever and fraudulent confidence trickster’. Turning down an application for bail, Judge Stephen Everett remanded Gordon in custody and told him: ‘You are a professional conman and time has finally caught up with you. ‘This was an overwhelming case against you and the sentence is going to be a substantial one.’ According to the Liverpool Daily Post, Judge Everett also said: ‘He is a man who cannot be believed when he says certain things. ‘The . fact that he went missing for three years and the fact that he knows . full well he’s going to get a long sentence says to me there is a . substantial risk of him failing to surrender.’ Gordon . was jailed for three years in 1988 for theft and between 1993 and 1998 . he cheated various charitable trusts while posing as different . clergymen, including two female vicars, and was jailed for a further . four years. Scam: Gordon (pictured right outside court in 2011 and in his mugshot left), who bought his clerical title from a Canadian website, had been jailed previously for fraud including a sentence for stealing £21,000 in charity cash intended for handicapped children and young sex abuse victims . But after he was released he landed a job on the Merseyside Disability Federation after being so convincing that no criminal record checks were carried out on his background. People who came into contact with Gordon claim he pretended to suffer from manic depression to work his way into the Merseyside self-help branch of the Bipolar Organisation. From here, he charmed his way into the Bipolar Organisation's MDF, a panel which met monthly to award grants to charities and community projects. Gordon, who boasted about having degrees from Cambridge and University of Wales, gained the trust of vulnerable individuals, charities, panels and funding bodies and was able to forge signatures to siphon off the grants, destined for vital community projects. Gordon also hired a base at the 3TC charity centre in Waterloo, Liverpool where it is alleged he conducted a fraud involving students with mental health problems. He ran the scheme from August 2006 until December 2007, when the lease was terminated after rent arrears rose to nearly £36,000. After taking legal advice, the charity was told the chances of recovering the debt were minimal. The Bipolar Organisation’s Merseyside branch was closed down when allegations about Gordon’s activity surfaced. Awaiting sentence: At Liverpool Crown Court (pictured), Gordon . pleaded guilty to nine counts of obtaining money by deception and 11 . counts of fraud and Judge Stephen Everett said his 'sentence is going to . be a substantial one' He was arrested in August 2008 but he vanished after being bailed and his name was circulated on a police wanted list. He was tracked down last year to an address in Durham. In a recent interview, Ruth Dean, a bipolar sufferer tricked by Gordon, said that the convicted fraudster used bogus titles to defraud and exploit the vulnerable. Mrs Dean said: ‘Members who sought support and solace in self-help groups were left to the mercy of George Gordon. ‘The Rev Dr is from a Canadian website. He has never, as he claims, held a ministry or been to Cambridge or Lampeter universities. ‘It is amazing how much carnage one individual can wreak. But what is really horrifying is that a man with an extensive criminal CV was allowed to sit on a panel awarding European Social Fund money.’ The charges against Gordon which spanned from November 2004 to 2007 allege he falsified documents on behalf of the Somewhere Else Mental Health Project, Healthcare Profession Support Network and Synergy Training Projects. He is also said to have falsified signatures on contracts of Synergy Training Projects, Phoenix Survivors Group, Karonga Garden Project, Borderline Personality Disorder, University Disability Fellowship and Adlam Accessible Allotments. Gordon was accused of obtaining money by deception from Manic Depression Fellowship of £10, 800, from Blue Skies Project of £8,700 on various dates plus another £950 and £5,000 from the Surviving Suicide Group.","George Gordon falsely claimed to be a Cambridge-educated CoE clergyman .

A 92-year-old grandmother with dementia had three precious rings pulled from her fingers in a 'deplorable' theft at a care home. Vulnerable Ruth Rose was robbed of her diamond engagement ring and two other family heirlooms at the private home where she lives. Her husband, Louis, 90, discovered the shocking theft when he arrived to visit her at Heathlands Village in Prestwich, Greater Manchester. Victim: Ruth and Louis Rose, a retired jeweller who used to run a shop in Manchester city centre, together . Mrs Rose's family say they are very happy with the day-to-day care at Heathlands which has been 'undermined by a morally bankrupt individual'. They have made a desperate appeal to find the culprit. The stolen jewellery included the one-of-a-kind diamond engagement ring Mr Rose gave his wife when he proposed almost 70 years ago. A diamond eternity ring and a half-hoop opal ring - which had belonged to Mrs Rose's mother - were also stolen. Police are investigating. Mr Rose, from Prestwich, said: 'When the theft occurred we're not certain. I went last Saturday and noticed that on one of her hands there were no rings.' Grandfather-of-three Mr Rose, a retired jeweller who used to run a shop in Manchester city centre, checked under his wife's blanket and on her other hand but could not find them. The care home and police were then alerted of the theft. Wedding photo of Ruth and Louis Rose, with Ruth wearing her engagement ring .

Mr Rose added: 'I am 100 per cent certain they were pulled from her fingers as she never took them off. There are three rings and although the monetary value is considerable, what upsets me more than anything is that she was assaulted by having the rings taken from her hand. I always hoped that they would go to my three granddaughters. I'm doing my best to come to terms with it.' Police and care home bosses slammed the theft. Sergeant Trevor Reid, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Whoever is responsible has physically removed the rings from her fingers and we are working closely with managers and staff to identify the person responsible for this audacious and deplorable crime.' The grandmother with dementia had three precious rings pulled from her fingers in a 'deplorable' theft at a care home . Karen Phillips, chief executive of the Jewish social care charity The Fed, which runs Heathlands, said: 'We're working very closely with police with regards to an alleged theft of jewellery at Heathlands Village care home. Such a breach of trust is absolutely unforgivable and we utterly condemn this deplorable act. 'The well-being of our residents remains our top priority, and we operate a policy of zero tolerance in relation to such issues. Any breach of trust will result in instant dismissal, and we will take measures to ensure that the guilty party will be prevented from working within the care sector again. 'These kinds of incidents are extremely rare at Heathlands Village but no less devastating for the people affected when they do occur. 'We employ around 400 staff, all of whom undergo thorough CRB checks and rigorous screening methods. We have full compliance with the Care Quality Commission and Bury has assessed our care as ""excellent"". 'Unfortunately, an isolated act such as this overshadows the level of care that we strive so hard to provide at Heathlands Village.' Mrs Rose's daughter-in-law, Fran Rose, said: 'The care home have been absolutely fantastic. Ruth is a really positive lady and she's certainly one of the easier ladies to look after. 'She's quiet and very, very gentle. I was with Lou that evening when the theft was discovered and the staff were devastated.

A mother suffered an agonising death after drinking from a Sprite bottle that she later claimed contained cannabis fertiliser, an inquest heard. Sarah Jane Moss, 23, drank the liquid while staying at boyfriend Daniel Fairbrother’s home, causing her to vomit blood as her face swelled to twice its normal size. The damage to her throat was so significant that her oesophagus was corroded to the size of a 'piece of string’ and her weight plummeted to 5st. Agonising: Sarah Jane Moss, 23, died six months after consuming liquid from a Sprite bottle that she later told her mother was fertiliser for cannabis plants, an inquest at Stockport Magistrates' Court heard . Miss Moss, from Mottram, Hyde, died six months later, the inquest at Stockport Magistrates' Court heard. She initially claimed that the liquid was a fluid used in a fish tank fluid before later telling her mother Lynn Moss that the liquid was used to fertilise cannabis plants. She also claimed there had been a cannabis farm at her boyfriend's house. The inquest heard that Miss Moss had been staying at Mr Fairbrother's Stalybridge house in January 2011 when she drank from the Sprite bottle stored on a kitchen shelf. Boyfriend: Miss Moss had been staying with her boyfriend Daniel Fairbrother, pictured outside Stockport Magistrates' Court, when she drank from the bottle that was sitting on a shelf in the house . Daniel, described as her ‘on-off’ boyfriend since 2009 and the father of her child, called his mother to say Sarah was sick. Mrs Fairbrother arrived at the house with her other son Richard, before taking Miss Moss to hospital. Medical staff, who were told Sarah had drunk fish tank fluid, sent her home with instructions to drink lots of fluids. But when her condition worsened two days later, her mother was forced to bring her back to hospital. Mrs Moss told the inquest: 'Julie said she had drunk liquid for the fish tank and at that stage I didn’t feel any panic. 'But when I pulled up and Sarah came out I had the shock of my life.' She said Miss Moss had sores and a red rash round her mouth, her face had doubled in size, that she was struggling to speak and was throwing up blood. Staff at the hospital were once again told that Miss Moss had drunk fish tank fluid. When doctors were finally given the Sprite bottle by Mr Fairbrother’s family, tests revealed it had a dangerously high level of alkaline. Doctors said they were in ‘unknown territory' and had to phone the National Poison Information Service for advice. After six days in hospital, Miss Moss discharged herself because she felt uncomfortable on the ward - but she was readmitted four days later in severe pain. Her condition worsened over the following months - with tests revealing her oesophagus was as thin as a string - and she was transferred to a surgical unit in February where it was planned to remove the damaged part of her oesophagus. Family: Daniel Fairbrother (second left) pictured with his mother Julie (second right) and brother Richard (right), who took Miss Moss to hospital after the initial incident, as well as James Fairbrother outside the court . Miss Moss had an operation at Tameside hospital on June 20 but three days later she was found to have an infection. Following further emergency surgery she died. Mrs Moss said: 'That was the last time I spoke to Sarah. She said ‘I love you mum, I’ll be all right’.' Mrs Moss said that her daughter told her on that she had consumed fertiliser. But Mr Fairbrother’s mother Julie told the inquest his family still believed the bottle was filled with fish tank fluid. The coroner asked both Mrs Fairbrother and Richard Fairbrother if they believed Sarah had drunk cannabis fertiliser. Both said they believed the substance to be ph neutraliser for a fish tank. Home office pathologist Dr Philip Plumb told the inquest Sarah died of peritonitis aesophagul and gastric strictures caused by the ingestion of a corrosive substance. Sarah, a former pupil at Copley High school, had a young daughter who is now four. The inquest continues.

It reveals an incredible story of water moving around the globe - from freshwater gushing from the Amazon River's mouth to an invisible seam dividing the salty Arabian Sea from the fresher waters of the Bay of Bengal. The amazing image below was created from the first full year of surface salinity data captured by NASA's Aquarius spacecraft. The groundbreaking maps are helping experts find out exactly how the Earth's oceans operate - and if they are changing. Scroll down to see an animated version of the image . Red colours represent areas of high salinity, while blue shades represent areas of low salinity, and the data from Nasa's spacecraft covers the period from Dec. 2011 through Dec. 2012 . Launched June 10, 2011, Aquarius is NASA's first satellite instrument specifically . built to study the salt content of ocean surface waters. The salinity sensor detects the . microwave emissivity of the top approximately 1 inch (1 to 2 . centimeters) of ocean water - a physical property that varies depending . on temperature and saltiness. The instrument collects data in . 240-mile-wide (386 kilometers) swaths in an orbit designed to obtain a . complete survey of global salinity of ice-free oceans every seven days. 'With a bit more than a year of data, we are seeing some surprising patterns, especially in the tropics,' said Aquarius Principal Investigator Gary Lagerloef, of Earth & Space Research in Seattle. 'We see features evolve rapidly over time.' Researchers say one of the features . that stands out most clearly is a large patch of highly saline water . across the North Atlantic. This area, the saltiest anywhere in . the open ocean, is analogous to deserts on land, where little rainfall . and a lot of evaporation occur. A NASA-funded expedition, the . Salinity Processes in the Upper ocean Regional Study (SPURS), traveled . to the North Atlantic's saltiest spot last year to analyze the causes . behind this high salt concentration and to validate Aquarius . measurements. 'My conclusion after five weeks out . at sea and analyzing five weekly maps of salinity from Aquarius while we . were there was that indeed, the patterns of salinity variation seen . from Aquarius and by the ship were similar,' said Eric Lindstrom, NASA's . physical oceanography program scientist. It is hoped the mission could provide data for several years. An earlier global map of the salinity, or saltiness, of Earth's ocean surface produced by NASA's new Aquarius instrument reveals a rich tapestry of global salinity patterns . 'The Aquarius prime mission is scheduled to run for three years but there is no reason to think that the instrument could not be able to provide valuable data for much longer than that,' said Gene Carl Feldman, Aquarius project manager at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. 'The instrument has been performing flawlessly and our colleagues in Argentina are doing a fantastic job running the spacecraft, providing us a nice, stable ride. 'The first year of the Aquarius mission has mostly been about understanding how the instruments and algorithms are performing,' Feldman said. 'Now that we have overcome the major hurdles, we can really begin to focus on understanding what the data are telling us about how the ocean works, how it affects weather and climate, and what new insights we can gain by having these remarkable salinity measurements.'","Video and images created using a year of data from NASA's Aquarius spacecraft .

Michael Pooley, 35, dated the teenager for four months, taking her on day trips and to a hotel, until her parents found out what was going on. Judge Alan Goldsack QC said he hoped Pooley's sentence acted as a warning to any others in his profession 'thinking of behaving in this way'. He who told him: 'Parents are entitled to expect when their children leave home to go to school that they are going to be safe and teachers will protect rather than abuse them.' In court: Michael Pooley was sentenced to 18 months in prison at Sheffield Crown Court after having a relationship with a 15-year-old pupil . Judge Goldsack heard how a mutual relationship developed between Pooley and a girl, who is now 17-years-old and cannot be named, at a secondary school in West Yorkshire. He was told how this started with the girl having a crush on the teacher and they began to see each other out of school, eventually going on trips together and staying in a hotel. Prosecutor Laura Marshall said: 'It was very much a mutual relationship. The two had talked about children and marriage, but this was put off by Pooley after he said her parents wouldn’t be happy about the idea.' Sheffield Crown Court heard how the pair communicated using Facebook over a four-month period and Pooley even set up two fake accounts on the social media site so the girl’s parents would not spot he was talking to their daughter. Judge Goldsack told Pooley: 'You agreed to meet her in the long school holidays and had regular Facebook contact with her. 'You then created two fake accounts to deliberately deceive her parents, should they look at her computer. 'Twice you took the girl without the consent of her parents on day trips. Undoubtedly, she had a strong attachment to you.' The court heard Pooley was confronted after friends of the girl alerted their parents to the relationship. The court heard that despite the defendant admitting touching the girl sexually, there was no penetrative sex between them and Pooley had continually dismissed the teenager’s requests for him to 'take her virginity'. Pooley, who was a teacher at a school in Wakefield, told the girl he wanted to wait until she was 16-years-old, the judge was told. Sheffield Crown Court heard that the girl in question now has medical issues and will have to take medication for the rest of her life due to stress. Pooley, of Miles Hill Terrace, Potternewton, Leeds - who stood in the dock wearing a dark suit, grey shirt and a grey striped tie - admitted seven counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of child abduction at a previous hearing. He was jailed for 18 months, ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register and was banned from working with children indefinitely.","Michael Pooley, 35, met the teenager at a West Yorkshire secondary school .

A link between obesity and the deadliest form of skin cancer has been uncovered by scientists. They found that the gene most strongly related to being very overweight also increases the risk of malignant melanoma, implying that people who are obese may be at increased risk of developing skin cancer. Until now experts thought that the illness was primarily caused by intense sunbathing or frequent use of sunbeds. Scientists have found the gene most strongly related to being very overweight also increases the risk of malignant melanoma . But researchers from Cancer Research UK and the University of Leeds believe the gene called FTO may also have a role. Their study, published in the journal Nature Genetics, looked at the DNA of 73,000 patients including 13,000 with skin cancer. Those with a particular variation of the FTO gene were far more likely to develop the illness. Malignant melanoma is the fifth most common cancer in the UK with around 12,800 new cases and around 2,200 deaths each year. Experts previously thought that malignant melanoma was primarily caused by intense sunbathing or frequent use of sunbeds (file picture) Lead author Dr Mark Iles, said: ‘This is the first time to our knowledge that this major obesity gene, already linked to multiple illnesses, has been linked to melanoma. ‘This raises the question whether future research will reveal that the gene has a role in even more diseases.’ Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK’s senior science information manager, said: ‘These are fascinating early findings that, if confirmed in further research, could potentially provide new targets for the development of drugs to treat melanoma. ‘Advances in understanding more about the molecules driving skin cancer have already enabled us to develop important new skin cancer drugs that will make a real difference for patients.’","Scientists find gene FTO may have role in obesity and skin cancer .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 14:55 EST, 5 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:55 EST, 5 March 2013 . A new study offers more compelling evidence that life expectancy for some U.S. women is actually falling, a disturbing trend that experts can't explain. The latest research found that women age 75 and younger are dying at higher rates than previous years in nearly half of the nation's counties - many of them rural and in the South and West. Curiously, for men, life expectancy has held steady or improved in nearly all counties. The study is the latest to spot this pattern, especially among disadvantaged white women. Trend: A map of the U.S. shows women's deaths by age; those in the South lived much shorter lives than those in other areas of the country . Weight of a nation: The latest research found that women age 75 and younger are dying at higher rates than previous years in nearly half of the nation's counties; the early deaths were linked to obesity and poverty . Some leading theories blame higher smoking rates, obesity and less education, but several experts said they simply don't know why. Women have long outlived men, and the latest numbers show the average life span for a baby girl born today is 81, and for a baby boy, it's 76. But the gap has been narrowing and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown women's longevity is not growing at the same pace as men's. The phenomenon of some women losing ground appears to have begun in the late 1980s, though studies have begun to spotlight it only in the last few years. Trying to figure out why is 'the hot topic right now, trying to understand what's going on,' said Jennifer Karas Montez, a Harvard School of Public Health sociologist who has been focused on the life expectancy decline but had no role in the new study. Researchers also don't know exactly how many women are affected. Montez says a good estimate is roughly 12 percent. The study, released Monday by the journal Health Affairs, found declining life expectancy for women in about 43 percent of the nation's counties. The researchers, David Kindig and Erika Cheng of the University of Wisconsin, looked at federal death data and other information for nearly all 3,141 U.S. counties over 10 years. They calculated mortality rates for women age 75 and younger, sometimes called 'premature death rates,' because many of those deaths are considered preventable. Many counties have such small populations that even slight changes in the number of deaths produce dramatic swings in the death rate from year to year. To try to stabilize the numbers, the researchers computed some five-year averages. They also used statistical tricks to account for factors like income and education. They found that nationwide, the rate of women dying younger than would be expected fell from 324 to 318 per 100,000. But in 1,344 counties, the average premature death rate rose, from 317 to about 333 per 100,000. Deaths rates rose for men in only about 100 counties. 'We were surprised' by how much worse women did in those counties, and by the geographic variations, Kindig said. Up in smoke: The study also suggested that women who smoke or who have little education also died at an earlier age . Two years ago, a study led by the University of Washington's Dr. Christopher Murray also looked at county-level death rates. It too found that women were dying sooner, especially in the South. Some other studies that focused on national data have highlighted steep declines in life expectancy for white women who never earned a high school diploma. Meanwhile, life expectancy seems to be growing for more educated and affluent women. Some experts also have suggested smokers or obese women are dragging down life expectancy. The Murray and Kindig studies both spotlight regional differences. Some of the highest smoking rates are in Southern states, and the proportion of women who failed to finish high school is also highest in the South. 'I think the most likely explanation for why mortality is getting worse is those factors are just stronger in those counties,' Murray said, adding that abuse of Oxycontin and other drugs also may add to the problem. Some also think the statistics could reflect a migration of healthier women out of rural areas, leaving behind others who are too poor and unhealthy to relocate. That would change the rate, and make life expectancy in a county look worse, explained Bob Anderson of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistic. 'We shouldn't jump to the conclusion that more people are getting sicker in these geographic areas than previously,' he said. But that is open to debate. Migration didn't seem to affect male death rates. Murray disagrees with the theory, saying he has tracked a great deal of movement from urban areas to less-populated counties.","New study released by journal Health Affairs says that while life expectancy is climbing for educated women, it is falling for those without education .

Two teenage boys from Wyoming have been charged in a triple homicide targeting . a 40-year-old woman and her elderly parents after the suspects told police their . goal was to steal the family’s Audi and flee to Denver. Stephen Hammer, 19, and Tanner Vanpelt, 18, both of Cody, made their first . court appearance Tuesday morning in a case that has rattled residents of the . small town of Clark near the Wyoming-Montana border. Each is charged with 11 felony counts, including premeditated murder, use of . a deadly weapon and robbery. Some of the charges could carry the death penalty. Accused killers: Tanner Vanpelt, 18, left, and Stephen Hammer, 19, right, have been charged with 11 felony counts each in connection to a triple homicide, which took place during an alleged car theft . Innocent victim: Ildiko Freitas, 40, was found shot dead inside the Clark, Wyoming, home alongside her parents . They were arrested after neighbors described two young men entering the . house Saturday where the victim's bodies were found at around 11.15am. The neighbors saw two vehicles speeding away, including a black Audi . belonging to Ildiko Freitas, 40, who owned the house with her husband, John. Freitas and her parents, Janos Volgyesi, 69, and Hildegard Volgyesi, 70, were . found dead inside the house. John Freitas, who works in the oil industry, was away on business . at the time of the murders, Powell Tribune reported. Family torn apart: Freitas, pictured left with her father, Janos Volgyesi, and right with her mother, Hildegard, emigrated from Germany and spent years in California until the elderly couple retired and moved to Wyoming . Police tracked down the vehicles several miles from the crime scene and . arrested Vanpelt and Hammer without incident. According to court documents filed Tuesday, after being arrested, Hammer . told investigators they used two 9 mm handguns the pair stole along with eight . other weapons last week from a Cody gun store and went to the house to steal . the Audi and leave the state. Vanpelt got into an argument with Freitas over the car and that's when he . pulled out a gun and shot her, according to the documents. Remote locale: Freitas, her husband and the woman's parents shared a home on Big View Road in the small community of Clarke, where they had moved six years prior from California . Hammer then went into the basement after hearing something there and shot a . woman he encountered, Freitas' mother, Hildegard Volgyesi. Vanpelt told authorities . he also went downstairs and shot the woman twice because it appeared she wasn't . dead. When Vanpelt was taking the Audi, the two young men encountered Freitas' father, Janos Volgyesi, in the garage and Vanpelt shot him twice in the back, . the documents state. After their arrest, Hammer and Vanpelt led investigators to an irrigation . pipe several miles from the shooting scene where they had hidden the two 9 mm . handguns. It's unclear how the teens knew about the Audi. Residents of Clark said . Hammer used to live with his family in town but had moved away several years . ago. Hammer told investigators he was ‘sorry for shooting “that lady,”’ according . to the documents. Vanpelt said ‘they had not planned it to go down this way.’ Neighbors on Big View Road where the slain family had lived said that they . noticed a suspicious white sedan pull up to the Freitas' house around 11am . Saturday. Two young men went in the front door. Life cut short: Freitas worked as a registered nurse until last year, and she and her husband were planing to move to Colorado, where they had bought a second home . About 20 minutes later, the white Ford Taurus sedan and Freitas’ black Audi A4 . were seen speeding away, with the family’s dogs in pursuit, according to neighbors. Local residents went to check up on the homeowners and return their pets, . only to discover  Ildiko Freitas and her . father Janos Volgyesi shot dead. Hildegard Volgyesi’s body was found in the . basement by police who responded to a 911 call. Clark volunteer firefighter and retired Baltimore cop Jerry Ruth was one of . the first on the scene. He gathered some information and spoke to witnesses, . but left after local police arrived. As Ruth was driving away from the Freitas' home en route to a baby shower, . he spotted the white Ford and Audi on the road ahead of him and called 911, . leading to the arrest of the two suspects. Freitas grew up in Bakersfield, California, and attended the University of . Wyoming before moving to Clark with her husband six or seven years ago. Last year, the couple bought another house in Loveland, Colorado, that they . had been renovating and were planning to move into sometime soon, said neighbor . David Mathiesen. Freitas' brother, Thomas Volgyesi, told The Associated Press . Monday that he knew of no connection between the suspects and his family. Volgyesi said his parents retired and moved from Sothern . California to Wyoming four years ago for its more relaxed lifestyle. Average Joe: Vanpelt graduated in December 2011 from Cody High School, where the principal recalled that the teen wasn't involved in sports or clubs, but also never had serious discipline issues . Drastic change: Shocked neighbors described Hammer as a likable and well-mannered boy . ‘They were the only family I have and I'm left with nothing . now,’ Volgyesi said. ‘To have them taken away from me like this, I'm not . registering it yet.’ The Volgyesis and their children, Ildiko and Thomas, . immigrated to the United States from Germany decades ago. ‘They were a fantastic family,’ said friend Teri Taylor . Thompson of Bakersfield, California. The woman described Mrs Volgyesi as a kind woman, and said . that her daughter was very devoted to her parents. Ildiko Freitas worked as a registered nurse at West Park . Hospital from September 2008 until September 2012, according to hospital . spokesman Joel Hunt. On her Facebook page, the woman wrote that she was unemployed. Vanpelt's father, Robb Vanpelt, said Monday that his son was not living with . him and had not been in serious trouble before his arrest, which was ‘pretty . much totally out of the blue.’ Tanner Vanpelt graduated in December 2011 from Cody High School, where . principal Brandon Jensen recalled that the teenager wasn't involved in . athletics or after-school clubs, but also never had serious discipline issues. Hammer attended the school only a year before transferring during his . freshman year, Jensen said. A former neighbor to the Hammer family, Jennifer Bays, . recalled Stephen as a likable and well-mannered boy. ‘I can’t understand what happened to him,’ Bays wrote in a . comment on the Tribune’s website. ‘It has shown me that you REALLY never know . someone.’ Residents of Clark said it's the first murders they can recall in decades in . the rural community dominated by agriculture that sits near the Clarks Fork of . the Yellowstone River.","Stephen Hammer, 19, and Tanner Vanpelt, 18, charged with 11 felony counts .

Leaky: A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority admitted that the ice was probably the result of a 'leak' from a plane . Miss Guy, from Pattingham, Staffordshire, was in the process of trying to sell the caravan for £5,000  but she says it is now worthless. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority admitted that the ice was probably the result of a 'leak' from a plane - and possibly from the lavatories. Miss Guy said: 'It is just a miracle that neither myself or my children were in there when it came crashing down - it could have killed someone. 'I heard a loud bang at 7am and thought someone was kicking the front door in but when I went downstairs there was nothing.' She added: 'The block of ice must have been 18 inches in size as that's the size of the hole. There is another hole the same size in the floor. 'There was brown and yellow ice all over the place. It had been six or seven hours and it still hadn't all melted - it must have been massive. Miss Guy said that nobody was liable, according to the Civil Aviation Authority, but she said 'someone should be - I could have died'. She lived lived in the 32ft by 12ft caravan for two years while she had a barn converted on her land and moved out in November. She lives on a flight path 40 miles from Birmingham Airport and thinks the ice fell from one of the many planes that regularly flies over her home. A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority said such falling blocks do happen 'now and then'. He said: 'What happens is there is some sort of leak on the plane and a body of water builds up on the outside. Straight through: A closeup of the huge hole that was left in the caravan floor.

Deadly: The mother-of-two said that she wanted somebody to accept liability as she 'could have been killed' 'When the plane is at height it freezes and then when the plane starts to descend it heats up and starts to thaw and falls off. 'The source of the leaks are one of three - the toilet facilities, the air conditioning or running water. 'These incidents are very rare but they do happen now and then.' The spokesman said the CAA would be checking with flight companies to see which service was flying overhead at the time so maintenance checks can be carried out. Over the past 40 years there have been five recorded cases of people being hit by 'waste' ice from plane toilets.

Gay politician Robert Biedron, left, and transgender politician Anna Grodzka, right, have been promoted to the front bench this week as a reaction to Lech Walesa's comments . Robert Biedron, the progressive party Palikot's Movement's first openly gay lawmaker, will sit on the front bench this week. The party's leader Janusz Palikot has also promoted transgender lawmaker Anna Grodzka to the front row for a three-day session starting on Wednesday. The front row, which is closest to the Speaker and gets the most television attention, is generally reserved for party leaders and senior lawmakers in Poland's Parliament. The Cabinet sits in a . separate section. Walesa's comments even provoked a rebuke from his son Jaroslaw Walesa, who is a politician at the European Parliament. He said homosexual politicians should be in Parliament, adding: 'Gays, lesbians, the homosexuals, have the right to have a representation.' Walesa's son said he was shocked by his father's words, which 'should not have been said.' Walesa angered liberal Poles when he was interviewed on news channel TVN 24 about homosexual rights. He was speaking after . parliament defeated draft laws that would have given limited legal . rights to homosexual couples. Walesa was speaking after parliament defeated draft laws that would have given some rights to gay couples . Walesa's son European Parliament politician Jaroslaw Walesa said homosexuals 'have the right to representation' When asked about where homosexuals should sit in the parliamentary chamber, he said: 'No minority should climb all over the majority. Homosexuals should even sit behind a wall, and not somewhere at the front. 'They must know they are a minority and adapt themselves to smaller things.' Ryszard Nowak, a former conservative . member of parliament, reported Walesa to the prosecutor's office late on . Saturday, accusing him of promoting hatred of sexual minorities. 'The report was filed on Saturday, . when the office is closed,' prosecutors' office spokeswoman Barbara . Sworobowicz told Reuters. 'We will examine it, starting on Monday, if it . meets the legal definition of a crime.' Palikot said: 'Walesa's words contradict democracy because that form of government is based on protecting minorities.' Biedron invited the former president to a meeting to discuss homosexual rights, which has been declined. Biedron said in a separate interview on TVN 24: 'Walesa was a hero. I dream of meeting . Walesa and talking to him about it. 'I think Walesa doesn't realise the kind of society we are now. Walesa went astray somewhere.' Walesa became a world-famous dissident when he campaigned for human rights and freedom in Poland's communist era. In the 1980s Walesa, a Roman Catholic, led the Solidarity freedom movement that peacefully toppled communism in Poland. He served as president between 1990 and 1995. Poland has been struggling with issues such as gay rights, abortion, legalisation of soft drugs and the role of the church in public life as younger Poles seeking a more secular society clash with a deeply religious older generation. The Senate will discuss whether to press outgoing Czech President Vaclav Klaus with high treason . The Czech parliament's upper house is meeting to discuss whether to charge outgoing President Vaclav Klaus with high treason. Mr Klaus provoked protests and legal concerns when he announced an amnesty to nearly one third of prisoners in January. Up to 7,000 inmates were eligible for freedom in the plans, which he said was done to 'give a fresh chance' to people who were not repeat offenders and to mark 20 years of independence. Prisoners serving sentences of more than 10 years were not affected and all inmates older than 75 years, providing they were serving a short sentence, and those serving less than one year were eligible for release. Mr Klaus infuriated many Czechs when court proceedings in several high-profile fraud cases and financial scams were halted as part of the amnesty. Only the Czech Senate has the power to file high treason charges at the Constitutional Court. A majority of lawmakers in the 81-seat house, which is controlled by the left-wing opposition, has to approve that to happen. Today's session will be held behind closed doors. The worst punishment Klaus faces is the loss of the presidential job and his final term in office ends Thursday.","Lech Walesa said homosexual politicians should sit behind a wall .

A horror film fan tortured and stabbed a homeless man to death before rubbing salt into his wounds in a chilling echo of teen movie The Loved Ones, a court heard. Andrew Nall’s body was found with strange wounds cut into the flesh, salt rubbed onto his arm and hand and a creamy substance put in his eyes. One of the defendants, Gary George, was fan of the violent horror film, which features a scene in which a man is stabbed multiple times before salt is rubbed in his wounds, Chester Crown Court was told. Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, said defendant George was a fan of the 2009 Australian film The Loved Ones (pictured) Mr Nall, 53, was 'beaten, kicked and stabbed dozens of times' at a flat in Eversley Park, Chester, on August 31 last year. Christine Holleran, 50, and Gary George, 41, went on trial yesterday for murder. The pair deny killing 53-year-old Mr Nall and George also denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent to Brian James Riley. In his opening statement Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting, said: 'One night last summer, a 53-year-old man called Andrew Mackenzie Nall was subjected to a brutal, ruthless and sadistic attack in his own home here in Chester. 'He was tortured, he was murdered. He was lying in his bed, his genitals partly exposed, his body surrounded by a pool of blood.' The jury was told George, of no fixed abode, was known to both Andrew Nall and Holleran, previously of Liverpool. 'He was homeless, openly gay, a heavy drinker and, say the prosecution, had a keen interest in witchcraft,' said Mr Unsworth. George, the jury was told, regularly . watched horror films and Mr Unsworth said one film George had a . particular interest in was violent horror film The Loved Ones. 'In a chilling precursor to what . befell Andrew Nall, one scene in that film depicts a man being stabbed . on multiple occasions before throwing salt in his wounds,' he said. Chester Crown Court was told the violent . horror film features a scene in which a man is stabbed multiple . times . He said it was unclear exactly when Mr Nall was killed but there was no doubt George and Holleran had been in his flat on the night in question. 'This was not a burglary that went wrong,' he said. 'There is no mystique around who was present at the time of the attack. Christine Holleran was there, Gary George was there. 'With Andrew Nall dead, they simply left him and went to the supermarket together. They spent money in the supermarket together, money which was almost certainly Mr Nall's.' Mr Unsworth said George is also accused of attacking Mr Reilly about 10 hours later in Chester city centre. 'Gary George, say the prosecution, smashed a bottle then used it to attack Mr Reilly,' he told the jury. 'That too as you will see was an extremely violent attack.' 'With Andrew Nall dead, they [Holleran and George] simply left him and went to the supermarket together.' Ian Unsworth QC, prosecuting . Mr Unsworth said Mr Nall had been in a relationship with a woman called Maria Griffin but Holleran had been living with him at his flat. Last August, the police were called to the flat several times and on one occasion Holleran told officers she and Mr Nall were getting married. Mr Unsworth said the pair’s relationship grew 'strained' in August and things came to a head in dramatic fashion on August 30. He said Mr Nall had been with Holleran that day and had withdrawn £100 from his bank account. They got in a taxi together at about 1.45pm and Holleran was abusing Mr Nall during the journey. Mr Unsworth said: 'It seems Mrs Holleran was abusive to Mr Nall and said something about that he had done something to her that she would not forgive him for.' Later that day, Mr Nall and George were bought wine from a Tesco Express store and cider and sherry from a McColl’s shop. 'That was at about 6.30pm - Andrew Nall was not seen alive again,' said Mr Unsworth. He said it seemed the pair then went to Mr Nall’s flat where they were later joined by Holleran. Together with George, Holleran went to Bargain Booze off licence at about 9.30pm that night to buy more alcohol. Mr Unsworth said: 'They purchased some sherry in Bargain Booze and Gary George spoke to the shop assistant and said something about Christine Holleran being raped the other day and that he would 'get him back'. 'That night Mr Nall was killed.' On the morning of August 31, Mr Nall’s neighbour noticed something unusual on his doorstep and took a photograph of a knife, pair of scissors and a tie cut into pieces. Holleran and George went to Morrison’s supermarket at about 7.50am that morning and bought some cider. Mr Unsworth told the jury he believed the cider was bought using money taken from Mr Nall’s wallet - possibly after he had died - and George wore Mr Nall's jacket to the supermarket. He said Holleran was interviewed by police and told them she did not even remember going to Morrison's that morning and said the money could have been owed to her by Mr Nall. The trial, expected to last three weeks, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Andrew Nall's body was found with strange wounds cut into the flesh .

A woman paid $22,000 to have a Connecticut couple's baby fled across the country and had the child after refusing their instructions to abort it when ultrasound scans revealed a series of disabilities. Five months into the pregnancy last year, surrogate mother Crystal Kelley was told the bad news by doctors - beginning a tragic and heartbreaking ordeal for her and the baby's parents. Following a legal battle with the parents, Crystal, 29, flew to Michigan to give birth according to CNN, leaving the child to be fostered, instead of being raised by either herself or the intended parents. Scroll Down for Video . Surrogate Crystal Kelley and the parents of the child she was carrying went through an exhaustive legal battle after she refused to abort the baby she was carrying . In August of 2011, Crystal, who has two children of her own, fell into financial difficulties and offered her services through an established surrogacy agency to a couple who desperately wanted a fourth child but couldn't have one. They paid $22,000 to Crystal and then an embryo the pair had left over from a previous round of in-vitro fertilization was used on October 8th. Just ten days later Crystal fell pregnant and the thrilled couple asked to be as involved as possible throughout the following nine months. The would-be mother phoned daily to offer morning sickness sympathy and gave Crystal and her two daughters Christmas presents and even paid out the monthly surrogate fee early to help her out. 'She said, 'I want you to come to us with anything because you're going to be part of our lives forever,' said Kelley to CNN. In February though, everything changed when ultrasound tests began to show that the baby was not developing as was hoped. Crystal Kelley became pregnant in October 2011 and at first enjoyed a healthy relationship with the parents . Disaster struck though in the fifth-month of the pregnancy when a scan revealed the unborn child had significant abnormalities including a cleft lip and palate (pictured) Doctors suspected that the baby had a cleft lip and palate, a cyst in her brain and serious heart defects. They couldn't even see a stomach or a spleen. On February 16th, 2012, with the parents at the ultrasound with Crystal, their worst fears were confirmed. Physicians at Hartford Hospital said the baby would need several surgeries after birth and had only a 25 per cent chance of living a normal life. After this bombshell news, a letter was sent to Crystal's midwife, in which Dr Elisa Gianferrari, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at Hartford Hospital, and Leslie Ciarleglio, a genetic counselor, outlined the parents' wishes. 'Given the ultrasound findings, (the parents) feel that the interventions required to manage (the baby's medical problems) are overwhelming for an infant, and that it is a more humane option to consider pregnancy termination,' they wrote according to CNN. However, Crystal, who is staunchly religious, disagreed and said that 'all efforts should be made to give the baby a chance'. For the parents though, who had gone through three previous premature births that left two of their children with medical problems, the abortion was the most humane option. Crystal refused to have an abortion - setting into motion a series of legal battles which led to her fleeing the state of Connecticut for Michigan . Hartford Hospital: The scan of the unborn child was performed here in February of 2012 . But the disagreement turned sour and developed into an emotional stand-off between the parents and Crystal. 'They said they didn't want to bring a baby into the world only for that child to suffer. ... They said I should try to be God-like and have mercy on the child and let her go,' said Crystal to CNN. 'I told them that they had chosen me to carry and protect this child, and that was exactly what I was going to do,' said Kelley. 'I told them it wasn't their decision to play God.' Unsure of their legal rights, the parents were stunned to discover that only Crystal could arrange and go through with an abortion. But the couple soon let Crystal's agency at Surrogacy International know that if she brought the pregnancy to term they wouldn't be the baby's legal parents - leaving the child to her. Crystal questioned whether she wanted to become a mother again, especially since the only income she could count on was the surrogacy fee and child support from her own daughters' father. Rita Kron from Surrogacy International explained to Crystal the realities of bringing up a disabled child and said the parents would pay her $10,000 to have the termination. Crystal refused - demanding $15,000 to have an abortion. Crystal already had two daughters of her own and left for Ann Arbor in Michigan to have the child - which she arranged to give up for adoption in that state . Claiming this was a moment of weakness, Crystal told CNN that she immediately regretted the counter-offer, which was totally refused by the parents. With the 24-week legal limit for a termination rapidly approaching, the desperate couple hired a lawyer. 'You are obligated to terminate this pregnancy immediately,' wrote Douglas Fishman, an attorney in West Hartford, Connecticut. 'You have squandered precious time.' He reminded her that she had signed a contract agreeing to 'abortion in case of severe fetus abnormality'. But the contract did not stipulate what this meant. Fishman said she was in breach of contract and that if she did not abort she would be sued for the money already paid, which was $8,000 and the medical fees and legal fees to date. Hiring her own lawyer, Michael DePrimo, an attorney in Hamden, Connecticut, Crystal fought back by sticking to her resolution not to have the abortion. However, the story took another turn when the parents changed their minds and said they would now exercise their legal rights to take custody of the child - but after the birth would surrender her to the state of Connecticut for foster care. After a difficult birth - Baby.S . was born in June and was handed over for adoption after Crystal and the child's parents came to a legal agreement . At this point, DePrimo explained to his client that the law was firmly on the parents' side. However, Crystal now decided that she couldn't stand the thought of the baby in foster care. Running out of options, Crystal was advised that she could go to a state where the birth-mother, and not the genetic parents, would be considered the legal guardian. So, on April 11th, in her seventh month of pregnancy, Crystal moved her daughters to Michigan and only as she was driving away told her attorney to inform the couple of her plans. 'Once I realized that I was going to be the only person really fighting for her, that Mama bear instinct kicked in, and there was no way I was giving up without a fight,' said Kelley to CNN. Choosing Michigan to have the baby was also a medical decision too - C.S. Mott Children's Hospital at the University of Michigan has one of the best pediatric heart programs in the country. Once firmly established in a small, cheap, sub-let in Ann Arbor, Crystal came to another realization - she could not keep the child, but she would give the child up for adoption in Michigan. Locating a couple who wanted to take on a special needs child, Crystal prepared to come to term and hand the child over. Baby S will need years of medical attention and operations to cure the problems she was born with . With one month to go, the parents filed an order in Connecticut Superior Court that they wanted to be the legal guardians - but they were forced to admit that the wife was not the baby's genetic mother as an anonymous egg donor had been used. As this latest legal battle was thrashed out in court, the child, a girl, was born on June 25th weighing six pounds, with Crystal's name on the birth certificate. Three weeks passed until both sides came to an understanding - the father gave up his paternal rights so long as he and his wife could keep in touch with the Michigan adoptive parents. In the seven months since, the couple have visited the child known as Baby S and held her in their arms. 'They do care about her well-being. They do care about how she's doing,' the unnamed adoptive mother said to CNN. But the child's medical problems have become far more serious than the ultrasound back in Connecticut first revealed. Baby S. with her adoptive mother (left) and Crystal (right) aged seven-months old and now living in Michigan . The seven-month-old child has a birth defect called holoprosencephaly, where the brain doesn't completely divide into distinct hemispheres. She also has a condition called heterotaxy, which means many of her internal organs, such as her liver and stomach, are in the wrong places in her body. Her head is small, her right ear is deformed, she has a cleft lip and a cleft palate, and a long list of complex heart defects. Already. she's had one open-heart surgery and surgery on her intestines, and over the next year she'll have one or two more cardiac surgeries. If the child, named Baby S for legal reasons, does survive, there's a 50 per cent chance she won't be able to walk or talk. As far as Crystal is concerned though, she did the right thing, even though some people have sent her hate messages through her blog, Surrogate Insanity. 'I can't tell you how many people told me that I was bad, that I was wrong, that I should go have an abortion, that I would be damned to hell,' she said. 'No matter what anybody told me, I became her mother.'","Surrogate mother Crystal Kelley, 29, refused to have abortion after abnormalities spotted on ultrasound .

The number of people cycling to work is up 17 per cent as cash-strapped Britons increasingly get on their bikes to save money and give their health a daily boost, according to a new report. The popularity of commuting by bike has increased by 760,000 in England and Wales in the past ten years, a detailed analysis by Halfords of the latest census statistics has revealed. The biking boom follows the success of the Government’s Cycle to Work Scheme which offers a 42 per cent discount on acquiring a bike with tax savings, and moves by many councils to encourage pedal power in order to decrease congestion and pollution, as well as to promote health and fitness. Biking boom: The popularity of commuting to work by bike increase by 17 per cent in England and Wales in the past ten years . It also reflects the huge interest in cycling promoted by the likes of Tour de France winner and Olympic hero Bradley Wiggins and fellow racers such as golden girls Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott. In 2001, the year of the last census, the number cycling to work was 650,000 people per year. But many urban areas that have introduced safer cycling routes and changed road layouts have seen numbers of cyclists more than double and the bike is even threatening the car in popularity as a regular choice of transport in some towns. Walking has also seen a major upturn, up 20 per cent, along with taking the train, up 42 per cent, and light railways, tram systems and underground, up 45 per cent. The number of people opting for a lift to work has dropped along with the use of motorbikes and scooters. Cycling heroes: The increase in bike riding reflects the huge interest in cycling promoted by the likes of Tour de France winner and Olympic hero Bradley Wiggins (pictured) and fellow racers such as golden girls Victoria Pendleton and Laura Trott . Growth in the numbers of people commuting by car has slowed, though its still the favoured way of travelling by 60 per cent of the working population. Surprisingly the census figures show a marked drop in the amount of people working from home, down a third from ten years ago. Halfords spokesman Keith Scott said: ‘As one of the biggest providers of Cycle to Work, we know just how popular this scheme has become, with growing interest from both employers and employees who are aware of how other transport costs are rising and how cycling is beneficial to their health. ‘It means less pollution and less traffic. The census figures reveal cycling is no longer just for a minority and shows how planners have to consider all road users when looking at the commuting habits in our towns and cities.’ Halfords studied the transport habits of almost 350 major towns, councils and metropolitan areas in England and Wales, detailed in the 2011 Census. Inner London has seen the biggest . rise in bike use, with the number of commuters cycling into work rising . by a huge 155 per cent over the past ten years. In Brighton, nominated a . Cycling Demonstration Town, bike use is up 118 per cent and the number . getting behind the wheel of a car in the seaside town has actually . fallen. Other metropolitan . areas embracing commuting by bike include Greater Manchester, where . cycling to work is up 25 per cent, the industrial North East with a rise . of 19 per cent, Merseyside up 12 per cent and in the conurbations that . make up West and South Yorkshire there has been a rise of 25 per cent. Getting to work: People are using the underground, tram and light railways much more - up 45 per cent, and walking has seen a major upturn of 20 per cent . Named the UK’s first Cycling City in 2008, Bristol received extra funding to promote pedal power and has seen the popularity of cycling to work double. In Newcastle it is up 83 per cent and in nearby Gateshead the growth is 63 per cent, in Bournemouth the rise is 47 per cent while university towns of Cambridge and Oxford have seen an increase of 39 per cent and 37 per cent, Bath is up 30 per cent and Southampton 24 per cent. Overall Cambridge has more cyclists per head of population than any other town in the UK. In the Welsh capital, Cardiff, sustainable travel campaigns have resulted in a growth of cycling to work by 68 per cent since 2001 while Nottingham, which also has an active cycling strategy, is up 17 per cent. It is not just major urban areas that are experiencing a rise in cycling, the district of South Gloucestershire has seen an increase of 41 per cent, East Sussex is up 34 per cent, and Central Bedfordshire, which is comprised of small towns and villages, is up 33 per cent. The Cycle to Work Alliance, which represents all the major bike retailers, said that last year saw a 7.9 per cent rise in the number taking part in the scheme compared with 2011. The biggest increase in applications came shortly after the end of the cycle-boosting Olympics and followed the announcement of inflation-busting increases in rail fares.

A biopic of 19th century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte could see the light of day five decades after the idea was originally conceived - as a television series. It may have proved to be Stanley Kubrick's Waterloo, but Steven Spielberg has revealed that he plans to develop a television version of the late director's biopic of Napoleon which never made it onto the big screen. Kubrick had meticulously planned the project, which he predicted would be 'the greatest movie ever made' but dropped it in the 1970s when he couldn't secure funding. Ambitious project: Director Steven Spielberg has said that he will produce a television series of Stanley Kubrick's unrealised biopic of Napoleon Bonaparte . Unrealised dream: Stanley Kubrick, pictured filming his last film Eyes Wide Shut in 1999, meticulously planned the project but dropped it when it failed to secure funding . The Lincoln director spoke of his plans in an interview on French television channel Canal Plus. He said he will collaborate on the project with Kubrick's family, though it is unclear whether the series is already being developed. Spielberg collaborated with his friend Kubrick on AI: Artificial Intelligence, which he released two years after Kubrick's 1999 death. That idea had been thought up by Kubrick, regarded as one of the greatest directors of all time, in the 1970s, but wasn't released until 2001 when Spielberg had written and directed it. The Shining director Kubrick originally wrote a first draft of a screenplay for a film about the life of Napoleon in 1961 after scouring more than 18,000 documents and books about the historic political leader. According to the Independent, he even sent one of assistant directors on 1968's 2001: A Space Odyssey to search for appropriate locations to shoot the film. Historic: A painting of 19th century French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte . Photographs were taken in Austerlitz and Waterloo as well as the island of Elba where Napoleon was exiled in 1814. According to letters exhibited in Los Angeles last year, some of the big acting names of the day, including Oskar Werner and Audrey Hepburn were approached by Kubrick to take on the film project's main roles, though Hepburn declined. A letter written by the director in 1971 to studio executives read: 'It's impossible to tell you what I'm going to do except to say that I expect to make the best movie ever made.' The project very nearly got the go ahead following the release of 2001, but was shelved again in 1970 for Kubrick to make A Clockwork Orange. But despite that setback, the director still vowed to shoot his project. A Clockwork Orange author Anthony Burgess was enlisted to write a novel on Napoleon for Kubrick to base his movie on. But even though the novel, Napoleon Sympthony, was published in 1974, the film project remained grounded. With studios reluctant to provide funding, Kubrick eventually abandoned the project. Spielberg, who was recently nominated in the Best Director category at the Academy Awards for Lincoln, is said to currently be working on a Second World War drama for HBO with Tom Hanks. He was announced last week as the president of the jury for this year's Cannes Film Festival. Stanley Kubrick was known for exerting complete artistic control over his projects. An American, Kubrick settled at Childwickbury Manor in Hertfordshire. His film credits include Lolita, Dr Strangelove, Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket. He died from a heart attack in his sleep aged 70 just days after shooting a final scene for Eyes Wide Shut starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Meticulous: Stanley Kubrick, pictured in 1966, poured through more than 18,000 books and documents for an initial draft of his biopic of Napoleon . Approached: Kubrick had Audrey Hepburn, left, and Oskar Werner, right, in mind for the film's top roles according to archive letters, though Hepburn had already declined . Napoleon Bonaparte . Napoleon Bonaparte was born to a family of gentry in Corsica in 1769. After being educated at military school, Napoleon rose through the ranks and became commander of the French army in Italy. He conquered Egypt in 1798 but his army was left stranded when his fleet was destroyed at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. As France faced turmoil, a coup d'etat saw Napoleon become First Consul of France in November 1799 and by 1804 he had become Emperor. During his reign he created the Bank of France, reinstated the Catholic Church as the state religion in France and reformed French law with the Napoleonic Code. He abandoned plans to invade Britain after a defeat at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 but went on to conquer large parts of Europe. But the Peninsular War begun in 1808 and five years of battle left French military resources depleted. The French invaded Russia in 1812 but were disastrously forced to retreat. Paris fell two years later and Napoleon was exiled to the island of Elba. He escaped exile in March 1815 and regained power briefly but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. Napoleon was imprisoned by the British on the island of St Helena and died in May 1821.","The Lincoln director will collaborate with Kubrick's family on the project .

The first man that a cannibalistic Maryland college student tried to kill and eat last spring is now suing the school saying that they had plenty of warnings and should have stopped the murderer before he had the chance to strike. Alexander Kinyua tried but failed to kill one man, before getting away with it and proceed to kill and eat another. Now the survivor is suing Morgan State University saying that they knew that Kinyua was a danger to others and they did nothing to stop him. Joshua Ceasar (right) was left with a fractured skull and a blinded eye following the brutal attack, allegedly carried out by Alex Kinyua (left) In the weeks and months leading up to . the first attack, Kinyua had been caught punching out walls at the ROTC . office and writing satanic rants on Facebook. One of his own ROTC instructors even told police after the fact that he was a 'Virginia Tech waiting to happen'. On May 19, something did happen: he . attacked Joshua Ceasar who was visiting his friends who were . then-roommates with Morgan State University. Mr Ceasar, who is now 23-years-old, was hit in the head with a metal baseball bat, wrapped in barbed wire and chains. The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that . Mr Ceaser's friends were able to stop the attack once they heard his . screams and saw Kinyua dragging him down the hallway while holding a . knife. Mr Ceasar was left partially blind . from the attack, and Kinyua is now in jail after he was eventually . caught by police after spending days hiding out in the woods. He later . admitted that he killed and ate a different man. Horrifying: Joshua Ceasar walked into Kinyua's apartment and was hit on the head with a baseball bat wrapped in chains and barbed wire . Now Mr Ceaser is suing the school for . failing to act in a preventative way, allowing his attack and the other . attack that left 37-year-old Kujoe Bonsafo Agyei-Kodie dead. War paint: For an image to accompany his 'Warrior Syndicate Internet' radio show, Kinyua posed in green and white makeup . 'By May 2012, it was well-known to the . counselors, ROTC instructors, and Morgan State officials that Mr. Kinyua's erratic, aggressive and bizarre behavior was increasingly . getting out of control, especially his obsession with world cleansing, . the end of the world, and violence,' Mr Ceaser's attorney Steve . Silverman wrote in the lawsuit. Last year, shortly after the attack, . Mr Ceasar said that he had heard about an outburst Kinyua had in January . at a university forum where he made cryptic comments about 'blood . sacrifice'. 'If I knew, I wouldn't have been . anywhere near him or that building,' Ceasar said. His attorney, Steve . Silverman, is exploring a lawsuit and investigating whether the . university could have done more. Two campus officers visited Kinyua after the December outburst and he was assessed by the counseling center, Coleman said. 'If the university had reason to . believe that any student or non-student represented a danger, of course . the university would have taken the appropriate steps to remove the . person from campus or render them harmless,' he said. In early May, police received a report . that a young man matching Kinyua's description was carrying a machete . around campus, Coleman said. Officers immediately tracked him to his . room and searched, but didn't find such a weapon, he said.","Joshua Ceasar visited his friends who were students at Morgan State University, and one of their roommates was Alex Kinyua .

These tragic photos show the body of a tusker elephant who died today when he was hit by a speeding train in West Bengal. The adult elephant was struck by a train in a forest at the Buxa Tiger Reserve, a few miles from Alipurduar in north east India. A speeding passenger train, the Guwahati-bound Somporkkranti Express, hit the elephant while he was crossing the railway line. He died instantly. Heart-breaking sight: The dead body of the tusker elephant lies on railway track after it was struck by the speeding passenger train . Deadly collision: Unlike the African species, only male Asian elephants have tusks, making it certain the elephant who died here was an adult male . The tiger reserve where the elephant was killed is inside the Buxa National Park, which runs along India's boundary with Bhutan. This means that the tiger reserve serves as international corridor for elephants migrating between India and Bhutan, making a it a danger spot for train drivers. Indian forest guards now have the difficult task of getting the huge animal off the tracks so that the train line can reopen. Sadly this fatal collision was not an isolated incident. As recently as December last year, five elephants were killed after they were hit by a passenger train in the eastern Indian state of Orissa. They were crossing railway tracks with their herd. At the moment there are around 26,000 wild elephants in India. Although elephants are worshipped by many Indians, their shrinking habitat has made them increasingly unsafe, especially when travelling cross country. The state of Orissa in eastern India last year issued a warning, asking trains to slow down because of moving elephants herd, but they say it was ignored. The main reasons for elephant deaths are poaching, eating crops poisoned by farmers, and being hit by trains. Last week, India’s Rail Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal stressed the need to protect the elephants from trains, describing the animals as 'gentle giants'  whose lives must be safeguarded.

A grandfather branded a real-life Victor Meldrew after he shot an air rifle in the street claimed today he has been driven from his home. Former paratrooper Brian Cotton has been arrested four times in three years following complaints from neighbours about his 'aggressive and threatening behaviour'. But Mr Cotton, 74, denies being like the grumpy pensioner from One Foot In The Grave and claims he was the 'victim' despite being given an anti-social behaviour order in court. 'Driven out': Former paratrooper Brian Cotton claims he had to move to a new house, pictured, after a string of complaints from neighbour who accused him of shooting an air rifle and 'pulling faces' through windows . Victor Meldrew: Neighbours compared him to Richard Wilson's grumpy character in One Foot In The Grave . Mr Cotton even kept a log book recording every incident at his house including 'stones thrown at shed', 'stones thrown at rear window', 'shouting outside back' and 'lots of dog barking'. But in his four years living at the warden-controlled over-55s estate in Penwortham, near Preston, Lancashire, Mr Cotton was accused of firing the rifle, hurling abuse in a community centre and pulling faces through a neighbour's window. The former town councillor has now quit the retirement estate run by Contour Homes following a string of complaints. He said today: 'The trouble with this country is that . although you know you are innocent you have to plead guilty because it . is cheaper and easier to just forget about it. 'The anti-social behaviour allegations were particularly upsetting. Those charges were just built on lies. 'I am no grumpy old man. I don't know what the world is coming to if that is how I am perceived. 'I went away to Tenerife last year while . it was the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and I left £100 to buy everyone a . drink at the community centre. That's not Victor Meldrew behaviour. I'm . just tired of feeling like I'm always in the wrong.' In April last year, Contour Homes secured an anti-social behaviour injunction order against Mr Cotton,  banning him from walking on the pavement outside a neighbour's home and he was . put on a four-month curfew from 8pm to 8am. Officials said between 2009 and 2012 . Mr Cotton was 'aggressive and threatening towards his neighbours, which . required police attendances and officer intervention.' Mr Cotton was . arrested for a fourth time shortly before Christmas, on the same day he had been found guilty in a . civil court of another charge of anti-social behaviour. Mr Cotton served for five years as a . paratrooper from 1959 in 16th Parachute Regiment and served in Tripoli, . Libya, where he was badly injured when he was run over by a lorry. The former miner is no stranger to notoriety. He was arrested in his hometown of Ilfracombe, Devon, in 2003 when he called colleagues 'plonkers' while sitting as a Labour councillor. He has also previously been accused of verbal abuse and distributing leaflets containing . offensive words. Vigilant: Mr Cotton even kept a log book recording every incident at his house including 'stones thrown at shed', 'stones thrown at rear window', 'shouting outside back' and 'lots of dog barking' He moved to Lancashire in 2009 with . wife Valerie but he became the subject of a string of complaints about . him 'engaging in nuisance and anti-social behaviour - including . aggressive, abusive and threatening behaviour towards his neighbours.' Mr Cotton believes the problems on the quiet estate were caused by him owning his own property while many other residents either rented or had shared ownership. He admitted that he fired an air gun towards a neighbour's house but said he was trying to scare pigeons. He also admitted to being placed on a curfew for 'making faces' through the same neighbour's living room window. Contour Homes staff also accused him of swearing in the local community centre and ripping up bingo tickets. He claims he was convicted of the anti-social behaviour because he is 'hopeless in court'. Mr Cotton said: 'There were hundreds of incidents at my house, pellets being fired at the building and vandalism outside. 'I used to tell the police every time there was an incident but it always ended up with me getting in trouble. Dossier: Mr Cotton, who has been arrested four times in three years, has kept bundles of letters as evidence . 'I bought an air rifle because my . house was being shot at. A neighbour used to feed the pigeons and they . made a real mess so I used to fire it at a wooden block to scare them . away. 'I was the victim in this situation but I was always made out to be the bad guy and I was taken to court several times.' But neighbours say they were tormented by Mr Cotton during his four years on the estate. One, who did not want to be named, said: 'He was just like Victor Meldrew with all his grumpiness but he was also menace too. We're glad to see the back of him.' A spokesman for Contour said: 'He was given an ASB Injunction Order following a hearing at Preston County Court. This was discharged at a further hearing in September 2012, when Mr Cotton offered to enter into a court undertaking and made a formal promise to the court as to his future behaviour. Contour accepted Mr Cotton's offer. 'Prior to issuing the court action, staff made numerous attempts to address his conduct and met with him about his behaviour.

A bottle of 'Miraval, Cote de Provence' rose wine, 6,000 bottles of this rose wine, produced from grapes grown in the vineyard in southern France owned by U.S. actors Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, are now on sale . The first batch of wine from soon-to-be-wed Hollywood golden couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie has been released. Miraval, a rose produced from the couple's £35million estate near the town of Brignoles in Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region, will be priced at around £13 a bottle. The estate includes around 50 to 60 acres of vines. One of the reasons wine-buff Brad bought 17th-century Chateau Miraval is because it is a working vineyard of 50 to 60 acres of vines that produces a white wine called Lady Jane, a red called Natouchka, and its award-winning rose, Pink Floyd. The latter got its name after the rock group recorded part of their album, The Wall, at the estate. There is also a stonewalled cellar, that dates back to 1850, filled with white wines from the Coteaux Varois appellation and red, white and rose from the Cotes de Provence. The wine's production has been overseen by the Perrins, a French winemaking family. Jolie and Pitt, however, want to do more than 'just put their name' on the bottle, according to Marc Perrin. He said: 'They want to be proud of the wine on their property. They are really looking for excellence. 'We are two families at the service of the estate.' Perrin told MSN he expected there to be around 150,000 bottles of the rose wine on the market in the first year, followed later by red and white wine. The wines would be sold through 'good wine merchants and in good restaurants', he added. According to Perrin, his family and . the famous couple came together with this business venture over a few . bottles of wine when the stars invited him over the the Chateau in June . 2012. The A-listers bought the 17th-century estate for £35million. One of the reasons they chose it is because it has a working vineyard . The wine's production has been overseen by the Perrins, a French wine-making family who are friendly with the couple . 'Brad and Angelina are very friendly, nice people and down to earth,' Perrin told Bloomberg. The news came in the run-up to Brangelina's wedding which will take place at Chateau Miraval. The picturesque estate even has its own Romanesque chapel, where the couple plan to exchange vows. And after a £10 million renovation project, personally overseen by Fight Club actor Pitt, a grand reception hall has was added , which will make the perfect location for the wedding party. Afterwards, guests can wander the . grounds that are filled with 20 beautiful water fountains, aqueducts and . a stream that runs through hidden tunnels and into a moat and ornamental lake. Animal rights organisation PETA recently quashed rumours the couple were having eight elephants at the the ceremony.

Singer and Britain's Got Talent Judge Alesha Dixon leads domestic violence campaigners in a march to the Houses of Parliament . Campaigners say women's awareness of domestic violence is 'shockingly low' (file picture) She said: 'One in four women will experience . domestic violence in their lives, making it the single biggest issue . that will affect young women and their peers in their life. 'Yet the results of this research show that awareness of domestic violence is still . shockingly low and that's why it's so important that we raise awareness . about a subject that is too often ignored.' Charities including Avon, Refuge and Women's Aid want domestic violence to receive the same level of attention as other high-profile issues such as drink-driving. The campaigners are demanding action from the Government to reduce domestic violence against women . The research found around one in five 16 to 18-year-olds did . not think or were unsure if pressure from a partner to have sex or do . other sexual things constituted domestic violence,  while the same number were unsure if slapping or hitting was a sign of domestic violence. Nearly half either disagreed . or did not know if going through a female partner's private electronic . messages counted as domestic violence. Just over half either disagreed or did not know whether a partner making all the monetary . decisions was domestic violence. But more than half of the women . questioned said they knew or suspected that someone in their life had . experienced domestic violence. Two women are killed by current or . former partners every week in England and Wales. Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge, said: 'This issue is still shrouded in myth and misunderstanding. The Government needs to invest in powerful awareness-raising campaigns to change the attitudes that allow violence and fear to darken so many homes up and down the country. 'It is essential that unhealthy attitudes and beliefs about violence against women in all professional and public spheres are challenged and addressed too. 'Changing social attitudes is not an add-on. It is at the very root of preventing and ending domestic violence.' Polly Neate, chief executive of Women's Aid, said: 'It is terrifying that many young women do not know where to get help if they are experiencing domestic violence, although that is to be expected when so few young people have been taught about domestic violence at school. 'Women's Aid has developed a free downloadable teaching resource, but at the moment it is a choice for schools if they decide to educate about healthy relationships. 'If we are going to reduce the level of domestic violence in the future, and educate those directly affected now about where they can go for help and support, we need the Government to support statutory education about relationships for all young people.'","More than half do not know if excessive jealousy counts .

She added: 'Nurses were punished by . the trust if they spent more time with the patients, if this resulted in . them breaching the four-hour target. 'Nurses who had fewer or no breaches . received high praise from management. Nurses who had breaches were made a . spectacle of and made to feel they were no good at their job.' Whistleblower: Helene Donnelly has claimed she was 'ostracised and had to endure constant bitchy comments' whenever she tried to insist on putting down the true times . The punishment was normally . unofficial, she said, including one sister who was 'undermined in her . role' by having junior nurses do her job instead of her. Ms Kelly told the tribunal that in . October 2007 Turner told a nurse, Helene Donnelly, 'my advice is to lie . about the breach time', when she rang through from the minor injuries . section saying they had patients who were about to clock up four hours . in A&E. Ms Kelly told the hearing that . although at the time she assumed it was said seriously, when she made a . statement last year she thought it was 'off the cuff', and now did not . know either way. Mrs Donnelly, who gave evidence to . the Francis Inquiry, told today’s hearing that patient records were . 'routinely' doctored in the 'chaotic' department, which lacked a . permanent manager at the time, to hide breaches in waiting time limits. A white board carrying patient . details often had admission times rubbed out, something which would have . been seen by management, she claimed. White is alleged to have told a . seriously ill elderly patient who later died that she was a 'naughty . little monkey' who was just constipated and had not taken her laxative. She allegedly refused to help lift . the woman from a wheelchair on to a bed, saying: 'I’m not doing this. I’m not hurting my back. We don’t need to get her on a trolley anyway, . she is going to breach (waiting time target) in a minute,' and telling . the junior doctor examining her to help with another patient. The woman, known as Patient B, was discharged but died the following day from a pulmonary oedema. White is also accused of saying 'she . can wait if you can do that to your baby' when a woman came into A&E . suffering from bleeding after having an abortion. Turner is accused of making racist . comments, including likening an Asian junior doctor to a suicide bomber . and describing another as 'Osama’s mate'. A third was frequently derogatorily . referred to as 'him in the turban', and a female gynaecologist pointed . out as 'her in the yashmak', Mrs Donnelly claimed. Turner, who was described as . 'foul-mouthed', is also accused of swearing about patients where they . could hear her, saying they 'can f****** wait', 'they want to get . f****** real' and 'I don’t give a flying f***'. James Townsend, representing both women, said they did not say the things they are accused of. He questioned Mrs Donnelly’s memory . of events six or seven years ago and accused her of targeting the nurses . because of 'bad feeling' toward them over remarks made about her . mother-in-law - a nurse at the hospital - and a complaint made about her . own conduct. She denied this. Ms Kelly said Turner’s dry sense of humour could be 'not politically correct' but with no intended malice. 'Sharon would get very frustrated . about a group of Asian junior doctors who would only speak to each other . in their own language, which was not English,' she said. 'I recall that Sharon would make tongue-in-cheek remarks highlighting that the junior doctors were being rude.' White and Turner contest the charges. Yesterday whistleblower Helene Donnelly said sometimes staff were in such a rush to get patients out of casualty within four hours that staff 'left patients to lie in soiled sheets to meet the targets.' Recounting one occasion where she was scathingly told off by another manager for faking a discharge time, she said she looked at the paperwork and recognised White's handwriting. But the senior nurse did not come forward to admit the forgery was hers, the panel heard. 'I realised Sister White would have been happy for me, a junior nurse, to taker the blame for her actions,' said Mrs Donnelly. 'As a result of this, absolutely nothing happened to Sister White in terms of disciplinary action.' Both Turner and White were eventually subjected to an internal disciplinary inquiry in 2008, but they were later reinstated with no action taken against them. Worrying: Nurses were often marched up to account for themselves to executives at Stafford General Hospital if they breached the four-hour limit for treating patients and 'made a spectacle of', it was claimed . During their suspension, Mrs Donnelly said she 'incurred the wrath' of their friends in A&E. Mrs Donnelly said of their return: 'Nothing had been learned other than how to break the rules more subversively.' She said: 'Sister White would deliberately make patients wait. Black patients were being made to wait.' The nurse, who resigned in June 2008 because of the toxic environment, said: 'The attitude of the sisters had not changed. 'I knew I had to get out.' The ongoing central London hearing is expected to last ten days. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Nurses were made a spectacle of if they breached 4 hour targets .

Still active: The Duchess of Cambridge did not let her pregnancy slow her down when she went sledging in Switzerland . Halfway down a black run, high above the French resort of Val d’Isere, I stop to consider my options. This is, after all, no ordinary black run. It is La Face — the men’s 2009 Olympic downhill course — and the next bit of it, the one I am about to attempt to ski, is so steep, so sheer, it is terrifying. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t hesitate. But I am four months pregnant and — standing there on the lip of this heart-stopping vertical drop — I pay a momentary thought to my growing baby, obliviously cocooned in my womb, and have a sudden wobble of conscience. So do I take the sensible route, remove my skis and call for help? Not on your life. Call me reckless, but what I do instead is take a deep breath and go for it — all the way to the bottom, where I head to the nearest bar for a brandy to steady my nerves. Even today, that memory does make me cringe a little. But the baby I was carrying is now a healthy, thrill-seeking 12-year-old girl who seems hell-bent on pushing her own boundaries of fear at every turn. No surprises there. Of course, I wasn’t carrying a future heir to the throne like the Duchess of Cambridge, nor was this my first baby — both understandable reasons for Kate to play it safe last weekend when, on the slopes of the luxury Arosa resort in Switzerland, she decided to give skiing with the rest of the royal party a miss. She was there — along with Princes  William and Harry — for the wedding of polo player Mark Tomlinson and Olympic dressage champion Laura Bechtolsheimer. And while everyone else headed straight for the slopes, the Duchess — herself a keen skier — chose to opt for the ‘safer’ pursuit of an afternoon’s sledging instead. But her choice of recreation still . attracted criticism. One onlooker said: ‘She tucked her legs up and just . went. I thought it was very brave for a pregnant woman because it was . on quite an incline.’ Snow baby: The Duchess enjoyed walks around the luxury ski resort of Arosa while The Duke of Cambridge and Prince Harry went skiing . Almost as soon as the pictures of the Duchess, sledge in hand, were published, the reaction was instant. People damned her for being cavalier with her safety and that of her unborn baby. Sledging, as anyone who’s ever done it will know, can be a bit hair-raising. After all, nearly everyone falls off. You can see why more cautious types would steer well clear — especially when pregnant. After my skiing exploits, though, sledging sounds pretty tame to me. But, of course, the pregnancy police would probably much prefer that the Duchess had stayed inside, rug over knees, with a hot chocolate and had no fun at all. But, as I know from four pregnancies, there is little point in wrapping yourself in cotton wool for nine months. It just makes the whole, drawn-out process of being pregnant even more boring than it already is. Indeed, not only did I ski while carrying all of my babies (although I did, eventually, steer clear of black runs), I also cycled, ice-skated, roller-bladed, went on a 42ft-high zip wire across a lake, jet-skied, jogged, flew across the world and — shock horror — rode on the back of a motorbike. It may sound as if I specifically hunted out hedonistic pursuits in a bid to liven up being pregnant. But this couldn’t be further from the truth. I just refused to put my life on hold and morph into one of those dreadful expectant mothers who have to let the world know they are carrying precious cargo, placing stickers on their car saying things like: ‘Mum-to-be woman on board.’ I’m not alone, either. When she was five months pregnant, marathon champion Paula Radcliffe admitted running 14 miles a day in training. Which just goes to show that women need not — and in most cases should not — take pregnancy sitting down. On the contrary, the benefit of exercise is undisputed. It not only makes for an easier labour and delivery, but can also help prevent excessive weight gain, which reduces the risk of gestational  diabetes and pre-eclampsia (pregnancy-induced high blood pressure) which is a leading cause of illness and death in mothers and babies. Of course, there’s a big difference between staying healthy through pregnancy and putting yourself and your unborn foetus in unnecessary danger. But where do you draw the line? A survey for the baby charity Tommy’s and healthcare company Johnson’s Baby found that 45 per cent of expectant women have been left confused by conflicting information they have received about pregnancy. Baby bump: Catherine with her bump clearly on display as she talked to Prince Harry at the wedding of Laura Bechtolsheimer and polo player Luke Tomlinson in Arosa . There are virtually as many opinions on what’s safe in pregnancy as there are people to give them. I admit I probably pushed the boundaries more than most when pregnant with Flo, 14, Annie, 12, Monty, ten, and Dolly, three. Certainly, that moment at the top of the mountain is probably pretty exceptional for a pregnant woman. But something my mother said to me early in my first pregnancy has stuck with me ever since. Future parents: Prince William with the Duchess of Cambridge on their holiday to Switzerland before the arrival of their baby in the summer . ‘Don’t treat growing a baby like an illness,’ she advised. ‘Just get on with your life as normal. It’s a far healthier approach.’ And she was right. On that basis, I drank a glass or two of wine every night once morning sickness had worn off. My GP even told me that Pinot Grigio was better for the foetus than me being stressed, which seemed to make perfectly good sense to me. On holiday, I ignored recommendations that pregnant women should not eat raw shellfish, soft cheeses and pate — because of the risk of harmful bacteria, and food poisoning such as listeria — and indulged in prawns, cheese platters and even, on one occasion,  foie gras. I didn’t do that again — not because it made me ill, but it gave me terrible heartburn. Not only did I have happier  pregnancies because of this relaxed, non-neurotic approach — but I also believe it set the pattern for my entire attitude towards motherhood afterwards. My body may have been hijacked by a being that hadn’t even entered the world yet, but — from the moment of conception — I flatly refused to have my personality hijacked, too. And that didn’t change once they were born. Today, I have four healthy, thriving children — despite my adrenaline-fuelled, Brie-consuming pregnancies. But I’m still recognisably ‘me’, too, and hopefully that will never be compromised. I sincerely hope the Duchess of Cambridge continues to enjoy a trouble-free pregnancy. But I also hope she doesn’t get so bogged down with worry that she forgets how to enjoy herself. My advice would be to ignore the pregnancy police and do what feels right. And if that means whizzing down a hill on a wooden toboggan — or even skiing — then she should go for it and enjoy every moment. I’m sure the newest heir to the throne would understand. After all, who wants a boring mother?","The Duchess of Cambridge was criticised for being too active on holiday .

But the tech giant's virtual empire could be about to take physical form - as the firm is set to bid for the rights to take over an airport. Nasa is looking for a buyer to renovate a disused hangar at an airfield near Google's headquarters, and the company's bosses are believed to be in the frame. Takeover: Google bosses could bid to renovate Hangar One at Moffett Field, currently standing empty . Fleet: The firm's founders Larry Page, left, and Sergey Brin, right, own a number of private jets between them . Larry Page, Sergey Brin and Eric Schmidt, the co-founders and chairman of Google, are believed to have access to a fleet of eight private jets between them. The trio offered 16 months ago to pay $33million for the renovation of Hangar One at Moffett Field in Mountain View, California, where the firm is based. Their offer was rejected, but last week the federal government announced that it was now actively seeking bids to take over the iconic 80-year-old structure. Google executives have long rented space at Moffett Field to park their private aeroplanes, but the prospect of their own dedicated structure could be too much to resist. Landmark: Hangar One dominates the Silicon Valley landscape at nearly 200ft (60m) tall . Heyday: The structure was originally used by the U.S. Navy and is now under the control of Nasa . Lenny Siegel, from the Save Hangar One Committee, included Mr Page and Mr Brin on a list of possible buyers based on their pre-existing links to the site. 'They understand the historic importance of the building,' he told the Mercury News. Moffett Field is currently attached to the Ames Research Center, a major Nasa laboratory opened in 1939. Last Friday federal officials announced that they were seeking a private partner to help save Hangar One from destruction after it was found to be leaking toxic chemicals. In its heyday, the hangar was one of the most prominent landmarks in Silicon Valley, covering eight acres with a maximum height of nearly 200ft (60m). Nostalgic: Hangar One was first used by gigantic airship USS Macon during the Second World War . Moffett Field is not the only location which could be taken over by Google to build an airport. The firm is likely to be the main tenant at a new $82million facility at the Mineta San Jose International Airport. That airport would be capable of accommodating even the largest Boeing jets owned by Google and its executives. Mr Schmidt said earlier this month that the project 'will provide us with long term hangar stability and the ability to grow our flight department in Silicon Valley'.","Google chiefs looking for space to park their eight private jets .

Biological surveys at conservation charity Trees for Life's Dundreggan Estate, in Glenmoriston, found eight new species. This find has brought the total number of species recorded at the site to more than 2,800. Biologists found new species including sawfly, an aphid (pictured), two types of aphid parasites, three fungus gnats and a type of mite . The new species discovered at the 10,000 acre estate in Inverness-shire are a sawfly, an aphid, two types of aphid parasites, three fungus gnats and a type of mite. Surveys in 2012 also discovered a rare Lapland marsh-orchid, which had never been found in that area of Scotland before. It brings the total number of species recorded at Dundreggan to 2,815, including 269 plants, 341 lichens, 92 birds, 20 mammals, 354 beetles, 207 moths and 125 sawflies. Species found at the estate include black grouse, pine martens, water voles and juniper stands, while research is on-going to establish whether the Scottish wildcat is present. Trees for Life's executive director Alan Watson Featherstone said: ‘The surprisingly rich variety of life at Dundreggan highlights the vital importance of conservation work, and of protecting and enhancing habitats across the Highlands. The find brings the total number of species recorded at Dundreggan to 2,815 . ‘The discoveries are not only demonstrating that the estate is a special site for biological diversity - they are also revealing that there is still much to learn about Scotland's biodiversity.’ Some 67 species which are considered to be a priority for conservation work have been identified on Dundreggan, which the charity said had been described as a ‘lost world’ of wildlife. Dundreggan was bought by Trees for Life in 2008 and, with the help of volunteers, the charity is planting half a million trees on the estate as part of efforts to restore the Caledonian Forest to an area of 1,000 square miles in the Highlands.","New species found at Trees for Life's Dundreggan Estate in Glenmoriston .

Gone are the days of long exposures and image distortion – Canon has unveiled a new camera sensor that can capture photos and videos in very low light. The new sensor is able to capture well-defined pictures of stars without the photographer having to take a long exposure or increase the camera’s sensitivity. It can even be used to 'see in the dark' and take pictures of friends at night without the need for any lighting. Scroll down for video . The camera takes a photograph of a man's face in a room lit only by three incense sticks . The sensor facilitates the shooting of clearly visible video images even in dimly lit environments with as little as 0.03 lux of illumination . The sensor is so sensitive that it even enabled the filming of shooting stars during the Geminid meteor shower. It has also been used to capture a man’s face in a room lit only by three incense sticks. This is possible because Canon has used new technologies in the pixels and readout circuitry which reduces noise. Thanks to this technology, the sensor facilitates the shooting of clearly visible video images even in dimly lit environments with as little as 0.03 lux of illumination, or approximately the brightness of a crescent moon . The full-frame, 35mm-film-size, camera sensor is even more specialised than Canon’s earlier DSLRs which, themselves, are known for their low-light performance. A promotional video produced by Canon shows that the camera can capture shooting stars . Canon's promotional video shows the difference between the images captured by an old camera and those captured using the new sensor . The CMOS sensor features pixels measuring 19 microns square in size, which is more than 7.5 times the surface area of the pixels on the CMOS sensor incorporated in Canon’s top of the range SLR cameras. It can be used to film full-HD video but it is only able to create video footage from a 1920 x 1080 array meaning that it only has one photosite per output pixel so cannot offer the same colour resolution as Canon’s EOS C200 professional video camera. Canon believes that the first generation of this technology will be used primarily in non-consumer applications, such as surveillance, medical research and astronomical observation.

A court heard he set up the Forces For Good trust to help ex-armed forces personnel suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder to return to civilian life. O'Neill, (right) pictured here with Simon Weston (left), spent the money intended for former service personnel on speedboats and gambling . But the 51-year-old splashed out on speedboats, gambling debts, high living and trying to romance three women at the same time. Conman O'Neill convinced the Welsh Assembly government he was legitimate through lying about his own very brief army career and giving 'expert' evidence to parliamentary and Welsh government committees about post-traumatic stress disorder and the impact on soldiers leaving the forces. He won over politicians, probation workers, senior police officers and even convinced war veterans like former Welsh Guardsman Simon Weston that he wanted to help struggling servicemen and women. It operated a hotel in Llandudno, North Wales, a nine-house supported housing project on Anglesey and a caravan site. But instead of ploughing the £125,000 government grant into helping ex-servicemen he stole from his own organisation to lead a luxury lifestyle until the money ran out. Christopher O'Neill conned £125,000 out of the Welsh government to set up a scheme to help injured soldiers . The court heard O'Neill transferred £74,800 from the Forces For Good bank account into his own. He . lost £20,00 in an account with Ladbrokes bookmakers and ripped off a . dying woman by persuading her to invest £30,000 in his hotel renovation . and continued to cash cheques from her account after she died. The . truth caught up with him after Forces For Good co-director Mandy . Bostwick became suspicious about his lifestyle and asked him to show her . the accounts. When he refused, Ms Bostwick and fellow co-director Kevin Grey suspended him and discovered there was only £500 left instead of £90,000. O'Neill, of Colwyn Bay, North Wales, was due to stand trial in October but failed to turn up at court and went on the run. He later surrendered and pleaded guilty at Caernarfon Crown Court to two fraud charges. He was jailed for three years yesterday. Falklands veteran Simon Weston today hit out at jailed military conman Christopher O'Neill after he was tricked by his fraud. Mr Weston was tricked by O'Neill while speaking alongside each other at meetings of the Welsh Government trying to help military veterans. The former Welsh Guardsman said: 'He abused the trust of politicians and the general public. But worst of all he abused the trust of his peers - people who had possibly served alongside. 'He should have honoured the trust they put in him. The 'congenital liar' ripped off a dying woman by persuading her to invest £30,000 in his hotel renovation . 'What he did was reprehensible. He has ruined the rest of his life. 'When you go to prison that isn't the end - there are an awful lot of ex-servicemen inside prison. 'He will have to be watched for his own safety. 'But when he comes out, he will want to employ someone like that. He may well have enjoyed more than £100,000 but no-one will trust him ever again. O'Neill 'could talk the birds down off the trees' says someone who was duped by him . 'In reality, society will punish him more than the courts. 'I wouldn't want to be in his shoes. We have millions of veterans in this country and families with serving members.' Prosecutor Karl Scholz said: 'Although he may have been concerned by the difficulties of ex-servicemen, he used moneys for charitable purposes to fund his own lifestyle. 'He is a congenital liar incapable of managing his financial affairs.' Judge Nicholas Parry branded his crime 'wicked' and said he was stunned by a lack of basic checks into his background: 'This was nothing other than a sophisticated high value scam. 'It was a wicked deception on the public purse. Any right-minded person would be sickened. 'Your wicked lies involve deceiving vulnerable former soldiers who had truly served their country and meant something, who had seen horrors and had their lives blighted. 'The best assessment of you was from 30 years in an army report which said you were a congenital liar. 'It is astounding that the Welsh Assembly Government didn't make the basic checks into the company and you were given the money without proper checks.' Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd, a prominent campaigner for veterans, was taken in by O'Neill. After his conviction, Mr Llwyd said: 'He could talk the birds down off the trees to be honest. 'He was perfectly plausible. He'd been in several meetings with some very high powered ex-service people and the whole group of people we deal with in committees in London. 'I don't think anybody suspected anything.' O'Neill had a previous conviction for dishonesty after stealing jewellery from his employers in 1985. Mr Llwyd is now calling for an inquiry into how his background wasn't checked in more detail before being handed such large sums of public money. After the sentencing, Mr Weston called for tighter controls on keeping checks grants to veterans' organisations. Mr Weston survived the Argentine attack on the Sir Galahad troop ship during the Falklands war which killed 48 people in the deadliest single attack on British servicemen of the war. The hotel in LLandudno which was previously owned by the Forces For Good trust and used as a hostel for former members of the armed services . Mr Weston, then 20 years old, survived the bombing but suffered horrific burns to 46 per cent of his body. Three decades and more than 80 operations later he has conquered his demons but admits after the Falklands he tried to commit suicide and found refuge in alcohol. Mr Weston was photographed alongside O'Neill at a veterans' event in Cardiff where the pair gave talks on the struggles soldiers faced in returning to civilian life. He said: 'What we mustn't do is attack the Welsh Government in this case. They were naive in their rush to help and in their desire to do the right thing. 'They got it wrong. But we have to have trust in some people - without that we lose society.' In a statement the Welsh Government said that Conwy council was responsible for administering the grant to Forces for Good and the council had now repaid the £125,000 in full. It also said its officials had now worked with the council to review and strengthen its governance procedures. Conwy council said it has carried out an internal investigation in to what went wrong with Forces for Good.","Christopher O'Neill, 51, conned politicians, veterans and police .

Best Buy corporate workers are the latest to trade in their bathrobes for briefcases, as it was revealed today the brick-and-mortar company is now placing a ban on telecommuting. The company has decided to end its results-oriented policy in favor of the traditional 40-hour work week done from an office environment. News of the switch comes after the controversial decision by Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer to require all workers to come into the office, which has sparked a national debate over office policy. Scroll down for video . Changes made: Struggling electronics retailer Best Buy will no longer allow its corporate members to telecommute . According to Minnesota Public Radio, the change was sparked in part because of the electronic retailer’s struggling performance against online stores such as Amazon. The idea is that Best Buy’s employees will be able to better collaborate and generate ideas while working in an office. Winds of change: Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly has made several dramatic changes to the company since coming on in August of 2012 . The previous policy allowed corporate workers to pick their hours and schedule while working from home. As long as their weekly tasks were completed, it did not matter whether they put in the standard 40 hours. Both Best Buy and Yahoo! have recently brought on new CEOs. Best Buy’s executive, Hubert Joly, who was the former CEO of a hospitality and travel company in Minneapolis, joined Best Buy last August and has been has been working to make the struggling company more efficient. The Minneapolis-based chain beat expectations in its recent fourth-quarter results, but Best Buy gave a cautious outlook on the first quarter because of increased investments. A Best Buy spokesperson did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. Mayer, the former Google Inc. executive, took the demanding top role at Yahoo! when she was five months pregnant. In a memo to employees late last month, she wrote: ‘Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home,’ according to Yahoo employees. ‘We need to be one Yahoo!, and that starts with physically being together.’ However, the executive has been criticized for using her clout and status within the company to build a nursery for her child at company headquarters – a luxury that is not afforded to the majority of employees. Similar to Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, Mayer says that her top priorities are not in the office, saying her concerns were: ‘God, family, and Yahoo! – in that order.’ Tech companies are noted for offering creative work arrangements and were pioneers in offering the option for staff to check in remotely. Plight of the working man: Yahoo! Inc CEO Marissa Mayer's controversial decision to halt telecommuting has left workers divided . The office: Yahoo headquarters are located in Sunnyvale, California near San Jose (pictured). The company employs 11,500 people in over 20 countries across the globe . Richard Branson, head of Virgin Group, said the move by Yahoo! undermined the trust that staff would get their work done wherever, without supervision, as working is no longer 9-5. 'This seems a backwards step in an age when remote working is easier and more effective than ever,' Branson wrote in a blog on the Virgin website. 'If you provide the right technology to keep in touch, maintain regular communication and get the right balance between remote and office working, people will be motivated to work responsibly, quickly and with high quality.' Earlier this week, Best Buy announced 400 job cuts at its headquarters as part of a $725 million cost-cutting plan. On Friday the company said it expects to announce more job cuts later this year. The company also said it plans $700 million to $800 million in capital spending and $150 million to $200 million in other expenses in fiscal 2014 as it invests in its business, mainly online and mobile channels. It plans to revamp Bestbuy.com by fiscal 2015.","Best Buy phasing out telecommuting option for its corporate workers .

A former Navy lieutenant accused of raping a woman he met through a Christian dating website has now been charged with attacking a second woman. Sean Patrick Banks, 37, from Del Mar, California, has already been accused of sexually assaulting a . woman he met through ChristianMingle.com last November. Banks allegedly arrived at the home of . his date, a woman in her 20s, on November 12, was sexually aggressive . towards her and ultimately forced himself on her, the prosecution said. Two more charges of . sexually assaulting another victim when she was drunk and of attempting to . dissuade a witness, a Miss California 2012 pageant contestant, from talking to police have been filed against him. The latest rape victim has claimed she met Banks for drinks in 2009, then engaged in sexual activities to which she did not consent. It is not known if the two met through the site. Authorities said Banks used a fake name . on the site to contact the woman he allegedly raped in . November. He allegedly used names including 'Rylan Butterwood' and 'Rylan Harbough'. Banks, a PhD student at Pepperdine . University, had been arrested on February 11 on a slew of counts, including rape . by force, digital penetration by foreign object and residential . burglary for the 2012 attack. Popular site: Kinney said she met Banks on the site ChristianMingle.com, where the man allegedly used different aliases . The second new charge stems from his alleged contact with Miss California contestant Victoria Kinney, who claims he threatened her and intimidated her against speaking to police. Kinney, who met Banks on the Christian site, said he was very charming at first, . and she got the impression that he was a very intelligent, eloquent, . well-read, good Christian man, according to 10News. 'Next victim': Victoria Kinney has claimed that Banks made threatening remarks to her . But in retrospect, she said that some of his remarks were unsettling. 'I didn’t listen to my instincts,' she said. 'In those instances and looking back, I absolutely should have.' It all came to a head when Kinney said she got a call from Banks, whom she planned to meet for lunch, telling her that he had been arrested on a rape charge. After the 37-year-old suspect was released on bail, Gilleon said he reached out to Kinney, trying to silence her. Gilleon told ABC News that Banks ordered Kinney ‘to first tell him’ if authorities contacted her about him, and that she not speak to them. ‘I started crying hysterically because I realized how close to something horrible that I had come,’ Kinney said. Kinney's attorney, Daniel Gilleon, . said his client was terrified, but being a devout Christian woman, she . was determined to testify against Banks in order to support other . possible victims. Addressing Kinney’s claims that she . could have been Banks’ next victim, his attorney Gretchen von Helms sad . that the woman has never met her client in person, and their . relationship was limited to talking on the phone and texting. Blonde beauty: The pageant contestant, center, said that Banks was initially charming, but there were some warning signs which she chose to ignore . Intimidated: Kinney, pictured left and right, said that she felt threatened after getting a call from Banks instructing her not to talk to police about his rape charges . During the hearing, Judge Charles Ervin granted Kinney an order of protection barring Banks from having contact with or getting within 100 yards of the beauty queen. The suspect was re-arrested on a rare 'no bail request,' even though he had previously posted $500,000 bail. Banks faces 44 years in prison if convicted.

The head of the health service pleaded ignorance yesterday to damning evidence that patients were failed on his watch. As he again faced down calls to quit his post, Sir David Nicholson was accused of presiding over of a ‘see no evil, hear no evil’ culture in the NHS. This, the chief executive admitted, culminated in patients ‘not being at the centre of the way the NHS operated’. He insisted he remains the ‘right person’ to stay on and improve the service at a time when it is at ‘maximum risk’ owing to impending reform. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Under fire: Sir David Nicholson faced the Health Select Committee where he pleaded ignorance to damning evidence that patients were failed on his watch . But during a bad-tempered session in which he left MPs staggered by his evasiveness, Sir David revealed a startling lack of awareness about growing scandals in the NHS. He: . ■ Admitted he had ‘no idea’ about the unfolding scandal at Stafford Hospital where 1,200 patients needlessly died – even though he was in charge of the regional health watchdog; . ■ Claimed he had ‘no access’ to statistics revealing high death rates while he was running the local health authority, although records show they were viewed online by his colleagues; . ■ Appeared unaware of the full extent of gagging orders against staff, saying he would never ‘sanction’ such a deal, even though nearly 600 were agreed on his watch; . ■ Confessed he did not even read a series of critical reports written on the NHS by Labour’s Lord Darzi – even though they were commissioned during his time in charge. Questioned by the Health Select Committee, Sir David made the candid but shocking admission that patients were not the main priority in the NHS, which had ‘lost focus’. Anger: Julie Bailey (centre) and protesters at Westminster as Sir David Nicholson gave evidence inside . Sir David insists he is the 'right person' to stay and improve the service, despite growing calls for him to resign . He has faced growing calls to stand down after it became apparent that he failed to intervene while patients were dying of neglect in Stafford during his spell on a string of Midlands health authorities. But he has clung on to his £211,000-a year job, insisting he is not ‘ashamed’ to carry on as the most powerful man in the NHS. Yesterday, for the first time, he admitted personal failings which led to more than 1,000 unnecessary deaths between 2005 and 2009. However he claimed he had no indication patients were suffering and dying needlessly until it was exposed by regulators. ‘I had no idea,’ he said. ‘We didn’t see any of the information that would lead you to believe that there was all of this going on in Mid Staffordshire. As shocking as it is, that is the truth.’ Protest: Campaigners calling for Sir David's resignation held placards outside Portcullis House . Sir David said there was ‘no culture of sharing information’ in the NHS. ‘During that period, across the NHS as a whole, patients were not the centre of the way the system operated.’ He explained that the NHS ‘lost its focus’ because managers were busily chasing targets handed down by Labour. Sir David said that for a ‘whole variety of reasons, not because people were bad but because there were a whole set of changes going on and a whole set of things we were being held accountable for from the centre’, an environment was created where the leadership of the NHS lost its focus. Campaign: A Cure The NHS poster shows what they think of Sir David, calling his 'shameful' and his evidence 'disgraceful' ‘I put my hands up to that and I was a part of that, but my learning from that was to make sure it doesn’t happen again.’ The Prime Minister has given Sir David his full backing, insisting he is doing a ‘very good job’, but 40 MPs have so far signed or lent their support to a motion calling on him to go. Polls have shown that as many as 90 per cent of healthcare professionals think he must resign. But Sir David began the session with a five-and-a-half minute monologue setting out why he should stay. Tory committee member Dr Sarah Wollaston, a former GP, said the embattled chief executive appeared to have ‘powerful friends watching his back’. She said he should not continue in his role after major NHS reforms are unveiled next month, as warning signs about the disaster had been ‘ignored’. She added: ‘He claimed not to know about the extent of gagging clauses which are silencing NHS staff, claimed not to know about the climate of fear that was highlighted in three reports that were suppressed and only came to light because of a Freedom of Information request. ‘And I felt really the whole issue of did he understand about his own role in this, did he understand the anger of patients, that this mortality data was there, and it was ignored.’ Sir David said he regretted failing to meet patients and the ‘legalistic’ way they were treated. On mortality rates showing a high number of unexpected deaths in Mid Staffordshire, which apparently failed to reach him, he claimed they were not widely used by trusts. In fact these figures, showing the number of deaths at hospitals compared with what was expected, were published annually in national newspapers since 2001 and online since 2005. Grilling: NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh (right), Sir David Nicholson (centre) and Liz Redfern CBE (left) give evidence to a House of Commons Health Select Committee . Professor Brian Jarman, of Imperial College, London, who supplied them to health trusts and the Department of Health, said: ‘Staff accessed them thousands of times, although they did not know we were recording it. I find it very difficult to believe he was not aware of them.’ Gary Walker, former head of a health trust in Lincolnshire who was handed a £500,000 gagging order, said yesterday: ‘I complained to Nicholson personally and lost everything.’ Dr Wollaston said: ‘Everyone is saying the NHS can’t survive without David Nicholson because he’s supposed to have this amazing grasp of detail, but it’s more than a detail if more than a thousand people died in the hospital where you were head of the strategic health authority. ‘He didn’t take responsibility for much except not meeting the patients. I’m afraid very disappointed that all of these things were minimised and it was a case of hear no evil see no evil. Questions: The trio were being asked about the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, that cost the lives of up to 1,200 people . ‘It was swept under the carpet. He’s determined to stay on and has a lot of powerful friends watching his back.’ Julie Bailey, 51, who set up the Cure the NHS campaign group after her mother Bella died in Mid Staffordshire, said: ‘We need to get rid of him. ‘Nothing will change. He is part of the problem, not the solution. That man is an absolute disgrace. He is desperate to carry on in his job.’ Andrew Bridgen, MP for Leicestershire North West, some of whose constituents died at Stafford, said: ‘If Sir David was the CEO of a private sector company where there were thousands of avoidable deaths, he wouldn’t be worried about resigning. He would be up on corporate manslaughter charges. He’s happy to take the pay but not the responsibility.’ Sir David was in charge of the regional health body supervising the Mid Staffordshire trust, and later head of the Department of Health, over the four-year period in which up to 1,200 are feared to have died needlessly . By Daniel Martin . Four former Labour Health Secretaries have ridden to the defence of Sir David Nicholson – insisting there is no reason for him to resign. Alan Milburn, Patricia Hewitt, Alan Johnson and Andy Burnham said there was no evidence he acted wrongly over the Mid Staffordshire scandal. Labour is worried about Sir David’s fate as many of the decisions for which he has been criticised took place when it was in power. It was responsible for the target regime and the ‘culture of fear’ behind it that was blamed for managers in Stafford putting finance before patients. Alan Milburn was the man who introduced . the target regime, under which managers were given financial incentives . for bringing down waiting times, in his 2000 NHS reform plan. He also . introduced foundation trusts – it was Stafford’s desire to gain this . elite status which led to the neglect of patient care. Neither Frank . Dobson nor John Reid, Labour’s two other health secretaries during the . Tony Blair years, responded to calls. But their four counterparts were vociferous in their support. Patricia Hewitt said: ‘I have been appalled by the campaign against David Nicholson. It is grossly unfair.’ Alan Johnson said: ‘David Nicholson was part of the solution to raising quality in the NHS rather than the problem.’ Andy Burnham, now shadow health secretary, said: ‘The Prime Minister has said what he wants to say on David Nicholson and I think he is right.’ Mr Milburn spoke out in favour of Sir David even though he had never worked directly with him. He said: ‘The easiest thing is to always look for the kneejerk response, put a head on a platter and then everything is solved.’ Below we assess how Mr Milburn, Miss Hewitt, Mr Johnson and Mr Burnham fared themselves when they were in charge of Health.","Sir David Nicholson grilled by MPs over his role in Mid Staffordshire scandal .

British women aged 18-25 care more about 'looking good' than climbing the career ladder, according to a new survey. The study, which asked single women to rank aspects of their life, found 41 per cent were more concerned about their appearance than how well their job was going. One in five admitted prospects, promotions and pay rises meant less to them than having 'perfect hair', fashionable clothes and good make up. Image conscious: One in four admitted they would rather look like Frankie Sandford from The Saturdays, left, than be as successful as businesswoman Karren Brady . As many as one in four admitted they would rather look like Frankie Sandford from The Saturdays than be as successful as businesswoman Karren Brady. The study also showed many women prioritise 'great hair' and 'staying thin' over renting or owning their own place and learning to drive. Settling down and starting a family was way down the modern women's list of priorities - in line with recent NHS statistics that revealed more women are delaying motherhood till their 30s and 40s. The top priority for the 539 women questioned was going out with friends. Girls just wanna have fun: The top priority for the young women questioned was going out with friends . A spokeswoman for haircare company John Frieda, which conducted the study, said it 'stands to reason' that young women today are more concerned with their . looks and friendships in an era when social networking means more . pictures are shared online and rising house prices have made buying a . first home impossible. They said: 'It stands to reason that . women of a young age will be more concerned about their looks, . friendships and socialising than other more serious aspects. 'As a young woman appearance is . incredibly important - from looking fantastic for a night on the town, . to checking pictures on Facebook, it is the thing at the forefront of . these girls minds. 'The other thing to consider is that for some girls, the prospect of owning a house, settling down, and paying into pensions are seemingly unachievable at present, so they're things which are easy to forget about.' The poll also found 45 per cent of young single women spend more on making sure they look good, rather than saving for the future. The average girl in her early twenties . spends £90 a month on her appearance - splashing out most of her . disposable income on haircuts, tans, clothes and shoes. One in three get their hair cut frequently, one in ten often top up the tan, and one fifth have their nails manicured regularly. But for one third of girls, looking amazing has nothing to do with bagging a boyfriend - as they'd prefer to impress their friends than a man with their appearance. When it comes to planning for the future, young women are burying their heads in the sand with 58 per cent preferring to think about the here and now instead. For almost 44 per cent of single ladies, having fun with friends is more important than making plans for a secure and steady future. One fifth of girls can't ever imagine being in the position where they'll be able to afford to buy a house, while two in three would like to have a house but can't see it being in the near future. The John Frieda spokeswoman added: 'It is incredible girls would rather have beautiful coloured hair and the High Street's latest outfits than a pension in place, their own car, or their own house. 'But this is because when you are in your early twenties appearance is of huge importance - and before life gets too serious and stressful, why should it be any other way.'","Single British women aged 18-25 were asked to rank aspects of their life .

Sentenced: Kimberly McCarthy, 51, was sentenced to death for the 1997 robbery, beating and fatal stabbing of her 71-year-old neighbour . The planned execution of a female inmate in Texas has been postponed for 60-days by a judge in the Lone Star state. The execution, which was planned for after 6 p.m. this evening would have been the first time in over two years a female inmate would have faced the death penalty. Kimberly McCarthy, 51, was sentenced to death for the 1997 robbery, beating and fatal stabbing of her 71-year-old neighbour Dorothy Booth - she was due to receive a lethal injection. A retired college psychology professor, investigators say Mrs Booth had agreed to give McCarthy a cup of sugar before she was attacked with a butcher knife at her home in Lancaster, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of Dallas. It was among three slayings linked to McCarthy, a former nursing home therapist who'd been addicted to crack cocaine. Her lethal injection is scheduled for tonight. McCarthy . will be the 13th woman executed in the U.S. and the fourth in Texas, . the nation's busiest death penalty state, since the Supreme Court . allowed capital punishment to resume in 1976. In that same time period, more than 1,300 male inmates have been executed nationwide. Federal . Bureau of Justice Statistics compiled from 1980 through 2008 show women . make up about 10 percent of homicide offenders nationwide. According to the National . Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense Fund, . 3,146 people were on the nation's death rows as of last Oct. 1, and only . 63 - 2 percent - were women. In . a final legal effort to spare her life, McCarthy's lawyers asked Gov. Rick Perry on Monday to use his executive authority to issue a 30-day . reprieve. They also appealed to Dallas County District. Attorney . Craig Watkins to withdraw or modify the execution date, citing his . support that Texas adopt a law allowing death-row inmates to appeal on . racial grounds. McCarthy is black, while all but one of her 12 Dallas . County jurors were white. Sentenced: McCarthy's lethal injection is scheduled for tonight - she will be the 13th woman executed in the U.S. and the fourth in Texas . The U.S. Supreme Court earlier this month refused to review her case, and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles turned down a clemency request Friday. Her lead attorney, Doug Parks, said drug use was McCarthy's downfall. 'I think when she's off dope she's probably a pretty good person,' he said. 'I believe now, as I did then, that in the penitentiary, Kim would be absolutely no danger to anyone.' Killed: McCarthy attacked Booth, including forcing the woman's hand to a chopping block so she could cut off her finger to remove her wedding ring . McCarthy declined to speak with reporters as her execution date neared. Evidence showed that McCarthy called Booth to borrow a cup of sugar. When she came to pick it up, McCarthy attacked Booth, including forcing the woman's hand to a chopping block so she could cut off her finger to remove her wedding ring. 'I remember the pain and agony that poor woman lived through before McCarthy delivered the final stab wounds,' former Dallas County assistant district attorney Greg Davis recalled last week. DNA evidence also tied McCarthy to the December 1988 slayings of 81-year-old Maggie Harding and 85-year-old Jettie Lucas. Harding was stabbed and beaten with a meat tenderizer, while Lucas was beaten with both sides of a claw hammer and stabbed. McCarthy, who denied any involvement in the attacks, was indicted but not tried for those slayings. 'She took the most defenseless, the most helpless people, people that trusted her, that she chose to attack,' Davis said. The Dallas County jury had already found McCarthy guilty of Booth's slaying when evidence during the punishment phase of her trial linked her to the other two slayings and convinced jurors to send her to death row. Prosecutors also showed that McCarthy stole Booth's Mercedes and drove to Dallas, pawned the ring for $200 and then went to a crack house to buy cocaine. Evidence also showed she used Booth's credit cards at a liquor store and was carrying Booth's driver's license. Booth's DNA was found on a 10-inch (25-centimeter) butcher knife recovered from McCarthy's home. McCarthy said she blamed the crime on two drug dealers she identified only as ""Kilo"" and ""J.C."" There was no evidence to show either existed. Facts: According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense Fund, 3,146 people were on the nation's death rows as of last Oct. 1, and only 63 - 2 percent - were women . McCarthy was tried twice for Booth's slaying, most recently in 2002. Her first conviction in 1998 was thrown out three years later by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which ruled police violated her rights by using a statement she made to them after asking for a lawyer. McCarthy is a former wife of Aaron Michaels, founder of the New Black Panther Party, and he testified on her behalf. They had separated before Booth's slaying. McCarthy is among 10 women on death row in Texas, but the only one with an execution date. In 1998, Karla Faye Tucker, 38, became the first woman executed in Texas since the Civil War for a robbery in Houston where two people were killed with a pickax.

New mothers are up to five times more likely to have the condition than other women (posed by model) Worries about the responsibilities of motherhood are making women more prone to obsessive compulsive disorder. New mothers are up to five times more likely to have the condition than other women. More than one in 10 of those who have recently given birth experience symptoms. These can include an irrational fear of accidentally injuring the baby, increased worry about germs and hygiene, and obsessive checking for mistakes. For example some women with the condition feel the need to constantly check that baby monitors are working, that cots and high chairs are secure, or that bottles are sterilised. The condition is now even more common in new mothers than post-natal depression, which affects around one in ten. Scientists believe that in many cases the two may be linked. OCD is a mental condition characterised by unwanted and repeated thoughts that create anxiety, and a compelling urge to dispel them. This can result in repetitive actions, such as constantly washing hands, or mental rituals that can include counting or avoiding ‘unlucky’ colours. In severe cases, the disorder can have a devastating effect on an individual. Some new mothers report intrusive fears that they might harm their baby. ‘It may be that certain kinds of obsessions or compulsions are adaptive and appropriate for a new parent, for example those about cleanliness and hygiene,’ said lead researcher Dr Dana Gossett, from Northwestern University in Illinois, US. ‘But when it interferes with normal day-to-day functioning and appropriate care for the baby and parent, it becomes maladaptive and pathologic.’ An estimated two to three per cent of adults have OCD, with famous sufferers including David Beckham. The former England captain has spoken of his compulsion to count clothes and place magazines in straight lines and symmetrical patterns. The condition may be triggered by stress, which could explain its association with pregnancy and childbirth, according to the researchers. The study looked at 461 women who were due to give birth and screened them for anxiety, depression and OCD. Famous OCD sufferers include David Beckham. The former England captain has spoken of his compulsion to count clothes and place magazines in straight lines and symmetrical patterns . Tests were carried out two weeks after delivery and six months after the women had gone home.The results, published in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine, showed an OCD rate among the women of 11 per cent - up to five times the risk for the general population. In about half the cases investigated, OCD behaviour began to improve after about six months. However, some women only begin to display symptoms this long after delivery and the risk remains for up to a year after giving birth. The most commonly-reported examples of OCD found in the study were concern about dirt or germs followed by compulsions to check that they did not ‘make a mistake’. Other manifestations included constantly testing baby monitors were working, washing and re-washing bottles, and constantly checking a baby is still breathing or its cot is secure. About 70 per cent of women who screened positive for OCD were also found to be suffering from depression, with the overlap suggesting post-natal OCD is a previously unrecognised mental problem. ‘There is some debate as to whether post-partum (post-natal) depression is simply a major depressive episode that happens after birth, or its own disease with its own features,’ said co-author Dr Emily Miller, also from Northwestern University. ‘Our study supports the idea that it may be its own disease with more of the anxiety and obsessive-compulsive symptoms than would be typical for a major depressive episode.’","More than one in 10 of those who have recently given birth have symptoms .

A woman whose breasts were so saggy that she had to fold them up to fit them into her bra is looking forward to finding love after a breast reduction on Embarrassing Bodies has changed her life. Ann, 47, had large breasts from a young age and when she gained a lot of weight as an adult her bra size expanded to an incredible size 48J. At her heaviest Ann weighed 25 stone. She lost almost 13 stone through bariatric surgery but was left with breasts that sagged over her tummy and were still a 34G. No confidence: Ann had large breasts from a young age but when she gained a lot of weight and was up to 25 stone, her breasts weighed in at a whopping 48J and became very saggy leaving her with little confidence . She had to double her breasts over to fit them into a bra. Speaking to Dr Christian on the Channel 4 show, she said: 'I have no self esteem and because I've got no confidence, I can't possibly contemplate a relationship. 'I don't ever look at myself in the mirror, only to do my hair. I don't ever look at my body because it's so disgusting. 'I've come to see you today because I've lost a lot of weight and I've got a lot of loose skin, especially on my boobs.' Following her extreme weight loss, Ann had been left with lots of loose skin, which she said she found really hard to deal with. A real pain: Her heavy breasts gave her back ache, neck ache and she would get a rash underneath and often infections so she set about changing her life on the show .

He said: 'You've lost a lot of weight but . your breasts are very deflated and, to put it kindly, your nipples . are now pointing at your feet.' A protein called elastin helps skin . ping back into place after it has been stretched. However, when Ann . weighed 25st, her skin was stretched so much and for so long that when she lost the weight it was no longer effective. Happy: Speaking to Dr Christian after the surgery, Ann said that she is over the moon with her new breasts and is looking forward to living her life fully . Dr Christian added: 'What's good is that you've got . nice healthy skin all up here and I think if we reconstruct the breasts . and place them back where they should be with the nipples pointing . upwards, you're going to end up with a nice pair of breasts.' He referred her to Cosmetic Surgeon, Mr Hicham Mouallem at the Highgate Hospital in London for a reconstructed augmented mastopexy to uplift the breasts and give them back some shape and volume. While Mr Hicham Mouallem admitted that helping Ann would be a big challenge, he made plans for her to undergo surgery. Speaking ahead of the surgery, Ann said: 'I can't wait for this to actually be . done because then I will be able to get on with my life and move . forward, get more confident and actually just live my life instead of . just existing.' Mr Hicham Mouallem moved her nipple up completely, removed all excess skin and reshaped the breast, which took a total of three hours. Her breasts had to be strong enough . to support the implant so he removed as much of the saggy skin as he . could, then created a pocket within the breast in which an implant was inserted. In total, he has removed 1.5kg of flesh; the equivalent of two guinea pigs.

'I feel much better, a million per cent better, especially when I have a shower. Before my boobs were so horrendous that I had to hook them over my arm to wash but now I don't have to do that.

Burning effigy: An image of retired pope Benedict XVI was set alight in a church in northern Italy during Sunday mass . A Catholic priest set fire to a photograph of Benedict XVI in the middle of Sunday mass in northern Italy. The now Pope Emeritus' first Sunday in retirement was marred by the actions of the clergyman in a petite medieval village on the border to France who accused him of deserting the church. Father Andrea Maggi, 67, said the former pope was 'like the Captain Calamity of the Concordia who had abandoned his ship.' Parishioners in Castel Vittorio, a hilltop village of 350 inhabitants, in Liguria, were shocked when the priest set showed them a picture of the ex-Pope and then set fire to it with a candle. Father Maggi explained his actions by saying: 'a shepherd shouldn’t abandon his flock.' Castel Vittorio mayor, Gianstefano Orengo, who was summoned to tackle the errant priest said: 'It was a shocking gesture. 'I understand that Don Andrea is going through a delicate period from a psychological point of view.' The local bishop said he was ‘mortified’ by the 'reprehensible and grave disturbance of ecclesial communion. He said: 'I am mortified by the actions of Father Andrea, who in other respects has proved a priest who is generous and sensitive in his pastoral conduct. 'The gesture has caused confusion among the parishioners- many left the church.' But Don Maggi remained defiant saying he 'had done the right thing'. He told La Repubblica: 'I had said to myself the day that he goes I will burn this.' While other clergy claim to found the Pope's retirement courageous, Don Maggi insisted: 'I thought to myself, ""Are you the Pope or are you Captain Schettino of the Concordia who abandoned his ship?"" 'If eight years was enough of being Pope, he didn't need to accept it. He created 90 cardinals, he wasn't some novice or ingenue, who didn't know what they were getting into.' Meanwhile in the Vatican, cardinals from . around the globe received a 'rock star' welcome as they gathered for the . first round of meetings before the conclave to elect the next pope. Fiery temper: A priest in the picturesque mountain village of Castel Vittorio in Liguria, north-west Italy, held up a photo of the former pope and set fire to it with a candle .

Time to choose: Cardinals Angelo Sodano, center, and cardinal chamberlain Tarcisio Bertone, right, head opening talks ahead of a conclave to elect a new pope in the Vatican today . Huge crowds and media crews forced the cardinals and and their aides to push their way through the masses when they arrived this morning to set the date for the papal conclave. 'A Latin American Pope is possible, everything is possible!"" said Portuguese Cardinal Jose Saraiva Martins as he entered. The core agenda item is to set the date for the conclave and set in place procedures to prepare for it, including closing the Sistine Chapel to visitors and getting the Vatican hotel cleared out and de-bugged, lest anyone try to listen in on the secret conversations of the cardinals. Although the main item on the agenda is setting the date, a final day may not come today as the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, has said the date won't be finalized until all cardinals have arrived in Rome. The meeting will also cover the time table for procedures preparing for the election, including closing the Sistine Chapel to visitors and getting the Vatican hotel cleared out and de-bugged, lest anyone try to listen in on the secret conversations of the cardinals. The first day of the cardinal's meeting . has already been marred in scandal with this weekend's shock resignation . of Scottish Cardinal O'Brien. Leader: Pope Benedict XVI's last weekly public audience in St Peter's Square in Vatican City attracted record crowds to hear his final words before he stepped down on Thursday . Britain's most senior Roman Catholic admitted on Sunday that his ‘sexual conduct’ had ‘fallen below the standards expected of a priest, archbishop and cardinal’. The 74-year-old former archbishop will face a Vatican investigation into his behaviour and could be subjected to further punishment if evidence of wrongdoing is found. In Italy, the Vatican is still reeling from the fallout of the scandal over leaked papal documents, and the investigation by three cardinals into who was behind it. Italian news reports have been rife with unsourced reports about the contents of the cardinals' dossier. Even if the reports are false, as the Vatican maintains, the leaks themselves confirmed a fairly high level of dysfunction within the Vatican bureaucracy, with intrigues, turf battles and allegations of corruption, nepotism and cronyism at the highest levels of the church hierarchy. In one of his last audiences before resigning, Benedict met with the three cardinals who prepared the report and decided that their dossier would remain secret. But he gave them the go-ahead to answer cardinals' questions about its contents.","Italian priest burned image of Benedict XVI in church in northern Italy .

The number of children identified with learning difficulties in England is five times the European average because schools too often classify under-performing pupils as having special educational needs, it was claimed  last night. A fifth of pupils, or 1.6million, have been identified as having special educational needs (SEN). They represent 19.8 per cent of the school population, compared with an EU average of 4 per cent, according to an analysis of European Commission figures from 29 countries. The statistics are revealed in a book from the ARK Schools chain of academies and the CentreForum think-tank which claims youngsters are being routinely over-classified as having SEN. Education Secretary Michael Gove criticised schools for using the 'special education needs' label as an excuse for under-performance, insisting there was no reason why a child with visual impairment or deafness could not do well at school. Picture posed by models . This ‘special needs inflation’ is contributing to a worrying ‘tail of underachievement’ in the country’s schools that is letting down thousands of pupils. The book, The Tail: How England’s Schools Fail One Child In Five – And What Can Be Done, was publicly endorsed by Education Secretary Michael Gove this week. He criticised schools for using the SEN label as an excuse for under-performance, insisting there was no reason why a child with visual impairment or deafness could not do well at school. Paul Marshall, chairman of ARK Schools, which runs academies in London and Birmingham, said: ‘There would need to be something very wrong with the water for England to have five times the special needs of our European peers. ‘The true explanation lies in a system of skewed incentives which encourages schools to over-classify children.’ The book, The Tail: How England's Schools Fail One Child In Five - And What Can Be Done, was publicly endorsed by Education Secretary Michael Gove (above) this week . Sophy Blakeway, its director of education, said many schools ‘have reached too readily for the SEN label when faced with pupil underachievement’. She added that this approach is ‘perpetuating a culture of low expectations which has too often trapped children in the tail of low attainment’. League table performance measures scrapped by the Coalition meant schools could boost their rankings by having higher numbers of SEN children. But Miss Blakeway said there was still a ‘perverse incentive’ for schools to over-identify SEN to prove they were improving the average attainment of these pupils compared with their non-SEN peers during Ofsted inspections. Ofsted should instead focus on a school’s success in improving the progress of low attainers and moving children off the SEN register. Schools – particularly those in disadvantaged areas – should also be acknowledged in Ofsted judgements for using the SEN label ‘sparingly’. She added: ‘This requires a cultural shift away from locating all issues around low attainment in the child and asking hard but honest questions about how much of it is due to poor teaching.’ In 2010, Ofsted found that around 450,000 children would not be identified as having SEN if schools focused on improving teaching and learning for all. In some schools, a ‘culture of excuses’ meant pupils making slow progress were automatically classed as having SEN, the education watchdog warned. Jean Gross, the Government’s former speech and language tsar, has also said a special needs diagnosis could be ‘used as an explanation for failure’.","A fifth of pupils, or 1.6m, identified as having special educational needs .

The exhilarating mixture of triumph over adversity, romance and melodrama captured the heart of veteran film critic Barry Norman. When compiling his list of best British films he had already chosen Slumdog Millionaire - but erased it at the last-minute, opting for 49 films and leaving it up to the public to decide on the final entry. Yesterday Mr Norman was left feeling vindicated. The public's choice: Radio Times readers voted for Slumdog Millionaire in their best British film, which won eight Oscars and seven Baftas . More than 3,000 people submitted their entries to the Radio Times with more than 500 British films suggested. And with Slumdog Millionaire proving to a popular choice there could only be one winner for Mr Norman. Ultimate feel-good film: Popular British director Danny Boyle holding up his Oscar for best director for Slumdog Millionaire . Repeatedly described as the ultimate feel good film, it went on to win eight Oscars and seven Baftas. In the film, Dev Patel plays Jamal, an 18-year-old orphan from the slums of Mumbai who appears on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. He has wangled his way on to the show not to get rich quick but to get in touch with a girl he loves but has lost contact with. She has been sold into  prostitution but is such a fan of the quiz he is hoping she will be watching. When the film opens Jamal has already won the top prize and is being interrogated by police who believe he cheated. As h answers their questions it becomes apparent his poverty-stricken upbringing and petty criminal past have provided him with all the knowledge he needs to answer the questions. Mr Norman said:  ‘Actually when I was first asked to do this [list] Slumdog Millionaire was on there and I excluded it partly out of curiosity to see what kind of reaction it might get. ‘Slumdog Millionaire  was the one I wanted to put in, apart from the fact that it won eight Oscars which is remarkable for a British film, it’s a multi-layered story – it’s not simply about the questions – in explaining how the kid can answer all the questions it gives us a sense of Indian life: the poverty, the corruption, the dishonesty. It’s a very believable portrait of Indian life. It got a lot of entries. Curious: Film critic Barry Norman left Slumdog Millionaire out of his top 50 British films, wondering if the public would choose it for their vote - and they did . ‘Slumdog doesn’t have a phoney feel-good ending. There is a sense of hope which runs throughout the film which is great. ‘It’s educational without being earnest.‘ . Last month saw Mr Norman, 79, unveil his list of 49 films in the Radio Times with the inclusion of 1981 Scots film Gregory’s Girl which he described it as the best teenage film ever made. Mr Norman said the responses from Radio Times readers had left him in no doubt that films still have an important role in the lives of many. He said: ‘Movies are still very important to people and so they should be. The cinema is a great art form and we should never lose that. ‘It provides escapism which is a big factor and films can teach us a lot about ourselves, other people and other cultures and societies and that’s what Slumdog Millionaire does. ‘ .","Barry Norman left one place in his top 50 British films to a public vote .

British ministers have promised benefits for Romanian migrants will be protected, it has emerged as the row over who receives state handouts intensifies. The UK government is understood to be drawing up emergency plans to curb the benefits which can be claimed by new arrivals. Healthcare, housing and child benefit could be limited to only those people who have lived in Britain for more than a year. Ministers want to get to grips with the issue before the expected influx of thousands of Romanians and Bulgarians next year once EU restrictions are lifted . But Romanian foreign minister Titus Corlatean claims to have 'received official assurances from the British Government' that EU rules on benefits would not be changed. 'We don’t speak about the Romanians as migrants, they are European citizens, we are European citizens, we are members of the European Union so we have our legitimate rights according to the EU treaties,' he told Sky News. However, a special Cabinet committee of senior minister are looking at ways to limit the impact on the taxpayer of thousands of Romanians and . Bulgarians arriving next year once EU restrictions are lifted. However, it means Britons could have to carry an ‘entitlement card’ to access free NHS care as part of a crackdown on health tourists. Romanian foreign minister Titus Corlatean claims British ministers reassured him that benefits would not be curbed . Reforms under discussion could mean immigrants having to wait six months or even a year before being granted habitual residency and therefore hospital care. Tory MP Stewart Jackson urged minister to 'take a chance' and limit access to benefits for immigrants because a European Court ruling on the legaility of such a move would take years. 'We’ve got to be robust, as they are in Spain, they are using the free movement directive to the nth degree,' he told BBC2's Daily Politics. 'We have to do that to protect the access to public services and our employment market. It’s important to recognise that the free movement directive is not a tablet of stone, its quite a flexible document, and ministers should have been looking at this issue months, not years ago.' Local residents could also jump the queue for council housing under a plan to give preferential treatment to people with strong ties to local areas. Today Downing Street said the idea is one of a 'range of options' being considered to limit access to benefits. The Prime Minister's Official spokesman said: 'There is an ongoing process of considering a range of options by the Cabinet sub committee, the Prime Minister chaired a meeting of it recently.  It is looking at a number of ideas. 'We are not at the announcements stage. We have to operate within the law, including the the EU single market law and yes it's my understanding that one can't discriminate between EU nationals under that law.' He added that the moves by the government were designed to address growing public unease about the prospect of thousands of new migrants arriving in the UK. 'There's a widespread public concern around pressures around some services both in housing services and the NHS there's a widespread sense of concern,' the spokesman added. A cross-government committee chaired by Tory immigration minister Mark Harper is examining a raft of ideas about how the curbs could be introduced, although details remain vague. Other members include health, justice, treasury, housing, schools, transport and foreign ministers. Ill-fated: Labour's ID card plan failed . Any plan to limit healthcare to those . who can prove they are entitled to free care would involve them . presenting a card at the point of treatment. However, the idea could spark civil liberty concerns akin to the opposition to Labour’s plans to impose an identity card. And . any plans to change the habitual residency test could be controversial. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Alarm bells should be ringing. The concern must be that the Government is set to limit benefits and access to the NHS under the cover of Romanians and Bulgarians gaining the right to work here. 'The Government must spell out its plans in full detail and come clean on which people living in the UK will lose out. Ministers must also clarify whether those, such as UK pensioners who have moved to Spain, will see their eligibility to health treatment affected too.' The European Commission is already unhappy that the UK has imposed such . a test to prevent immigrants gaining access to all benefits and would . be likely to oppose a plan to extend the test to entitlement to NHS . care. Frank Field, . Labour MP for Birkenhead, and Nicholas Soames, Tory MP for Mid Sussex, . who co-chairman a cross-party parliamentary group on balanced migration, . have written a letter to Jeremy Hunt to outline their proposal. They . told the Health Secretary to ‘get this situation dealt with very soon’ to avoid a public backlash. The . idea would be welcomed by many doctors who say they find it difficult . to ask people whether they are entitled to NHS care for fear of . appearing racist. Conservative . plans to clamp down on immigrants’ access to free healthcare will be . seen as an another attempt by the party to steal a march on UKIP after . their second place in last week’s Eastleigh by-election. UKIP . leader Nigel Farage claimed they pushed the Tories into third because . David Cameron was too busy talking about issues such as wind turbines . and gay marriage rather than immigration. Mr Cameron has confirmed previous reports that he is backing plans to clamp down on immigrants’ access to free healthcare. He wants to do this by changing the ‘habitual residency test’, which is used to refuse certain benefits to immigrants. At present, it gives full access to NHS care to anyone permanently resident in the UK. Iain Duncan Smith, Work and Pensions Secretary, would like to see a habitual residence test for all handouts . In addition, hospitals will be compelled to enforce current rules which mean tourists and others who have no right to free care – including failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants – are charged for any services they receive on the NHS. A source close to Mr Hunt said there was concern that the NHS was being exploited by ‘more and more’ people from overseas, putting a strain on services. ‘The National Health Service is becoming the global health service,’ the source said. ‘We are looking at the way in which services are open to people. You have to be ordinarily resident to access healthcare. ‘We have to have a look at that and whether there is a prospect of changing that. We are looking in a bit more detail at the contributions you need [to have paid] to be entitled to free healthcare.’ The habitual residence test is used to decide whether migrants from the EU and elsewhere are eligible for certain benefits. Last month Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he wanted to see the test extended to all handouts, so that no one can claim a benefit unless they can show they have rented a home here for at least a year. Labour's Chris Bryant, the shadow immigration minister, said: 'This Government has spent the weekend flying more kites than Mary Poppins. 'Managing immigration in a fair way is really important. Yet what we are getting from the Government is just an unseemly reaction to threats from their backbenches.'","Romanian foreign minister Titus Corlatean claims to have 'received official assurances from the British Government' that handouts would continue .

Furniture giant Ikea has taken chocolate cake off the menu at stores in 23 countries worldwide after it was found to contain bacteria found in human faeces. Almost two tons of cake imported by the Swedish firm to China were destroyed late last year after authorities found it contained coliform bacteria, which is present in sewage. Quarentine officials in Shanghai confirmed that 1,872kg of chocolate almond cake imported by the company contained excessive levels of coliform bacteria which is found in human faeces. Ikea Australia today also confirmed that the cake had been withdrawn from sale there too. The news comes just a week after Ikea became embroiled in the horsemeat scandal. Food scandal: Cake imported to China by Swedish firm Ikea failed to meet food hygiene standards, officials have said . The company had to withdraw meatballs from 24 countries last week over fears that they could contain horse DNA. Ikea spokesman Ylva Magnusson said that the cakes were destroyed in November and December but the company’s head office had only found out about it on Monday. She said: 'The product was stopped and destroyed. So none of the cakes made it to our restaurants.' She added that the supplier has tested the same batch of almond cakes and found no presence of E. coli or human intestinal bacteria. The cake, which is made by a Swedish supplier, is sold in Ikea stores in the majority of countries that it operates in. A statement released by Ikea said that the product has now been withdrawn from 23 countries, including China and Australia - but added that the UK and Ireland are not affected. It read: 'Traces of coliform bacteria have been found in two isolated production batches of Almond cake with chocolate and butterscotch, produced for the Restaurant, from one supplier in Sweden. 'There is no health risk associated with consuming this product. 'The production batches have, as per safety and quality routines, been tested for bacteria that can cause health issues, such as E.coli, and none of these pathogen bacteria have been found.' Coliform bacteria can be found in soil, vegetation, water and everyday human environments, as well as in the faeces of humans and warm-blooded animals. Not on sale: The firm had already had to remove meatballs from 24 countries because it was feared that there could be horse DNA in them . The Shanghai quarantine bureau said this week that Kraft cream cheese and 2.7 tons of Nestle chocolate bars also were among dozens of imported products destroyed in its latest round of quality inspections. Chinese authorities have stepped up food inspections in recent years after a series of scandals over fake or shoddy goods. The Nestle chocolate apparently contained too much sorbitol, a sweetener that in large amounts can cause bowel problems, the agency said in a statement.","Chinese authorities found cake contained high levels of coliform bacteria .

Twelve former Florida A&M University band members were charged Monday with manslaughter in the 2011 hazing death of a drum major. Ten of the band members had been charged last May with third-degree felony hazing for the death of 26-year-old Robert Champion, but the state attorney’s office said they are adding the charge of manslaughter for each defendant. They also have charged two additional defendants with manslaughter, though they have yet to be arrested. Hazing death: Robert Champion died in Orlando in November 2011 after he collapsed following what prosecutors say was a savage beating during a hazing ritual . Added charges: Ten of the band members had been charged last May with third-degree felony hazing for the death of Champion, 26 but the state attorney's office said they are adding the charge of manslaughter for each defendant . The second-degree manslaughter charge announced during an afternoon status hearing carries a penalty of up to 15 years in prison. Champion died in Orlando in November 2011 after he collapsed following what prosecutors say was a savage beating during a hazing ritual. It happened on a bus parked in a hotel parking lot after Florida A&M played Bethune-Cookman in their annual rivalry football game. Authorities said Champion had bruises on his chest, arms, shoulder and back and died of internal bleeding. Witnesses told emergency dispatchers that the drum major was vomiting before he was found unresponsive aboard the bus. Christopher Chestnut, an attorney for Champion’s parents, said Pam and Robert Champion, Sr. were pleased with Ashton’s decision to upgrade the charges. ‘These charges are commensurate with the acts committed,’ Chestnut said. ‘It sends the right message regarding zero-tolerance of hazing in the FAMU band.’ Brian Jones, left, and Ryan Dean, right, have already been sentenced after pleading no-contest to third-degree felony hazing last year . Rikki Wills, left, and Caleb Jackson, right, were two others among the twelve band members charged with manslaughter . Prosecutors had originally filed felony hazing charges because the charges only required that they prove the defendants took part in a hazing that resulted in death. It didn’t require them to prove who struck the fatal blows. A spokesman for State Attorney Jeff Ashton’s office said the prosecutor would not comment. Ashton, a 30-year veteran who was on the team that failed to convict Casey Anthony of murder in 2011, was sworn in as the area’s top prosecutor in January after beating his former boss in a hotly contested election. David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami, said it would be easier to prove felony hazing charges than it would be to prove manslaughter. ‘The easy way out is you charge them with felony hazing. That’s what they decided to do initially. You’re still holding someone accountable,’ Weinstein said. 'Now you have somebody new who comes in, takes a look at the evidence, and for a combination of reasons decides the manslaughter charge is warranted.’ Leading prosecutor: State Attorney Jeff Ashton Ashton, who was on the team that failed to convict Casey Anthony of murder in 2011, upgraded the charges . Weinstein also said it was not unusual for prosecutors to go ahead with the lesser charge while still gathering evidence and then later upgrade. Two former band members whose cases were resolved last year weren’t among those charged Monday. Brian Jones and Ryan Dean have already been sentenced after pleading no-contest to third-degree felony hazing last year. Jones was sentenced last October to six months of community control, which strictly limits his freedom with measures including frequent check-ins with probation officials. He also was given two years of probation and required to perform 200 hours of community service. Dean was sentenced the following month and received four years of probation and 200 hours of community service. 'Pleased': An attorney for Champion¿s parents said Pam and Robert Champion, Sr., pictured, were pleased with Ashton's decision . Judge Marc Lubet conferenced with all the attorneys involved before Monday’s hearing and said they all agreed that because of a witness list that includes more than 100 people, a June trial date was unlikely. He has set another status hearing in the case for August. Since Champion’s death FAMU has made sweeping changes to fight hazing. The band remains suspended and there still has not been a time announced for its return. The university is still searching to find a new director for the band. FAMU’s board held an emergency meeting last month to discuss the wrongful death lawsuit filed by the Champion family, though there were no final decisions made. Interim FAMU President Larry Robinson said the board was authorized to continue trying for a resolution with the family. The Champions, who live in the Atlanta suburb of Decatur, Georgia, claim university officials did not take enough action to stop hazing in the famed Marching 100 band before the death of their son. They rejected a previous offer to settle the case for $300,000. New rules: Since Champion¿s death A&M University has made sweeping changes to fight hazing .

"PUBLISHED: . 11:33 EST, 5 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:33 EST, 5 March 2013 . Four army bases are to be closed and another three scaled back in major shake-up of forces sites which will save £240million-a-year. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted the move would sever ‘historic ties’ between local communities and the army. But he defied a Cabinet warning from Treasury minister Danny Alexander that ministers must not 'air dirty laundry' over cuts in public, by again speaking out against further reductions in the Ministry of Defence budget. Cuts: Four army bases are to be axed, including Howe Barracks in Canterbury, Kent where the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, 5th Battalion were stationed . Battle: Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, pictured arriving for Cabinet today, used the bases announcement to defy a warning from Treasury minister Danny Alexander not to air 'dirty laundry' over cuts in public . Under the plans announced today, all British troops are to be returned from Germany a year earlier than planned, with them based at Salisbury Plain, Edinburgh and Leuchars, Catterick, Aldershot, Colchester, Stafford and the East Midlands. But barracks in North Yorkshire, Canterbury, Edinburgh and Pembrokeshire will be axed as a result of a dramatic cut in the number size of the army. ‘The local communities in each of these areas have been hugely supportive of the military presence over many years,’ Mr Hammond told MPs. He said it was a plan ‘that is driven by the army's requirement to generate military capability in the most effective and efficient way as it reconfigures for contingent operations, based almost entirely in the UK’. Mr Hammond added: 'By setting out our plans to bring troops back to the UK we are not only providing our service personnel and their families with greater stability for their future, but also generating a saving of around £240 million a year in operational running costs. 'We are going to invest an additional £1.8 billion in our new basing plan, providing investment around the country, crucial jobs for local economies and the best possible accommodation for our soldiers and their families. 'This work also supports and enables the Army 2020 structure, announced last year, which will ensure that the British Army remains the most capable Army in its class, adaptable and ready to meet the security challenges of the next decade and beyond.' Closures: The cost-cutting plan will see the end of Claro Barracks, Ripon, North Yorkshire; Howe Barracks, Canterbury; Craigiehall Barracks in Edinburgh; and Cawdor Barracks in Brawdy, Pembrokeshire. Parts of Redford Barracks, Edinburgh; Forthside Barracks, Stirling; and Copthorne Barracks, Shrewsbury will also be cut back . The bases which will be axed are: Claro Barracks, Ripon, North Yorkshire; Howe Barracks, Canterbury; Craigiehall Barracks in Edinburgh and Cawdor Barracks in Brawdy, Pembrokeshire. Parts of Redford Barracks, Edinburgh; Forthside Barracks, Stirling; and Copthorne Barracks, Shrewsbury will also be cut back. Around 11,000 British troops based in Germany will return home by 2016 under plans which will see nearly £2 billion invested in Army housing and bases. It is equibalent to 70 per cent of the total and ahead of the plan to have half out by that date. The remaining 4,500 troops will be back in the UK by 2019, a year earlier than planned. Around £1 billion of the funding being announced today will be go towards 1,900 new houses for service families and accommodation for 7,800 single soldiers. Another £800 million will be spent on infrastructure and refurbishment of bases. However Mr Hammond used the announcement to launch another defence of his department's budget, despite warnings hours earlier that ministers should stop publicly scrapping over funding. At this morning's session of Cabinet, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander told ministers to stop airing 'dirty laundry' in public. The senior Lib Dem said that this was 'no way to do business', adding: 'I would like to say it is really important that we do work together and that conversations between ministers are private. We should not air our dirty laundry in public.' But hours later Mr Hammond told reporters at a press conference: 'We have some challenging efficiencies which we are driving through now, including in the front line commands. 'I have never said, and I would never say, that there are not further efficiencies that we can take and we are working right now to identify where we mighty find still further efficiencies across the defence budget. 'But really, if we go beyond what can be delivered from efficiency, there will have to be a reassessment of the output that is delivered.'","Barracks in North Yorkshire, Canterbury, Edinburgh and Pembrokeshire to close and three others to be scaled down .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 12:17 EST, 28 February 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:17 EST, 28 February 2013 . A baby has cheated death after she was randomly chosen to have a new blood test. Five-month-old Habul Khatoon was one of 430,000 babies chosen by doctors at Sheffield Children’s Hospital to be screened for five serious conditions. The test showed that Habul has the rare metabolic condition, Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD), which causes a potentially fatal build up of amino acids in the blood. As soon as the results came in the seriously ill baby was rushed to hospital, where they discovered she was just hours from death. Habul Khatoon (pictured with her mother, Fahmeeda) was diagnosed with Maple Syrup Urine Disease when she was just hours from death . Her mother, Fahmeeda Khatoon, said: ‘It was a big shock to begin with. The nurses called me on the phone and then a few minutes later they were at the door. ‘They called an ambulance straight away to take Habul into hospital. At this point she wasn't crying, she was lethargic and already in a coma-like state.’ Mrs Khatoon, who lives in Birmingham, had a normal pregnancy and only realised there was something wrong when her daughter did not settle like normal babies. MSUD is so rare, and symptoms are initially so broad, that any number of ailments could have been causing the symptoms. ‘She was trying to cry but she wasn't able to. We didn't know what to do,’ said Mrs Khatoon. However, the child was saved because she took part in the newborn screening just six days after she was born. Two days later, when Habul was eight-days-old, the results came back showing that she had MSUD, a genetic disorder which stops the body breaking down parts of proteins called amino acids. The test identified high levels of the amino acid leucine in Habul’s blood, a condition which can lead to coma, brain damage and death if not treated. Sheer luck: Habul was only diagnosed because she was selected for a screening programme at Sheffield Children's Hospital. (Pictured here with consultant Dr Anupam Chakrapani, left, and head of dietetic services Anita MacDonald, right.) Mrs Khatoon, 30, said: 'She was a very lucky girl. She had to be taken straight to the Intensive Care Unit.’ Habul was put on dialysis to cleanse her blood and then began special feeds given via a feeding pump. After just 48 hours she came out of the coma-like state and could cry normally. She is now being fed low-leucine feeds made up by her mother who has received special training on how to feed her daughter correctly. MSUD is an inherited metabolic disorder which is caused by a mutation in at least four genes. It causes a potentially fatal build up of amino acids in the blood. If untreated it causes brain damage, physical disabilities and death. Globally it affects about 1 in every 185,000 live births. Symptoms include maple syrup smelling urine and earwax, poor feeding, vomiting, poor weight gain, lethargy and seizures. It is managed through a carefully controlled diet which is low in the amino acid leucine. The only other treatment is liver transplant. As she grows up Habul will need to have a very low protein diet avoiding eggs, fish and meats amongst other foodstuffs in order to stay well. Dr Anupam Chakrapani, a consultant at Birmingham Children's Hospital, said: ‘The expanded newborn screening project sped up the diagnosis and treatment of this rare condition and enabled Habul to recover quickly and she has remained very well.’ Mrs Khatoon added: ‘I'm very thankful. Back home in Pakistan there might be many children that pass away on a daily basis so I'm very appreciative of the programme.’ Sheffield Children's NHS Foundation Trust ran the UK pilot to screen babies across the country for five very rare diseases - MSUD, homocystinuria, glutaric aciduria type 1, isovaleric acidaemia and long chain hydroxy acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. These tests were carried out on top of the current five, which include tests for cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disorders - for which every newborn is screened. So far 228,000 babies have been screened and seven children have been diagnosed with rare conditions that would have limited their lives if left untreated. The results from the pilot will be evaluated by the NHS National Screening Committee early next year before a decision is made on whether to introduce such screening nationwide. Professor Jim Bonham, director for newborn screening at the  Sheffield Trust, said: ‘So far the project is progressing extremely well. Seven children already have been discovered and this is very encouraging. ‘We're very much looking forward to seeing the end result of this project and hope it will have changed a significant number of children's lives for the better.’ For more information visit the MSUD Family Support Group.","Habul Khatoon was diagnosed with Maple Syrup Urine Disease (MSUD)

Murdered: A congressman has called for an FBI probe into the death of mayoral candidate Marco McMillian (pictured) in Mississippi . A Mississippi congressman has called for an FBI probe into the killing of an openly gay mayoral candidate. US Rep Bennie Thompson - whose district includes Clarksdale, where Marco McMillian was running - wants the review to determine if any federal laws might have been broken. The body of Mr McMillian, 34, was found last week in a rural area nearby. His body was reportedly beaten and burned before being left near a Mississippi River levee. Mr Thompson, a Democrat, said he has confidence in the sheriff investigating the death but that he wants the FBI to get involved because that's what Mr McMillian's family wants, ABC News reports. 'If another set of eyes looking at it would provide additional information, I think it would be helpful to the McMillian family,' Mr Thompson said. Coahoma County sheriff's spokesman Will Rooker said the investigation continues and that officers are looking at all possibilities - including whether hate crime laws were broken, according to ABC News. Mr Thompson, who is the top Democrat on the House Homeland Security Committee, said the FBI could determine if a hate crimes charge should be considered. Mr McMillian's campaign had said he was one of the first openly gay, viable candidates for public office in Mississippi. Mr Thompson said he had personally known . Mr McMillian and that his daughter and the mayoral candidate had . attended the same college - Jackson State University - at the same time. A person with knowledge of the . investigation told the Associated Press that Mr McMillian was found to have bruises and that . there were burns on at least part of his body. On Thursday, Lawrence Reed, 22, was taken into custody and charged with the murder of Mr McMillian. The cause of death has not yet been released.

Jodi Arias resumed testimony on Monday in her Arizona death penalty case as her defense attorneys worked to undo any damage from her withering cross-examination last week. Under intense questioning from prosecutor Juan Martinez last week, Arias, 32, had admitted to lying throughout the investigation in order to cover her tracks and avoid being caught. 'Were you forced to testify?' defense attorney Kirk Nurmi asked Arias today in the Phoenix, Arizona courtroom. Scroll down for video . Support: Jodi Arias, left, demonstrates how she had her arm around her sister in a photograph that had been admitted into evidence today with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott . 'No,' she said. 'When you chose to testify, did you so do with the idea that the lies you told would be called into question?' Nurmi prodded. 'Yes,' Arias said. Arias, 32, is charged in the June 2008 killing of her lover in his suburban Phoenix home. She says it was self-defense, but the prosecution says she planned the attack on Travis Alexander in a jealous rage. Arias initially told authorities that she had nothing to do with Alexander’s death, then blamed it on masked intruders before settling on self-defense. Arias also was questioned repeatedly . during cross-examination last week about the steps she took after she . killed Alexander, all admittedly in an attempt to create an alibi. She dumped the gun in the desert, got . rid of her bloody clothes, tried to clean the scene at Alexander’s home . and even left the victim a voicemail on his mobile phone within hours . of killing him and dragging his body into the shower. She said she was . too scared and ashamed to tell the truth. Last stand: Arias, 32, is questioned on Monday, during redirect from defense attorney Kirk Nurmi in Maricopa County Superior Court . Prosecutors are working to prove it was a premeditated killing that deserves a first-degree murder conviction in order to secure a chance at the death penalty. 'Did you go to Mr Alexander’s home on June 4 with the intent on killing him?' Nurmi asked Arias on Monday. 'No, I didn’t,' she said. 'That was never a thought.' Arias’ grandparents had reported a .25 caliber handgun stolen from their Northern California home about a week before the killing - the same caliber used to shoot Alexander in the head - but Arias says she never knew her grandfather had the weapon. Authorities believe she brought it with her, though she has testified she shot Alexander with his own gun as he chased her into his closet in a rage after body-slamming her and threatening to kill her. 'He was trying to kill me so I was defending myself,' she said Monday. Aggressive: Martinez has kept up a rapid fire of questions each time he addresses the murder suspect on the stand . Alexander had also been stabbed and slashed 27 times and had his throat slit. His body was found by friends about five days later. Arias has testified that in the months leading up to his death, Alexander had grown physically abusive and beat her on numerous occasions. However, no witnesses have testified and jurors have heard nothing to indicate Alexander had ever shown violent behavior in the past, and there has been no proof admitted at trial that he ever owned a gun. Arias even told authorities repeatedly after her arrest that he didn’t own a gun. That story changed only after several years in jail when she admitted to the killing.","Arias, 32, charged with 2008 .

A squeeze on access to the Health Service, taxpayer-subsidised housing and welfare is being considered as part of a package designed to limit the number of people who come from Bulgaria and Romania when controls are lifted at the end of this year. However, Number 10 confirmed that to comply with EU law, restrictions would have to apply at least in principle to UK citizens too – raising the prospect of people having to prove their eligibility to access services. Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘What a pity that having failed to adequately control our own borders, we are now having to put up frontiers to our public services. ‘Had we managed to control who was coming in to our country, we would not need to be rationing access to our benefits. This will mean British people will have to effectively carry the equivalent of an identity card to access public services.’ TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘The Government must spell out its plans in full detail and come clean on which people living in the UK will lose out.’ The most drastic step being considered is to make key benefits dependent on how long applicants have lived and worked here. Some payments, such as jobseeker’s allowance and the state pension, are already linked to National Insurance contributions. A Government source said that could be extended across other payments – such as income support or tax credits – to ensure that those who have ‘worked and paid in here for years’ benefit most. Ministers on a committee chaired by immigration minister Mark Harper have also proposed telling councils to give greater priority to local people in the allocation of housing. Factors such as whether people have gone to school in an area, or have family locally, could be given greater weight. Earlier this year it emerged that the Department of Health is drawing up proposals so that certain categories of migrant workers are told that they must have private medical insurance to prevent the NHS becoming an ‘international health service’. Foreign students and temporary visitors are expected to be prevented from getting free care on the NHS. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt recently . told MPs: ‘We have to ask whether it is appropriate for us to be giving . free health care to short-term visitors. We will be saying more about . that issue shortly.’ Former Labour welfare minister Frank Field (left), and Tory . MP Nicholas Soames (right) oint chairmen of a cross-party group on migration, said they welcomed a review on access by . new arrivals to NHS and housing . Under . EU law, the UK is entitled to reclaim the cost of healthcare from the . patient’s country of origin, but the NHS has written off at least . £35million because it is often complex and costly to reclaim the cash. Government . sources played down the possibility of an ‘entitlement card’ that would . be required to access NHS care. One said: ‘We don’t want to do anything . that would look like ID cards by the back door.’ However, . it is likely to be a requirement that students and migrants who claim . they are ‘self-sufficient’, meaning they are not coming looking . immediately for work, have to have private medical insurance. Those who wanted to see a GP or have non-emergency treatment on the NHS would be charged. Tory . MP Nicholas Soames and former Labour welfare minister Frank Field, . joint chairmen of a cross-party group on migration, said: ‘We warmly . welcome the news that the Government are looking closely at access by . new arrivals both to the NHS and to social housing. The . cross-party group has vigorously been pressing the Health Secretary to . introduce checks on access to GPs and wider NHS services. We have also . urged the housing minister to make the recording of nationality . compulsory for new lets.’ Transitional . arrangements in place since 2005, which restrict the rights of . 29million Bulgarian and Romanian citizens to live and work in other EU . states, will expire in December. Campaign group MigrationWatch has claimed that as many as 250,000 could arrive over the next five years. A . Downing Street spokesman said a Cabinet sub-committee had met ‘several’ times to discuss the issue of migrants’ access to benefits and that an . announcement was expected before the Queen’s Speech in May. Minister without portfolio Kenneth Clarke warned his colleagues not to play up ‘fanciful fears’ being stoked by UKIP. He . added: ‘Some of the things that have been canvassed around I don’t . recognise as Government policy or anything likely to be adopted by a . Conservative Party that I recognise.’ Some EU nations find it easier to restrict access to benefits than the UK. Many use ID cards, which make it easy to check whether a migrant is resident without discriminating, because all citizens have to carry cards. Some also tend to have more contributory benefits, accessible only to those who have paid into an insurance system. FRANCE Out of work benefits: Usually not payable until someone has lived in France for at least six months. Healthcare: People expected to have signed up for health insurance, and apply for a ‘Carte Vitale’ eligibility card after passing residence test. Most patients will have to pay up front before claiming the costs back. Housing: Access defined on basis of need. No separate requirements for a link with the area. GERMANY Out of work benefits: Can be claimed only if the applicant has worked in Germany – however briefly. Must usually be resident, and prove this by signing in at the ‘residents’ registration office’ of the local council. No minimum period of residence. Healthcare: Individuals must join statutory health insurance.  Only once they start paying in, can they receive general healthcare. Housing: Access defined on basis of need. No separate requirements for a link with the area so migrants can get housing. ITALY Out of work benefits: Claimants entitled only if they live in Italy, and local councils carry out checks. Certificate of residence, granted by local authority, must be provided before benefits can be accessed. Healthcare: Eligibility based on residence, and patient must have started to pay into the state insurance system. The patient may have to contribute to the cost of some drugs and treatments. Housing: One of the few countries open about giving its nationals priority in access to social housing. SPAIN Out of work benefits: Claimants must have worked in Spain for at least 360 days in the past six years. They must have registered with social security service and joined insurance scheme. Healthcare: Workers expected to join insurance scheme. Those who are not ordinarily resident in Spain or are not part of scheme will get only emergency care paid for. Housing: Decided by the income of applicant and disabilities. Provinces allowed to impose their own residence requirements.","Migrants from the European Union could .

It is also probably one of the sleekest machines to bear the prestige marque. For those qualities alone, the £225,000 Rolls-Royce Wraith is likely to be one of the stars of the upcoming Geneva Motor Show. But this car is rather clever, too. It can read the road that hasn’t quite come into the driver’s view yet. Scroll down for video . Sleek: The two-door £225,000 Rolls-Royce Wraith which can 'see' further ahead than its driver thanks to GPS technology . Powerhouse: The Wraith has a 6.7litre, 624brake horse-power V12 engine - the equivalent of six Ford Fiestas - and can reach 60mph in 4.4 seconds . Low-slung: The car has the sweeping styling of a 'fastback' coupe and Rolls describes the four-seater as 'the ultimate gentleman's grand tourer' Using GPS mapping, it pre-selects the correct gear for what lies ahead – even when confronted with potentially complicated situations such as roundabouts and motorway junctions. A company spokesman said: ‘The satellite-aided transmission uses GPS data to see beyond what the driver sees; it anticipates his or her next move based on location and current driving style, then selects the most appropriate gear for the terrain ahead.’ Naturally, the driver retains  ultimate control of the car’s automatic gearbox through the brakes and accelerator. Apart from the transmission, the latest technology is also deployed in the Wraith’s steering and suspension and in its voice-activated controls – ‘the on-board valet’. These include the satellite navigation, meaning the car can simply be told its destination. The low-slung Wraith has the sweeping styling of a ‘fastback’ coupe and Rolls-Royce describes the four-seater as ‘the ultimate gentleman’s grand tourer’.

Germany will stop Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen passport-free zone across Europe, interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich has said . Germany will stop Romania and Bulgaria joining the Schengen passport-free zone across Europe if they push for membership of it at an EU meeting on Thursday. Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich warned both nations if they insist on entry into the scheme ‘Germany will veto it and they will fail’. The Netherlands also backs the ban. Britain is not signed up to the Schengen agreement. It is strong language from a politician well versed in more diplomatic speak, but Germany is undergoing an invasion of immigrants from both countries with many cities experiencing extreme social tensions as a result. Only last Friday the left-wing mayor of the former industrial city of Duisburg spoke of rubbish mountains, children of immigrants organised into gangs for stealing expeditions and an apartment block for 200 housing nearly 400 Romanians and Bulgarians. The Schengen accord allows participating nations to allow its citizens to pass borders without having to show a passport. Twenty-six nations participate, but Britain remains outside of it out for security concerns. When asked if either Romania or Bulgaria could have a Schengen-zone at a major air or seaport, Mr Friedrich said: ‘No,’ adding: ‘The concept of freeing up certain areas, such as arrivals by air or via seaports, is likewise unacceptable. ‘The EU has long been evaluating whether or not Romania and Bulgaria are ready for acceptance in the Schengen Area. The last annual report showed progress, but it’s not enough. ‘Bulgaria and Romania still have to be more decisive in the fight against corruption. Those who acquire a visa through bribery could travel all the way to Germany without further controls.’ The minister also called for stricter sanctions for anyone who tried to cheat a country’s social security system. In response, Romania’s foreign  minister Titus Corlatean warned Europe’s leaders that excluding his country from the rules that allow their citizens to travel without passports would only remind Romanians of the Communist era. Last Friday the left-wing mayor of the former industrial city of Duisburg (pictured) spoke of rubbish mountains, and children of immigrants organised into gangs for stealing expeditions . He said: ‘This reminds us of a separation line we had before 1989... I am not sure Romanians were asked after World War II if they want to be on the other side of the wall with Stalin, instead of being with Churchill.’ Mr Friedrich, in a parting shot seen aimed squarely at Brussels mandarins who take decisions without consulting the people of the EU, added; ‘The Commission has to learn to pay closer attention to the viewpoints and sensitivities of the people in EU member states. ‘The basic attitude of “Oh, we’ll just turn a blind eye; the main thing is that the EU continues to grow,” is no longer acceptable for those who have to answer to the citizenry.’","Interior minister Hans-Peter Friedrich warned both nations 'they will fail'

Ferrari’s first ever hybrid was launched today as the company proves that environmental technology can still provide the speed-seeking thrills of a supercar. The new lightning-fast car called LaFerrari - or ‘The Ferrari’ – is the fastest car the company has ever built, and will have a £1million price tag. It has an electric motor linked to a 6.3 litre petrol engine that propels it from rest to 62mph in under three seconds and to 124mph in under seven seconds. Scroll down for video . Hybrid: LaFerrari is the company's first ever environmentally friendly hybrid car . With a top speed of 220mph, its lap time . around Ferrari’s legendary Fiorano  circuit is under 1 minute 20 . seconds -  5 seconds faster than a Ferrari Enzo and more than 3 seconds . faster than a the F12 Berlinetta. The company said that LaFerrari, which made its world debut at today’s Geneva International Motor Show, is the fastest car in Maranello’s history and ‘the first hybrid in Ferrari history.’ ‘All in all the car guarantees maximum driving thrills,’ said a Ferrari spokesman. ‘The LaFerrari’s body has been given a sculptural treatment heavily influenced by its aerodynamics.’ Built for thrills, LaFerrari emits 330 g/km of CO2, which though low by supercar standards, is still much higher than an average hybrid car. Striking: the car's design includes chairs that are moulded to the drivers body . fast: lap tests showed that LaFerrari is faster than the iconic Ferrari Enzo . The congestion charge exempt Toyota Prius costs £21,600 and has CO2 emissions are much lower at just 89g/km, it qualifies for exemption from the London congestion charge and does 72 miles to the gallon. Ferrari ‘LaFerrari’ Price: £1million . Type: Petrol-electric hybrid. Built: Maranello, Italy. Production run: Limited to an exclusive 499 . Length; 15ft 5 inches . Width: 6ft 6 inches . Height: 3ft 8 inches . Weight: 1.365 tonnes . Petrol engine: 6.3 litre V12 and 800 horse-power . Electric motor: 120 kilowatt and 163 horsepower. Total power: 963 horsepower- equivalent to nearly 10 Ford Fiestas. MPG: 17 to 20 mpg (estimated) Top speed: More than 220mph . 0-62mph: under 3seconds . 0- 124: under 7 seconds . CO2 emissions: 330g/km . Lap time Fiorano circuit: Under 1min 20s . To save weight the seats are fixed and moulded to the individual driver following a ‘bespoke fitting’. There are no runners. Instead it is the pedals and steering wheel which are adjustable. So if you sell the car, Ferrari will have to mould a new bespoke seat for the new owner. The driving position is similar to that of a single-seater F1 car and was designed after consultation with the Ferrari drivers Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, who both played an active role throughout the entire development process. Weight from the system is kept low and between the car’s two axles as close as possible to the floor to lower its centre of gravity by just over an inch to boost dynamic handling and help keep the car as compact as possible. The chassis has four different types of carbon-fibre, all hand-laminated and cured in an oven in the racing department using the same design and production methods as the Formula 1 car. The seats and the battery compartment were integrated into the chassis to improve the car’s rigidity and cut weight. It is powered by Ferrari’s hybrid petrol-electric energy recovery system called ‘HY-KERS.’ The powerful 6.3 litre V12 800 horse-power engine is coupled with a 120 Kw electric motor with power equivalent to about 40 electric kettles, as much horsepower as a family saloon. Together this gives the LaFerrari a combined power output of 963 horsepower – equivalent to nearly ten Ford Fiestas - to drive the wheels. The electric motor is coupled with the F1 derived dual-clutch gearbox so that power is instantly available to the wheels during acceleration and from the wheels to the electric motor during recharging. Electric: the engine is a combination of a 120kw electric motor and a 6.3litre petrol engine . Iconic: the company believe this hybrid is as thrilling as a normal supercar . A computerised engine management system controls the relative flow of petrol and electric power. A second electric motor powers ancillaries such as air conditioning. The thin battery pack weighing 60kg covers most of the cabin under-floor area and is attached to the chassis beneath the driver and passenger to keep the centre of gravity low. The batteries are charged in two different ways. Firstly energy generated from braking is collected. Secondly energy is collected every time the engine produces more torque or ‘puling power’ than is needed - such as in cornering.  Instead of being sent to the wheels, the excess power is converted to energy and stored in the batteries. An aerodynamic guide vane on the rear spoiler generates downforce to keep the car gripping the road – and prevent it taking flight.  An on board computer electronically measures the car and the driver’s actions to optimise performance.","The £1million LaFerrari is the company's first ever hybrid supercar .

Meddling: Lord Neuberger was accused of make political comments after he criticised plans to curb free legal aid . A senior judge was yesterday accused of meddling in politics after saying that legal aid cuts would bring lawlessness. Lord Neuberger, the head of the country’s highest court, warned that stripping half a million Britons of the right to free lawyers would ‘lead to people taking the law into their own hands’. He added that cuts to free legal advice and free courtroom lawyers would ‘start to undermine the rule of law’. The 65-year-old judge, who is president of the Supreme Court, spoke as the Coalition’s attempt to reform the legal aid system is about to take effect. The shake-up of legal aid in civil cases is aimed at saving taxpayers £350million a year in lawyers’ bills. Criticising the judge’s remarks, Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘If the system of justice over which his lordship presides was not so inaccessible to my constituents, justice would be even-handed in the first place. ‘But the self-serving legal elite has made justice so expensive that the state has had to subsidise lawyers. Lord Neuberger should concentrate on providing cheaper justice and stop bellyaching.’ Criminologist Dr David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘It is inappropriate for the president of the Supreme Court to make such political comments. The new President of the Supreme Court warned confidence in the legal system and 'the whole democratic process' could be undermined by curbing access to justice . ‘He is also misguided: it is the . commercial exploitation of the law that has undermined people’s respect… . lawyers no longer see themselves as servants of justice. In some . respects he appears to be speaking as a trade unionist for a special . interest group.’ Lord . Neuberger told the BBC: ‘My worry is the removal of legal aid for people . to get advice about law and get representation in court will start to . undermine the rule of law because people will feel like the . Government . isn’t giving them access to justice in all sorts of cases. ‘That . will either lead to frustration and lack of confidence in the system, . or it will lead to people taking the law into their own hands.’ In . a separate interview, he told a newspaper: ‘Rich people can always . afford legal advice and representation, but unless you have access to . legal advice for poorer people you have not got the rule of law. ‘You . get more and more people who don’t believe in the government we have, . which is very undermining, or who end up taking the law into their own . hands or a bit of both, which is not good for us, nor for the country.’ Lord . Neuberger’s intervention – which is understood to have surprised other . senior judges – came less than a month before the cuts go into operation . at the start of April. The . reforms mean legal aid will no longer be available for whole classes of . compensation claims, including those made over medical negligence, . personal injury and employment law. Taxpayer support will also be withdrawn from many family law, education, immigration, debt, housing and benefit disputes. The . judge’s remarks were a shot across the bows of Justice Secretary Chris . Grayling, who yesterday announced more legal aid reforms. These . will try to reduce the price of taxpayer-funded defence lawyers in . criminal cases by making law firms submit competitive tenders for . criminal legal aid work, so that solicitors and barristers would be . forced to compete on price for work. Tory . and Labour governments and now the Coalition have all tried to reform . legal aid since the 1980s, during which time taxpayer spending on . lawyers’ bills has more than quadrupled to £2.1billion a year. Official . figures show that in the financial year to March 2011, six barristers . each made more than £500,000 from criminal legal aid cases. Another was . paid more than £450,000 for civil legal aid cases. ANALYSIS by James Slack . Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has so far resisted engaging in a public row with Lord Neuberger . Lord Neuberger opted to focus his attack on the most emotive cuts being made by the Ministry of Justice: the ending of legal aid for court battles over benefits and family disputes. But, far from being a rare event, the legal aid taps are running constantly in the civil courts. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show that £645million is spent annually on family law alone. Increasing breakdowns between parents who are fighting bitter custody battles over their children are costing the taxpayer £468million. Taxpayers are also spending £25million on divorce cases. But it is not only the children of warring parents who are going to lose out. Taxpayers are handing nearly £500,000 a week in legal aid to prisoners to help them make human rights claims. The bill has spiralled from £1million a year before the Human Rights Act came into force in 2000 to more than £25million in 2010. The money has helped prisoners addicted to heroin to win thousands in compensation for being forced to go ‘cold turkey’ when locked up. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling decided against engaging in a public row with Lord Neuberger yesterday. Instead, he unveiled plans to target the criminal legal aid bill next. There will, inevitably, be more howls of protest. But can it really be argued that the system is working efficiently when the former fugitive tycoon Asil Nadir – who rented a £23,000-a-month London residence during his trial – received £1,056,588 in legal aid after claiming he was bankrupt? The Government is trying to recoup some of the costs. Lord Neuberger is not alone in opposing the cuts in legal aid. The Bar Council, the Criminal Bar Association and the Law Society have argued since 2010 that if the £2billion-a-year legal aid budget is slashed the ‘rule of law will be undermined’. But they are trade unions whose job is to oppose their members’ pay being cut – even if they are not exactly on the breadline. Judges, on the other hand, are meant to keep their noses out of politics. They take a very dim view when ministers criticise their rulings in human rights cases. Indeed, Lord Neuberger criticised Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday for daring to question why judges had ignored the will of Parliament in relation to deporting foreign criminals. If judges expect dignified silence from the Government, surely ministers have a right to expect the head of the Supreme Court to behave in the same way – no matter how strongly he disagrees with them.","Lord Neuberger warns plans to limit legal aid will undermine the rule of law .

Difficult life in the spotlight: Whitney Houston faced an extortion plot shortly after her marriage to Bobby Brown, and a constant stream of obsessive fan mail . Whitney Houston's troubled private life was laid bare yesterday when the FBI revealed it kept a 128 page-file on her - including obsessive fan letters and details of an extortion attempt. Shortly after Houston married singer Bobby Brown, a 'close friend' who was 'privy to . much personal information' allegedly attempted to blackmail her. A . Chicago lawyer wrote to her production company threatening that unless the singer paid $100,000 (£66,000), his client . planned to 'reveal details of [Houston's] private life to . several publications'. Later the blackmail amount was upped still . higher to $250,000 (£165,000). Whitney's father apparently sent the perpetrator a confidentiality . agreement and an unknown sum of money. The FBI monitored her at the height . of her fame between 1988 and 1999 and the files show a decade of dealing with intrusive fans. In 1999 she began receiving letters . and cassette tapes from the Netherlands which she found . threatening. The . FBI interviewed the man, who made outlandish claims that he was the 'President of Europe', purchased Brazil for $66billion and helped . Nelson Mandela win election in South Africa. At the very beginning: Whitney Houston as young up-and-coming singer signing a recording deal with Clive Davis of Arista Records in 1983 . At the height of her fame: Whitney Houston in 1988 when the FBI began monitoring her . Among her fan letters sent by a man from Vermont, New England wrote that he 'might hurt someone with some crazy idea.' He proclaimed his love for the late singer through more than 70 letters in a 17-month period, sent to Houston at the height of her fame. More... Whitney Houston 'visited doctors three times in the eight days before her death' Whitney Houston was 'chronic cocaine user' and drowned after suffering massive heart attack, coroner reveals . The file shows the FBI interviewed the man but the bureau concluded no law was broken because the man said that all he wanted was to proclaim his love for her publicly. After the peak of her career, her behaviour was increasingly erratic. She suffered a long battle with drugs, including cocaine, as well as alcohol and spent various spells in rehab. Hell-raising lifestyle: The FBI revealed that Whitney Houston was blackmailed by a 'close friend' after her marriage to Bobby Brown (right) in 1992 . Career highlight: In 1992 Whitney Houston scored a blockbuster hit with The Bodyguard, for which she also sang her most famous song 'I will always love you' Recent appearances had become increasingly erratic and the years of substance abuse had clearly taken a toll. She cancelled a string of concerts and talk shows as she struggled to cope. In a chat show with Oprah in 2003, . the star admitted the scale of her addiction to smoking crack cocaine. 'It was every day, every,' she said. 'I didn't think about the singing . part of it any more.' Her powerful voice began to suffer . because of her demons prompting record sales to nosedive and in 2007 she . split from husband Bobby Brown after 15 years of marriage. Houston was found dead in 11 February last year in a Beverly Hills hotel bath. She was 48. Authorities said . her death was an accidental drowning due to cocaine use and heart disease. With her only child: Whitney Houston had one daughter, Bobbi Kristina, with husband Bobby Brown . Shortly before she died: Houston was seen looking worse for wear leaving a nightclub in Hollywood days before her death in February 2012 . Paramedics battled to revive the singer but she was pronounced dead hours before she had been due to perform at a pre-Grammys party. Even Houston's funeral was not . without drama. While her daughter with Bobby Brown, Bobbi Kristina, 19, . was in the front row of the church with Houston's mother both in black, . ex-husband Bobby Brown stormed out. Brown had argued with Houston's family over the number of guests he was allowed to bring. Brown was driven away from the funeral but . later returned in time for the start of the home going service.

Arriving in Brussels he declared: ‘I cannot support the proposal currently on the table.’ But hours later the Treasury conceded ‘a cap of some sort will happen’. The climbdown came after the EU’s 26 other finance ministers made it clear they would not abandon the plan in the wake of the financial crisis. Britain has no veto and Mr Osborne was forced to accept a face-saving concession from Germany, Spain and Italy to undertake ‘technical negotiations’ over how the cap will work, in the hope of reaching ‘consensus’. The defeat is a significant blow to the UK, which had argued a bonus cap would have a disproportionate impact on the City of London. It will raise fresh concerns about Britain’s ability to defend the City from a wave of financial regulations being plotted by Brussels. Finance leaders fears the rules will drive away talent and restrict growth. Employers’ organisation the CBI reacted with dismay, saying: ‘The proposals will damage the competitiveness of the EU’s financial services industry, hitting the UK particularly hard, at a time when growth should be the key priority.’ Downing Street last week said David Cameron had ‘real concerns’ about the proposals, while London Mayor Boris Johnson said the ‘deluded’ plan would simply drive top bankers overseas. Yesterday Mr Osborne warned a cap on bonuses could result in banks pushing up salaries to top executives, which would be even harder to claw back in the event of failure. The Chancellor fears capping bankers' bonuses will lead to an exodus from the City of London to other financial centres, like New York . ‘Our concern is that it may have a perverse effect, it may undermine responsibility in the banking system rather than promote it,’ he said. But Irish finance minister Michael Noonan said EU ministers were in no mood to give way to Britain over the issue. Irish finance minister Michael Noonan warned Britain there is 'very little room' to take account of London's concerns . ‘There is very little further that we can do for them (the British),’ he said. ‘There isn’t really any more room left.’ France’s finance minister Pierre Moscovici said Mr Osborne would have to ‘live with what is on the table’, adding: ‘These moral rules apply to everyone, even the City.’ Michel Barnier, the EU commissioner for the single market, said excessive bonuses had fuelled risky behaviour by bankers, with dire consequences for taxpayers. ‘Enough is enough. We’ve got to put a stop to that,’ he said. The EU plans, which are now set to come into force next year, will limit bonuses to 100 per cent of a banker’s annual salary, or to 200 per cent if shareholders approve. The Treasury last night insisted it still hoped to make the cap more ‘flexible’, but conceded it could not now be blocked altogether. A spokesman said Britain would press for larger bonuses to be permitted on condition they were deferred for several years and/or paid in shares ‘so that they can be clawed back’. ÷The boss of scandal-hit UK bank Standard Chartered lashed out at the plans to cap bonuses – while pocketing a £2million payout. Chief executive Peter Sands warned a crackdown would make its best staff an ‘easy target’ for rivals outside Europe. Standard Chartered also claimed the £440million fine it was forced to pay for breaching sanctions against Iran, Burma. Libya and the Sudan was due to ‘clerical errors’.","Britain isolated in opposition to plan to cap bonuses to a year's salary .

A naked man wrapped only in a towel murdered a passer-by who disturbed his bath-time, a court heard today. Stuart Worvell, 22, was listening to loud music in the bathtub at about 9pm when he heard a series of loud knocks on his front door. Passer-by Thomas Sutton, 20, heard the bath-time music and thought there was a party going on in Worvell's house. The court heard Worvell went down wearing nothing but the towel then allegedly flew into rage before stabbing Sutton nine times. Prosecutor Gregg Taylor QC said: 'Thomas heard loud music coming from the end terrace house and thought there might be a party going on. 'He decided to stop, knock the door and try his luck. 'There was no party going on - Stuart Worvell was in his house on his own, he was in the bath with the music up loud so he could hear it from the other room. 'He got out of the bath, went to the bedroom window and said there was no party. 'Thomas kept knocking the door and asking to come in, Worvell didn't want to let him in and things got a bit heated.' The murder trial jury heard how Worvell confronted Thomas on the doorstep of the house on Maesteg, South Wales, in June of last year and was trying to get admittance to what he thought was a party. Worvell is then alleged to have grabbed a 15cm kitchen knife and stabbed him repeatedly. Thomas Sutton (left) and Kyle Harris (right) who was allegedly murdered by Stuart Worvell after they interrupted his bath time . Mr Taylor added: 'He grabbed the biggest knife he could from the cutlery drawer in the kitchen and stabbed him twice. 'The first blow was to the left hand side of the neck severing the main artery between the heart and the brain. 'The second was a wound to the left side of the chest which went deep into his lung. 'Worvell continued to stab his victim, twice to the top of the head and five times to the back. 'These were deep blows and he deliberately stuck in the full extent of the blade.' Police at the scene of the alleged stabbing in Nantyffyllon, Maesteg, south Wales in June last year . Worvell is charged with murdering Thomas Sutton, 20, of Caerau, and attempting to murder 17-year-old Kyle Harris, also of Caerau, . Thomas Sutton mistook Worvell's loud music for a house party . Worvell is also accused of stabbing Thomas' friend Kyle Harris, 18, who tried to intervene to save his best friend. Mr Taylor said: 'He was stabbed three times and survived only because he received very quick and good emergency surgery without which he would have died as well.' Thomas, a trainee groundsman, was rushed to hospital but declared dead on arrival. The court heard how after the attack Worvell - also known as Womble - got dressed and fled the scene shortly after the 9pm killing. He travelled to Cardiff where he stayed overnight. He then caught a train to Manchester but got off in Dorrington, Shropshire, and handed himself in. Jobless Worvell denies murder and attempted murder. He claims he acted in self-defence after Thomas and Kyle, both of Caerau, Maesteg, attempted to attack him with pieces of wood. Mr Taylor said: 'He claims he did what he did because he thought he was going to be attacked. 'He claimed they had pieces of wood and he thought he would have been killed so he grabbed the biggest knife he could. 'The use of such force was wholly unnecessary. 'Even though the victims had no real reason to be there they were just trying their luck, thinking they might get admittance to a party.' The trial at Cardiff Crown Court continues.

New York's Lauren Silberman made history as the first woman ever to try out for pro football on Sunday, but she was branded 'terrible' after two feeble kicks. Katie Hnida, former college placekicker for New Mexico and Colorado, feared that Silberman had even set back women's sports with her embarrassing effort.

'Unfortunately, what's going to happen . now is she's going to be looked at [as inferior] because she was female. But she was terrible.' Up-and-coming football star Mo Isom, an LSU student who could become the second ever female major college football player was also very disappointed by Silberman. She told TMZ that she was shocked at her 'lack of preparedness, training, skill and ability.' Silberman tried two kickoffs, the first going 19 yards and the second about 13 yards, and then asked to see a trainer and hobbled off. It was the second kick that likely caused the injury.

Critical: Up-and-coming NFL player Mo Isom could not believe Silberman's 'lack of preparedness' Walk it off: Lauren Silberman ices her thigh after taking two attempts during kicker tryouts at an NFL football regional combine workout . Incomplete: Silberman talked to officials about whether she could complete the day but ultimately had to leave . Posting to Twitter from the scene, Star-Ledger writer Conor Orr wrote that Silberman 'said she injured her quad earlier in the week and tried to push through it today.' When asked by The Jet Press if Silberman could get interest from any teams, Orr wrote: 'Absolutely not.' Writer Jane McManus tweeted that Silberman 'said she was injured last week in practice. Teared up. Asked what her longest kick was, said it was hard to exactly say.' As more than two dozen media, including E! Entertainment network, . watched her every move, the 28-year-old Silberman was examined off to . the side of the practice field. About 30 minutes later, while 36 other . kickers continued their workouts, she called the scene 'surreal' and . thanked the NFL for 'this tremendous opportunity.' Silberman took no warmup . kicks until she attempted her first kickoff and even appeared to have . some trouble keeping the football on the kicking tee. Grateful: Silberman thanked the staff for the chance to try out and said she hoped she would be given another opportunity in the future . Short: Silberman's combined kicks totaled just over 30 yards . First try: Silberman said she was so concerned about her leg injury she didn't even warm up before attempting a kick . 'I've always been an athlete, and I've always been a gamer,' she said . while fighting back tears. 'When I had the opportunity to be in the . NFL, one of the world's most competitive leagues, I absolutely had to . take the chance.' Silberman said she suffered a quadriceps injury while preparing for the . tryout earlier in the week, and attributed her struggles to that. 'I tried staying off it and waited for today,' she said.

All eyes on her: Silberman addressed reporters about her historic attempt after deciding she had to leave . Out early: Silberman's injury kept her from competing in the rest of the day's events . Silberman, who spoke to the media for 3 minutes after the tryout, . insisted she can 'do more' and 'it's too bad that this happened.' She also said she 'did the right thing' and anticipates trying to kick . again in the future. Silberman appeared to be favoring her right leg when she left the complex soon after that. 'I would certainly be very, very excited and happy if I had the . opportunity to try again,' she said, 'but it's not up to me. It's up . to the scouts.' She later added that Silberman 'didn't stay for the final group meeting at tryout.' Silberman had trained for weeks for the opportunity. Ready for the world: Lauren Silberman stretches before she begins her try out for the NFL Regional Scouting Combine . Go for it: Silberman has spent weeks training for this opportunity, and has made kicks from as far out as 35 yards . Pioneer: Silberman is the first woman to try out since the NFL agreed to open itself to female players in 2012 . 'I didn't think about my gender when I . registered,' Silberman, 28, told USA Today. 'I just wanted to go out . and compete with the best.' 'I . am glad that is has focused attention on increasing opportunities for . women and am so proud to be able to kick through this open door!'

A family member . said she rushed to the hospital as soon as she got the phone call about . the crash and stayed by the baby's side until he died. Nachman and Raizy Glauber, both 21, were killed when their livery cab crashed.

Share prices have hit levels not seen since before the start of the financial crisis, offering some respite to Chancellor George Osborne ahead of the Budget on March 20 . Share prices last night hit levels not seen since before the start of the financial crisis. The FTSE 100 index closed in London at its highest point since January 2008. It was up 86 points to 6,432 – taking its gains this year to £135billion. In New York, the Dow Jones hit the highest point in its 117-year history. The rally is a boost to pension pots and savings and suggests investors are regaining confidence in the world economy following years of crisis and recession. It will also offer some respite to George Osborne ahead of the Chancellor’s Budget on March 20 – and could foster confidence among businesses and households. But experts remained cautious about the prospects of a recovery in the wider economy. Paul Atkinson, an analyst at Aberdeen Asset Management, said: ‘With luck, we will see a recovery take hold in the second half of the year. ‘The question now is whether we are seeing a stealth rally in danger of running its course or whether we have the conditions for further market gains.’ A report by financial research group Markit suggested the economy would grow by 0.1 per cent in the first three months of 2013. This would be enough to prevent a third recession in quick succession but it would still not be enough to reverse the 0.3 per cent slump in the final quarter of last year. ‘While the UK may have avoided a triple-dip recession, the underlying picture is one of a modest and hesitant upturn,’ said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. The stock market rally was hailed as a milestone for investors who saw swathes of their wealth wiped out when the near collapse of the global banking system sent shares into freefall in the Great Panic of 2008 and 2009. ‘It has been a long time coming,’ said Richard Hunter, head of equities at UK stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. ‘It has been a very strong start to the year and is improving pension pots so it really does matter.’ Chris Low, chief economist at FTN . Financial in New York, said the Dow’s record was ‘particularly . significant because this economic cycle has been so challenging’. Recession beaters: Stock markets around the world have steadily risen since the start of the year . The rally has been fuelled by the hundreds of billions of pounds of emergency cash pumped into the financial system and economy by central banks such as the Bank of England and US Federal Reserve. Investors fed up with miserable returns elsewhere, due to record low interest rates, have been encouraged to plough money into shares amid hopes the powerhouse economies of the US and China will lead a recovery in the global economy. The FTSE 100 index has broken through a peak of three weeks ago to take it to five-year highs. Fears of an imminent collapse of the eurozone have also eased – despite the political unrest in Italy – while the UK economy looks set to avoid a triple-dip recession by the skin of its teeth. The FTSE crashed from a pre-crisis peak of 6,732 in mid-2007 to a low of 3,512 in March 2009 – a fall of nearly 50 per cent. The collapse of US investment banking giant  Lehman Brothers in the autumn of 2008 sent the financial markets into meltdown. The crisis also forced British taxpayers to rescue banks including Northern Rock, Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS owner Lloyds. Commentary by Alex Brummer . Stock trader Michael Capolino follows stock prices for JC Penney at the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Index reached the highest level in its history . The surge in share prices on both sides of the Atlantic suggests that after more than five miserable and turbulent years, when global capitalism looked to be teetering on the edge, business confidence is finally returning. Almost unnoticed, the Dow Jones Industrial Index has reached the highest level in its history – dragging Britain’s FTSE 100 index and other global markets ever higher. The surge in shares, after a long drought for investors, provides a glimmer of hope to savers with pensions, investment and unit trusts and individual savings accounts with large equity holdings. The timing of the rally, which has carried shares indexes some 10 per cent higher since the start of the year, is remarkable given recent economic and political news. There was despair only last week when Congress and the White House failed to agree on a US budget and ushered in automatic cuts and tax rises – in the shape of the ‘sequester’. In Europe, the stalemate in the Italian elections looked to signal another period of crisis for the euro. Remarkably, however, international investors fed up with the very low interest rate returns on cash accounts and government bonds have decided that putting money back into business, through the stock market, is a better option. Investors have also been encouraged by better economic developments. In Britain a recovery in the services sector, which accounts for 70 per cent of total output, has raised hopes that a ‘triple dip’ recession can be avoided. Indeed, with revised numbers showing the economy having expanded by 0.3 per cent last year there are serious questions as to whether there was really a ‘double dip’ at all. The improving growth outlook is reinforced by the latest information from China, that has promised to maintain an ambitious growth target for 2013, and signs that America is showing great resilience with industry recovering and employment prospects the best for nearly seven years. Stock markets are generally regarded as a significant indicator of the economic future, often rising six months to 18 months ahead of a full recovery. But they are not infallible. The Nobel-prize winning American economist Paul Samuelson famously quipped that the ‘stock market has forecast nine out of the last five recessions’ – a testimony to its historic unreliability. Nevertheless, the move of smart money out of cash and bonds into shares ought to boost the investment returns of all of our long suffering pension funds that have been badly holed by a long period of low interest rates. It should also underpin the confidence of business. The higher the share price the more freedom directors have to plan investment and recruit staff. For the moment the recovery is being stimulated by the financial ‘cocaine’ of low interest rates and printing of money. The test will come when central banks decide this help is no longer needed.","The FTSE 100 closed 86.32 points, or 1.36 per cent, higher at 6,431.95 .

He begged jurors to find him not guilty . A British tourist told a court today of the chilling moment alleged Tenerife booze cruise killer Darren Sapstead admitted: 'I did it, he deserved it.' Lucy Smethurst turned the clocks back nearly 17 years to November 1996 as she claimed the kitchen fitter confessed to pushing Garry Walton, 21, to his death after an afternoon's drinking games at high sea. The apprentice builder, originally from Leeds, west Yorkshire, drowned after falling from the boat the trio were on in an incident originally written off by Spanish investigators as an accident. Lucy, a 14-year-old girl at the time, . told a jury in the Tenerife capital Santa Cruz  she was drunk and had . her head on a table so did not see the moment Garry went overboard and . just heard the commotion. But she added: 'Darren made an . unarranged visit with a friend to our hotel the following day and me and . my sister went to eat something with them. 'I thought Garry had died by accident . but the conversation between the four of us over the table was going . along the lines that Darren did it. 'I was shocked to hear it because I didn't know what had really happened on board the boat. 'I remember very clearly saying to Darren, 'So you pushed him' and he said, 'Yes.' 'I then said, 'Do you feel guilty?' and he said, 'No, he deserved it.' 'Darren said at the time, 'Don't say . anything'. We were scared, we felt intimidated and together we decided . we wouldn't say anything.' Father-of-two Sapstead, 38, from Woodham . Ferrers near Chelmsford, Essex, is accused of Mr Walton's homicide and . faces 12 years in jail if found guilty.

Distress: The long-awaited trial comes after a protracted campaign by Garry's parents Robert and Catherine to unlock the mystery of their son's death . Mrs Smethurst, giving her evidence . behind a screen shielding her from the alleged killer, admitted under . cross-examination she had changed her story after claiming in initial . statements in Spain and the UK the death was an accident and Sapstead . was not involved. But she insisted it was because she was 'young, vulnerable and very scared of telling the truth.' She waited until September 1997 - 10 . months after the incident - to make a statement in her native Manchester . pointing the finger at Sapstead. 'I didn't know if Darren would try to . approach us but when I got back home after some time I decided I . couldn't live with what I knew,' she told the court. 'I knew the truth and couldn't keep it inside. 'It's not fair what happened that day. It's not fair on the victim's family.'

She told the court: 'Garry was very drunk and it all happened very very quickly. 'He was picked up and taken right next to the railing and forced over. He didn't fall over.' Sapstead's defence lawyer Carlos . Valenciano said Katie told Manchester police in a statement in September . 1997 when she first incriminated Sapstead that she had screamed: 'I . didn't do it, I didn't do it.' after tourists on board the boat started . having a go at her as they discovered Garry had gone overboard. But she denied under cross-examination . she was trying to divert attention from the suspicion she was . responsible for his death and insisted she delayed telling the truth . because she felt 'intimidated' by Sapstead. Return: Mr Sapstead voluntarily returned to Spain to stand trial and could face 12 years in prison . Hearing: Proceedings opened on Monday after a long-running legal battle over Mr Walton's death . A police officer called to the boat . admitted they were told Garry had been pushed after rushing to the . Tenerife port of Los Cristianos to meet the incoming tourists. Detectives only took five people in for questioning of the estimated 45 people on board. They included Sapstead and Katie Smethurst, identified by other tourists as the last two people seen with the dead man. Katie was questioned by a Spanish . investigating judge after her police quiz but Garry's alleged killer was . allowed to leave Tenerife after a police interview.

Brooke Astor's son is allegedly trying out a new fraud as he was allegedly hawking a fake gold watch that he claimed belonged to his famous relative who died on the Titanic. Anthony 'Tony' Marshall, who was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother Brooke Astor out of $60 million in 2009, and he and his current wife Charlene made a rare public appearance last week at a lavish party for a new cruise ship called the Titanic II. At the party, he reportedly showed guests a gold watch that reportedly belonged to John Jacob Astor and was trying to sell it for $1million. However, his story is claimed to be the 88-year-old's latest con, as a California collector has said that he bought the real watch in an auction over a decade ago. Scroll down for video . Party guests: Philanthropist Brooke Astor's son Anthony Marshall, 88, (pictured) and wife Charlene attended an event for Titanic II. Marshall wore a pocket watch he claimed was recovered from the ship . The real watch: Collector John Miottel (pictured) bought the watch that belonged to John Jacob Astor at an auction in 1997 . Abused: Brooke Astor, centre, was defrauded by her son and his wife and spent her final days in squalor despite her vast fortune . 'I wasn’t surprised. I had heard about . somebody who was claiming to have the Astor watch from the Titanic. He . has a different watch,' collector John Miottel told the New York Post. Marshall, 88, has been outcast by New . York society since he was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother . Brooke Astor out of $60 million in 2009. He and wife Charlene have kept . to a frugal life of solitude ever since and are rarely seen in public . as he awaits his one to three year sentence. Initials: John Jacob Astor's watch helped identify his body after he drowned on the Titanic . Moment in time: Now Tony Marshall, whose mother Brooke Astor was Vincent Astor's third wife, claims that he has the original and is trying to sell it for $1million . However the couple ventured out for . the event this week at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in . Manhattan, thrown by Australian millionaire Clive Palmer who is behind . the ambitious plans to build Titanic II. Marshall wore the watch which he said had been given to him by his mother's third husband, Vincent Astor. At the party, Marshall claimed that . the gold piece had been found on the body of John Jacob Astor IV who was . wearing it when he died on the Titanic after it sank on April 15, 1912. Values: The watch which Anthony Marshall is planning to sell to the highest bidder belonged to ancestor John Jacob Astor IV, a millionaire and decorated Spanish-American war hero who died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 . Sad news: The telegram which was sent to bear the news that JJ Astor's body had been recovered on April 22, 1912 and was identified by his personal effects including a gold watch . Part of the story is true- Astor's . body was found with the gold watch after he drowned in the infamous . shipwreck. The tycoon was the wealthiest person on board the luxury . liner when it went down and the timepiece along with his gold watch, . cuff links and a ring were later recovered with his body. The part about Marshall owning it is believed to be made up. Vincent Astor was the one to go claim . his father's body in Nova Scotia after the wreck, and he wore the watch . for years after that. Vincent, who was reportedly sterile, had no children of his own and left the watch to his godson William Dobbyn V. According to The Post, Dobbyn's wife . Elizabeth put the watch up for auction in 1997 and that is when Mr . Miottel bought the piece of history. Treasured: JJ Astor's pocket watch from the Titanic was passed on to his son Vincent (pictured in 1920) who is believed to have worn it every day for the rest of his life. He passed it to his son Anthony Marshall who is now believed to want to sell it . Sequel: An artist's rendering of the proposed cruise ship Titanic II, provided by the Blue Star Line as Australian tycoon Clive Palmer unveiled plans for his dream ship in New York on Tuesday . Setting sail: The Titanic leaving Southampton on her ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912 . Predictably, the Marshalls dispute . this claim, with Charlene telling the paper: 'I’ve heard that story . (that Mr Miottel owns the original) and it’s not true.' John Jacob Astor has become one of the most fabled characters to emerge from the 1,517 passengers who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912. The 47-year-old American tycoon, who built the Astoria Hotel in New York, was returning from his honeymoon on the doomed vessel with his 19-year-old pregnant wife Madeleine. When the Titanic struck the iceberg, Astor helped his wife into a lifeboat but remained onboard. He was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck. Half an hour later, the ship slipped beneath the ocean waves. His wife survived. Astor's was one of the 333 bodies recovered on April 22 by a cable ship. He was identified by the initials sewn into his jacket along with his engraved gold watch. Astor's son Vincent inherited the piece and wore it for the rest of his life before passing it on to his son, Anthony. J.J Astor is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. Madeleine gave birth to a son on August 14, 1912 who was named after his father. Charlene, 67, was seen wearing Brooke . Astor's diamond and ruby bracelet, one of the few things she inherited . from her mother-in-law who referred to her as 'that b****'. The Marshalls were among 600 guests at the event to announce the ambitious project due for completion in 2016. They enjoyed a dinner based on the final 11-course meal with wine pairings served aboard the Titanic. The 88-year-old, who is in poor health following open heart surgery, is estranged from his twin sons. They testified that their father and . stepmother were abusing Astor, withholding medical treatment and leaving . her to lie drenched in her own urine. Marshall was found guilty of . defrauding his mother out of millions, money she had inherited from her . third husband, hotelier and realtor Vincent Astor. Brooke Astor, who died in 2007 aged . 105, had devoted her life to philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of . money to the St. Regis Hotel, the New York Public Library and the . Metropolitan Art Museum. The multimillionaire, who had . Alzheimer's, was left to spend her last days in heart-breaking . conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue apartment while she . napped in her own urine with no one to help, the Post previously . reported. The jury convicted Marshall of 14 counts, including first-degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud. Vast wealth: Brooke Astor's Westchester home - most of the furniture was auctioned at Sotheby's last year and the proceeds went to philanthropic causes in New York City . Taken: While the furniture was initially given to Marshall from Brooke Astor's will, he will now not see any of the money after being found guilty of defrauding the elderly woman .","Anthony Marshall, 88, the son of philanthropist Brooke Astor, bragged about the family heirloom at Titanic II event in Manhattan .

A Chicago couple duped into believing their adoption of a Korean baby was legal are being forced to return the nine-month-old to her country of birth tomorrow despite the fact no-one wants her there. Jinshil, 49, a South Korea native who was raised in the U.S., and her husband Christopher Duquet, 55, had desperately wanted a second baby. They went to South Korea to find their little girl named Sehwa Kim after adopting their first child in the country. Sehwa's birth mother, who lives in a homeless shelter for unwed mothers, relinquished all rights to her child in the adoption in June and says she still doesn't want anything to do with the baby. Uncertain future: 9-month-old baby Sehwa will be returned to South Korea tomorrow after her country refused to let an American couple adopt her . However, on returning to the U.S., officials discovered holes in the Duquets' paperwork and now after a seven month legal battle with the South Korean authorities - throughout which the Duquets have raised the child - they will be forced to send her back. 'No one has considered (Sehwa) and her well-being,' Jinshil told the Chicago Tribune. 'She is just part of our family now,' said Christopher Duquet. 'It's as if she was born to our family.' 'We really wanted to give this child a home and the love that she deserves,' he told CBS outside court. Loved: Jinshil Duquet, who was born in South Korea, and her husband believed they had legally adopted the baby, like their first adopted daughter Emilie, pictured . Campaign: Christopher Duquet, pictured, and his wife from Evanston have fought for 7 months to keep Sewah . The couple claim they received bad legal advice on the adoption process in South Korea and had no reason to suspect the baby was not officially theirs. The couple, who run a jewelry shop in the city of Evanston just north of Chicago, now have one final day with their child and 24 hours to prepare for the heart-breaking moment they have to hand her over to an unknown future in her birth country. At the latest court hearing they realized their case was lost and any further legal actions would just delay - not prevent - her return. They relented for the sake of the baby. When the couple decided to try for another child earlier this year they thought they would return to South Korea where they successfully adopted their first child Emilie, 10. However, the agency they used in her case said they were now too old to go through the process again. Sisters torn apart: 10-year-old Emilie, pictured, will join her parents in saying a final goodbye to her adopted baby sister Sehwa today . They found a lawyer who said he would organize a private adoption and presented the couple with Sehwa Kim who had been renounced by both her mother and grandparents. They believed everything was legitimate for her return to the U.S. but on landing in O'Hare airport on June 28 found U.S. officials disagreed. They were held for ten hours of questioning and have since fought in the courts to try and keep her with them, caring for her in their family home along the way. A lawyer acting on behalf of South Korea said the country was just protecting their citizen. Lee Kyung-hee, director of child welfare at the ministry told the newspaper: 'The baby girl is a Korean citizen and must have the opportunity to be adopted in Korea first.' Don Schiller, a lawyer acting for South Korea, said: 'Korea wants to protect its citizen. There is no more vulnerable citizen than an infant child that has been illegally taken out of the country. The U.S. wouldn't stand for it if it happened here, and Korea is not going to stand for it.' There has been a drive to increase domestic adoptions in South Korea in recent years and one legal expert said Sehwa's case comes as a result of South Korean embarrassment at its high numbers of adoptions by foreign couples. Legal defeat: On Thursday . Christopher and Jinshil Duquet, pictured with a lawyer outside court, agreed to give up the baby being told they had no hope of keeping her . Court battle: The Duquets, pictured, have fought for 7 months to keep the child . Lawyer Kim Min-jo told the Tribune: 'In my opinion the Korean government is somewhat embarrassed that we are high among countries exporting adoptions. They want to keep the numbers down.' Meanwhile the Duquet family and their legal team have been left distraught. 'Our whole team of people here are saddened and devastated by it,' lawyer Jamie Teich said. On returning to South Korea tomorrow little Sehwa will face another lengthy adoption process but this time in her own country. The case comes on the back of a Russian ban on the adoption of children by U.S. couples. On Saturday thousands marched in Moscow in favor of the law passed by Vladimir Putin who called on children to be kept in their native country. Opinion in the country is divided on the issue with a march against the measure in January where opponents said the move would lead to children dying needlessly for the sake of patriotic posturing. Americans have adopted more than 60,000 . Russian children since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.","South Korean officials have won their seven month legal battle to have baby Sehwa returned to South Korea .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 07:24 EST, 6 January 2012 . The U.S. Air Force's top secret unmanned space plane which has been circling Earth for ten months may be spying on China's space laboratory, it was claimed today. The secretive X-37B space plane launched into Earth's orbit last year, with the Air Force revealing few details about its course or when the plane will return. But onlookers studying the spy plane's path now believe the space craft may be spying on China's new space station, Tiangong-1, in the latest bout of orbital accusations exchanged between the two nations. Secretive: The U.S. Air Force has refused to reveal the course of landing date of its X-37B, which has been circling the Earth for ten months . Experts claim the U.S. plane could be spying on China's space program after it was noted that the two space craft's have closely matched orbits. The mission of the X-37B space plane was extended at the end of last year after it spent nine months orbiting the Earth, with a new landing date yet to be set. The claims that the U.S. craft may be snooping on Chinese space activity were made in Spaceflight magazine. Spaceflight editor, Dr. David Baker told the BBC, told the BBC: 'Space-to-space surveillance is a whole new ball game made possible by a finessed group of sensors and sensor suites, which we think the X-37B may be using to maintain a close watch on China's nascent space station.' 'The parallels with X-37B [and Tiangong-1] are clear. 'With a period differential of about 19 seconds, the two vehicles will migrate toward or against each other, converging or diverging, roughly every 170 orbits.'

A Long March-2FT1 carrier rocket loaded with Tiangong-1 unmanned space lab module blasts off from the launch pad at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert in September . Claims that the U.S. could be spying on Chinese space activity come in the wake of cyberhacking allegations made against China at the end of last year. China was accused of interfering with two U.S. government satellites in one of its most advanced hacking operations to date. On four occasions between 2007 and 2008 Chinese agents are said to have breached security on the environment-monitoring craft. The 29-foot, solar-powered craft had an original mission of 270 days and had been due to land at the same base last month.

Under construction: Engineers prepare part of the Tiangong-1 module which was propelled into space as part of China's ambition to build a space station . The X-37B's official task is to test new spaceflight technologies, but some nations have speculated abouts its potential military capabilities. Iran's PressTV called the craft a 'secret space warplane', while space experts and technical advisers have also echoed the same opinion. Brian Weeden, a technical adviser to the Secure World Foundation and a former orbital analyst with the U.S. Air Force, told Space.com early last year: 'As we know through experience, everything and anything about them [the NRO] is classified.' 'A typical spy satellite is in a polar orbit, which gives you access to the whole Earth. 'The X-37B is in a much lower inclination which means it can only see a very narrow band of latitudes - and the only thing that's of real interest in that band is the Middle East and Afghanistan.'","X-37B space plane has 'similar orbit' to Chinese space station .

So it’s little wonder that when asked what he’d do if he had a time machine, Sir Paul McCartney’s response was simple: ‘Go back and spend time with my mum.’ He made the touching reply in answer to a fan from Brazil, whose question was picked from more than 10,000 submitted to his website in a new monthly feature. Sir Paul’s mother, Mary, was a midwife. She died at the age of 47 from an embolism, following surgery to treat breast cancer. Sir Paul, her eldest son, was just 14. 'I would spend time with mum': Paul McCartney, pictured left aged six, said he would go see his mother Mary, pictured right with his four-year-old brother Michael, if he had a time machine . Muse: Paul McCartneysaid his mother inspired the hit Beatles song Let It Be after appearing to him in a dream . The 70-year-old Beatle has previously described how his mother inspired the song Let It Be, which he wrote after she appeared to him in a dream. He said Mary contributed ‘a good half’ to the family income. The McCartneys were too poor to have a car, but they ‘just about had a television’. He added: ‘At night when she came home, she would cook, so we didn’t have a lot of time with each other. But she was just a very comforting presence in my life. 'And when she died, one of the difficulties I had, as the years went by, was that I couldn’t recall her face so easily. That’s how it is for everyone, I think. 'As each day goes by, you just can’t bring their face into your mind, you have to use photographs and reminders like that.' Of the dream, he said: ‘My mother appeared, and there was her face, completely clear, particularly her eyes, and she said to me very gently, very reassuringly: “Let it be”. McCartney family portrait: From left to right are Michael, mother Mary, father Jim and a young Paul . Mary died when Paul McCartney, pictured right next to his Beatles band mates, was just 14 and never lived to see his success as a member of one of Britain's most successful music groups . ‘It was lovely. I woke up with a great feeling. It was really like she had visited me at this very difficult point in my life and gave me this message: Be gentle, don’t fight things, just try and go with the flow and it will all work out. ‘So, being a musician, I went right over to the piano and started writing a song: “When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me … speaking words of wisdom, let it be.”’ He added that he got together with Linda, his first wife, shortly afterwards, saying ‘it was as if my mum had sent her’. Sir Paul continued: 'So those words are really very special to me, because not only did my mum come to me in a dream and reassure me with them at a very difficult time in my life - and sure enough, things did get better after that - but also, in putting them into a song, and recording it with the Beatles, it became a comforting, healing statement for other people too.' Let It Be was released as a single in 1970, and went on to become one of The Beatles’ best-loved hits. The album of the same title was released in May of that year, shortly after the band announced they were splitting up. A gift from mum: Sir Paul McCartney met his future wife Linda, pictured together in 1982, shortly after the dream and said it felt as though his mother had sent her his way .","Sir Paul McCartney's mother, Mary, died at the age of 47 from an embolism .

The man wanted for driving the car that killed a pregnant woman, her husband and their child in Brooklyn has said his 'heart goes out to' the young family. Julio Acevedo, 44, has eluded authorities since fleeing the crash that killed Nachman and Raizy Glauber, both 21, on Sunday. Their son, who was delivered by caesarean section, died on Monday. But on Tuesday he vowed to turn himself in as he spoke out for the first time since the deaths. 'My . heart goes out to them,' Acevedo said of the couple as he spoke to the New York Daily News over the phone. 'I didn't know they died until I saw the . news.' Killer: Police are looking for Julio Acevedo, 44, in connection with the deaths of an expectant couple in Brooklyn. He previously served time in prison for shooting Kelvin '50 Cent' Martin, right, to death in 1987 . Origins: His name inspired rapper 50 Cent, pictured, whose real name is Curtis Jackson . He added . that he had been fleeing from gunshots when his car smashed into the cab . carrying the couple to hospital. He said he is making contact with a . lawyer before contacting police. It also emerged on Tuesday that Acevedo served eight years for a . first-degree manslaughter charge for the 1987 shooting of his one-time . associate Kelvin Martin, who went by the nickname of '50 Cent'. Martin was the inspiration for the moniker assumed by platinum-selling rapper Curtis Jackson. Acevedo has a long criminal record that includes time in Attica prison for Martin's death, two arrests for drug possession and arrests for robbery and reckless endangerment. His record also includes a 1997 robbery in the Bronx. Just two weeks before the deadly crash in Williamsburg, he was stopped by police for driving erratically and his blood alcohol level was far above the . legal level at .13. Tragic: Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21, were on the way to hospital when they were killed in a hit-and-run car crash. Their son, who was delivered by emergency C section, has also died . Kelvin Martin lived at a housing project in Fort Greene, Brooklyn and terrorized the streets throughout the 1980s until his death aged 23. He made a living through robberies and allegedly murdered local hustlers. Friends estimate that he sustained 24 bullet wounds and murdered at least 30 people in his life. According to legend, Martin also stole from rap stars, such as LL Cool J. He allegedly robbed a gold chain from the rapper's neck in a parking lot in Brooklyn. He was nicknamed '50 Cent' by his associates, but there are different theories over its origin. It has been claimed the name came from his small stature - he was just 5ft 2 and weighed 120 pounds. Others say it referred to his robbery habit and how he would steal from someone, even if it were just for 50 cents. Another theory is that he once put down 50 cents in a dice game and won $500 back. He was shot by Julio Acevedo on October 20, 1987 on the stairway of his girlfriend's building and died from hemorrhaging four days later. Acevedo was convicted of first-degree manslaughter and sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison for the death. In an interview with Vanity Fair last month, the rapper 50 Cent said: 'There was actually a guy from the Fort Greene projects [in Brooklyn, New York] who called himself 50 Cent. I used it as a metaphor for change. Musically, I had my own way of doing things.' He told police he had drunk just two beers at a baby shower before he was pulled over. He was charged with a DWI but released the next day . without bail. A friend of Acevedo's from prison said . Acevedo has called him seeking guidance at least four times since the . crash, according to the New York Times. 'He has remorse,' the friend said. 'He wants to turn himself in.' Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the . family's Orthodox Jewish community, called Acevedo a 'coward' before his arrest and demanded he be charged for three deaths. 'We in the community are demanding that . the prosecutor charge the driver of BMW that caused the death of this . couple and infant ... with triple homicide,' Abraham said in a . statement. 'This coward left the scene of the accident not even . bothering to check on the people of the other car.' The Glaubers had been heading to . hospital in a taxi early on Sunday morning after Raizi, who was seven . months pregnant, felt an unusual pain. Nachman and Raizi were traveling in the . black 2008 Toyota Camry livery cab to Long Island College Hospital in . Cobble Hill when a BMW smashed into the car and fatally injured the . would-be parents. The Glaubers both were pronounced dead . at hospitals, and the medical examiner said they died of blunt-force . trauma. It's not clear if they were wearing seatbelts. The cause of the crash remained under . investigation on Monday. The driver of the BMW was expected at least to . face charges of leaving the scene of an accident. The . livery car, which the Glaubers had called as they did not have their . own vehicle, was at a stop sign, but it was unclear if it had stopped, . police said. The taxi driver, Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32, was not injured in the crash. He had an up-to-date license but an application to use the Toyota as a livery cab was still pending at the time of the crash. Resting place: The original 50 Cent was given this headstone in Staten Island after a documentary about the rapper revealed he had died penniless and could not afford a proper burial . This means it should not have been sent to collect them, according to the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, but his union insisted he had done nothing wrong. In New York City, yellow taxis are . hailed on the street, but residents may call car services, and are . picked up by drivers in everyday vehicles. Meanwhile, police said the registered . owner of the BMW, Takia Walker, 29 who was not in the car, was charged . with insurance fraud on Sunday in a scam involving the car. A . person familiar with the investigation said Walker bought the car . legally - or willingly used her identification for the purchase - then . gave the car to another man. The middleman wasn't driving at the time of . the accident, and had either lent or rented the car out to the driver, . the person said. Deadly: Acevedo was allegedly driving this BMW when it smashed into the taxi carrying the Glaubers . Scene: Police still do not know the cause of the crash but believe Acevedo was travelling at 60 mph . A spokesman for the Orthodox Jewish community described the couple's death as 'a tragedy beyond (belief) just coming off a joyous holiday as Purim' as they were getting ready to welcome their first child . The impact from the t-bone smash sent . Raizi out into the street where her body came to rest under a trailer, . while first responders had to cut the roof off the taxi to rescue . Nachman and the taxi driver. Both the Glaubers were pronounced dead at hospital. The . couple's child was born by C-Section at Bellevue Hospital in . Manhattan, and had been in critical condition before his tragic passing. Doctors had delivered the baby by . cesarean section. Neighbors and friends said the boy weighed only about 2 . pounds. Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the . city medical examiner's office, said the baby's death was caused by . extreme prematurity due to maternal blunt force injuries. Paramedic Yisroel Altman . said he initially believed both husband and wife could survive, but . their head injuries were just too much. Missed: A person walks towards the graves of Nathan and Raizy Glauber at the Satmar Cemetery. In keeping with the Jewish tradition of holding a burial as soon as possible, they were buried on Sunday . 'I’ve . seen worse cases [car accidents], it was the knock on the head that . killed them,' said Altman to the New York Post, adding that Raizi was . responsive in the ambulance until a few minutes before she arrived at . Bellevue. Jewish law calls for the burial of . the dead as soon as possible and at least 1,000 people gathered at Yetev . Lev D'Satmar synagogue in Brooklyn on Sunday to pay their respects to the . Glaubers. The sound of wailing filled the . street as the two black-draped coffins were carried from a vehicle. There will not be a similar funeral . for the baby boy; Hasidim do not perform funerals for newborns who do . not survive 30 days, according to Mendel Rosenberg, of Chesed Shel Emes. Heartbroken: The Glaubers were mourned at an emotional funeral hours after their deaths on Sunday . Missed: The young Orthodox Jewish couple, both 21, both died of blunt force trauma from the crash . Mourning: Rabbi Zalman Teitelbau, leader of the Satmar Orthodox Jewish community, speaks during the funerals in Brooklyn on Sunday, surrounded by members of the community . The baby was placed in a tiny coffin . and buried early on Monday afternoon in a separate area of the cemetery . in Kiryas Joel where his parents were laid to rest Sunday. At the funeral on Sunday Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum addressed the mourners in Yiddish. 'It's . a great tragedy for the community,' said Teitelbaum. 'We have to hold . on together and see what we can do to make things better. This is a . very, very big tragedy.' Raizi's brother, Yitzchak Silberstein, spoke of his devastation at his sister's tragic passing to the New York Daily News. 'She was the crown of the family,' said Silberstein. 'We were sitting together last night and today she’s gone.' Investigation: A police officer examines the scene of the devastating hit-and-run accident that killed the expectant parents . The young couple were in this livery cab when they were involved in the crash . He . was full of praise for his brother-in-law too. 'We can all learn from . him how to treat a wife,' he said. 'The way he treated her was special.' The funerals took place in Brooklyn, which is home to the largest . community of ultra-orthodox Jews outside Israel, more than 250,000. The Glaubers were married about a . year ago and had begun a life together in Williamsburg, where Raizi . Glauber grew up in a prominent Orthodox Jewish rabbinical family, Sara . Glauber said. Raised north of New York City in . Monsey, N.Y., and part of a family that founded a line of clothing for .

"Judge James Dabney is 'concerned' that New York lawyer Mark Heller isn't prepared to represent her . Lindsay - who was present at pre-trial - either has to get another lawyer or she has to come into court and waive her right to a competent California lawyer . He vehemently blocks Heller's attempt to put back trial from March 18 to April 1 . 'In the interest of justice, my client needs that time,' Heller maintained . By . Amelia Proud . PUBLISHED: . 20:08 EST, 1 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:08 EST, 1 March 2013 . Lindsay Lohan‘s New York lawyer, who was criticised in court this morning for being incompetent, called a press conference after the pre-trial to claim that the star should never have been questioned by police after the June car crash in question... because she had concussion. But according to Radar Online, her medical records show she didn’t suffer any injury to her head. 'The doctors who treated Lindsay on the day of her car accident last summer didn’t diagnose her with a concussion. She suffered no injury to her head whatsoever,' a law enforcement source told the website. What's he cooking up now? Lindsay Lohan's lawyer Mark Heller claimed that his client was forced to answer questions with concussion after a woeful performance at pre-trial on Friday . But Heller said: 'My client suffered a concussion, and never should have been questioned by the police. She was basically held against her will and forced to answer questions.' 'Give her leeway to show that she's worth of compassion,' Heller pleaded with Judge James Dabney on Friday morning as part of his disastrous bid to get Lohan's latest criminal case thrown out. The New York based lawyer even played the victim card, telling Judge James Dabney that 'there seems to be some doubt as to whether Lohan is entitled to some mercy because of her history with this department.' But the judge wasn't buying it, and he steadfastly refused to allow Heller to persuade him to move the trial date from March 18 to April 1. Claims: After the judge gave him short shrift, Heller called a press conference to make the concussion claim . Unsuitable? Judge Dabney told Lindsay Lohan's lawyer that he was not versed sufficiently in California law to represent her properly at trial as he threw his attempts to have lying to police claims thrown out during this morning's pre-trial hearing . Noting that it was also April Fools' Day, Dabney pointed out that April 1st is a court holiday and said he saw no merit in postponing the reckoning. He also questioned Heller's suitability to represent Lohan, 26, as it seemed to the judge as though the lawyer - who admitted he'd practised in New York for 44 years - wasn't completely versed in California law. Heller began by questioning 'particulars', in short - he wanted to know where certain statements attributed by Lohan were made after the the June crash relating to the lying allegations. Did Lohan - who is accused of lying to cover up the fact that she was driving recklessly - make her statement at the scene, or at hospital or to police at a later date? Slammed: Heller obviously feels strongly about helping Lindsay but his preparation and suitability was questioned by the judge in court on Friday . The judge told Heller that he saw no need to discuss these details until trial, and added emphatically that this was all in accordance with California law. He added that Heller had not prepared adequately given his lack of competence in California law, which meant prosecutor Terry White's trial date remained in place. He told Heller his concerns about police not reading Lindsay her Miranda rights were of no concern, either, as Lindsay's fourth amendment rights had not been violated. Dabney also emphasized to Heller that he needs to take local guidance before trial and that Lindsay will suffer if she doesn't have a legal team who fully understand California law. Her father Michael was, as always, quick to comment on the matter to TMZ, he said: 'This guy is a loser and will drag her down. 'I already started to pray to God that Lindsay fires him before it's too late,' he added before explaining he has another lawyer lined up. Back at court: Lindsay Lohan appears at a hearing with her attorney Mark Heller on January 30, 2013 . Lohan was on probation at the time of the accident and she . faces jail time if a judge determines she violated her sentence in a 2011 theft . case. It has been reported that prosecutors offered her a 'no jail' deal if she agreed to return to rehab, but she rejected it. According to TMZ, . the Mean Girls star does not believe she has a substance abuse problem . that warrants the condition and is risking instead to take the case to . trial. The website reports that Heller had a telephone conference with prosecutors on Wednesday to discuss the terms of the bargain. Prosecutors were apparently asking for 'a significant amount of time in a residential rehab facility'. Earlier reports suggested the plea bargain stipulates she must enroll in rehab for at least 60 days, attend AA meetings and undertake community service. Heller reportedly did not accept the offer, although the insider says 'negotiations are ongoing'. Lohan is said to be against the idea of going back to rehab entirely, looking at the condition as 'punishment for something I didn't do'. Facing the music: Heller's pleas for 'compassion' and 'mercy' fell on deaf ears and Lindsay will face trial on March 18 . Details of the apparent deal surfaced after the New York-based attorney sent an emotional letter pleading with prosecutors to help the 'deeply broken' actress. Heller reveals that Lindsay is undergoing extensive psychiatric therapy and is struggling to overcome a history of family issues, and urges Santa Monica and Los Angeles City Attorneys Terry White and Spencer Hart to join forces with him to become the team that 'fix' the actress. Sent on February 4 and obtained by TMZ, the letter was also sent to the judge presiding over the case. Heller, who came onto the case after Lohan fired her long-term attorney, Shawn Holley, earlier this year, wrote the prosecutors need to understand that his client's problems are even deeper than what is publicly known. On her way: Lindsay Lohan and her mother Dina head to the car crash case pre-trial hearing on January 30 . 'I have known Lindsay for many years and have witnessed the dynamics of her family and her experiences that are not known to general public, and which have deeply impacted her and resulted in certain events in her life that has bought her before the Court and derivatively to your attention and professional assessment,' he is quoted. 'Yet, as I noted at our meeting these prior events and their portrayal in the media, regrettably always results in distortion, creating a very negative public persona without consideration of what happened in Lindsay's life that bought her to that place and without considering the pain, torment and confusion which Lindsay has experienced and been affected with.' The lawyer promises, alongside Lindsay's psychotherapist, to reveal just how bad things have become for the Parent Trap actress as he says that without knowing, the prosecutors are 'handicapped because he could you propose to fix something without known just how broken it was'. 'The only way we as a ""team"" are going to formulate a solution is for Lindsay, her Psychotherapist and I provide a true window revealing the real problems we must solve,' the letter reportedly continues. Family drama: Lohan's lawyer has apparently pleaded with prosecutors to join him in helping to 'fix' the actress in light of her personal issues, stemming from her relationships with father Michael Lohan, left, and Dina Lohan, right . Heller appeals to the prosecutors to consider alternatives to Lohan's previous sentences - including a lengthy probation in 2011 for stealing a necklace, which is now in jeopardy in light of the new criminal charges. 'Which is why I appeal to your good conscious to join me in not rubber stamping this case but rather to be patient and understanding and open to productive alternatives as we, as a team, help fix Lindsay Lohan,' the letter continues. The case is not Lohan's only legal worry. The actress earlier this week was fined $1000 for failing to make herself available in a civil case deposition, RadarOnline reported. Lohan was repetitively requested to attend a deposition in the civil case bought by photographer Grigor Baylan, who filed the civil lawsuit claiming he was injured when a car that the actress was riding in hit him in 2010. The actress claimed to be out of state but was in California for her criminal cases pre-trial, according to the website. She could face a reported 245 days in jail if she is found guilty in the criminal case. A spokesman for Lohan has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment.","Judge James Dabney is 'concerned' that New York lawyer Mark Heller isn't prepared to represent her .

A little girl from Phoenix, Arizona, has been diagnosed with a rare genetic condition which means her skins breaks into agonizing blisters at the slightest touch. Lizzy Hendrickson, 3, has Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex or 'Butterfly Disease' where the skin is as fragile as an insect's wing, 12 News Phoenix reports. It means ever since she was born her skin painfully blisters on being grazed- even through the comforting arms of her mom and dad. Scroll down for video . Butterfly disease: Lizzy Hendrickson suffers with the painful condition dubbed 'butterfly disease' because her skin is so weak and tears at the slightest graze . Painful cuts: Little Lizzy Hendrickson suffers from painful cuts on her body if her skin is rubbed . She can't do simple tasks without putting herself at risk and to run, play and fall like other children would likely necessitate a trip to the emergency room. She can't be showered because of the pressure of falling water and wears layers of ointment and bandages around her legs - the worst affected parts of her body. Changing her out of her diapers as a baby was a two person job - her parents told the website. One had to focus on holding her down and stopping her from wriggling so she didn't break her skin from the movement while the other removed the diaper gently with two hands to ensure it didn't tear her by sticking to her body. 'There’s nothing that I can do, as a mother, to make her pain go away,' Kristin Hendrickson told the local website. 'You just hope that it ends quickly. But that kind of makes me feel like a failure as a mother, that I have this child that is in pain or gets hurt and I can’t protect her.' 'It’s a horrible feeling as a parent. You feel totally out of control.' The incurable disease affects around 1 in 50,000 and can vary in severity with most cases at the very mild end of the scale, a much less serious illness than Lizzy's. Blisters: 3-year-old Lizzy Hendrickson has painful blisters on her body from her condition, particularly on her legs, pictured. They have to be constantly bandaged to protect them from every touch . Building a normal life: Things are getting easier for Lizzy as she and the people around her learn to live with her condition . On the other end some children are unable to eat solid food as their throats and tongues are affected with food tearing at their bodies from the inside. Lizzy is able to wear normal clothes but anything sharp like a zipper is strictly banned. Her arms can go un-bandaged but are still sensitive and she often gets blisters on her face. Her parents use ice packs to relieve the pain but are daily forced to pop large blisters that form across her body. Her mother, Kristin, 40, a nurse said the diagnosis was heartbreaking. 'I can’t possibly describe how I felt at the time,' she told the website. 'I thought my child had a death sentence. It was unthinkable to me. It was unbearable.' Her father Rob, a teacher, 49, recalls looking up the disease when she was first diagnosed. 'Boy, was that a mistake,' he said. The couple have developed a close relationship with their specialist Dr Ronald Hansen. The head of dermatology at Phoenix Children’s Hospital discovered her condition by simply rubbing his pencil eraser on the remaining skin on her leg - soon it was tearing . 'We had a number of very interesting conversations with Dr. Hansen very early on,' Rob said. 'What do we do with her? Do we put her in a bubble? Keep her safe? Or do we make her a normal kid and deal with the consequences'. The family were able to count their small blessings that their little girl wasn't suffering from one of the very extreme types of the disease. Her eating isn't affected so she can go to school so long as she, and everyone around her, is extremely careful. Brave: The Hendricksons pictured are fundraising to allow research into their daughter's condition. They are hopeful a cure will be found . Tough: Lizzy Hendrickson changes her own bandages despite only being three . Although she can't get into the rough and tumble of the playground her parents want her to have as normal a life as possible. 'I didn’t want to mummy her, keep her like a mummy,' Kristin said. And the gift of independence is helping. Lizzy now changes her own dressings and when asked about her condition in school has been known to reply - 'I'm beautiful'. 'She’s very much a little captain. She’s in charge. She’s a very savvy little girl,' Dr Hansen says. 'But we kind of always tell (EB) parents, like, this should be their computer kid. She can’t be the soccer kid, because she just can’t stand any kind of friction. It causes blisters every time she touches anything.' 'Having said that, Lizzy will go off and kick a soccer ball. 'She’s going to be a rambunctious, active girl. But she pays for it. Every time. She pays for it with blisters.' The couple, meanwhile, fund-raise to try and help advance research into the disease and hopefully find a cure. 'Will it be five years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now? We don’t know,' Rob said. 'We know a cure is coming. We feel that in our hearts.'","Brave Lizzy Hendrickson, 3, is fighting painful condition Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex which means her skin blisters at every touch or graze .

Katie Drew has lost nearly half her body weight thanks to a 'fat controller' - a mock DVD-style zapper that makes her stop and think about what she is eating. The humanitarian worker, 32, ballooned to more than 16-and-a-half stone eating 'trucker-sized' portions late at night. But after discovering Pause Button Therapy early last year single Katie claims to have dropped an incredible six stones - around 40 per cent of her weight. Katie Drew lost a third of her body weight - six stone - in six months using Pause Button Therapy . The treatment features hypnotherapy and other cognitive programmes combined with a mock credit card-sized controller or wristband. It has imaginary play, fast forward, rewind and pause buttons which users are taught to 'operate' to consider the consequences of eating unhealthy food. Katie said: 'The PBT device I have is a small card that slips into your wallet - it's just a simple aide memoir - you don't need batteries. 'It doesn't have any moving parts. It just prompts you to stop and think about the ramifications of what you are about to do. The Pause Button Therapy device is a credit card-sized prompter featuring mock play, fast forward, rewind and pause buttons . '""The . wonder is, it lasts for ever - you need to reinforce using it to begin . with, so the first few weeks you tend to physically use it, as in take . it out of your pocket and imagine pressing the button. 'Now, I don't even use the card - it's become practice for me to stop and imagine pressing the button, without the prompt. 'Of course, there are always times when I should have used it - but didn't it. But the difference is, I recognise them now.' Katie, currently living and working in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was in London when she began researching ways to lose weight in March 2012. She had reached 16-and-a-half-stone and was desperate to get down to a much healthier weight. Katie, originally from Bournemouth, Dorset, would go all day without eating but plough through heavy meals late in the evening. A friend recommended Pause Button Therapy - a combination of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy and hypnotherapy. The £1,400 course involved discussions on the psychology of PBT where the subject is talked through the reasons for their weight gain and their 'triggers' for unhealthy eating. They are followed by 20 minute hypnosis sessions which drum home the need to eat slowly and in a more considered way, when to eat and thinking of the consequences. Once the course is complete the clinic hands over the DVD-style remote control so the patient can use the pause button to buy them time while they put PBT into practice. Katie had the treatment during four . visits to Elite Clinics in Marbella, Spain, run by Martin and Marion . Shirran, the pioneers of PBT. The fast forward button on the device takes the dieter forward to imagine the future consequences via different scenarios. Katie added: 'It sounds really simple, and it is - but it really helped me to take my time. 'I . was definitely eating automatically before, without thinking, and . sometimes I couldn't tell you what I'd eaten for lunch for example. I'd . just eaten - without thinking. The principle behind Pause Button Therapy is that it teaches the dieter to think about the consequences of eating unhealthy food. Kate says: 'It helped me to take my time. I was eating automatically before, without thinking.' 'Is it as simple as just pressing a button - it's easier, you don't even need to press the button if you don't want to. 'I also used stop and forward or rewind to help me think about consequences. 'You press it for literally seconds, just to make sure the decision you make is conscious, not automatic and not a 'reflex'. I think I was a reflex eater before. 'When I pressed rewind, usually in the mornings, I imagined listening to Martin's advice to always eat breakfast. 'I started losing weight in March and lost a healthy two pounds or so a week. It was really even, and really easy. 'By September, just six months later, I weighed 10-and-a-half stone.' 'It has made my life better. I enjoy food now without the guilt, I feel healthier, I have so much more energy and I had to buy an entire new wardrobe.' Marion Shirran says she came up with the idea for PBT using the concept of a TV remote control. She said: 'I noticed clients benefited from having a tactile device, to help them engage in taking responsibility for their actions. 'PBT is such a simple concept it can help with many behavioural issues - from anger management to thumb-sucking, from road rage to overcoming addictions.'

Richard Whipps, 38, who had a chest infection, was wrongly given diabetic medication instead of steroids for asthma by his local Lloyds Pharmacy. Although the sticker on the packet detailed the medication Mr Whipps was supposed to have the tablets inside were the wrong kind. The sticker on the tablets he had been given had the details for the steroids Mr Whipps should have been given . Mr Whipps, who has three-year-old twin daughters, had to be rushed to hospital twice after he took the drugs and felt unwell. It was only when Mr Whipps' wife Debbie researched the name 'Gliclazide' that was on the packet it was realised the medication was a hypoglycaemic anti-diabetic drug. Doctors told him that if his wife had not been vigilant and got him to hospital on the second occasion he could have gone into a diabetic coma and died. Mr Whipps,  an IT systems officer at the Arts University Bournemouth, said: 'The medication had . been checked twice by members of staff at the pharmacy but they still . got it completely wrong. If his wife Debbie hadn't researched the name Gliclazide they wouldn't have found out why he was taking sick . 'I felt horrendous but just thought . it was a side effect of the steroids. I had no idea I had actually been . taking the wrong medication. 'I am really angry about what happened and how serious it could have been. 'The nurse and the doctor at hospital . said it was very serious what had happened to me and that I was . basically going into a diabetic coma. 'If my wife hadn't noticed and I had been left overnight, I could have been killed.' Mr Whipps, from Verwood, Dorset, visited his GP with a chest infection and was prescribed antibiotics and steroids. He had been given 30 Gliclazide pills instead of 30 Prednisolone tablets. After collecting his prescription from the nearby pharmacy that evening he took six steroid tablets as instructed the following morning. He began feeling unwell within a few hours and suffered an asthma attack. He was taken by ambulance to Royal Bournemouth Hospital and released later that evening. The next day he took his antibiotics and another six steroid tablets as instructed but again started to feel poorly. Mrs Whipps checked the medication and discovered the box and drugs inside were actually for diabetics - even though the printed label stuck on the box contained the details for the correct medication. He was rushed back to hospital and put on an IV glucose drip before spending the night on the acute medical ward while doctors corrected his sugar levels. Mr Whipps said he was lucky his wife noticed he had been taking the wrong drugs or he could have died. The Lloyds Pharmacy in Verwood that made the blunder. Mr Whipps is lucky that his wife spotted the mistake . He added: 'My wife's grandfather was diabetic so when she got home from work and saw how ill I was after the second time of taking them she looked at the medication and realised the mistake. 'I was feeling very ill and I was just sprawled out on the sofa and very spaced out. I'm incredibly lucky my wife noticed the mistake when she did otherwise I might not be here today. 'I'm absolutely disgusted by it to be honest. The package was signed by two different people so it wasn't just one person's mistake. 'There is no way I will be going back to that pharmacy again.' Mr Whipps was contacted by the pharmacy and offered an apology. A Lloyds Pharmacy spokesman said: 'We take the health of our patients very seriously and are extremely sorry that Mr Whipps was given the incorrect prescription medication. 'We have stringent standard operating procedures and a full investigation has taken place into the circumstances surrounding the incident. 'We will shortly share the findings of our investigation with Mr Whipps and have been in contact to apologise for any distress caused.'","Richard Whipps was given diabetic medication instead of steroids .

Labour leader Ed Miliband will admit in his party political broadcast that immigration has let too many low-skilled workers into Britain, undercutting wages . Ed Miliband will admit today that Labour was wrong on immigration and let too many low-skilled migrants into Britain. In a party political broadcast tonight, the Labour leader will say that communities struggled to keep up with the speed of new arrivals to Britain. And he will concede that the scale of immigration meant workers' wages have been undercut. Mr Miliband will pledge to introduce a ‘One Nation immigration policy’ for the many and not the few. But his party, which has consistently refused to support a cap on numbers, will again fail to spell out any firm policies to cut immigration. In an astonishing about-face, Mr Miliband will say: ‘Low-skill migration has been too high and we need to bring it down. ‘That . means the maximum transitional controls for new countries coming in . from Eastern Europe, it means properly enforcing the minimum wage so . people aren’t brought here to undercut workers already here, and it . means proper training for people here so that they have a fighting . chance of filling the vacancies that exist. ‘There’s . nothing wrong in employing people from abroad but the rules need to be . fair so that local people get a fair crack of the whip.’ In . an attempt to distance himself from Labour’s ‘open-door’ immigration . policy, which let hundreds of thousands of migrants from new EU . countries come to Britain, he will add that it is ‘not prejudiced when . people worry about immigration, it’s understandable’. Jobs: In the film, Mr Miliband will admit that Labour got immigration 'wrong in government' and promise more training for British workers to fill jobs . Mr . Miliband will say that every foreigner who settles in Britain should . learn English, and all public-sector workers who deal directly with the . public must be able to speak English. And he promise to step up enforcement of the minimum wage to ensure that migrant workers are not paid less to undercut Britons. But . a Tory source said: ‘Vague rhetoric about One Nation does nothing to . explain how Labour would control the number of people coming into . Britain.’ And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: 'What will you do Mr Miliband, about the relaxing of controls on Bulgarians and Romanians? Are you prepared to defy the EU treaties and take back our border controls? If not these comments are mere crocodile tears.' Diane Abbott appeared to torpedo Mr Miliband’s change of tack, insisting Labour would not pander to ‘anti-immigrant’ feelings. Writing in the New Statesman magazine, Labour’s public health spokesman wrote: ‘There is no path to victory for the Labour Party through the thickets of anti-immigrant politics.’ Mr Miliband will attempt to distance himself from Labour’s ‘open door’ immigration policy which led to hundreds of thousands of migrants from the new EU countries coming to Britain as the UK did not introduce transitional controls. Family: Mr Miliband (right) filmed the broadcast at The party political broadcast was filmed at Acton College in West London, where his late, Polish father the academic Ralph Miliband came to study English 70 years ago . Nearly 600,000 European migrants came to the UK in 2010 alone, making Labour’s predictions of just 13,000 incomers from the new EU countries laughable. Mr Miliband will say: 'One of the things I've done since I became the leader of the Labour Party is understand where we got things wrong in government, and change them. 'And one of the things we didn't get right was immigration, and that's why I've got a new approach. Millions of people in this country are concerned about immigration and if people are concerned about it, then the Labour Party I lead is going to be talking about it.' Labour's public health spokesman Diane Abbott appeared to torpedo Ed Miliband's plans saying the party would not pander to 'anti-immigrant' feelings . He will add: 'Britain's diversity is a source of our great strength. It makes us a more successful country. 'But people can lose out if migration isn't properly managed. The pace of change can be too fast or people can see their wages undercut.' The party political broadcast was filmed at Acton College in West London, where Mr Miliband’s late, Polish father the academic Ralph Miliband came to study English 70 years ago after fleeing the Nazis. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, will make a speech on immigration tomorrow in which she will unveil plans to crackdown on unscrupulous employers who force migrants into overcrowded housing and pay them below the minimum wage. She will also target 'gangmasters' employing illegal migrants in the social care, hospitality and construction industries - including a ban on housing workers in over-crowded accommodation. Ms Cooper is also expected to detail proposed reforms of the immigration system and action to improve the training of UK workers so they can fill jobs in shortage occupations. The news came as Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said migrants could face a minimum period before they could claim tax credits and out-of-work benefits. Sources said it could be introduced before the lifting of restrictions on Bulgarian and Romanian immigrants this year.","Leader says 'low-skill migration has been too high' in new broadcast .

"Anybody who has sold in UK or overseas will pay capital gains tax . By . Becky Barrow . PUBLISHED: . 21:11 EST, 5 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:51 EST, 6 March 2013 . Second homeowners who fail to pay their taxes could face crippling fines or even jail under a major crackdown launched yesterday by HM Revenue and Customs. Tax collectors are targeting thousands of people who have sold a second home, a holiday home or a buy-to-let property without paying tax, even if it was up to 20 years ago. Anybody who has sold a second property in the UK or overseas will have to pay capital gains tax on the money they made from the sale. Tax collectors are targeting thousands of people who have sold a second home, a holiday home or a buy-to-let property without paying tax, even if it was up to 20 years ago . If they fail to do so, they could face huge fines and even jail under the new plans. The move will give rise to accusations that HMRC is penalising ordinary, hard-working families when they should be tackling tax avoidance by corporate giants who make huge profits but pay little or no tax in this country. Under the current rules, you are allowed to sell your home without paying a penny in tax, but the rules are different if you own more than one property. For example, a family with their main home in London and a cottage on the Cornish coast must pay capital gains tax on any profit from the sale of their country retreat. Under the tax amnesty, HMRC is urging people who should have paid tax - but failed to do so - to come forward over the next five months. The deadline is August 9. If they do not, they could face penalties worth up to 100 per cent of the capital gains tax bill which they did not pay on the sale on top of the actual bill. Anybody who has sold a second property in the UK or overseas will have to pay capital gains tax on the money they made from the sale . Marian Wilson, head of HMRC campaigns, said: ‘It is better to come to us before we come to you’, and warned people face ‘penalties or even criminal prosecution’ if they do not. Tax evasion is estimated to cost the British economy around £14billion a year. In the most extreme cases, people found guilty could be sent to jail. The crackdown will worry hundreds of thousands of Britons, many of whom may not even know that they should have paid tax on the sale of a second home. And the bill will not be small, given the house price rises over the last 20 years. Official figures, from the Land Registry, show how house prices in the most popular locations for second homes, such as Cornwall and Devon, have risen sharply. In 1998, the average home in Cornwall was worth £61,000. Fifteen years later, the same property has trebled in value to £180,000. Capital gains tax is currently charged at up to 28 per cent on any profit over £10,600, the amount of profit which can be made every year before the tax will be charged. But they will be liable to pay the tax at the rate which was levied in the year they sold the property. The levy has been as high as 40 per cent. Overall, around 619,000 families have a second home, with some owning more than one extra home. Of the total of 711,000 second homes, 343,000 are in the UK and 368,000 are outside the UK. The most popular place to have a second home is Cornwall which has around 14,560 second homeowners, followed by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London with 7,474. Around 84,000 people have a second home in France and around 88,000 in Spain, according to the Department for Communities and Local Government. Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Rather than spending its time announcing yet another crackdown, HMRC should focus on the underlying problem that is Britain’s dysfunctional tax code. ‘Capital gains tax is a deeply unfair charge which targets some people just because a home has gone up in value with inflation. ‘If our tax system was reformed to make it simpler and fairer then the taxman wouldn’t have to spend so much time and money trying to chase down those not sure of the rules as well as finding it easier to pursue those who deliberately break them.’","Tax collectors targeting thousands of people who sold second property .

An NHS nurse who secretly worked night shifts at a steel plant before driving straight to her job on a hospital ward put patients' lives at risk, a court heard. Diane Davies, 55, is accused of breaking NHS rules by working 19-hour days for 12 years, leaving her 'too tired' to properly care for patients. The court was told Davies worked from 10pm to 7am as an agency nurse at a steelworks, before driving to Swansea's Morriston Hospital for 8.15am to put in a near nine hour shift on the ward. 'Too tired': NHS nurse Diane Davies drove straight from night shifts at a Llanelli steelworks to her job at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, the court heard . Davies would drive home when her shift ended at 5pm only to start the routine all over again at the steel plant five hours later, functioning on barely any sleep. Health chiefs were unaware the nurse was holding down two full-time jobs. The court heard Davies' 12 years of night shifts had boosted her income by up to £28,000 per year on top of her NHS salary. Prosecutor Kristian Jowett said: 'She was obliged to disclose her second job to the NHS but she didn't do that. 'Nurses are required to disclose secondary employment to their employers to ensure safe practice.' The court heard Davies was promoted to staff nurse by NHS bosses in 2003, meaning it would have been part of her role to ensure other staff followed such policies. Details of Davies' punishing daily schedule at Trostre steelworks in Llanelli, South Wales, were given to the jury. The prosecution claims she had a working week of between 77 and 82 hours spread over four days. Punishing: Between her jobs at Trostre steelworks and Morriston Hospital (pictured), Davies put in a working week of between 77 and 82 hours, the prosecution claims . The court heard Davies' contract at Morriston Hospital was for a minimum of 37-and-a-half hours each week. During her employment at the steelworks through Acorn Recruitment, she worked between 40 and 45 hours a week. She is accused of doing both jobs four days of the week, breaking the rules of her contract with the NHS. Julian Quirk, a senior human resources manager at the hospital, said: 'Working the hours Davies did would be almost impossible. 'If Davies had disclosed her full-time second job it would most definitely not have been allowed' Julian Quirke, senior HR manager at Morriston Hospital . 'It would be illogical for someone to work so many hours back-to-back. There simply would not be sufficient time for the individual to have rest.' 'If Davies had disclosed her full-time second job it would most definitely not have been allowed. 'If somebody was working 19 hours a day, I cannot imagine a manager not saying that would represent a risk.' The court heard how that during the 12 years at the steelworks Davies was paid between £8,471 and £28,238 each year in addition to her NHS salary. Davies, of Birchgrove, Swansea, denies putting patient safety at risk and obtaining a financial advantage by failing to disclose her second job. The experienced nurse claims she thought the hospital knew about her other employment and that she 'never hid it'. Davies, who received no complaints regarding her clinical duty, has now resigned from her role at the hospital, where she worked since 1994. The trial at Swansea Crown Court continues.

The burden of nursery fees on working parents is now akin to taking on a 'second mortgage', childcare charities have warned. A full-time nursery place will now set a family back around £11,000 a year - almost on a par with the average price of a place at private school - rising to £14,000 in London. The cost has almost doubled in a decade. A report from the Daycare Trust and the Family and Parenting Institute found that in some parts of Britain the cost of childcare can reach as high as £42,000 for a full-time nursery place - 25 per cent more than annual boarding fees at a top public school like Charterhouse in Surrey. Expense: The cost of a full-time nursery place can reach as high as £42,000 in parts of Britain - more than annual boarding fees at a top public school like Charterhouse (pictured) The report said the typical cost per hour for a child under two has gone up by 77 per cent since 2003 to reach £4.26, while wages have stagnated. It found that one central London nursery was charging a staggering £42,000 for a full-time place. The average weekly cost of a part-time (25 hours a week) nursery placement for a child under two, according to the report: . The report argued that childcare costs are becoming increasingly difficult for families to manage. In the last year alone, the average nursery cost for a child aged under two has increased at an above-inflation rate of 4.2 per cent, to around £106 a week for a part-time place at 25 hours a week. Soaring childcare fees are a key issue for the Coalition, but the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are yet to agree on reforms to tackle the spiralling cost. Costs for children aged over two have increased at an even faster rate of 6.6 per cent annually to around £104 a week for a part-time place, the report found. Childcare costs for older children have soared by 9 per cent over the last year, with the typical cost of an after-school club at 15 hours a week reaching around £50. Anand Shukla, chief executive of Daycare Trust and the Family and Parenting Institute said: 'The survey makes clear that, from a parent's perspective, costs are increasingly difficult to manage which is a finding that should concern us all. 'Families are being expected to pay more for their child's nursery place - an average of £14,000 per year in London - than the fees for many private schools - and this cannot continue.' The survey regularly asks local authorities to report the price that parents pay for different forms of childcare in their area. The report suggested that the rising cost of childcare is evidence of a 'market failure in our childcare system', with a lack of new providers setting up to meet levels of demand in some areas. The report pointed out that 91 per cent of nursery care is delivered by the private and not-for-profit sectors in England. It said that private sector providers often have more costs to overcome than those in the public sector such as rents and servicing debts. Soaring costs: The cost of a nursery place has almost doubled in the past ten years, a report warns . The study said that much of the expense of childcare is driven by staffing costs. At present, regulations stipulate that for children under two in nurseries there must be one member of staff for three children. The report said: 'While salaries for nursery workers are not high, the need to maintain safe supervision levels and high quality childcare does, inevitably, mean that childcare cannot - and should not - be provided 'on the cheap'.' One of the ways in which the Government helps parents with childcare costs is a voucher scheme which is available through employers and allows mothers and fathers to pay for childcare out of their pre-tax wages. Basic rate tax payers can pay for up to £243 of childcare a month with the vouchers. Julian Foster, managing director of one of the voucher schemes, named Computershare Voucher Services, called for the limits on childcare vouchers to be increased and said the scheme should be extended to help the self-employed. He said: '(This) would show to this country's working families that Government ""gets it"". They get that support needs to be widely accessible, they get that household budgets are becoming increasingly strained, and they get that working mothers and fathers - part of the lifeblood of the British economy - need adequate support to raise their families and this country's future.'","A full-time nursery place can cost as much as £42,000 in parts of Britain .

Run-down and left to the elements, these abandoned buildings offer a sometimes macabre, often poignant insight into their history - as a leper colony. The centuries-old institution on the Greek island of Chios once housed dozens of outcasts who had contracted the disease, which is still often misunderstood today. These evocative photos by Kelly Katsarou vividly reveal the environment in which the lepers were forced to live out their lives. Scroll down for video . Welcoming?

Greek leper colonies are the subject of . Victoria Hislop's best-seling debut novel The Island . Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease after physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, is a chronic disease caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. Left untreated, the disease can cause permanent damage to the skin, nerves, limbs and eyes. A common myth is that body parts can fall off, but it can cause limbs to become numb or diseased from secondary infections. Although the form of transmission remains uncertain, it is thought to be through respiratory droplets. The World Health Organization estimated that in 1995 between two and three million people were permanently disabled because of leprosy. In the past 20 years, 15 million people have been cured of leprosy worldwide. The colony, called Lovokomeio, opened in 1378 as the first leper colony in Greece and one of the first in all of Europe. It . was intended to isolate those suffering from leprosy and other . contagious skin diseases from the rest of society in order to avoid . infecting others. The origins of leprosy, now known to be caused by a bacterium, were then unknown, adding to the stigma placed on its sufferers. As the disease was so poorly understood, many of the 'lepers' sent to the colony did not even suffer from it - rather, they had other skin diseases or fungal infections. Such was the fear and stigma, settlements were usually built in . isolated locations such as islands. Sometimes, however, they . were deliberately set up to be accessible so that they were kept in the public eye, and thus received a steady flow of . donations. Lovokomeio was no such colony. Fitting with the commonly held belief of the time that the disease was a punishment from God, there was a church dedicated to St Lazarus, the patron saint of lepers. Step inside: The abandoned leper colony is now a tourist attraction since being shut down in 1957 . Picturesque: Some of the photographs make you forget the sinister past of the buildings . Eerie: Other images bring home the horror of what used to happen at the institution . Outdated: Lepers were made to live with one another and forbidden from mixing with their families . It is just one of the run-down buildings on the colony photographed by Kelly Katsarou, where children’s . notebooks and medicines lie scattered alongside open tombs.

A woman who attacked a hamster and left it for dead in front of horrified children was ordered to carry out 160 hours of unpaid work. Tracey McGregor was told by a sheriff she had caused the rodent 'clear distress' and upset the children, who saw Jeff the hamster lying lifeless on the ground. Sheriff Robert McCreadie told McGregor, 28, at Perth Sheriff Court she was lucky not to have killed the hamster after she hurled its cage more than 20ft through the air. Tracey McGregor, who hurled a caged hamster down a flight of stairs during an angry row, was found guilty of animal cruelty . He told her: 'The distress to the animal must have been considerable. 'Your behaviour distressed others in the house. There was distress caused to children who ran out of the house past the hamster… they were really upset.' The sheriff told the court: 'It is clear she was under the influence of alcohol. She has had a difficult relationship with binge-drinking in the past. 'She is noted as posing a high risk of future offending, doesn't show any remorse and continues to deny the hamster was in the cage when the evidence points to the contrary.' Sheriff McCreadie told McGregor, who was found guilty after a trial of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal in a house in Perth in October 2010, she would be ordered to do the unpaid work as part of a community payback order. The court was told children fled in fear after McGregor attacked hamsters in the house. Jeff initially appeared to have been killed after his cage smashed open at the foot of the stairs in the home of McGregor's 17-year-old half-sister Leanne Anderson. McGregor, 28, appeared at Perth Sheriff Court and was told she was lucky not to have killed the hamster . Miss Anderson said McGregor had been drunk and had been asked to go after shouting and swearing abuse. She said McGregor had reacted to this request by grabbing the cage containing Jeff and hurling it down a flight of stairs. She then knocked over two further hamsters in their cages, Miss Anderson said. She added: 'I asked her to leave when the argument started. She got angry. I had to phone my dad. She shouted down the phone at him. She threw the phone against the wall. I kept asking her to leave. She went into my room and threw some things about. 'That's when she picked up the hamster cage. It was obvious she was heading to the stairs.' Miss Anderson said her boyfriend tried in vain to stop McGregor, adding: 'I went to check on my younger sister and heard the other two cages getting knocked from the chest of drawers. 'I went back out to see what had happened. She had thrown it down the stairs. It was at the bottom. I saw her at the top of the stairs.' Miss Anderson said the cage had smashed open on the floor and the hamster was lying motionless on the carpet. She said the children had been 'really upset, because the hamster was lying at the bottom of the stairs. They were petrified.' Miss Anderson confirmed Jeff was later taken to the vet and had survived his ordeal. McGregor, of Perth, admitted she had picked up a cage and had hurled it down the stairs, but claimed it did not contain a hamster at the time. She said: 'I was being reckless and stupid.' She said she did not like hamsters, adding: 'I am terrified of them.'","Tracey McGregor was told she had caused the rodent 'clear distress'

Confession: Russian police today confirmed that principal Bolshoi dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko has confessed to ordering the acid attack . A top Bolshoi Ballet dancer has confessed to police that he ordered a ruthless sulphuric acid attack on the world famous troupe's artistic director in a case as dramatic as one of its famed productions. Star soloist Pavel Dmitrichenko -  best known . for playing Ivan the Terrible on the Moscow stage - allegedly 'masterminded' a 'hit' that left Sergei Filin, 42, almost blind and his face disfigured. After being seized by police, the 29-year-old said: 'I organized that attack but not to the extent that it occurred.' A police source said: 'The motive of the crime was the hostile personal relationship Pavel Dmitrichenko had with Sergei Filin, which was linked to their work.' Two others, Yury Zarutsky, 35, suspected perpetrator of the attack, and Andrey Lipatov, 31, allegedly driver of the get-away car, are also said to have signed written confessions for playing a part in the January incident. The treacherous row at the top of Russian ballet has shocked the country. It is claimed the dancer's dispute with Filin was over . his 21-year-old 'partner' Anzhelina Vorontsova, another Bolshoi . dancer, who the director allegedly snubbed for a job. Vorontsova is a student of leading dancer Nikolai . Tsiskaridze who is seen as a rival of Filin, but who strongly denied any role . in the attack.

No statement has been issued as yet by Dmitrichenko or on . his behalf. There is palpable shock at the Bolshoi which said on Tuesday . that they were unaware of any massive breakdown in relations between Filin and Dmitrichenk. 'All three have  confessed to the crime,' said a statement by Moscow police. 'All three are arrested now according . to the Article 91 of Russian Criminal Code.'

State jobs: Northern Ireland has the highest percentage of workers employed in the public sector (27.7 per cent) compared to just 16.6 per cent in the South East . Fewer than one in five people now work in the public sector, new figures show every part of the UK becomes less reliant on state jobs. In September there were 5.7million people working in the public sector, 19.4 per cent of all those in work. The figure is down from almost 6.2million or 22 per cent in 2009, as spending cuts have seen a massive reduction in jobs in government, councils, education, the armed forces and the health service. The proportion of people employed by the state varies markedly across the country. Northern Ireland is most dominated by taxpayer-funded jobs, with 27.7 per cent of workers on the public payroll. By comparison in the South East just 16.6 per cent of people work in the public sector. The ONS said: ‘Total public sector employment is estimated to have risen in all regions during 2008 and 2009 before then falling to below 2008 levels by September 2012.’ The number of people employed by . councils has fallen across the country since 2008, except in Northern . Ireland which has seen a small increase. The National Health Service employs 1.55 million people nationwide, down four per cent from a peak of 1.6million in 2009. Less reliant: The proportion of people employed by the state has fallen across all regions since 2008 . The education sector accounts for 1.5 million staff while public administration employs 1.1 million. Most regions now have more people working in the private sector than in March 2008. David Cameron has repeatedly promise a ‘private-sector led’ recovery, and boasted that the coalition has created up to 1million jobs. From September 2008 to September 2012, . the number of people employed by the public sector fell by five per . cent from 6million to 5.7million. Over the same period, private sector employment rose by two per cent to 23.9million. Part . of the fall in the number of people employed in the public sector can . be explained by some sixth form and further education colleges being . reclassified from the public to the private sector. Public spending cuts have seen reductions in the numbers on the state payroll, but the private sector has grown . But the ONS said that even excluding this reclassification, the number of people employed in the public sector fell by 128,000 between September 2011 and September 2012. The ONS said: Across the UK the percentage of people employed in the public sector varies. Northern Ireland (27.7%) and Wales (25.7%) both had more than a quarter of their workforce employed in the public sector. 'Within England, the South East (16.9%), East (16.7%) and London (16.9%) had the lowest percentage of their workforces employed in the public sector. 'However across the UK, London had the highest number of people employed in the public sector at 741,000 but it has a larger population than other areas of the UK.'","Fewer than one in five jobs is now taxpayer--funded across the country .

A NHS nurse who worked 19-hour days . with moonlight shifts at a steel plant said she had to work the marathan . hours to pay for her son's university education. Diane Davies, 55, is accused of endangering patients lives by her marathon working days for 12 years. But Davies told how she took on the extra shifts as a steelworks nurse after becoming the sole breadwinner for her family. She is accused of breaking NHS rules by working 19-hour days for 12 years, leaving her 'too tired' to properly care for patients. 'Too tired': NHS nurse Diane Davies (pictured yesterday) drove straight from night shifts at a . Llanelli steelworks to her job at Morriston Hospital, Swansea, the . court heard . Davies would drive home when . her shift ended at 5pm only to start the routine all over again at the . steel plant five hours later, functioning on barely any sleep. Health . chiefs were unaware the nurse was holding down two full-time jobs. The . court heard Davies' 12 years of night shifts had boosted her income by . up to £28,000 per year on top of her NHS salary. The . court was told Davies worked from 10pm to 7am as an agency nurse at a . steelworks, before driving to Swansea's Morriston Hospital for 8.15am to . put in a near nine hour shift on the ward. But she told a jury she did what she . had to so to 'survive' and took on the punishing workload with two . full-time jobs after her husband Ken lost his employment. She said: 'I did what I had to do to survive. 'I was putting my son through university at the time so money was very very tight. 'My husband lost his job so we lost a wage. 'It was very important for me to put my son through university and things were bad.' Davies is accused of putting patients' lives at risk because she was too tired to care for them properly. She worked from 10pm to 7am as an . agency nurse at a steelworks, before driving to Swansea's Morriston . Hospital for 8.15am to put in a near nine hour shift on the ward. Davies would drive home when her . shift ended at 5pm only to start the routine all over again at the . Trostre steel plant in Llanelli, West Wales. Punishing: Between her jobs at Trostre steelworks and Morriston Hospital (pictured), Davies put in a working week of between 77 and 82 hours, the prosecution claims . The nurse told a jury that her role . at the steelworks as a 'babysitting' shift and she was able to sleep for . 'about six hours' while on the job. She said: 'After I finished at the hospital my husband would cook dinner, I'd watch telly or have a sleep then go to Trostre. 'They employed 600 at the steelworks, . it was heavy industry so they had a nurse 24/7 but the nurse on a night . shift wasn't really needed.' 'My role was to baby sit the plant at night. 'I'd do a hand over from the day . nurse, clean up, stock up dressing trollies, make notes for the . following day's duties and that was my role finished so I'd sleep. 'I couldn't have worked two jobs if I didn't have any sleep, so I slept. 'I never worked straight through two shifts, I slept at Trostre. 'If I was disturbed I woke up and dealt with that but that was the nature of the work. 'You can't sit in a chair for eight hours and not fall asleep.' 'If Davies had disclosed her full-time second job it would most definitely not have been allowed' Julian Quirke, senior HR manager at Morriston Hospital . Swansea Crown Court heard how health chiefs were unaware the nurse was holding down two full-time jobs. The court heard Davies' 12 years of night shifts had boosted her income by up to £28,000 per year on top of her NHS salary. But Davies claimed she had informed . her line manager at the hospital she was working a second full-time job . at the steelworks - but he 'had not been concerned'. She said: 'As he'd never placed any priority on it I didn't think it would be an issue with anyone else. 'I thought I was doing the right thing.' Davies told the jury her work at the . hospital was managerial not not clinical - from 2003 she was appointed . junior sister and later sister. She said she would 'never' be involved in clinical procedures and did not distribute drugs or remove stitches from patients. Prosecutor Kristian Jowett said: 'She was obliged to disclose her second job to the NHS but she didn't do that. 'Nurses are required to disclose secondary employment to their employers to ensure safe practice.' The prosecution claims she had a working week of between 77 and 82 hours spread over four days. The court heard Davies' contract at Morriston Hospital was for a minimum of 37-and-a-half hours each week. During her employment at the steelworks through Acorn Recruitment, she worked between 40 and 45 hours a week. She is accused of doing both jobs four days of the week, breaking the rules of her contract with the NHS. Julian Quirk, a senior human resources manager at the hospital, said: 'Working the hours Davies did would be almost impossible. 'It would be illogical for someone to . work so many hours back-to-back. There simply would not be sufficient . time for the individual to have rest.' 'If Davies had disclosed her full-time second job it would most definitely not have been allowed. 'If somebody was working 19 hours a day, I cannot imagine a manager not saying that would represent a risk.' The . court heard how that during the 12 years at the steelworks Davies was . paid between £8,471 and £28,238 each year in addition to her NHS salary. Davies, . of Birchgrove, Swansea, denies putting patient safety at risk and . obtaining a financial advantage by failing to disclose her second job. The experienced nurse claims she thought the hospital knew about her other employment and that she 'never hid it'. Davies, . who received no complaints regarding her clinical duty, has now . resigned from her role at the hospital, where she worked since 1994. The trial continues.

Cost-cutting: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said there was a need to 'achieve savings as quickly as possible' New powers to seize and sell off the cars of convicted criminals to help cover their legal aid bills will be introduced as part of plans to cut the cost of the scheme. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the Government will also speed up moves towards lawyers competing on price for legal aid work on criminal cases. Mr Grayling, who told MPs the urgency was due to the need to 'achieve savings as quickly as possible', said the first contracts could go live in autumn 2014 - a year earlier than previously announced. Lawyers warned the move - designed to help reduce the £2billion legal aid bill for England and Wales - would not protect the 'safeguards and qualities which we must expect from our justice system'. Mr Grayling also confirmed that new powers to seize and sell convicted criminals' cars to help meet the cost of legal aid in their cases would come into force in July this year. In a written statement he said the move would 'help ensure that defendants contribute towards the cost of their otherwise taxpayer-funded defence'. Ministry of Justice figures show some £75million in legal aid has been ordered to be repaid since 2010, but so far only £16million has been received, a report in the Telegraph said. Mr Grayling said: 'We have already made clear our intention to introduce price competition in the criminal legal aid market, as the best way to ensure long-term sustainability and value for money.' Under the new timetable the consultation will be published next month, with tendering opening in competition areas in autumn and the first contracts going live a year later. The Bar Council said competition by price was a 'blunt instrument' which could damage standards. 'Blunt instrument': Lawyers warned the introduction of price competition would not protect the 'qualities and safeguards we must expect from our justice system' Maura McGowan QC, chairman of the Bar, said: 'Just as the Government faces pressure, we must also recognise the enormous pressure which publicly funded legal practitioners, particularly at the junior end of the profession, are under and how vital it is to the future of the justice system that they are able to pursue a viable career as specialist advocates and in the public interest. 'One of the proposals is a model based on price competition, which is a blunt instrument. 'It assures none of the safeguards and qualities which we must expect from our justice system.

Criticising the judge’s remarks, Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘If the system of justice over which his lordship presides was not so inaccessible to my constituents, justice would be even-handed in the first place.' Mr Carswell said it was because the 'self-serving legal elite' had made justice so expensive that lawyers had to be subsidised by the state. Criminologist Dr David Green, of the Civitas think-tank, said: ‘It is inappropriate for the president of the Supreme Court to make such political comments.","New powers are among measures aimed at cutting Britain's legal aid bill .

The species lives in the tree canopy and moves large distances in search of food. Around 55,000 Bornean orangutans live in the wild. As well as the destruction of their natural habitat, they are also killed for the 'bushmeat trade,' while young orangutans are even caught to be sold as pets.

A man who beat his pregnant ex-fiancee to death causing the death of their unborn baby has been jailed for at least 27 years. Unemployed alcoholic Tony McLernon, 24, of Harlow, Essex, was found guilty of murder and child destruction following a trial lasting just over two weeks at Chelmsford Crown Court. The trial heard he lured Eystna Blunnie, 20, to her death in July last year after telling friends she was trying to ruin his new relationship. Lured: Eystna Blunnie, left, was found dying in the street after being attacked by her ex Tony McLernon, right . Jailed: Tony McLernon, of Harlow, Essex, was found guilty of murder . When they met in Howard Way, near her home in Harlow, he jumped on her, kicked her and left her to die in a pool of blood. Miss Blunnie was due to give birth to a girl within days. Ordering a minimum tariff of 27 years . of a life sentence, Mr Justice Fulford said: 'It is undoubtedly the . case that he brutally and repeatedly attacked Eystna Blunnie during the . course of their relationship. 'He told friends he wanted her significantly harmed or killed. In April he strangled her, causing the baby distress. 'This killing was not the result of . an unthinking moment of anger but instead he had contemplated the attack . over a long period of time. 'The killing was truly terrible. The . horrific screams heard by those nearby show the suffering and pain she . suffered and for some period of time she would have been aware of the . fatal consequences for herself and her child. Chilling: A CCTV image shows Eystna Blunnie walking down the street on her way to meet Tony McLernon . 'He has shown not the slightest shred of remorse.' McLernon showed no emotion as he was led from the dock. Outside court, Miss Blunnie's uncle, Tony Blunnie, read a statement on behalf of her family.He said: 'After a very long and heart-breaking eight months, we have finally received justice for Eystna and her then soon-to-be- born daughter, Rose. 'Eystna was a loving girl with a unique personality and her whole life ahead of her. 'We know Rose would have been loved, nurtured and given the best in life that's possible. We are pleased the jury saw through his lies and saw him as the evil person he truly was.' When questioned by police McLernon claimed she had been attacked by two men and he had been unable to defend her. But the jury took just two hours to find him guilty of both murder and child destruction yesterday. Final moments: McLernon will be sentenced today for the murder of Miss Blunnie, seen in CCTV footage on the night of her death . Miss Blunnie’s family released a statement after the verdict which said: 'In June of 2012 our . family was shattered by the death of a loving daughter, Eystna, and her . unborn child, Rose. 'The worst part was to find out that their deaths were such a brutal murder. 'However today justice has prevailed for our daughter and granddaughter with the conviction of their killer.' Speaking outside court, Detective Chief Inspector Lucy Robinson said: 'Tony McLernon is a dangerous, violent man. 'He has subjected numerous ex-girlfriends to constant fear of being . assaulted, and Eystna paid the ultimate price during his final violent . outburst. 'What he has taken away from the Blunnie family can never be replaced, . but I hope he never has the opportunity to put another family through . the pain they continue to suffer.' McLernon, of North Grove, . Harlow, had earlier told the court how he had been drinking more than . 20 litres of cider and Lambrini a day and was addicted to the computer . game Guitar Hero at the time of the attack. He described how he would rarely leave his bedroom, instead spending hours on end playing the Xbox game. The court heard how the couple got . engaged in 2011 after meeting on Facebook but their relationship . deteriorated and they split up early in 2012. In the weeks leading up to the killing . he had told friends and family that Miss Blunnie was trying to ruin his . new relationship, telling one he expected to go to prison for what he . planned to do. Giving evidence, McLernon said he had been 'over the moon' about the . impending birth adding that, in the days leading up to Miss Blunnie’s . death, they had been getting on well. He said that his drinking and gaming habits put strain on his relationship with Miss Blunnie. Unemployed McLernon told the court that his drinking began at the age of 16. Investigation: Police outside the home of Tony McLernon last year . Distraught: People lay flowers on the side of a main road in Harlow near to where Eystna Blunnie and her unborn baby were brutally beaten to death . Grief: Two friends console each other beside tributes to the college student who was due to give birth . For . several years he had met friends in a park near his Harlow home and . would drink up to 12 pints of lager most nights, he said. As his alcoholism, funded by Jobseeker’s Allowance, worsened, he sought out cheaper and stronger drinks. He said: 'A group of us would meet by a bench and drink. I would normally have about 12 pints of lager. 'But in 2012 my drinking changed significantly. 'I . would buy two or three litre bottles of strong cider from the . supermarket and mix it with Lambrini to make a drink with 13 per cent . alcohol. 'We called it rocket fuel. By the middle of the year I was drinking a mix of 10 or 11 bottles per day. 'I would be sick, vomiting everywhere, falling out of bed and at times the ambulance would have to be called.' Describing the moment Eystna was supposedly attacked by two men, McLernon said: 'I saw the two men run off up a path and, when I saw Eystna injured in the street, I nearly screamed.' He said he tried to put his former partner in the recovery position. 'There was more blood than I care to remember and she made a horrible sound,' McLernon added. 'I tried to turn my phone on but it took a while to load up. There wasn't anything I could do. 'I saw one of the men running back towards me so I panicked and I ran. 'I . was in no fit state to try to defend her - the look in his eyes was . terrible and I thought he was going to give me a kicking.' Shocking: A mourner reads some of the touching messages left at the spot where Miss Blunnie was found . He added that he had not been able to tell anybody about what happened that night because 'it made me feel sick'. CCTV footage captured a heavily-pregnant Eystna Blunnie, a catering student and barmaid, walking through the Harlow estate to meet McLernon talking on her mobile phone. She was due to give birth to a girl within days when she died. She told McLernon she was pregnant with his child in October 2011 but they broke up the following year. He said that he had been 'over the moon' about the impending birth and that the pair had been getting on well. Asked if the text message was part of a . scheme to tempt her to meet him, he said 'absolutely not' adding the . surprise was that he had brought his dog, Alan, to see her. McLernon, who said he had suffered . from depression and was prone to self-harm, denied claims he had . physically abused her and previous partners.","Tony McLernon, 24, killed Eystna Blunnie, 20, in Harlow, Essex, last year .

Laughable: Andrew Cant, owner of Simply Books, was shocked when he received a cheque for 12p seven years after being a victim of crime . Court officials have been accused of 'judicial overkill' today after spending seven years chasing 12p in compensation from a criminal before handing it to his bemused victim. Book shop owner Andrew Cant, 58, had no idea he had lost £3 in a sponsorship scam in 2006 - yet investigators were determined he would get his money back. Although the culprit was jailed in 2006, officials at Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunal Service pored over paperwork relating to the case. They went through a raft of bogus sponsorship forms signed by Mr Cant and other unwitting victims of serial conman Mark Maskell and then investigated whether the names and addresses on the list of sponsors checked out. After establishing their identities, they split the amount and made out cheques for 12p to 34 victims - placing first class stamps on each later at a cost of 59p each. When Mr Cant tried to find out what the money was for, HMCTS went to the expense of sending him another letter apologising for sending him the 12p cheque. Mr Cant - owner of Simply Books in Bramhall, Cheshire said: 'I can't imagine the waste of public money that has gone into administering the cheque and now sending me a letter to apologise for it. 'The fact is I had forgotten all about losing this money yet these people have spent many man hours sorting out a payment which literally isn't worth the paper it is written on. 'It seems ludicrous. I would happily have written off three pounds and frankly I can't understand all the bother that went into investigating it. The irony is it would cost me more money to cash the cheque than the cheque is actually worth. Pay-off: This cheque for 12p was the result of years of work by civil servants who were accused of 'judicial overkill' today . Don't spend it all at once: The cost of the stamp used to send it to him was more than the money he received . Funny: 'It was ridiculous to send out a cheque for 12p, especially as it would cost me 63p to cash it,' the book shop owner said . 'As far as I'm concerned I'm going to frame it and put it up on the wall of the book shop as an example of judicial overkill. Had I known what the court people were doing I would have told them not to bother for such a small amount of money.' Criminal: Mark Maskill had scammed dozens of people, claiming he was going to do parachute jumps for good causes and Andrew had sponsored him £3 in 2006 . Father of three Mr Cant was one of a number of victims of conman Mark Maskell who scammed dozens of people, claiming he was going to do parachute jumps for good causes - only to pocket the cash. Mr Cant sponsored Maskell for £3 in 2006 after the conman came into his shop falsely claiming he was raising money for a homeless charity. Maskell was later jailed for four months later that year after admitting deception but Macclesfield magistrates ordered he pay compensation to his victims. 'The whole thing is just laughable. It was ridiculous to send out a cheque for 12p, especially as it would cost me 63p to cash it,' Mr Cant said. It is understood that court officers chased the compensation ordered by magistrates and whatever money was recovered was split equally between victims. It is not not known why it took so long for the money to come through. A spokesman for Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunal Service said: 'HMCTS uses all means at its disposal to ensure compensation ordered by the court is paid. 'Normally payments are not sent to victims until a minimum of £5 has been collected. The 12p cheque was issued in error. HMCTS has apologised to the individual concerned.' Sorry! The letter sent to Andrew apologising for sending him the tiny amount and explaining they always try to track down compensation for victims . Maskell, now 30, was jailed four times - for four months in 2006, another four months in 2007, 16 months in 2008 and a further four months in February 2010. He would knock on the doors of the victims, claimed he was doing parachute jumps or sponsored swims to raise money for The Wellspring homeless charity in Stockport or the British Heart Foundation. He was caught for the sixth time in 2011 after being shopped by his sister for pretending to take part in a sponsored swim - but was given a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and a three-month electronically tagged evening curfew. It emerged he had carried out the fraud to fund an addiction to heroin.","Andrew Cant, 58, was handed the cheque but had no idea he'd been robbed .

A top U.S. official has suggested a new reason for the failure of sensitive international negotiations - it could be because the participants are drunk. The country's deputy ambassador to the United Nations is calling for a ban on excessive drinking during meetings designed to hammer out the budget. There are reports that diplomats have been visibly drunk while serving on key committees - fuelled by the fact that the UN budget is usually fixed in late December. But Joseph Torsella appeared to admit that the U.S. has in the past taken advantage of drunk negotiators to get its way without them noticing. 'We . make the modest proposal that the negotiating rooms should in the . future be an inebriation-free zone,' Mr Torsella said yesterday in a . speech aimed at reforming the UN's Fifth Committee, which manages the . budget. 'While my . government is truly grateful for the strategic opportunities presented . by some recent past practices, let’s save the champagne for toasting the . successful end of the session, and do some credit to the Fifth . Committee's reputation in the process.' Drinking . among UN diplomats is thought to be exacerbated around Christmas, when . the budget is set - especially since the meetings frequently drag on . late in to the night. 'We're not talking about a delegate having a nip at the bar,' one diplomat told Foreign Policy magazine, adding that had once seen a delegate drink so much he was sick. Heavy drinkers? UN diplomats have been accused of drunkenness by a leading U.S. official . Ploy: Some have suggested heavy drinking is a deliberate negotiating tactic for some countries . Diplomats from the G77 group of emerging countries are said to be particularly prone to over-indulgence. However, some have suggested that the heavy drinking is a deliberate ploy to stall the negotiations and avoid any change in the status quo. As well as taking aim at the UN's drinking culture, Mr Torsella, who is the U.S. representative for 'management and reform', attacked other countries for blocking change by deploying tricks such as simply skipping meetings. 'If negotiators do not arrive on time for meetings scheduled on nights and weekends, or simply refuse to meet on a specific item in order to run down the clock, we must conclude that they do not share a commitment to negotiating in good faith, and we will respond accordingly,' he said.","Deputy ambassador Joseph Torsella criticises UN delegates for drinking .

A courageous mother who lost parts of both of her legs while protecting her children from a tornado exactly a year ago has shown off her astonishing recovery and her new state-of-the-art limbs. Stephanie Decker, 38, lost one leg above . the knee and the other foot protecting her 8-year-old son and 5-year-old . daughter as the storm flattened their 'dream home' in Henryville, . Indiana on March 3. But she has remained humble about her heroic act of love, and has become an advocate for other amputees since leaving rehab last summer. And in an interview marking the one-year anniversary of the tornado, she revealed that the family is almost finished building their new home in Sellersburg. Fighting back: Stephanie Decker has shown off her remarkable recovery a year after she lost her legs . New legs: Decker lost part of both legs while protecting her two children from a tornado last March . 'We're currently building our house,' she told WHAS11. 'We thought about having a scripture . signing of our home on the day and inviting the community to come and . just say a few things on our walls. 'But we really just want to be there for everyone else... There are so many people who went through so many tragedies and ours is a good story.' She also showed off her new legs, which have flexible prosthetic ankles and different settings for driving and walking. She charges the . batteries in her two ankles and one knee every night. 'I get up in the morning and instead of . putting on a pair of shoes, I put on a pair of legs,' Decker told the Courier Journal. 'And . then my day begins. It’s fixing lunches, getting kids off to school.' Brave: She has shown astonishing determination throughout the year, including as she walked through the White House last June, aided by President Obama, her husband and children . Upbeat: She also danced with Ellen DeGeneres on her show just two months after the accident . She also spends as much as two hours every day training at the gym. The legs even helped her walk to the capitol in Kentucky last month, where she lobbied for a bill requiring private insurers to give amputees in the state greater access to advanced prosthetic, as Indiana does. The bill has now advanced out of a Kentucky House committee. She also started the Stephanie Decker Foundation to help young amputees go to camp, pursue sports and other outdoor activities. And last summer she was pictured walking into the Oval Office with the help of President Obama, just four months after her limbs were crushed by the debris. 'Dream home': The Deckers had spent nine months building their home in Henryville, Louisiana . Gone: The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mrs Decker said . 'So many good things have come from this accident,' Decker told the Courier Journal. 'I know that's kind of strange to say.' And even when she wakes up knowing she has a struggle ahead of her, she stays positive. 'I have a lot to be thankful for,' she said. 'When I . get to wake up and see my kids every day it really squashes that, ""Man, . this is hard"" (mindset) really quick.” Decker was injured when a series of mega tornadoes raged across . Southern Indiana and Kentucky last March, killing 39, injuring . many and destroying thousands of homes and schools. She has previously spoken out about . how uncertain she was about the impending disaster that she filmed a . message on her mobile phone to her husband, telling him she loved him. Happy family: Stephanie was surrounded by her family at the hospital, including her husband Joe (left), son Dominic (center right) and Reese (right) A mother's love: As soon as the storm passed, Dominic, 8, ran to a neighbor's home for help . 'I assumed I was safe and I heard the . roar like a train, and I heard it behind me, and I knew it was coming,' she told ABC News. 'And it was so loud that I knew that I needed to do . something different. I knew staying put wasn't going to work.' 'They were screaming, ""Mommy, I can’t . live without you! I don’t wanna die, please don’t let me die!"" and I . said, ""you’re not going to die, we’re going to make it"".' Then she realised she had been badly . hurt, with her leg appearing as if it had been severed. She also . suffered seven broken ribs and a punctured lung. 'I knew it was bad. If I didn't get help soon, I was going to bleed out,' she added to ABC News. Support: Stephanie is pictured with her husband Joe, son Dominic and daughter Reese . Fears: Mrs Decker was so worried she was going to die as a result of her injuries that she filmed a video on her mobile phone for her husband Joe, pictured, to tell him she loved him . Knowing his mother was hurt, it was . Dominic's turn for bravery. He crawled out from under his mother and ran . to a neighbor's house. 'After Dominic left, I realised I . couldn't get out because I actually used the comforter I tied with them . as a tourniquet. I knew I was cut,' she said. One . neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark County Sheriff’s officer, used his . belt to create a tighter tourniquet and drove her until he could flag . down an ambulance, which took her to hospital. Her husband, Joe Decker, tearfully said that the flattened house had been their dream home. His . wife had said she always wanted to have the children's handprints . imprinted in the foundation's cement, because 'we were never gonna leave . here'. Destruction: The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds destroyed by tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather . The small prints, with the 'Reese' and 'D' for Dominic, remain scrawled in the concrete. Mr Decker said: 'What I told her was: ""You’re alive and you get to see your kids grow up"".' The . home, which was partly built by Mr Decker and his wife's father, was . completely destroyed, with a bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field. Henryville was nearly entirely . flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the South and Midwest on . Friday March 3, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless. The Decker’s inspirational story is . one of the few from that fateful day, which saw deaths in Alabama, . Georgia. Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, with Indiana and Kentucky . particularly hard hit, with 13 and 21 lives lost respectively.","Stephanie Decker, 37, told children: 'You're not going to die. We'll make it'

Legal highs have caused a surge in hospital admissions in the UK, a report has warned, as it emerged Britain has become a hub of Europe's booming online designer drug market. The report from the International Narcotics Control Board said the number of websites supplying mind-altering substances to Europe has increased by 300 per cent in just two years - and around one fifth of those sites are hosted on servers based in Britain. The 'unprecedented' increase in the emergence of new psychoactive substances has led to increases in hospital admissions and medical appointments in the UK, along with reports of health problems caused by regular use of designer drugs, it said. 'Major challenge': The rise of so-called legal highs like mephedrone, also known as meow meow, has seen a rise in hospital admissions in the UK, a report found . The INCB study said the abuse of illicit drugs in Europe has stabilised in recent years, albeit at a high level. Mephedrone - which was banned and made a class B drug in 2010 - was the third most popular drug among those aged 16 to 59. Abuse of the club drug, also known as Meow Meow, Bubbles and M-Cat, was at 1.4 per cent in England and Wales in the period 2010/11 . The UK is the only major European country allowing the import of khat, a substance widely consumed in East Africa and parts of the Middle East for its stimulating effects . The abuse of antidepressants has increased in Northern Ireland . The number of foreign nationals being used as couriers to smuggle drugs into the UK, Canada and the US has risen. But the emergence of psychoactive substances - so-called designer drugs or legal highs - posed a 'major challenge', it said. While overall drug-related deaths in Britain fell by 14 per cent from 2009 to 2010, fatalities caused by the abuse of new substances increased significantly, from six cases in 2008 to 44 cases in 2009, the study from the UN body found. However, it did not state the exact figures that showed the surge in hospital admissions. It said: 'In recent years, there has been an unprecedented increase in the emergence of new psychoactive substances not within the purview of the international drug control conventions.' It added: 'The number of Internet-based retail sites selling psychoactive products and shipping to European Union member States increased from 170 in January 2010 to 314 in January 2011 and 690 in January 2012. More than 130 sites were registered in the UK. 'About a third of them were hosted on servers based in the United States, and a fifth of them were hosted on servers based in the United Kingdom.' Citing figures from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, it said the number of notifications relating to new psychoactive substances hit 49 in 2011, meaning a new drug appeared on the market almost every week. It said: 'Although it is impossible to know the exact number of new psychoactive substances on the market, experts have advanced estimates running well into the thousands. 'As abuse of these substances has increased, so too has the number of users who have experienced grave health consequences or even suffered death due to exposure to them. Concerns: While overall drug related deaths in Britain have fallen, those caused by the abuse of new substances increased significantly, the report found . 'In many countries, use of such substances has manifested itself in marked increases in emergency room visits for adverse health reactions caused by the ingestion of new psychoactive substances, as well as in significant increases in calls to poison treatment centres.' The study found 'mounting evidence' to suggest many new drugs were being manufactured in China and India. It concluded: 'A particular challenge to Government efforts to place new psychoactive substances under national control is the difficulty of identifying those substances in a timely manner, given the rapid succession of new substances entering the market, their inconsistent chemical composition and the lack of technical and pharmacological data and reference material, as well as insufficient forensic and toxicological capacity on the part of some states.'","Number of websites supplying legal highs to Europe up 300 per cent .

Best-selling tipple Baileys is scrapping its distinctive bottle shape after almost 40 years...so that drinkers can keep it in the fridge door. The Irish cream liqueur has been sold in the instantly recognisable container that is shorter and fatter than a typical bottle of spirits since its 1974 launch. But although it can last for up to two years at the back of the drinks cupboard - even after being opened - a growing number of its predominantly female fans like it chilled. Scroll down for video . Before and after: The traditional Baileys bottle, pictured left, has been used since the Irish Cream liqueur was launched in 1974. The new bottle, pictured left, has been heightened and slimmed down so it can fit in the fridge . Now drinks giant Diageo, which owns Baileys along with other brands like Guinness, has finally decided to change the shape to fit modern demands. From this month it will be sold in a slimmer, longer, wine-shaped bottle in its first major revamp since the original launch. A £1 million publicity campaign to introduce the new look will accompany the launch as fans of the whiskey (corr) based tipple, often a Christmas favourite, get to grips with it. Alcoholic drinks giant: Diageo also makes Guinness and Smirnoff vodka . Diageo says the new shape gives it a ‘stylish and elegant’ profile but admits: 'It allows it to fit inside a fridge door.' The company added the shape would appeal more to the drink’s huge female fanbase. A spokesman said: 'As one of the most-loved female spirits brands in the world, we need to not only to appeal to current Baileys consumers and adorers, but ensure we also appeal to each new generation of progressive, savvy and spirited women. 'We have created a beautiful new bottle which is both modern and stylish, with a greater sense of femininity. 'Baileys is a brand that appeals specifically and uniquely to women, and through this re-design we embrace and celebrate that timeless appeal in a fresh and contemporary way.' The drink does not have to be kept in the fridge, it can last for up to two years with or without being chilled and whether or not it has already been opened. But after years of being associated with a largely middle aged, Christmas market, the brand tried to make itself younger and trendier with expensive ad campaigns encouraging drinkers to try it with ice in. Now a lot of its younger buyers keep a bottle in the fridge rather than the drinks cupboard.","Irish cream liqueur has been sold in same bottle design since 1974 launch .

Burglar Max Bancroft, from Lancashire, was tracked down by police after he accidentally left behind his shirt and a letter at the scene of the crime with his name and address on it . A burglar was tracked down by police after he accidentally left behind his shirt and a letter at the scene of the crime with his name and address on it. Teacher's son Max Bancroft, 21, had smashed into his local pub after earlier being thrown out for drunkenness - only to injure himself on the broken glass of a window. As he pulled off his T shirt to to stem the flow of blood, a letter he had received in the post fell out of his pocket and landed on the floor. Police found the incriminating . blood-stained note and T-shirt as they hunted for clues following the . burglary at The George and Dragon in the village of Barrowford, . Lancashire. Officers went to arrest Bancroft at . his home and found his fridge full of cooked meat stolen on the same . night from a grocery store. At Burnley Crown Court, Bancroft admitted two charges of burglary and was jailed for two years. The judge Mr Recorder William Smith . told him: 'The stupidity of the offence is highlighted by the fact you . left a blood-stained shirt and your calling card in the form of an . envelope with your name and address on. 'Together with the blood on the carpet, that identified you clearly as being the perpetrator of this burglary.' The court heard Bancroft carried out . the raids just four months after he was given a suspended jail term for . two other burglaries. Last December 15, at 9am, the landlady of The George and Dragon found a window to her private accommodation had been smashed after an intruder had climbed onto a roof and taken a slate. Nothing had been stolen but the landlady found the T-shirt and the blood-stained letter with Bancroft's personal details on it at the back of the pub. Prosecutor Miss Emma Kehoe said: 'Blood was also found on a carpet in the bedroom and it was that that identified the defendant as the offender.' Inquiries revealed he went on to break into the grocery shop on the same night using a brick to smash the window and stole a charity collection box, a meat pie and four kilos of ham. Bancroft later claimed he could not recall either burglary. In mitigation his lawyer Nick Dearing said: 'Both burglaries demonstrate a level of incompetence which showed there was no sophistication at all. He made shambolic attempts to gain entry.' Mr Dearing added: 'He is an intelligent young man who is a fool to find himself in court. It seemed all his offences were committed either after alcohol was consumed or to acquire alcohol. 'He had no recollection of the offences at all and couldn't say whether he had or had not committed then. When presented with the forensic evidence, he conceded he must have committed them.' Mr Dearing said Bancroft, who came from a 'decent family background', presented himself as deeply immature, rather then an entrenched criminal. He added: 'He is terrified of the prospect of a custodial sentence. This will be his first time in custody.'","Max Bancroft broke into pub after being thrown out for drunkenness .

The number of Syrians who have fled the civil war and urgently need help has now topped one million, the United Nations' refugee agency said today. The figure is based on reports from the agency's field offices in neighboring countries that have provided refuge for families fleeing the conflict between forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar Assad and the Free Syrian Army, said Antonio Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. 'With a million people in flight, millions more displaced internally, and thousands of people continuing to cross the border every day, Syria is spiraling towards full-scale disaster,' Guterres said. Scroll down for video . Exodus: A refugee camp in Turkey, near the Syrian border. The UN says more than a million people have fled the bloody civil war and Syria is now heading for disaster . Exodus: Syrian refugees wait to register their names after their arrival at the Al Zaatri refugee camp in the Jordanian city of Mafraq, near the border with Syria . Syria's uprising began in March 2011 with protests against President Bashar Assad's authoritarian rule. When the government cracked down on demonstrators, the opposition took up arms and the conflict turned into a full-blown civil war. The United Nations estimates that more than 70,000 people have been killed. The relentless violence also has devastated many cities and forced hundreds of thousands of Syrians to seek refuge abroad. Guterres said the number of refugees has swelled dramatically this year, with most Syrians pouring into Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. Plume: Smoke rises after shells exploded in the Syrian village of al-Jamlah yesterday. The war has taken an estimated 70,000 lives . The war has escalated in recent months, and more than 400,000 of those people become refugees since the start of 2013. Guterres said the refugees often arrive in neighbouring countries 'traumatised, without possessions and having lost members of their families'. Around half are children, the majority under the age of 11. 'We are doing everything we can to help, but the international humanitarian response capacity is dangerously stretched,' he said. 'This tragedy has to be stopped.' Buildings damaged by combat in Homs. This sort of damage to residential areas has driven people out of the country .

The UN in December estimated that 1.1 million Syrian refugees would arrive in neighboring countries by the end of June this year. Budgeting for the UN's regional response plan are being adjusted in light of the new figures, Guterres added. On Monday Syrian rebels tore down a bronze statue of President Bashar Assad's late father and predecessor as they pushed government troops from most of the northern city of Raqqa. Scores of cheering protesters ripped down the statue in scenes reminiscent of Iraq in 2003, when angry civilians toppled a giant statue of Saddam Hussein. Rebels hold control in parts of several major Syrian cities - several neighborhoods in Aleppo, Homs and Deir el-Zour, as well as suburbs of the capital, Damascus. But if they seize control of Raqqa, it would be the first time an entire city had fallen into the hands of anti-Assad fighters.

Distress: Frances Raftery, 71, said the email she received telling her she was excluded from the NHS protest rally was 'disgusting' A former NHS worker has been excluded from a protest rally to fight the closure of her local casualty unit because she supports UKIP. Frances Raftery, 71, contacted a campaign group to say she would be attending their meeting to help them challenge changes to local NHS services. The widowed grandmother revealed she was a UKIP member, but was left ‘incredibly distressed’ when she received a response  making it clear she would not be welcome at the meeting, being held last night. Karen Reissmann, campaign co-ordinator of Save Bolton Health Services, told Mrs Raftery the group represented ‘multi-cultural’ Britain and was ‘not for scapegoating any part of the community for the problems in the NHS’. Her letter added that they had members ‘across the political spectrum. But concerns have been raised that we do not want to be used by a party that has had no contact in any of our activities in five months we have been in existence’. The controversy is the latest involving claims of discrimination against UKIP members. Last year Rotherham Council was widely criticised for removing three Eastern European children from their foster parents after social services discovered the couple belonged to the anti-EU party. Mrs Raftery, a retired teacher who previously worked in the laundry at the Royal Bolton Hospital where A&E services are under threat, said the response she received was a racist slur against UKIP. ‘I have lived in the same area for most of my life and myself and all of my children and grandchildren have been treated at the hospital at some point during their life,’ she said. ‘I am not racist, regardless of what this group feel about UKIP and I wanted to attend because I am concerned as a local resident. Their response to my courtesy email has been disgusting. ‘If we live in a multi-cultural society then am I not part of that society and should I not be allowed to attend meetings to help protect our local NHS services? ‘Instead I have felt like I have been excluded because of my political beliefs. The fact that I am a UKIP member should not mean my voice is not heard.’ Protest: Mrs Raftery had worked in the laundry at Royal Bolton Hospital where A&E services are under threat . UKIP leader Nigel Farage said: ‘This is another example of the appalling discrimination against UKIP members in the Labour-dominated North of England.’ Deputy leader Paul Nuttall added: ‘The inference in the letter is that we are a racist party, but that is totally untrue. The attitude smacks of the same sort of ill-informed prejudice that led to the Rotherham couple having foster children taken away. ‘The proposed closure of Bolton A&E is a matter that affects local people whatever their political persuasion and it should not be an issue in the protest.’ Bolton West Labour MP Julie Hilling said: ‘It is a great pity when any local protest is politicised in this way. ‘The real issue is the cuts being imposed by the Coalition government. We need all of the community of Bolton to save our much loved and much needed services.’ Miss Reissmann, a former mental health nurse, said: ‘No one has been banned from any group. I passed on concerns that had been raised with me and wanted to let Mrs Raftery know what our group stood for.’ Bolton NHS Foundation Trust, which is trying to save £20million, recently attracted controversy after it stood accused of fiddling figures to mask the numbers of patients dying needlessly.","Frances Raftery, 71, contacted Save Bolton Health Services campaign .

Ready to make her case: The Apprentice winner Stella English arrives at The East London Employment Tribunal for a hearing in which she accuses Lord Sugar of constructive dismissal . Sparks – and four-letter words – flew yesterday as The Apprentice clashed with her former master. Stella English accused Lord Sugar of subjecting her to extraordinary foul-mouthed tirades when she worked for him as her prize for winning the BBC1 reality show. The business tycoon hit back, calling the 34-year-old mother of two ‘suspicious’, ‘cold’ and prone to ‘some very odd conspiracy theories’. The clash occurred during a bitter tribunal battle over Miss English’s failure to keep the £100,000-a-year job she won. She claimed that when she left, he told her ‘I don’t give a s***’ and accused the 65-year-old peer of treating her life like a ‘game show’. During a break in her evidence she burst into tears. Lord Sugar repeatedly shook his head during her evidence and interjected with muttered disagreements. The multi-millionaire, famed for his confrontational boardroom style, remained composed as he read a statement but made no efforts to hide his fury at his former employee. Miss English, 34, is suing Lord Sugar for constructive dismissal after he refused to renew her one-year contract in his business empire. She had been awarded a job with his IT subsidiary Viglen in January 2011 after winning the sixth series of The Apprentice. But she left the company that May, complaining that bosses treated her like an ‘overpaid lackey’. Lord Sugar offered Miss English a new role with YouView, his internet set-top box conglomerate. She claims she felt ‘under pressure’ to accept when he demanded an answer within the hour so he could fend off impending reports in the Daily Mail about her disagreements with Viglen bosses. Scroll down for video . Denial: Lord Sugar (right) has denied the claims and instead said Miss English (left) was an 'untrusting and suspicious person' who was full of 'conspiracy theories' She said: ‘I was under pressure in . the sense that the Daily Mail had been in touch with Lord Sugar and said . they were going to run a story that there had been a big fall-out. Lord . Sugar wanted an answer quickly. ‘He . stipulated a point in time he needed an answer by... so he could get . back to them and say their story was false.’ She left YouView in . September that year. Miss . English told the East London tribunal that junior staff members had been . ordered not to follow her instructions, and claimed: ‘Colleagues would . go silent when I walked into a room.’ She . said she tried to raise her concerns with Lord Sugar in several . meetings, telling him he was wasting his money on her salary as she did . not have enough work. He was unsupportive and told her he only gave her the YouView role to protect his public image and that of the BBC, she claimed. ‘He . said to me: “Look if you think Lord Sugar is s****ing himself and . that’s why you’re here, that’s where you’re mistaken. I don’t give a . s***. I’ve met my obligations to you. I did it for the BBC and the . integrity of the show and a bit of my own PR and a bit of yours too. But . the fact is that I don’t give a s***.” Big gamble: Miss English, 34, (right) gave up a high-flying career in the City when she was named as a semi-finalist on series six of the hit BBC1 show starring Lord Sugar (pictured, left, arriving at the tribunal) 'Yes, I went on a reality TV show. But by then I had thought we were living in the real world, not in a game show.’ Lord Sugar flatly denied many of Miss English’s claims. ‘She . never said “I’m an overpaid lackey”, “You are wasting your money”, “I’m . the butt of everyone’s jokes”. That is a figment of her imagination,’ he said. Miss English had claimed he relayed negative feedback from a senior manager, saying: ‘Nice girl, doesn’t do much.’ But . Lord Sugar said: ‘I deny saying to her that the feedback was “Nice . girl, doesn’t do much”. This is typical of her suspicious nature. In . fact what I said was the feedback was “Nice girl, but she has got a lot . to learn.” Testing relationship: Ms English had to carry out a four-month probationary period before she was eventually named the winner of the show in December 2010 . ‘She was a very . untrusting and suspicious person. She believed everyone was out to trick . her. She came across as very reserved, detached, and some might say . cold. She would come to me with some very odd conspiracy theories.’ Last . year the Daily Mail revealed that Miss English’s fiancé Ray Dewar had . links to gangster Clifford Norris, the father of Stephen Lawrence’s . killer David Norris. Lord Sugar said one of her ’conspiracy theories’ was that this was a deliberate leak. He said Miss English did not work as hard as he had hoped. ‘I . began to wonder whether the idea of work rather than the glamour of . showbusiness was beginning to bite with her. She was earning a lot more . than many of her colleagues. People were bound to be a bit resentful but . it was up to her to earn their respect.’ The tribunal continues.

Her mother Natalie, 29, and great-grandfather Eric Bell, 85, also have their birthdays on March 3 and the trio, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, plan to celebrate their special day together in future.

Baby Phoebe with her mother Natalie Chadwick and great-grandfather Eric Bell, who all share the same birthday . To try to work out how likely it is that three people will share the same birthday, we have to assume that there is an equal probability of being born on any one day of the year.We have to also assume that there are 365 days in a year, not 366 as if it were a leap year.With three people and 365 days, the equation looks like this:1* (365 x 365 x 365) = a 1 in 48,627,125 likelihood of the three birthdays landing on the same day.Probability is given as a value between 0 - that it will not happen at all - and 1, that it will happen.For three people having the same birthday, the probability is 0.00075 per cent - an extremely small probability.

The New York police officer accused of scheming online to kidnap, cook and eat his wife will not testify in his trial, leaving his fate in the hands of the jury, it was revealed today. Yesterday, jurors were forced to watch a video of a woman made to appear to be cooked over an open flame from the Dark Fetish website officer Gilberto Valle used, as the court heard the site has 38,000 members and 4,500 active users. In the final day of testimony yesterday, Valle fought back tears as he told the judge it was 'not his desire' to testify. This is the only time he has spoken during his cannibalism trial since it started on February 25. On trial: Gilberto Valle visited websites containing instructions on how to tie up, 'chloroform' and cook a girl . Cannibal Cop: The former New York City police officer Gilberto Valle, pictured in a courtroom sketch, planned to tie up his wife and watch her bleed to death, he said . Emotional: In the final day of testimony yesterday, Valle fought back tears as he told the judge it was 'not his desire' to testify . The government rested a week after it . began trying to prove that Valle tried to conspire with others on the . Internet to kidnap, kill and cannibalize six women, including friends . and his wife. The evidence, taken from websites devoted to torturing and eating women visited by Officer Gilberto Valle, also included images of women with apples in their mouths and instructions on ‘how to cook a girl’. Public defender Robert Baum said Valle 'started getting emotional' as jurors were shown the Dark Fetish website where Valle met the alleged co-conspirators with whom he engaged in depraved online chats and e-mail exchanges. 'It got him very emotional,' Baum told the New York Post. 'It brought back the whole experience.' Baum also said Valle realized that 'the trial is finally coming to a conclusion and his fate is in the jury’s hands. And that’s a heavy weight for someone to bear'. Since the trial's start last week, jurors have heard excerpts read aloud from dozens of Internet chats and emails in which Valle talked with others about murdering and eating women. Those women included his estranged wife, Kathleen Mangan-Valle. Out of two dozen plots involving women, at least three were real, prosecutors contended. Defense lawyers said their client's cyber-plots were 'pure fiction', no more dangerous than a Stephen King novel or a horror movie. Earlier, FBI computer forensics . examiner Stephen Flatly testified Valle frequently visited websites . showing women being tortured, including one that offered images of women . who did not survive. ‘Some are dead. A couple of them appeared to have been strangled,’ he said. As Mr Flatly described the images . displayed on video monitors in federal court in Manhattan, shocked . jurors put hands to their mouths and displayed other signs of distress.

An undated photo submitted as evidence shows Gilberto Valle with his daughter. Valle is accused of conspiracy to kidnap a woman and unauthorized use of a law enforcement database that prosecutors say he used to help build a list of potential targets . The video showed to the jury, which . was found by the FBI on Valle’s computer, is apparently staged and shows . a naked, screaming woman hanging over an open flame. Two images of naked women roasting on a . giant spit were discovered in a computer file of several dozen . photographs that Valle kept on a former college friend whom prosecutors . have identified as a target of the alleged plot. The face of one woman prosecutors say he targeted was cut out and pasted onto a cartoon of a woman being boiled in a pot. Prosecutors also had wanted to present . as many as 34 exhibits of even more ghastly images found on Valle's . computer depicting women being tortured, dead bodies and body parts. They include a picture of a dead body . with the feet cut off which Valle's wife testified she saw when she went . to one of his favorite sites and discovered why he stayed up late . online. However U.S. District Judge Paul . Gardephe ruled they were not admissible because they were automatically . stored in cache files on Valle's computer. ‘What we don't have is proof that he ever saw the images here,’ he said at the start of the second week of the trial.

On trial: In this courtroom sketch, Gilberto Valle is seen in federal court in New York as his wife, Kathleen Mangan testifies . However, the judge permitted the . screenshots of Valle's Internet searches about cannibalism as well as . proof that the officer looked up articles written about the rape and . murder of a young woman and others about a 15-year-old girl who was . kidnapped and murdered in California. The browsing history also showed that . an article titled ‘Cannibalism can be addictive, expert says’ and . Facebook pages of alleged targets were viewed. As soon as the government finished, . defense lawyers asked the judge to acquit their client, saying . prosecutors failed to present sufficient evidence to let a jury decide . whether Valle planned to carry out a crime. A judge reserved decision. Defense attorney Julia Gatto said it has not yet been decided whether . the officer will testify. Earlier in the trial, prosecutors . claimed the 28-year-old was involved in online chats with a Pakistani . man to whom he offered his ex wife for meat. At Manhattan Federal Court last week, . testimony by FBI Agent Corey Walsh outlined an an online chat between . Valle and a man named Aly Khan last year, where Khan said he 'would love . to slaughter a girl and make her meat'. Valle, who met Khan on a website for . people who fantasise about eating human flesh, wrote that he was 'trying . to pick out a girl who i can send over'. He added: 'I can talk my girlfriend into going to India,' where Walsh said Aly Khan claimed to live. Testimony: Kathleen Mangan, pictured right as she's driven away from court on Monday . Warped: The websites visited by Valle contained images of women with apples in their mouths . Prosecution case: A passage of a Federal complaint filed in New York against Valle . He was referencing Kathleen Mangan, the . woman who would become Valle’s wife about six months later and informed . police about her husband's sexual fantasies after she found material on . his laptop. The pair have a baby daughter. They go on to talk about 'humiliating' Mangan, taking turns raping her and then slaughtering her together. Valle, 28, has been held without bail . since his October arrest. Throughout the trial, his lawyers have . attacked government evidence as nothing more than a man fantasizing with . like-minded people. The government has conceded that Valle never met . the purported Internet co-conspirators and that no women were harmed. Jurors have heard testimony from . Valle's estranged wife and from former classmates and other women who . said they knew Valle on a casual basis and never considered him . dangerous. Their testimony was followed by evidence that all of them . were the subjects of emails and chats describing how they could be . snatched away and eaten.

The girl is understood to have had tantrums at school before, but when Jmyha became too much for school staffers to handle, the police were called. Scroll down for video . Excessive? Jmyha Rickman, a student at Lovejoy Elementary School in Alton, Illinois, was hauled off to jail after she threw a fit in a classroom yesterday morning . Restrained: Jmyha, pictured with her guardian Nehemiah Keeton, demonstrates how she was handcuffed behind her back . An officer responded to the school, where he handcuffed Jmyha and stuffed her into the back of his squad car. She was then taken to the Alton Police Department, where she was allegedly held in a jail cell for two hours. Jmyha's guardian, Nehemiah Keeton, told KMOV-TV: 'Her eyes were swollen from her crying and her wrists had welts on them and they cuffed her feet too. He added that the tantrum started because 'she asked to use the restroom several times and was ignored.' Kristie Baumgartner, assistant . superintendent of the Alton School District, told MailOnline that she . could not comment on specifics of the incident, citing Illinois privacy . laws regarding children. Confinement: Jmyha was taken to the Alton Police Department, pictured, where she says she was put into a cell . However, she outlined school district policy, which says that if a student is at risk of harming themselves or others, police would be called if the child's parent or guardian refuses to pick them up. Alton police told the station that Jmyha was placed in a juvenile detention room and was supervised the whole time. The department also claimed that the girl was out of control and tearing up two classrooms - and the officer believes he did the right thing. But Mr Keeton contends that the girl’s tantrum was met with excessive force. He told KMOV: 'This is something that I don’t feel like any 7 or 8 year old - I mean,  she didn't have a weapon threatening to harm anybody.'

Rarely-seen pictures of a 21-year-old Elvis Presley in the beginning of his career show all stars start somewhere, even the King of rock 'n' roll, . Taken by photographer Alfred Wertheimer during Elvis' time on the road in 1956, the snaps show that despite his tender years, he already had his legendary movements and Brylcreem hairdo figured out. Mr Wertheimer, now 83, caught the would-be King's more intimate moments as he records his music, performs on tour and sneaks a kiss with a young fan backstage. A star is born: A 21-year-old Elvis 'kisses' young fan Barbara Gray just before going on stage at the the Mosque Theatre Richmond, Virginia, in June 1956 . Taken shortly after the legend had been signed by record company RCA Victor, some of the black and white snaps for . the new book include a 21-year-old Elvis and a young fan sharing a tender moment just before he goes on stage. The famous photograph - known as 'The Kiss' - was taken without Elvis' or the young woman's knowledge and had become one of the most iconic of the King in his early years. The fresh-faced singer actually touches the blonde girl's tongue with his in the spontaneous moment. 'I never bothered to ask her name,' German-born Wertheimer said in a Vanity Fair interview about 'The Kiss' in 2011. 'And she never bothered to tell me.' In fact the buxom blonde is Barbara Gray, or Bobbi Owens as she was known back then, a young woman to whom Elvis had spoken over the phone and had arranged to meet in Richmond. Young Elvis: The King performing for StageShow in March 1956 photographed by Alfred Wertheimer who was commissioned to take publicity shots of the, then unknown, new star . Making history: Elvis already had his signature moves down to a T when he performed at the age of 21 on stage at the Mosque Theatre Richmond, Virginia, in June 1956 . Love me tender: Rare colour shot of Elvis recording Don't Be Cruel at RCA Victor's studios on July 2, 1956, from the new book revealing images from the very earliest days of the King of rock 'n' roll as his legend was born . When they met in person, they spent . the day together, and Mr Wertheimer captured it all, photographing them . flirting and being playful in the back seat of a taxi. Later that day, Mr Wertheimer grew concerned when he found he had lost Elvis just before the show was about to start. As he walked around the theatre . looking for him, he saw two figures at the end of a dark, narrow hallway . - the future rock star, and his date for the day. He thought about letting the two have . their private moment, but then thought better of it, saying 'the worst . that can happen is that he’ll ask me to leave'. Speaking in 2011, Mr Wertheimer said . he was never asked about all the pictures he took that day until 19 . years later, when Elvis was found dead in his Graceland mansion. He told the Today Show: 'The day he died, Time magazine called me and asked me to bring all my photos over immediately.' Among those photos was 'The Kiss'. Despite the closeness evident in the . photos, Mrs Gray, 75, said she didn't have as much attraction to the . singer as he did for her, and she never saw him again. 'Maybe he had sparks, but I never even knew who he was.' Another image taken a few minutes . later shows Elvis on stage, kneeling down on his left knee while singing . into the microphone as he wows the audience who had never seen or heard . anything like it before. Another photo taken on March 17, 1956 - . about two months after he was signed - is of Elvis performing for . American TV's Stage Show. In it, he is depicted holding an acoustic guitar while singing into the microphone and displaying his famous lip-curl. Over 400 photos, many of which have . never been seen before, are being published in the new book entitled . 'Elvis and the Birth of Rock and Roll' which has been produced by . London-based Taschen. A spokesman for the publishers said: . ‘Alfred worked with Elvis on his very first tour before his fame took . off and tighter controls were put on images of him. ‘Alfred had unprecedented and unlimited access to Elvis and was able to get so many candid shots. ‘Some of the photos are well known but others haven't been seen before. ‘We have wanted to work with Alfred . for some time now. We have used his original negatives and made them as . high resolution as possible for the book.’ Elvis Presley died on August 16, 1977, from a heart attack after battling prescription drug abuse.

Detective Constable Steven Barnes, . from Derbyshire Police, told Nottingham Crown Court that Michael . Philpott said: 'I just can’t believe this is happening' when he was . arrested along with his wife Mairead over the fatal house fire at their . three-bedroom house in Allenton, Derby, last May. Philpott cried in the dock this . morning as the constable read out his interview with police on April 29 . following his arrest for the fire which claimed the lives of his . children on May 11. A jury heard Michael Philpott, pictured with wife Mairead Philpott, said: 'I just can¿t believe this is happening' when he was arrested . At the start of the interview at . Ripley police station, Philpott told Det Con Barnes: 'I just can’t . believe this is happening. I don’t think you understand what it is like . losing six children,' the court heard. Describing the night of the fire, Philpott told Det Con Barnes he and his wife had been woken up by the downstairs smoke alarm. Philpott said he did not see any flames when he went into the living room, just a 'bright light'. He told the constable he did not know . there was a fire until flames and black smoke 'shot' out through the . living room doorway, Det Con Barnes told the court. Philpott told the constable he tried . several times to smash the window into his daughter Jade’s back bedroom . but could not get into the house. 'This horrible thing, I dream it every night,' he told the police officer. Deadly blaze: Philpott surrounded by the six children whose lives were claimed by the fatal house fire last May . He told Det Con Barnes he dreamed about not being able to get into his daughter’s bedroom and that he felt 'far away' from her. 'I smashed the windows about five . times. I wish now I’d got in. It would have been me in that morgue and . not my kids,' Philpott said, the court heard. During the interview, Philpott told . officers the day before the fire had gone as normal with him taking the . children to school then playing snooker with Paul Mosley at the house . before going to bed with Mairead in the conservatory. Scene: Flowers are left outside the house where the children died in the fire . Six siblings died as a result of the . fire on May 11 - Jade, 10, and brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, . six and Jayden, five, died during the blaze. Their brother Duwayne, 13, was taken . to Derby Royal Hospital and transferred to Birmingham Children’s . Hospital, but died three days later. Their parents, Mick and Mairead . Philpott, and a third defendant, Paul Mosley, 46, are on trial over the . deaths of the children. They have each denied six counts of . manslaughter. The prosecution claim the children’s . deaths were the result of a botched 'plan' to frame 56-year-old . Philpott’s former mistress, Lisa Willis. The court has heard how Miss Willis, . 29, left the home she had shared with the couple and their six children . in February, taking her five children with her. The jury has been told Philpott and . Miss Willis were due to face each other at a court hearing over access . to the five children, four of which he had fathered, on the day of the . blaze. Philpott said the children had been . distressed by the departure of Miss Willis and her children. He told the . constable that usually Jessie, John and Jack shared the front bedroom . of the three-bedroom house. Duwyane and Jayden shared one of the back bedrooms, while Jade was in the second, Philpott told the officer. But after Miss Willis left, Philpott . said, the children often swapped rooms because they were upset and . missed the other children, the court heard. He said on the night of the fire he . and Mairead had left the house to get some weed for Mosley, who looked . after the children while they were gone. He told the police none of them smoked it once they returned to the house at around 10pm. Accused: Mick Philpott, pictured with Mairead Philpott and another woman, is alleged to have 'gone on' about wanting a bigger house, the court heard yesterday . The policeman said Philpott explained . that Miss Willis and her children had lived with him and his wife and . that they had shared a three-way relationship until she left in . February, taking her five children with her. 'I treated Lisa like she was a queen. For the past four years I have given her all my attention and not my . wife,' Philpott told him. He said he had no idea why Miss Willis had left the house. 'At first I blamed Mairead for a bit, . then I realised it was down to Lisa. She didn’t want Mairead to be . mother to her kids anymore. Covert: A prison van carrying Michael and Mairead Philpott (pictured) contained recording equipment but the defence say their voices were muffled by the sound of the engine . Audio: The Jury also heard a tape of a desperate 999 call made by the couple during the fire that claimed the lives of six children upstairs . 'Mairead brought them children up, not . Lisa. I wanted my kids back, my kids are everything to me, my kids are . my life, you don’t understand that,' Philpott said during the interview. In a further interview on May 30, . Philpott warned police that they might find traces of petrol on his . clothing and Duwayne’s and also in the house. He said his petrol strimmer had been . brought through the house by him and his eldest son in the days before . the fire for a neighbour to borrow. The constable went on to ask Philpott whether he was responsible for the fire at his house. 'Watch these eyes - categorically no. Nor was my wife,' Philpott told him. When asked how he knew petrol was used in the fire, Philpott claimed the police had told him. Evidence: Police revealed that when Mr Philpott visited his son Duwayne in Birmingham Children's Hospital he collapsed when he heard he might not survive . Fall: Philpott, pictured with his wife Mairead, also passed out after a press conference in Derby (pictured) 'I knew on the morning of the press conference, before I even went in,' he said in the interview. When he was told the police had not told him, Philpott claimed he had heard from locals that it had been petrol. 'You made an assumption it was petrol?' Dc Barnes asked him. 'Yeah, we assumed it was petrol,' Philpott replied. When asked about the hearing with Miss . Willis regarding residency of her five children, he said he believed he . was going to win custody of the youngsters. 'We thought we were going to win the children,' Philpott told the constable. He said he and his wife had received death threats from Miss Willis and her family and that he had reported these to the police. Later in the interview, Philpott told . police: 'You’ve got to believe me. Me and my wife had nothing to do with . that fire. Nothing.' When police asked him about two fire . extinguishers in the kitchen, Philpott replied: 'I didn’t think about . water, I didn’t think about fire extinguishers. I just thought about . getting in to my children.' He added: 'I couldn’t try any harder to get into the house to my children. My kids are the most important thing in my life.'

Older people with diabetes are suffering needless life-changing complications, including amputations and blindness, because of discrimination in favour of younger patients, a new report has warned. Half of the diabetics in the UK are over the age of 60, yet they are being denied the proper care and aggressive treatment which is routinely given to younger patients, experts say. This discrimination then leads to complications such as blindness and kidney failure - costing the NHS £9.8 billion a year - according to the Institute of Diabetes for Older People (IDOP) report launched today. Older diabetics are suffering needless life-changing complications, including amputations and blindness, because they are not getting the best treatment, experts warn . Yet within the next seven years, 60 per cent of diabetics will be over 60 and if nothing is done, more beds will be taken by elderly patients with the associated rising costs, the IDOP report says. In fact, the crisis in health care threatens to bankrupt the already overstretched NHS, it says. Earlier this week, shocking figures revealed that one in 20 Britons is suffering from diabetes as a result of soaring obesity rates. Some 132,000 patients were found to have the condition in the last year, adding to the 2,912,000 existing sufferers in 2011. This brings the total to 3.04million – 4.6 per cent of the UK population – compared with 2.2million six years ago. And a further 850,000 people are thought to have undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, according to analysis of official data by Diabetes UK charity and Tesco. The soaring rate of type 2 – which mostly affects middle-aged people – is being blamed on obesity. Blindness is one of the most common consequences of diabetes if the condition is not managed properly . Nine out of ten people with diabetes . have type 2, which occurs when the body gradually loses the ability to . process blood sugar, which can damage the organs and lead to years of . ill health. Complications of diabetes include diabetic retinopathy - the leading cause of blindness in the UK - nerve damage, kidney disease, heart disease and even the need for the amputation, as ulcers in the foot can become severely infected. In the last few years, retinopathy has increased by 118 per cent, stroke by 87 per cent, kidney failure by 56 per cent and cardiac failure by 43 per cent. And it is estimated that of more than 100 amputations carried out each week from diabetes complications, up to 80 per cent are preventable. Professor Alan Sinclair, Director at Institute of Diabetes for Older People (IDOP) said: 'It’s a tragedy that so many elderly people suffer these complications when they could be so easily prevented if they were given the care and treatment that they need.' Older patients with diabetes complications currently occupy 15 per cent of all hospital beds. Professor Sinclair predicts that by 2030, this figure will rocket to one in four hospital beds, costing taxpayers £465.25 million per year - the equivalent of 1.34 million diabetes bed days. He added: 'If nothing is done now to improve the care of older people with type 2 diabetes, the effect on patients and the NHS could be catastrophic - the impending diabetes time bomb could potentially bankrupt the already stretched service.' In order to ensure older people with type 2 diabetes receive better care, the institute has launched new guidelines in the form of user-friendly recommendations for doctors, nurses and care home managers who work with or care for older people with diabetes. The guidelines have been developed to address care gaps highlighted in previous studies. Prof Sinclair said: 'In the past, some clinical guidelines have ignored the issues faced by older people with diabetes such as frailty, functional ability and increased dependency, focusing mainly on the needs of the young, and consequently older people have missed out on preventive treatments and suffered blindness and limb amputation as a result in some cases.'","Half of the diabetics in the UK are over 60, yet are 'not getting proper care'

Mastermind: Maria Loureiro has been jailed for 45 months after pleading guilty to conspiring to assist unlawful immigration . When the blushing bride failed to recall the name of the groom she was marrying, it raised a few eyebrows. But when it emerged the couple could barely communicate because they did not share a common language, it was downright suspicious. Last night 11 people were behind bars after a sham marriage racket was smashed. It was masterminded by Portuguese-born Maria Loureiro, 54, who styled herself as a matchmaker and wedding fixer. The former teacher used her contacts to fly in nine women from Lisbon to marry nine Indian men at register offices in Blackburn, Wrexham and Chester, and was said to have made £27,000. The men had all entered Britain legally but their visas had expired or were due to, and they faced having to return to India. By marrying a European Union citizen in the UK they would have been given the right to remain in the country. The Indian men were contacted by a middleman who agreed to provide them with brides for a fee and the women were then flown into the UK. They had never left Portugal before. Loureiro provided them with false documents, wage slips, national insurance numbers and utility bills and arranged the weddings. The ‘brides’ wore traditional Indian clothing jewellery, and held a bunch of flowers. The day after the ceremony the women flew back to Portugal, while the men made formal citizenship applications to the Home Office. The racket was smashed after Loureiro was seen at a number of ceremonies acting as an interpreter. She gave false names and on one occasion wore a blonde wig. Staff at the Blackburn and Darwen register office became suspicious and raised the alarm with the UK Border Agency. Agency staff watched as Loureiro met bogus brides arriving at Liverpool John Lennon Airport. Strangers: One of the bogus ceremonies at Blackburn register office in July last year . They also saw her meeting prospective grooms who paid between £6,500 and £9,000 for the bogus marriages. Nick Wood of the UK Border Agency said: ‘We set up surveillance outside Blackburn register office. When they came out the groom would get in the front of the car and the bride in the back, there was no intimacy. ‘On one occasion the bride didn’t know the groom’s name.’ The Border Agency carried out raids at homes in Bolton and Loureiro’s London home last year and arrested the nine bogus bridegrooms. Behind bars: Among those jailed today were Yunusbhai Yakubbhai Duka and Sajauddin Badruddin Mansuri, who were both sentenced to 16 months . Jailed: Amjadhushen Dilavar Patel and Mehulkumar Arunbhai Patel were both sentenced to 16 months . At Manchester Crown Court, Loureiro said she moved to England with her husband and two children and joined the racket after her marriage broke down. She was jailed for 45 months after she pleaded guilty to conspiring to assist unlawful immigration. Company director Ilias Neki, 46, the conduit between the Indian men and Loureiro, admitted similar charges and was jailed for 32 months. Sajauddin Mansuri, 27 was sentenced to 16 months. Mehulkumar Patel, 23, to 16 months, Yunusbhai Duka, 30, to 16 months, Faisal Chand, 25, to 15 months, Inayathussain Tailor, 26, to 16 months, Bhavesh Bapodora, 22, to 18 months, Amjadhushen Patel to 16 months, Safvan Mirja, 23, to 16 months, Mitesh Panjari, 25, to 13 months and two weeks.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . UPDATED: . 01:45 EST, 16 August 2011 . The legend of Davy Crockett, the buckskin-clad 'King of the Wild Frontier,' has been cast into doubt by new claims that his fabled last stand at the Alamo may have only lasted 20 minutes. For 175 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events. Celebrated in song, story and cinema, the story of heroism against all the odds helped define the young nation's pursuit of liberty. Myth or reality? Actor John Wayne, left, as Davy Crockett in the 1960 classic western The Alamo. A new book has cast doubt on the legend of the fort's heroic defense . But, according to a new book, the brave last stand depicted by Hollywood stars like John Wayne was a myth. In . reality, author Phillip Thomas Tucker claimed many of the Americans who . died at the Alamo were cut down as they tried to escape from the . besieged garrison after a surprise pre-dawn attack. The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March . 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days . against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa . Anna. The leaders of the . group included Crockett, already famous as a frontiersman, storyteller . and crack shot, and James Bowie, known for his distinctive knife. Last stand: Mexican soldiers advance on the fort at the Alamo in the 1960 film . It has long been part of the Alamo legend that Crockett died fighting. The legend was firmly established by . the 1955 Disney TV show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty . rifle as the hordes of Mexican soldiers closed in for the kill. But in his book, 'Exodus from the Alamo,' Dr Tucker painted a much less glamorous ending. Using recently discovered Mexican accounts of the battle, the historian wrote that the defenders of the Alamo in the war for Texan independence did not die defending their garrison under brilliant sunlight. Instead, the Mexicans launched a surprise pre-dawn attack, climbing the walls under cover of darkness and causing mayhem in the fort while most of its defenders were still asleep. Bowie is rumoured to have been bayoneted in his bed. According to a diary kept by Colonel . Jose Enrique de la Pena, an officer in Santa Anna's army, Crocket was . captured with a handful of others and executed. Although the accuracy of the diary is disputed, he claimed Crocket and his fellow prisoners were hacked to death with swords. And most of the Mexican casualties inflicted within the fort were said to be the result of 'friendly fire.' Evidence? The bound manuscript of Lieutenant Colonel Jose Enrique de la Pena, who fought at the Alamo. The contentious account claims Mexican soldiers captured Crockett and several others and hacked them to death . Dr Tucker claimed the myth grew over the years because Americans preferred to ignore the Mexican version of the battle in favour of a more heroic ending. 'A culture of chauvinism disregarded the accounts of the Mexicans. The power of the myth was so strong it transcended the truth,' he said. He said his research showed the battle may have only lasted 20 minutes. It was 'but a small affair,' wrote the general who led the final assault. Publishers Casemate said the book has received a hostile reception in Texas, where the story is said to embody the spirit of the state. American hero: A contemporary picture of Davy Crockett . Born 1786 of Irish, Scottish, French and English descent, David 'Davy' Crockett grew up in east Tennessee. He . ran away from home aged 13 and did not return until he was nearly 16 . after three years, in which he claimed to have roamed across Tennessee . and learned his skills as a backwoodsman. During . the 1813 Creek War, a conflict between Indian tribes and U.S. forces, . Crockett was made a scout because of his hunting abilities, he is said . to have supported the starving troops with game. He was eventually discharged from service in 1814 but was elected Lieutenant Colonel in the Tennessee Militia on March 27, 1818. In . 1826 Crockett was elected to the United States House of Representatives . as a Jacksonian. As a Congressman, Crockett supported the rights of . squatters, who were barred from buying land in the West without already . owning property. He . also opposed President Andrew Jackson's Indian Removal Act, which sought . to evict Native Americans from swathes of the country. Disillusioned with U.S. politics, Crockett left his home in Tennessee in 1835 to join the Texan uprising against Mexican rule. On . January 14, 1836, Crockett and 65 other men signed an oath to the . Provisional Government of Texas saying: 'I have taken the oath of . government and have enrolled my name as a volunteer and will set out for . the Rio Grande in a few days with the volunteers from the United . States.' Crockett . arrived at the Alamo on February 8. To the surprise of the men . garrisoned there, on February 23 a Mexican army, arrived and laid seige. All that is certain . about the fate of David Crockett is that he died at the Alamo on March 6 . when Mexican soldiers overran the fort.","Americans cut down trying to escape pre-dawn attack .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:33 EST, 5 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:36 EST, 5 March 2013 . Expecting: Former prison guard Nancy Gonzalez poses on Facebook, showing off her baby bump as she prepares to give birth to the child of convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson . A 29-year-old prison guard who became pregnant during an affair with convicted cop-killer Ronnell Wilson, tested positive for cocaine, prosecutors at her arraignment said today. Nancy Gonzales' lawyer admitted that she took the drug before her arrest in February to deal with 'stress', the attorney told Brooklyn Federal magistrate Judge James Orenstein in New York. The eight-months pregnant former Metropolitan Detention Center guard, who was charged with having unlawful sex with an inmate, was asked to be put in a treatment program today after failing the drugs test, The New York Post reported. Gonzales' defense lawyer Anthony Ricco said: 'She admitted that she had a relapse and she used cocaine prior to her being arrested.' He added that she took the drug because of 'stress caused by her impending arrest and her personal circumstances.' She has a previous history of drug abuse and tested positive to a test in 2011 which was taken by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Ricco blamed her youth and stress for the incident and said she intends to raise her child fully. Gonzales is facing 15 years in prison after being arrested on suspicion that she . had hatched a plot with Ronnell Wilson to help save his life. The convicted killer . allegedly impregnated Gonzales in a plot to avoid the death penalty and had been so desperate to father a child . that he offered to confess to the murders of two detectives, according to his . former lawyer. Attorney Ephraim Savitt said that in 2006, his then-client . Ronell Wilson was poised to accept a plea deal as part of which he would accept . responsibility for the 2003 slayings of undercover detectives Rodney Andrews . and James Nemorin and be sentenced to a life in prison. Illegal liaison: Federal prison guard Nancy Gonzalez, left, was arrested after police say she had an illicit affair with convicted cop killer Ronell Wilson, right, and became pregnant with his baby to save him from execution . Explanation: Gonzalez allegedly said in a recorded phone conversation that she was 'vulnerable' when she decided to start a relationship with Wilson in a bid to give him some 'hope' 'Wilson advised me that he would take the life deal — as . long as he could have conjugal visits — because he was determined to leave this . earth with a child of his own, to give his wasted life some meaning, Savitt . told the New York Post. For Wilson to be . allowed to meet with women behind . bars, he would have had to be sent to a state prison, but his former . attorney . said that the negotiations with the prosecution never went that far . because Attorney general Alberto Gonzalez rejected the proposed . agreement. Sources told the newspaper in February that during his tryst with . Gonzalez last year, Wilson was also placing 'romantic' phone calls with three . other women from behind bars. In the aftermath of Gonzalez’s arrest on suspicion that she . had hatched a plot with Wilson to help save his life, the father of one of the . slain officers, Rodney Andrews, spoke out against the idea that his son's . killer should be shown leniency just because he got the woman pregnant. 'Put him to death for what he did,' Rodney Andrews Sr told New . York Daily News. 'If he had 20 children, it wouldn't change my mind.' The 72-year-old father went on to say that Ms Gonzalez does . not deserve any mercy either. Change of heart: On her MySpace page, Gonzalez summed up her attitude toward children thus: 'Love kids, but not for me' On her Facebook page, Gonzalez posted a photo last month depicting herself proudly showing off her swollen pregnant belly in a tight yellow T-shirt with the world 'Love' printed across the front. Interestingly enough, on her MySpace page, the 29-year-old described her attitude towards children thus: 'Love kids, but not for me.' Gonzalez was arrested on . charges she intentionally had sex with Ronell Wilson while working the . night shift at the Metropolitan Detention Center, which is against the . law. She became pregnant in June, a few months into the affair, . according to court papers. Wilson . was a young gang member when he was convicted in the point-blank . shootings of two undercover officers in an illegal gun sting gone awry. ‘I took a chance because I was so vulnerable and wanted to be loved and now I am carrying his child,’ Gonzalez said, according to court papers. Wilson was sentenced to death in the killing of officers Rodney Andrews and James Nemorin, but the sentence was thrown out in 2010 by an appeals court. Victims: Detectives James Nemorin, left, and Rodney Andrews, right, were gunned down by Wilson during a drug bust gone awry in Staten Island in 2003 . Legal complications: Wilson's death sentence was thrown out after an appeals court found that a prosecutor had vilified the convicted killer . A new jury must decide his fate. But . replay of the trial's penalty phase has been put off as Wilson's lawyers . seek to convince a judge that he's ineligible for the death penalty . because he is mentally disabled. Gonzales, who is eight months pregnant, was taken into custody at her Long Island home, New York Daily News reported. She could face 15 years in prison if convicted. According . to a complaint, Wilson and Gonzales' scheme to help the convicted . killer escape capital punishment was revealed by prison informants. According . to one inmate, he witnessed the female guard moving away . from Wilson's cell door while he was standing there with his pants down. The complaint was made public and cited by CBS New York stated that the inmate and guard had sex in a vacant activity room while Gonzalez was supposed to be checking up on prisoners. The two were caught on video talking or hours at her desk in the kitchen. Military career: Before taking a job as a federal corrections officer, Gonzalez served in the U.S. Army . One of many: While carrying on an affair with Gonzalez, pictured, Wilson was allegedly wooing three other women from behind bars . The corrections officer came clean about her affair with Wilson, which lasted between March and August 2012, in a taped phone conversation with her boyfriend, who is serving time in a state prison. Gonzalez allegedly said she 'kind of got sucked into his world' and 'why not give him a child as far as giving him some kind of hope. 'I can’t explain it. I know what’s to come. I know what is going to be said about me,' Gonzalez allegedly said. 'I know that for me as a parent, how am I going to explain this to this little boy?' It remains unknown what effect the uncovered plot will have on Wilson's mental retardation claim. He still faces life in prison or death by lethal injection. 'If this was done by design, it's not the actions of a person who is mentally retarded,' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives Endowment Association. 'It's a devious plot to avoid the death penalty.' Insanity claim: Wilson's defense attorney argued that he cannot be executed because he is mentally handicapped . Wilson was found guilty in December 2006 of shooting detectives James Nemorin, 36, and Rodney Andrews, 34, in the back of their heads in a car March 10, 2003 in Staten Island. The following year, he was sentenced to death, making him the first federal defendant in New York to face capital punishment since 1954. However, an appeals court reversed the sentence in 2010 claiming than a prosecutor violated Wilson's constitutional rights by making him out to be a villain. Raymond Patterson, a noted psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the prosecution, told the New York Post that while Wilson suffers from anti-social personality disorder, he is not mentally handicapped.","Prison guard Nancy Gonzales' lawyer admitted she took the drug before her arrest in February .

The troubled holiday firm is to close 195 stores in Britain as part of a three-year plan to transform its fortunes. The 172-year-old company said jobs at its head offices at Peterborough and Preston were also at risk, and that it would close its Accrington office. Job losses: 2,500 workers are to be axed at holidays group Thomas Cook after it revealed plans to close 195 of its high street travel agencies . Thomas Cook also has offices in Egham in Surrey, Brighton, and Birkenshaw in West Yorkshire. It has already closed 168 stores and shed 1,100 workers in recent years as customers have tightened their belts and spent less on foreign holidays. It has also battled the euro crisis, high fuel costs and unrest in key destinations such as Egypt and Greece. A spokesman for Thomas Cook insisted it would maintain a ‘strong presence on the high street’. He added that the stores earmarked for closure did not meet performance targets or were in areas where the group has more than one retail outlet. The company slumped to a £590million loss in its last financial year and wants to slash costs. Changes: Bosses say that jobs and shops must go to make the business more profitable . Having been forced to turn to its banks for an additional £200million of loans in 2011, the UK’s second-biggest travel company has already trimmed its airline fleet and sold off hotels. Many of the stores being closed in the latest cutbacks are Co-operative Travel stores. Thomas Cook and the Co-op merged their high street businesses in 2011. UK chief executive Peter Fankhauser said yesterday: ‘We firmly believe these proposals will mean a better, more profitable Thomas Cook that continues to be a major employer in the UK.’ He added that Thomas Cook was planning to open its travel agencies on bank holidays and Sundays, while also potentially extending opening hours during the week in an effort to meet customer demand. Historic: Thomas Cook's travel agents on the Strand, London, in 1959, when it was at the height of its popularity . Powerful: Thomas Cook's store in Kensington in 1992, but since then it has struggled and been forced to close many shops . Stores will likewise be better staffed in peak trading times, such as lunch hours. But he confirmed this will mean changes in working patterns for many of its retail staff. Group chief executive Harriet Green, who took over last May, has been busy trying to transform the group. Visionary: Thomas Cook, the Victorian founder of the Thomas Cook travel empire created the and redefined the package holiday . She has boosted the firm’s finances following a series of disposals to slash its £1.5billion debt mountain, including the sale of its Indian business and several Spanish hotels. Oliver Richardson, of the union Unite, said the job cuts were ‘a devastating blow for Thomas Cook staff across the retail network’. He added: ‘It is yet another dark day for Britain’s high streets.’ The Transport Salaried Staffs . Association, which represents employees, said it was 'shocked and angry' at the scale of the job losses. General . secretary Manuel Cortes said: 'This constant policy of slash and burn, . with the axing of one in four stores and the loss of jobs, is simply . self-defeating. 'The company needs new products if it to come to come to terms with the age of the internet and prosper in the 21st century. 'That . is the only way to stop this spiral of decline which repeated bad . management decisions over the past five years has led them.' Earlier this week Thomas Cook said it had decided not to sell its under-performing French business and would instead kick off a restructuring programme to turn the unit around. Thomas Cook last month reported reduced first-quarter operating losses and said its turnaround plan was on track. Shares in Thomas Cook, which have risen 78 percent so far this year, were 0.3 percent up at 85.6 pence by 1225 GMT, valuing the business at around £777million. Bygone era: The company was set up in 1841 by . cabinet maker Thomas Cook for railway trips for the temperance movement . in the East Midlands and grew into one of Britain's biggest brands . Package: Britons on a Thomas Cook tour of Egypt in the late 19th century climb a pyramid . Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook UK and . Ireland’s CEO, said: 'It is never easy to make decisions that impact . directly on our people, but we also owe it to our customers to shape the . business effectively and ensure that, when they book their holiday with . us, our administrative costs are as low as possible. 'As we improve and develop our online . capabilities, maintaining a strong presence on the High Street is an . important part of our omni-channel strategy. Even after these changes we . will still have one of the largest retail networks in UK travel. 'It is essential that we operate with . the right number of people as we move forward into the next era for our . company, allowing us to meet the future needs of our customers more . effectively.  These proposals will mean a stronger Thomas Cook that . continues to be a major employer in the UK dedicated to providing . excellent holiday experiences to our 23 million customers. 'We are in consultation with our . Unions and employee representative bodies to minimise the impact of . these changes and I am speaking personally to all employees today to . provide information and support through this period of consultation.' Meanwhile more than 500 people working . for bed company Dreams could lose their jobs because a rescue deal to . save the bust business will not save all its stores. Under threat: A deal to save Dreams has been set up but it means 90 stores will shut, costing 500 people their jobs . Sun European, which already owns sofa . chain SCS Upholstery, will buy 170 high street shops and take on 1,600 . staff, with the remaining 90 showrooms set to be axed by administrators . Ernst & Young. There are also fears that the chain's head office in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, could be at risk under the £35 million deal. It is another blow to the battered high street, which has recently seen the closure of all Comet and Jessops stores and a number of HMV and Blockbuster shops after a spate of high-profile administrations. Private equity firm Exponent acquired Dreams from its founder Mike Clare in 2008 in a deal worth more than £200 million. It is thought that Mr Clare wanted to win back the business and keep every shop open, but was thwarted. Mr Clare worked for several furniture firms before setting up a sofa bed shop in Uxbridge, Middlesex, in 1986. Upset: Mike Clare, founder of Dreams, who sold the business for £200m in 2008, says he has tried to save the company . The father-of-four remortgaged his home with his wife to start the business.

The extraordinary number of football players suffering from brain damage has rocked the NFL - but the league's boss is worried that the scandal could go even further. Commissioner Roger Goodell has apparently admitted that a player could die in the middle of the game, and is 'terrified' that such an incident could wreck the sport's reputation for ever. The NFL chief is now working with players, team owners and even the Army in a desperate attempt to improve the league's safety record before tragedy strikes. Fears: NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is said to be worried about the prospect of a player dying on field . Since taking over as NFL commissioner in 2006, Mr Goodell has worked to improve the league's reputation in this regard, introducing new regulations and harshly punishing the New Orleans Saints over their 'bounty' programme. A profile of the 54-year-old in ESPN The Magazine reveals that he is nonetheless haunted by the prospect of a player dying on the field thanks to a head injury. 'He's terrified of it,' a former player who knows Mr Goodell told the magazine. 'It wouldn't just be a tragedy. It would be awfully bad for business.' While football has always been a . violent and potentially dangerous game, the issue of player safety in . both the short and long term has recently come to the fore. A . number of former players, including Dave Duerson, Junior Seau and Ray . Easterling, have committed suicide over the past four years after . sustaining repeated concussions throughout their careers. Super Bowl: But America's most popular sport also has a dark side with the issue of player safety . Chuck Hughes is the only NFL player to have died during a game - he collapsed on the field with a heart attack while playing for the Detroit Lions in 1971. Many athletes in other sports have died while playing, notably soccer player Marc-Vivien Foé who collapsed and died during a game for Cameroon in 2003. NFL officials including Mr Goodell have often tried to downplay the dangers of their sport, though they have simultaneously worked hard behind the scenes to make it safer. The league has been working with the U.S. Army in an attempt to record players' concussions better, according to ESPN, and could adopt military technology embedded in soldiers' helmets which gathers data on every concussion sustained. Death: Linebacker Junior Seau killed himself last year after suffering brain damage from repeated concussions . Mr Goodell has received praise from NFL team owners - who collectively employ him and pay him nearly $30million a season. New York Giants boss John Mara said: 'Player safety is Roger's number one priority. It's something, quite frankly, that he wants as part of his legacy as a commissioner.' But others are more sceptical - lawyer Peter Ginsberg claimed that the commissioner 'doesn't view individual players as anything more than commodities for the business'. DeMaurice Smith, head of the NFL Players Association, who has often clashed with Mr Goodell, even accused him of endangering players by pushing to expand the season to 18 games. 'It is diabolically brilliant,' he told ESPN. 'It also happens to be completely inconsistent with health and safety.'","Former player who knows the NFL boss said he's 'terrified' it will happen .

A teenager has said he 'could have died' as he relived the moment he was allegedly thrown to the floor by police while being arrested at Australia's Mardi Gras festival. Hundreds of Australians have signed a petition protesting against 'police brutality' after a video showing an officer slamming teenager Jamie Jackson to the ground and standing on his back went viral. Amateur footage of 18-year-old Mr Jackson being arrested as he celebrated Sydney's Mardi Gras festival last weekend has been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people across the world. The video, which was filmed by at least two people, has sparked outrage across Australia and resulted in the head of the Police Association, Scott Weber, warning against trial by social media. Scroll down for video . 'Brutality': Hundreds of Australians have signed a petition protesting against the treatment of 18-year-old Jamie Jackson who was arrested by police at Sydney's Mardi Gras. He is shown here being held on the ground by officers . Harrowing: The youngster is shown laying face down on the ground sobbing after being 'slammed' to the ground . Hundreds of gay activists will now march to a Sydney police station on Friday in protest at Mr Jackson's treatment. The New South Wales Ombudsman is to investigate Mr Jackson's arrest. The incident has also opened a debate about the . public's right to film incidents involving police as the footage shows . officers telling the bystander behind the camera to stop. Despite being shown protesting his innocence in the footage, Mr Jackson has been charged with using offensive language against police, assaulting officers and resisting arrest. The arrest, which was witnessed by hundreds of people, came hours after thousands of gay and lesbian people had marched through the Sydney streets to celebrate the annual festival. Mr Jackson told 7News in Australia: 'I didn't deserve to be treated that way, that's for sure. 'It just got pretty heated and I'm just completely in shock about the whole thing, it could have been dealt with so much easier. 'I've got nothing bad to say about the police but that one officer that was just standing on me in the video treating me like a piece of meat, that was just wrong.' The crying youngster is heard on the video protesting is innocence and is heard to say 'I didn't do anything wrong' repeatedly. The person behind the camera is told to stop filming by the officer who then pulls Mr Jackson away by his neck. Pleading: The teenager, pictured, who has been charged with assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest and swearing at officers, is shown repeatedly protesting his innocence . The tearful teenager, still vehemently . protesting his innocence, is heard telling a bystander who is shouting . at the officers to get the policeman's name. The footage then pans down to what appears to be a spot of blood on a bit of paper on the ground. But the camera then switches focus back to the office and Mr Jackson, who is seen being slammed face down to the ground. He is then shown sobbing on the floor with the policeman's boot on his back. New . South Wales MP, Alex Greenwich, who is a gay rights campaigner, said it . was very concerning that a large police officer ‘body slammed’ a . teenage boy for swearing. He said: ‘If the only thing that the individual did was use offensive language, then I think many would agree that the approach the police took to the situation and the body slam on the ground is certainly a heavy-handed approach to the matter.' The officers involved in the incident are heard to warn people filming the incident to put their mobile phones away, but one woman can be heard saying she had a right to record what was going on. As debate flared over whether police can order people to stop filming their activities with their mobile phones, New South Wales Assistant Commander Mark Murdoch said that not only did the public have a right to do so, but he encouraged it. Mr Murdoch said an officer who told one witness to stop filming ‘cos I said so’, will be pulled aside and reminded of police protocol which encourages the public to film police. Warning: One of the police officers involved in the incident tells the bystander behind the camera to stop filming . He said: 'It is the right of the community to film anyone in a public space. ‘Police need to be mature enough to know everyone on the street has a mobile phone and that anyone has the right to record anyone in a public space.’ He added: ‘This is a matter we are taking very seriously.’ ‘It’s not about anything other than doing what we do, day in, day out, and that is policing by consent and with the support of the community. ‘We’re not in the business of doing otherwise – we are not a third-world organisation.’ Although neither of the two videos that have gone viral captures the initial encounter between Mr Jackson and police, a woman interviewed in one of the clips is heard to say: ‘They just slammed his head. There’s blood all over the ground.’ According to Sydney's Channel Seven, police sources said that Mr Jackson was ‘not an angel’ on the night, and is alleged to have tried to kick a woman in the shins and using the worst kind of profane language. Complaint: The teenager is seen asking bystanders to get the names of the police officers involved . In a second incident, gay activist Bryn Hutchinson alleged that up to five police officers held him down and kicked him after he ignored their instructions not to cross a road during the Mardi Gras. He said: ‘I had a police officer leaning on me. ‘I told him I couldn’t breathe. He said “If you can talk, you can breathe.”’ The annual Mardi Gras festival attracts hundreds of thousands of people from all over Australia and the rest of the world. The festival, which grew from gay rights marches in 1978, is one of the largest of its kind in the world. In November last year New South Wales Coroner Mary Jerram recommended five Sydney officers face disciplinary proceedings after saying they used excessive – and ‘in some instances even thuggish’ – force in the death of a Brazilian student who was repeatedly Tasered. Student Roberto Curti died when he was hit 14 times with Tasers, was showered with capsicum spray and handcuffed after a chase through central Sydney. Debate: The bystander eventually stops filming when asked by another officer to cease. The footage has sparked a debate on whether the public should film incidents involving police .

David Cameron today claimed Britain had already take tough action on bankers’ bonuses as he faced heavy criticism for his opposition to capping big City payouts. The Prime Minister was challenged by Ed Miliband over why he was ‘pulling out all the stops to defend the bankers and their bonuses’ from European Commission’s plans for a cap. But Mr Cameron said he would take no lectures from the Labour leader, who as a key aide to Gordon Brown ‘croupier in the casino when it all went bust’ in the 2008 financial crash. Write caption here . Brussels wants to prevent bankers being paid more than a year’s salary in bonuses in most cases. But the UK government fears the rules will drive away talent and restrict growth. The Bank of England also hit out at the plans today, warning they will fail to rein in excessive pay and will only force up fixed salaries that cannot be clawed back. George Osborne suffered a humiliating defeat yesterday in his bid to block a Europe-wide cap bonuses yesterday after finding himself outvoted by 26 to one. Britain has no veto and Mr Osborne was forced to accept a face-saving concession from Germany, Spain and Italy to undertake ‘technical negotiations’ over how the cap will work, in the hope of reaching ‘consensus’. The defeat is a significant blow to the UK, which had argued a bonus cap would have a disproportionate impact on the City of London. Clash: The row over banker's bonuses and welfare reforms dominated the session of Prime Minister's Questions . In the Commons today Mr Cameron was challenged by Mr Miliband over his decision to oppose limits on the vast payouts made to City high fliers. Mr Miliband claimed to have a letter from ‘John the banker’ who was ‘worried’ about his bonus being capped at £2 million. The Labour leader said negotiations on the EU proposals were led by a Conservative MEP and asked: ‘Why are the Prime Minister and Chancellor the only people who think it's a priority to fight for bigger bonuses for bankers?’ However the Prime Minister said Mr Miliband was ‘completely wrong’ and added: ‘We have some of the toughest rules on bonuses and the toughest rules on transparency of any major financial centre anywhere in the world.’ And he attacked Mr Miliband’s record as a key aide in the Treasury when Gordon Brown was Chancellor, and promised an end to boom and bust. ‘Under this Government bonuses are one quarter of what they were when you were in the Treasury,’ Mr Cameron said. ‘I will take lots of lectures from lots of people, but I don't have to listen to the croupier in a casino when it all went bust.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson today insisted the 26-1 EU vote was not the 'end of the story'. He told BBC 2's Daily Politics: 'We will go on, we will make . sure that the negotiations continue, we will try to ameliorate the . proposals, we will try and make sure that it’s not damaging to the . interests of London. 'All I would say is if it were to have the effect that they propose, . then the most it could achieve is not so much to damage the interests of . the greatest financial centre in Europe i.e. London, but to damage the . interests of all of Europe.' Knives out: Mayor of London Boris Johnson, pictured promoting apprenticeships today at Brasserie Blanc, said the fight against a bonus cap will 'go on' Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King today also warned the cap will act as a ‘distraction’ to efforts to change the culture of pay within the banking industry, according to Sir Mervyn. Andrew Bailey, incoming deputy governor at the Bank and chief executive designate of the new Prudential Regulation Authority, added it could set back recent progress made to reduce overall bonus pools, defer awards and introduce clawbacks of past bonuses. ‘My concern is that in setting this limit, it runs the risk of pushing up fixed remuneration - that's cash out of the door and it's much harder to get that back if needed,’ said Mr Bailey. The row comes days after the annual round of bankers' bonuses showed the culture of big money payouts is alive and well in the City. HSBC handed million-pound pay packages to more than 200 staff in a year that saw it fined £1.2billion for money laundering. Stuart Gulliver, who is the UK bank’s chief executive, picked up £7.4million in pay and perks as a reward for bumper profits.  Similar seven-figure payouts went to 78 of his British-based staff. HSBC’s profits for 2012 hit £13.7billion –  more than ten times the amount it was fined for its US and Mexican operations channelling money for drugs cartels. State-backed bank Royal Bank of Scotland paid £600million in bonuses, despite slumping to a £5.2billion loss.","David Cameron challenged in the Commons after UK tried to block attempt to limit bonuses to a year's salary .

Alexander Wright was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court after posing as a police officer and carrying out seven robberies at the homes of elderly victims . A bogus caller who dressed up as a policeman to target elderly people in their homes before robbing them has been jailed for eight years. Alexander Wright, 31, bought a dark blue top and trousers, smart white shirt and tie from a charity shop to carry out the con. To complete his costume he had a fake earpiece, a walkie-talkie radio and sported a four-inch ID badge bearing the word 'police'. His victims were aged between 67 to 91, and included an 87-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease. Wright denied seven burglaries but a jury took only 45 minutes to find him guilty after a three-week trial at Sheffield Crown Court. Jailing him, Judge Rosalind Coe said he was nothing more than a distraction burglar who went to great lengths to convince victims he was someone in authority. She said: 'You dressed as a police officer therefore persuading them you were somebody who could be relied upon. 'You took from them various amounts of money and belongings in circumstances where the victims were left uncomfortable and frightened in their own homes.' Prosecutor Ian West said Wright's trick was to prey on elderly and vulnerable people in their own homes. 'He does that by pretending to be a police officer who arrives at the premises and knocks on the door,' he said. 'He will claim he is a police officer and say there have been burglaries and ask to check their homes. This is a very clever and devious man.' Wright struck three times in Chesterfield and at homes in Huddersfield, Oldham, Sheffield and Rotherham last summer. He was arrested after fleeing a break-in and driving at 70mph in his white transit van trying to ram a police car, narrowly missing other vehicles and driving through red lights. Wright bought his uniform from the Minds Matters shop in Sheffield and conned his victims who were aged from 67 to 91, some of whom were short-sighted, into believing he was a policeman. 'He just needed to look presentable and the ruse worked,' said Mr West. 'He even had two sets of his chosen disguise.' When Wright was arrested officers found half of a pair of headphones in his van which he used to make a fake earpiece to pretend he was talking to the control room. 'One of the victims said he had this headphone in his ear and he was talking into it,' said Mr West. Wright stole bank books, a passport and £400 in cash from Elsie Swan, 88, at her home in Gleadless, Sheffield on Saturday, July 7. Three days later he struck at three homes in Chesterfield where the female victims were aged 76, 91 and 82 respectively. In Huddersfield he targeted an 87-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease and his 75-year-old wife, and robbed a 67-year-old woman in Oldham. Mrs Swan said a smart, clean shaven man with short hair in police uniform knocked on her door and said: 'I'm a police officer from the station.' At Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, Judge Rosalind Coe told Wright he was nothing more than a distraction burglar and left his victims uncomfortable and frightened in their own homes . He claimed two boys had been arrested who had burgled her house. She said he must be mistaken but he insisted and told her: 'Please hurry up, they're waiting for me at the station.' The victim said: 'I was frightened of him so I thought I had better check my money,' she said. She went upstairs and found everything was fine before later discovering her passport, £400 cash and two bank books had been taken from a downstairs room. 'I thought it must have been the policeman who took it,' she said. Wright was arrested wearing his police uniform after he leapt into his van, stuck up two fingers at officers and was pursued from the scene of an attempted break-in at Handsworth, Sheffield. The father-of-two , who lived on a caravan site in the Sheffield area, admitted buying the clothing but said he had split up from his wife at the time and needed shirts to look more professional for work as well as a tie for church. He claimed to have lent his white van, which was seen at the various crime scenes, to friends from the travelling community. He had bought the van from a traveller and was paying for it in instalments. The court heard Wright has five previous convictions for burglaries. He was also sentenced for three false representation offences, when he preyed on elderly homeowners offering gardening services before stealing cash. He was jailed for five years for the seven burglaries, another two years for the deception offences and a year on top of that for dangerous driving. He was also banned from driving for five years.","Alexander Wright stole from victims between the ages of 67 and 91 .

Cheshire East Council agreed the plans yesterday after being told it must create new habitats for a colony of great crested newts that are protected by European law before construction on a £30million bypass can begin. The move has been slammed by campaigners as 'unrealistic' when councils are being forced to slash budgets on frontline services. The council already has to make £13million of savings this year. Expense: Cheshire East Council has voted to spend £210,000 on moving 18 newts so it can build a new bypass . Rare: Great Crested Newts are protected by EU law and work cannot start until they are safely moved . Work on building the new habitat will . begin later this month to ensure that the area’s newt population has . time to settle into their new habitat. A council spokesperson said: 'Great crested newts are a protected species and as such we are required by law to protect their habitat. 'The £26.5m Crewe Green Link road is a major infrastructure project that will impact on their environment. The money is being used to create a suitable wildlife habitat, including the ponds, that will ensure the species continue to thrive.' Plans for the 1.1km Crewe Green Link Road - running between Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent - went straight through an area dubbed ‘pond capital of Europe’. An environmental survey of the affected area counted just 18 of the rare amphibians spread over a 500m area - putting the cost of the project at £11,666.66p per newt. Construction of the bypass cannot go ahead until the newts are relocated to a new habitat next year. The ecological study centered around wetlands on either side of Basford Brook, near the village of Weston, Cheshire - known as ‘the pond capital of Europe’ and noted for its wildlife. Ecologists surveyed 30 ponds, marshes and swamps and found great crested newts in 14 of them. The largest newt population discovered in a single pond was just six, although eggs were found at ten sites. The discovery of the newts, which are protected by EU law, has already delayed construction. The species are one of the most protected in Europe and one of the most endangered. Population numbers are estimated at about 400,000 in the UK. Habitat: The area between the A500 (pictured) and the A5020 is known as major home of the rare newts . Protected: Ecologists found newts in half the ponds and marshes surveyed and eggs were found at ten of them (file picture) The . cost of creating ‘artificial wetland’ areas is expected to reach . £190,000, with an extra £20,000 needed to cover legal and surveying . costs. A report to the council said: 'The . construction of the proposed Crewe Green Link Road South will result in . the loss of natural great crested newt habitat areas which in accordance . with protected species guidelines must be mitigated by the provision of . suitable alternative habitat. 'This is also a condition of our planning permission for the road. 'The . council will be able to claim some of the money back from the . Department for Transport, which is providing 60 per cent of the funding . for the bypass - but only if the road scheme goes ahead.' Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of TaxPayers’ Alliance said: 'This is an incredible amount of money to spend on relocating a group of amphibians to a new pond. 'For the size of this bill the authorities could have moved several families, not just a group of newts. 'Protecting endangered wildlife is important, but councils must ensure the costs of doing so are realistic and affordable to taxpayers.' A Wildlife Trust spokesman said the area - between the A500 and A5020 - was known as a major newt habitat. He said: 'This area is an important stronghold for great crested newts, given its long history of ponds and small wetlands. It may even be the ""pond capital"" of Europe. 'The creation of new ponds, especially if well-managed, is a tried-and-tested conservation technique to safeguard these rare amphibians.'","Cheshire East Council agreed the plans so it can build £30million bypass .

A mother has told how social workers turned up while she  was giving birth in hospital to say they would be taking her baby  into care. Without consulting her, social services chiefs had decided Kelly McWilliams was unfit to look after her baby because she had suffered from depression five years earlier after her ten-year-old son was found hanged. The officials arrived without warning to say the baby would go straight into foster care as they were concerned about Mrs McWilliams’s mental health. Kelly McWilliams is demanding an apology from Doncaster Social Services after her daughter Victoria, now 18 months, was taken into foster care after her birth . But the baby, a girl named Victoria, had serious breathing problems and was transferred to intensive care. Mrs McWilliams, 36, said she was only allowed to spend two hours a day with her daughter, supervised by a social worker. She was forced to call a lawyer from hospital and ended up in court two days after the birth to plead her case. Victoria’s father, who lived apart . from Mrs McWilliams, was given temporary custody of the baby when . Victoria was discharged from hospital ten days after her birth, and for . four months Mrs McWilliams was only allowed two hours of supervised time . each day with her child. Miss McWilliams has since been reunited with Victoria . Last night, the mother of five from . Doncaster said: ‘I feel very, very angry and very, very let down because . I had overcome my mental health problems and was in a very good place . and I was feeling proud and ready to be a mother. ‘Then this came along and crushed me. I lost precious time with my daughter. I missed her first smile, I missed so much.’ The social workers were able to take . Victoria into care after obtaining an emergency protection order from . Doncaster Magistrates’ Court. Mrs McWilliams said: ‘They literally . just walked in very coldly and said as soon as I had delivered my baby . she was going to get placed into foster care. ‘I was in labour when they came in. To be honest I didn’t actually believe them, at first I thought it was some kind of joke.’ When she asked why Victoria had to be fostered, she said they replied: ‘Because you are not well.’ According to Mrs McWilliams’s lawyer, . Doncaster social services had gone too far when Victoria was born in . August 2011, having failed to carry out a pre-birth assessment or case . conference to discuss any possible intervention. Solicitor Sarah Young said that if proper procedures had been followed, social services may not have needed to take action. Miss Young added: ‘I think it’s a shocking example of a massive over-reaction by social services in Doncaster.’ Victoria is now 18 months old and . happily living with her mother. But Mrs McWilliams is demanding an . apology from Doncaster social services, which she fears has not learned . from its mistakes. Miss McWilliams was in labour at Doncaster Royal Infirmary with her daughter Victoria when social workers arrived to take her unborn daughter away . Her case follows a series of major . failings by care bosses. In November, an Ofsted inspection found that . children’s care in Doncaster was still ‘inadequate’. The service had already been . criticised over the deaths of seven children and failures that led to . the torture of two boys by two brothers who were in foster care. Mrs McWilliams said: ‘People need to . know what Doncaster social services are like, because they make mistake . after mistake but they are not paying for it. ‘To me, they have got more power than the police, they can do what they want when they want. ‘Nobody can make up for what they have . taken away from me. They need to change the way they work. It can’t . happen to anyone else. I was an experienced mum and yet I had to be . supervised all the time I was caring for Victoria. ‘I am constantly terrified that there will be a knock on the door and that someone will come to take Victoria away from me.’ Chris Pratt, director of Doncaster’s . Children and Young People’s Services, said: ‘It’s inappropriate for us . to comment on cases involving individual children. However, when any . matter of concern is raised with me I do ask for this to be examined and . I have done that in this case.’","Social workers arrived at the Doncaster Royal Infirmary with a court order .

The Dutch Parkinson's Society released the video, called 'Worst Shake Ever', that shows society chairman Eric Roos, who did not take his medication in order to make the video, shaking out of control in an office kitchen while the song Harlem Shake by Baauer plays. The video imitates the Harlem Shake internet meme, which are short videos typically beginning with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them. Then the bass line drops and everyone goes wild, doing crazy dance moves around the room. Scroll down for video . The Dutch Parkinson's Society have released a spoof Harlem Shake Video to raise awareness of the debilitating effects of the disease. Society chairman Eric Roos (right) starts shaking as the music plays . In this version, when the bass drops, Mr Roos collapses and people in the office rush to help him. The clip, created by advertising agency Saatchi & Saatchi, ends with slogan: 'Shaking, fun for some … daily struggle for others.' A statement on the charity's website said: 'With this the society and its chairman want to show that Parkinson's is much more than a shaking hand or foot. 'The intention of the video is that it shocks the viewer, because a lot of people don't know what the daily reality of Parkinson's is.' Online observers were mixed about the . video.

Police had to use a woman's satnav to find a child she had left home alone because she was too drunk to give them directions, a court heard yesterday. Ruth Evans, 41, abandoned the youngster as she joined a drinking session at a pub in High Halden, Kent. The landlady of the Chequers Inn called police as drunken Evans got out of hand. Officers arrested her when she became aggressive and bared her teeth at them. Drunk: Ruth Evans left a child alone while she went to the Chequers Inn (pictured), and was too drunk to give police directions after she was arrested, forcing them to use her satnav . As she was being driven into custody Evans revealed she had left a child alone in a house - but could not remember where it was. They looked up the directions on her satnav and luckily found the child unharmed and asleep on the sofa. Evans escaped prison yesterday as she admitted cruelty to a child, being in charge of a car while unfit through drink and an assault on the police officer. Prosecutor Jim Harvey told Canterbury Crown Court how Evans went to the pub last June asking to buy bottles of wine. She drank a half-pint of shandy and then started to share one of the bottles of wine that she had bought with some customers. After some time she was told the bar was closing but then become abusive and aggressive. Hearing: Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) heard how the landlady of the pub called police as Evans got out of hand - officers arrested her when she became aggressive and bared her teeth at them . When she left the pub Evans became confused about where one of the bottles of wine had gone after a friend placed it in her car. 'Under the influence of alcohol': The court heard Evans demanded the police officers stood in a certain place before agreeing to talk to them (file picture) She then started kicking the pub door to attempt to get back inside and rowing with other bar staff until police were called. One of the policeman attempted to reason with Evans but had 'no fruitful conversation' with her because she was 'extremely wound up'. Mr Harvey added: 'The officer formed the view she was under the influence of alcohol. She demanded they stood in a certain place before agreeing to even talk to them.' It was then that drunken Evans lunged at one of the officers and pushed him forcefully with both her hands while she was 'baring her teeth'. A second officer then restrained her and arrested her for being drunk and disorderly. Thomas Restell, defending, said Evans was having treatment for her alcohol problems and her crime. He said she had faced a number of crises in her life, with 'death after death after death' which was 'enough to wear down even the strongest of people.

The discovery of an ancient woolly rhinoceros skeleton has allowed scientists to work out the average temperature of Britain 42,000 years ago. The researchers discovered that average summer temperatures were about ten degrees Celsius, while in winter temperatures dropped to about minus 22 degrees Celsius. Therefore, at this time Britain was unrecognisable Arctic tundra covered with shrubs as it was too cold for trees to grow. The discovery of an ancient woolly rhinoceros skeleton has allowed scientists to work out the average temperature of Britain 42,000 years ago . In total, 33 separate parts of the rhino were found including a complete cranium and lower jaw . The study was led by Professor Danielle Schreve, from Royal Holloway, who studied the rhino skeleton, along with other remains found with it, in an attempt to gather evidence on what the environment would have been like at the time. The rhino skeleton was found in 2002 at Whitemoor Haye sand and gravel quarry in the valley of the River Tame, Staffordshire. The bones were in excellent condition when they were found meaning that this represented the best example of a woolly rhinoceros found in Britain this century. In total, 33 separate parts of the rhino were found including a complete cranium and lower jaw, some of the vertebrae and ribs and the major parts of the front limbs. It is believed that the rhino must have become mired on the boggy edge of a river. In these conditions the carcass would have frozen quickly before being buried by river sediment. This explains why the rhino was so well preserved. This represented the best example of a woolly rhinoceros found in Britain this century . The rhino was so well preserved that specimens of its last meal remained in its teeth . Professor Schreve told phys.org: 'This is one of the most significant fossil finds in the last 100 years of a large mammal. 'It's an iconic specimen so it's important to date it, and it correlates well with other specimens from this time in mainland Europe. ‘As a result we can tell conditions at this time were very favourable for this species in Britain.' She went on to explain that the remains of beetles and midges were found alongside the rhino and that this was particularly important as these animals are very sensitive to changes in climate meaning that they give a clear idea of the temperatures at the time. The findings are published in the Journal of Quaternary Science.","Skeleton helped scientists work out UK temperatures 42,000 years ago .

Survivor: Laura McGoldrick broke down in tears when the shotgun used by Michael Atherton was shown during the inquest . A survivor of a triple killing broke down in tears at an inquest as the weapon used to kill her mother and other family members was demonstrated in court by a firearms expert. Just 30 minutes before his shooting spree, Michael Atherton had texted his partner offering to stay out for the night rather than risk confrontation, the hearing was told. But the 42-year-old shot his partner Susan McGoldrick, 47, her sister Alison Turnbull, 44, and Alison's daughter Tanya Turnbull, 24, then killed himself in Horden, near Peterlee, County Durham, on New Year's Day 2012. Firearms expert PC Mark Outhwaite opened a cardboard evidence box and produced the camouflaged shotgun - one of six weapons legally owned by Atherton - which was used to such devastating effect. As he showed the coroner Andrew Tweddle how it could be reloaded within moments, and with loud clicks ringing out in the hearing, Laura McGoldrick, who fled to safety by climbing through the bathroom window that night, wept and was comforted by her family. Two others left the hearing in Crook Civic Centre as the brief demonstration went on. Atherton, who had arrests for domestic violence dating back 10 years, had a deep-rooted dislike for Alison Turnbull, after he blamed her for his arrest following a family row at his home in 2008. The sisters and other family members had been out to a local rugby club without Atherton, and he grew angry when his son Mick told him they were out together. He told his son there would be 'trouble' if Mrs Turnbull turned up at his house with the others. Rather than face a confrontation with Ms Turnbull, he offered to stay the night at a local hotel. Minutes after 11pm, Atherton texted his partner: 'Our Mick says you are with your Ali. Going to stop at the Lodge. Aint spending a night in the cells. See you tomorrow.' But Mrs McGoldrick's party arrived home in a taxi at about 11.30pm, before Atherton left, and his partner accused him of assaulting her earlier that night. Inquest: Michael Atherton (left) shot three people including his partner Susan McGoldrick (right), 47, then killed himself in Horden, near Peterlee, County Durham . A row broke out and when Atherton went out of the back door, those present believed he was leaving for the night. But he returned with one of his shotguns that he had prepared for an early shoot with friends the next morning, and started blasting. He hit his partner from a distance of one metre in the kitchen, the inquest heard, with spray also hitting Laura. Detective Superintendent Paul Goundry, who led the investigation, said she was 'very lucky' to survive the blast and ran upstairs to her bedroom where her boyfriend was staying. Victims: Susan McGoldrick's sister Alison Turnbull (left) and Alison's daughter Tanya Turnbull (right) were also shot by Atherton . Atherton then shot Tanya Turnbull twice causing fatal injuries. Tears: Laura McGoldrick, pictured at her 18th birthday, broke down during the hearing when a firearms expert demonstrated the gun Atherton used . There was no evidence of any previous animosity between the two, Mr Goundry said. His last victim was Alison Turnbull, who was returning from the toilet, and appeared to have tried to avoid the blast by ducking. The women's friend Susan Ferguson was sat on a settee as the horror unfolded, and was spared, despite him looking at her. At some point Atherton reloaded the weapon, which could take three cartridges, and shot himself in the head, Mr Goundry said. Before that, he had 'exchanged some words' with his son, Mr Goundry said, and he fled through the front door. Alison's partner David Rowe and her niece Lauren Hardman avoided the massacre by not getting a taxi home with the women, and instead walking back from the rugby club. They arrived home at about the same time as armed police. Mr Goundry said: 'It must have been absolutely heart-breaking for David and Lauren. 'They arrived at the house and witnessed the sight that had unfolded in front of them. 'I have been there myself and it is not something I would wish upon anyone.' The inquest will conclude on Friday after hearing evidence from Durham's Chief Constable.","Michael Atherton texted partner offering to stay away to avoid confrontation .

Bogus nurse: Denice Stewart has been spared jail after admitting theft, fraud, deception and forgery after posing as a registered nurse for six years . A woman with no medical training stole the identity of a nurse and spent six years carrying out hundreds of smear tests and vaccinations in GP surgeries, a court heard yesterday. When Denice Stewart, 48, was finally arrested in July 2011, patients she had treated, many of them children, had to be offered retests and additional treatment. During her sentencing for fraud yesterday, the judge accused Stewart of a ‘gross breach of trust’ but did not jail her. He also criticised the Nursing and Midwifery Council for failing to investigate immediately when suspicions of the deception were raised as early as 2005. In total, Stewart performed 1,100 vaccinations and 686 smear tests while working at three surgeries in Kent between 2006 and 2010. Of 951 vaccinations she carried out at one practice, 515 were for children. During a previous job in Essex, she gave 67 jabs and carried out 46 smear tests. The opportunity for her crime presented itself when she bought a house in Essex from nurse Amaya Lloyd-Johnson, who had moved to Canada but had neglected to inform the Nursing and Midwifery Council, which holds a register of all nurses and midwives. Stewart received an application in the post addressed to Mrs Lloyd-Johnson asking her to renew her membership to the NMC. Instead of passing it on, Stewart completed it herself, Maidstone Crown Court heard. Alan Gardner, prosecuting, said: ‘She dishonestly adopted the identity of a nurse.  She worked at several general practice surgeries around the country carrying out a number of medical procedures which she was not qualified to undertake.’ Hearing: Maidstone Crown Court (pictured) heard Stewart vaccinated 1,167 adults and children and tested 732 women for cervical cancer while working unsupervised as a bogus nurse . He added: ‘The NMC didn’t check as . closely or fully as perhaps they should’ve done that the documents that . were sent to them were from Mrs Lloyd-Johnson. ‘The defendant stole the mail which arrived and used the contents to begin establishing herself as a fraudulent nurse.’ Mrs Lloyd-Johnson soon became aware . that her registration was being used by someone called Stewart and . alerted the NMC. But nothing was done and Stewart continued her fraud. Fraud: Stewart hatched her plan in August 2002 after stealing mail which belonged to a genuine nurse who used to live in the Darlington home that she had recently bought . Over the years, Stewart made several . requests to change the name on her NMC identity card, each time making . it more closely resemble her own. She then moved to Wales, where she . worked as an auxiliary nurse, which does not require an NMC card. However she quickly applied for a registered general nurse job when one . became available. Mr Gardner said: ‘She was becoming at that stage increasingly ambitious in terms of the work she was seeking.’ But when her employer at the Brecon . Medical Centre in South Wales examined her identity card, he realised it . had been tampered with and informed the NMC. In 2011, the NMC finally cancelled her registration number. She was later arrested by police. Peter Alcock, defending, said that . Stewart was a ‘fragile, vulnerable, damaged individual’ who had suffered . gynaecological problems and had tried to commit suicide. He said the motivation for her crime, . which earned her nearly £74,000 over the years, was not economic, but . due to ‘low self-esteem and low self-worth’. Sentencing her to 20 months’ imprisonment suspended for two years, Judge Carey said: ‘You were . inhabiting a world in which you were deceiving others and deceiving . yourself.’ He added: ‘I reach the conclusion . that uppermost in your mind was the desire to have a status which you . had not earned and you did not deserve in order to beset your low . self-esteem and against a backdrop of an unhappy domestic life.’ Stewart had admitted eight charges, . mostly relating to fraud but also theft and forging of documents and . profiting from her role.","Denice Stewart spared jail after admitting posing as a registered nurse .

Three conmen who duped investors into paying thousands of pounds for worthless plots of land by telling them they would be used for the Olympics have been found guilty of fraud. Daniel Webster, 29, Stephen Allan, 30, . and Steven Percival, 29, told buyers they were selling valuable plots around Britain - including some which would be developed as part of the London Olympics in 2012 - which would eventually deliver huge profits. But in fact the land invariably turned out to be either low-value farm land, in the Green Belt or unlikely to be granted planning permission. In total, more than 400 investors from across Britain parted with £35million in one of the biggest 'landbanking' frauds to date. Conmen: Daniel Webster, left, and Stephen Allan, right, used fake names and set up front companies to carry out the 'landbanking' fraud for five years . Steven Percival named himself gave himself the false name Toby Maguire in reference to the Spiderman star . The fraudsters used false names and front companies to carry out the scam between 2005 and 2010, claiming their telesales headquarters in Canary Wharf was selling gym memberships. Allan called himself George Hackett and even set up a front company Allan and Hackett Ltd, named after himself and his alter-ego. Percival named himself after Spiderman star Toby Maguire while Webster gave himself the surname 'Legend'. The trio were today found guilty of fraud following a two month trial at Southwark Crown Court. Ringleader Christopher Demetriou, 30, earlier admitted conspiracy to defraud investors. All three were remanded in custody ahead of their sentencing on Friday. Judge Martin Beddoe said: 'You can expect a severe sentence in relation to these matters.' Earlier in the trial, prosecutor Andrew Bird told the jury: 'Investors were persuaded to buy the plots by various high-pressure sales techniques, typically by cold-calling. 'They puffed up the value of the plots of land, and making representations that planning permission was being obtained or that a blue-chip purchaser is interesting in purchasing the land. 'Promises were made that the investor could sell the land back to the marketing company.' In fact, the land being sold invariably turn out to be low value farm land or forestry, divided into dozens of tiny plots to be sold on at hugely inflated prices. 'Much of it was in the green belt or in other areas where the grant of planning permission was extremely unlikely', said Mr Bird. 'No applications for planning permission had in fact been made.' False promises: The conmen convinced investors the land was needed as part of plans to build the Olympic Village and Stadium in London among other lies . Those who tried to reclaim their investment were told exorbitant extra sums needed to be paid to recoup the money. One plot in Birling Road, Leybourne, West Malling, Kent, which was bought from Kent County Council for £80,000, was divided into 220 mini plots valued at just £363.63 each. The con artists then set about selling each plot for £10,000 a piece, promising rich rewards to investors and drawing up a brochure showing a 'wholly unrealistic' housing project. The scam used front companies including Countrywide Land Holdings Ltd, Countrywide Land, Regional Land, and Plateau Development and Land Ltd, all of which were linked to the same office on the 29th floor of an office block in Canary Wharf. Cancer sufferer David Wright and his wife Sandra-May were among those sucked into the scheme, investing a total of £628,013 in Countrywide Land after being promised hefty profits in return for buying land. The retired couple from Shoreham-on-Sea, West Sussex, were first approached in March 2005 by Allan posing as George Hackett. They were persuaded to part with more than £220,000 for plots in Folkestone, Kent, Aylesbury, Berkswell, in Coventry, Hillesden in Milton Keynes, and Marple in Stockport. Rip-off: The conmen sold mini-plots of land on Birling Road in West Malling, Kent, for £10,000 each when they were valued at just £363.63 . The couple had received titles for the land but seen no return by November 2007, but were urged to buy more land in Meopham, in Kent. 'They were expecting Countrywide to take steps to get planning permission and for an opportunity to sell at a profit when the land was snapped up by a developer', said Mr Bird. By March 2009, the Wrights were growing anxious but were met with excuses over the delay and encouraged to invest another £17,500 in the West Malling site. Percival, as Toby Maguire, then told the couple some of their land was being bought up by an American investor, but another £100,000 was needed to seal the deal. The conmen strung them along with claims they were 'privileged clients', asking for increasing sums of money to ensure their investment returned a profit, until eventually they refused to pay any more and were told the money could not be returned. 'Mrs Wright felt that they had to keep paying or that they would lose everything', said Mr Bird. 'They had been promised financial returns and got nothing. 'They had been strung along and persuaded to make more and more payments.' Landbanking fraud has become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Companies divide land into smaller plots and sell it to investors on the basis that once it is available for development it will soar in value. Fraudsters will use high-pressure sales tactics by cold-calling names and numbers from publicly-available shareholder lists. They can also use email, post, word of mouth or talk at a seminar or exhibition. In fact, the land is often in areas of natural beauty, historical interest or has little chance of being built on and the people behind these companies are actually highly-skilled criminals. The Financial Services Authority estimates landbanking schemes have so far cost UK investors more than £200million. Although not all landbanking schemes are a scam, it is often not made clear to investors that there are restrictions on the development of the land or that it is otherwise protected. They offer this advice on how to protect yourself: . - Contact the local council where the land is located and asking them whether the land might ever be released for development. Just because the person promoting or operating the scheme says it is guaranteed the land will be developed does not necessarily mean it will be. - If you have already invested in a scheme and are concerned, stop sending money to the firm and individuals involved. If you have given them your bank account details, tell your bank immediately.- Contact the FSA Consumer Helpline with as much information as you can about your investment and the company involved, including their contact details and ‘firm reference number’ (FRN). Source: The Financial Services Authority (FSA) The scam eventually unravelled after probes by police, trading standards, and the Financial Services Authority, as well as 2010 exposes in the Mail on Sunday. Paperwork showed plots of land in Slough, Sevenoaks, Plymouth, Horsham, Ely, Ascot, and Dover, were used in the scam, all of which were either green belt land or had no planning permission. Raids of the trio's homes revealed a host of fake passports, paperwork under aliases, and details of their victims. Percival's home computer had been used to search on Google for 'Countrywide Land Holding Scam' as the net tightened on the gang. The ringleader of the fraud is believed to have fled the country and is currently on the run. Percival, Allan, and Webster are now facing hefty spells behind bars after being found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Percival, Webster and Allan, all of Bromley, Kent, had denied the charges but were found guilty following a two-month trial. Demetriou, of Ilford, Essex, earlier admitted conspiracy to defraud.","Case revealed one of Britain's biggest ever 'landbanking' frauds .

It was revealed today that the doctor who stabbed her seven-year-old daughter 31 times before killing herself had a major confrontation with her relatives in the weeks preceding her suicide. Victoria Vovchik, 45, told a friend that her relatives were 'all dead to me now' after a massive falling out. Vovchik was discovered lying dead in the master bedroom of her New City, New York home when the father of her daughter came to pick the girl up. The daughter, Ava Sangavaram, was found lying nearby but in spite of her significant injuries, she was 'alert and responsive' when emergency crews arrived on scene. Tragic: Dr Victoria Vovchik (left) is thought to have stabbed her 7-year-old daughter Ava (right) 31 times before killing herself in their home . A number of details surrounding the life of Dr Vochik are mysteriously missing as investigators try to explain how she could have brought herself to harm her daughter and then kill herself. It is unclear whether Dr Vovchik and her daughter's father, Dr Kristappa Sangavaram had ever married, but they were not together at the time of her death. Dr Sangavaram was the one to call police on Thursday as he arrived at the home to pick up the girl. Dr Sangavaram, 68, did not live with Vovchik and their daughter, but co-owned the home. Though she remains in critical condition, he seemed hopeful on Thursday night, telling Newsday: 'Be happy that she's going to be fine. Thank God she's alive. She's going to be OK.' Dr Sangavaram was brought in for questioning by Clarkstown police, but was later released. They do not believe he played any role in the tragedy, the Journal News reported. Police now think that the best understanding of the true version of events will come from the little girl as soon as she is strong enough to talk to investigators. Discovery: They were found by the girl's father, who co-owned the house with Vovchik . Police said Vovchik left behind no note explaining why she attacked her daughter or took her own life. She used a knife or other sharp object to kill herself, officers said. 'She loved Ava. Ava was her world. If she tried to kill Ava and herself, it was a misguided — probably frantic — attempt to spare them both future suffering,' her college friend Allison Solin told local paper The Journal News. Ms Solin spoke to Dr Vovchik two weeks before her death and said that her friend was going through some family trouble, though she did not know the cause. 'She would call me crying and say, ""Family is the most important thing to me, and I don’t feel like I have a family anymore."" These are her exact words — ‘My heart bleeds for this little girl (Ava) because she doesn’t have a family,' she told the paper. Vovchik went on to dramatically liken the split in her family to genocide. Tragic: Vovchik's body is carried away by coroners but her daughter survived and is in critical condition . Investigation: She left no note explaining why she attacked her daughter or took her life, police said . That was not the only split going on in her life either, as she recently closed one of her three medical practices. Vovchik was a podiatrist with practices in Fort Lee and Montvale, New Jersey, but the doctor who sold her the Fort Lee practice spoke to her about six months ago and was told that she was shuttering the location. 'I asked her if there was anything I could do to help. She said no, that she was fine. She wanted to join a group practice,' Dr Richard Weiner told Newsday. She co-owned the house in New City where she lived with her daughter and bought it with the girl's father in 2010 for $810,000. The lawyer who represented them in the sale said that he thought that they were together as a couple, but Sangavaram's grown son from a different relationship refutes that theory. 'It’s a touchy situation because he had a child with her (Vovchik) but wasn't married to her,' Preeth Sangavaram, 29, told The Journal News. Scene: Her body was found next to her daughter at their home in New City, New Jersey on Thursday . 'The child was very important to him, so he always tried to maintain a healthy relationship.' The elder Mr Sangavaram had reportedly been married to a different woman for several decades, though the status of that relationship is also unclear. Though Dr Sangavaram and Dr Vovchik apparently tried to be civil for the health of their daughter, her friend Ms Solin painted a picture of a turbulent relationship. 'A lot of times, when I would speak with her, they were in a fight and he was nowhere to be found. At times, he just wouldn’t take her calls or respond to her, and that would make her extremely anxious and desperate,' she said.","Victoria Vovchik found stabbed to death in her home next to her daughter .

Mr . Barnes, who also flew aircraft for the Tomb Raider II film and was an . air ambulance pilot, had 10,000 hours of flying time - including 3,500 . hours on the type of craft involved in the incident. Yesterday, workers began dismantling the crane on top of the skyscraper.

Amanda Wood, 31, said the 39-year-old had . taken the role of head of the family after their father Brian died of . cancer last January. She . said: 'He was a big man with a big heart, a big friendly giant. He . didn't have a bad word to say about anyone. He was always at the end of . the phone if you needed him. 'He . said he would be proud to walk me down the aisle when I eventually get . married. He said he would be happy to have that privilege.' Mr . Wood was struck as he arrived at the Vauxhall office of Rentokil. Miss Wood said their mother was struggling to cope because their father had also died this time last year. He said: ‘It's a matter of instinct (to . minimise casualties) - it's what pilots do. He had 25 years and 10,500 . hours experience. He was very good at what he did. He was outgoing, very . personable.’ His added that rules around the . construction of skyscrapers in London may need to be tightened, saying: . ‘We've got to learn from a tragic accident like this.’ Workmen Richard Moule, 31, and Nicki . Biagioni, 30, both of Essex, who should have been in the crane at the . time of the accident, escaped death by minutes because they overslept. Kevin Hodgson, now director of operations at the Great North Air Ambulance, served on life-saving missions for several years alongside Mr Barnes, whom he described as 'a good guy'. He added: 'Pete . was one of the best pilots I've ever had the pleasure of flying with. Over the years he will have flown on dozens of missions, no doubt saving . lives along the way.'

Repair: Workmen on top of the crane which was hit by a helicopter in Vauxhall . Jeopardy: Workmen scaled the equipment to assess the damage done to it by the crash . Privately-educated Mr Barnes had previously described himself as 'the luckiest pilot around' after surviving a helicopter crash 15 years ago when the electrics failed but he managed to bring the aircraft down in a field. A friend said: 'Pete used to show people pictures of the wreckage of the helicopter and say it was a miracle he survived. 'Apparently his electrics failed and he lost control. I believe he had passengers on board and they were amazed by the skills he used to guide the chopper down. Witnesses described hearing a loud bang and seeing a flash of light as the helicopter collided with the high-rise crane. Mr Barnes and Mr Wood died in the incident . Police have been amazed that more people were not hurt in the incident, which saw the helicopter plummet to the ground . The streets were flooded with emergency services trying to help the injured and put out the flames. The collision claimed two lives . 'He used to say he was the safest pilot around because most people don't survive one crash and the fact that he had meant that he was unlikely to have another.' 'I suppose it was a bit like being hit by lightning.' In an interview with a local paper in . 2006, Mr Barnes described his varied professional life, saying: ‘One . minute you’re flying paramedics to scenes of carnage and devastation, . then you’re flying VIPs and doing corporate entertainment at Ascot, . Silverstone and the world rally driving championships. The report described how Captain . Barnes meticulously co-ordinated stunts in Hollywood films, such as a . multiple abseil from a helicopter in Agent Cody Banks 2. When not working on films, he . regularly took celebrities and A-list stars to and from yachts in Monaco . and also flew race-goers to Ascot dressed in a top hat and tails. One picture shows him beside a helicopter with Formula One racing driver Lewis Hamilton. Working as what he described as an ‘aerial chauffeur’, he ferried world leaders to and from the 2005 G8 conference in Scotland. Between 1997 and 2011, Mr Barnes worked for the police and air ambulances in Yorkshire, Wiltshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire. In 2004 he helped save a motorist trapped in his Audi in the flooded Stanhope Ford, County Durham, described by a local paper as a  ‘rescue reminiscent of a Hollywood movie'. With the water level reaching the motorist's chest, Mr Barnes managed to keep the helicopter steady a foot above the car despite heavy winds while a paramedic jumped on to the roof and pulled the 40-year-old man out of a side window.He also piloted for the BBC and Sky News and previously worked as a broadcaster giving travel reports for Metro FM in the North East.","Rebecca Dixon, 38, praises partner Pete Barnes, 50, who died on Wednesday .

Facing criticism: UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been accused of costing the party its first Westminster seat by not standing in the Eastleigh by-election himself after candidate Diane James came second . Nigel Farage was forced to face down claims yesterday that his refusal to run in the Eastleigh by-election cost his party its first Westminster seat. UKIP candidate Diane James stormed from behind on a wave of protest votes to take second place in the poll. She won 27.8 per cent of the vote to finish just 1,771 votes behind Liberal Democrat victor Mike Thornton. But her leader, who said his party was on the verge of causing a ‘national political earthquake’, faced the charge that his decision not to run had killed any chance of UKIP winning the seat. Mr Farage said the result, UKIP’s . best in a Westminster election, was a ‘very significant step forward’ and boasted that they had hoovered up votes from all three main parties. He claimed that UKIP had persuaded voters disillusioned by mainstream . politics to go out to vote for the first time in ‘20 or 30 years’. Mr . Farage, by far the best-known figure in UKIP, had been expected to . stand, not least because he was the party’s first-ever candidate in the . 1994 Eastleigh by-election. And . while in 2010 UKIP received just three per cent of the national vote, . Mr Farage picked up 17.4 per cent when he stood against Speaker John . Bercow in Buckingham. And recent polls put UKIP 1 per cent ahead of the . Lib Dems nationally, at 9 per cent. Asked . whether he had ‘bottled it’ yesterday, Mr Farage said: ‘I have been . accused of many, many sins and most of them are true but I could never . be accused of bottling anything in my life. I wouldn’t have done any . better than Diane did.’ 'We are not a one man band': UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he wouldn't have done any better than candidate Diane James . Scraped through: Mike Thornton, pictured with his wife Peta Thornton at the Eastleigh by-election count, won his seat by just 1,771 votes . Mr . Farage maintained that if he had been the candidate it would have . reinforced criticism that Ukip is a ‘one-man band’. ‘We are not a . one-man band, I intend to lead this party into the European elections in . June next year, when we will take the tremor we have created in . Eastleigh and turn it into a national political earthquake,’ he said. ‘Had . I stood and I had got more votes and be going to the House of Commons, I . would not have been able to lead the party as a candidate in the . European elections next year. I believe its in those elections we will . come first and cause a real earthquake in British politics.’ UKIP’s success opens the possibility that the party could cost the Tories dozens of seats at the next general election. Gloomy faces: David Cameron admitted the defeat of Tory candidate Maria Hutchings, pictured at an event during the campaign, was 'disappointing' Dog's dinner: The Tories had named Eastleigh as one of its top 40 target seats for a majority in 2015, but the campaign was overwhelmed by a surging UKIP . Mr Farage said the Tories should lay the blame for their defeat firmly at the door of David Cameron, and added that it was “unlikely” that UKIP would consider a pact with them as long as he remains their leader. ‘The Conservatives failed here because traditional Tory voters look at Cameron and they ask themselves, “Is he a Conservative?” and they conclude, “No, he’s not”,’ he said. ‘He’s talking about gay marriage, wind turbines, unlimited immigration from India. He wants Turkey to join the European Union. The Conservatives’ problems are not because of UKIP, it’s because of their leader.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Eastleigh candidate Diane James celebrates the party's second place finish in the by-election .

Doctors are writing millions of prescriptions a year for a painkiller that is known to raise the risk of heart attacks and strokes, a study has warned. Diclofenac is given by GPs to ease the pain of arthritis, backache, gout and other common conditions. A review of existing research showed the drug is one of the riskiest of its type, raising the danger of heart attacks and strokes – including fatal incidents – by up to 63 per cent. This risk is almost identical to . that of the painkiller Vioxx (rofecoxib), which was withdrawn from . worldwide sales in 2004 because of cardiovascular risk. The study’s authors are calling for diclofenac to be banned or severely restricted in use. And . they accused family doctors, who issued almost five million . prescriptions for the drug in England in 2011, of being complacent about . the dangers and of not warning patients of the risks. In a review of studies on painkillers . known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), which also . include ibuprofen, co-author Patricia McGettigan, of Barts and the . London School of Medicine and Dentistry found diclofenac had the highest . risk. Despite this, it was the most used – meaning it was prescribed more often than safer alternatives such as the painkiller naproxen. Dr McGettigan said that the dangers of diclofenac have been well-documented, so GPs are either not keeping up with the latest research or simply ignoring the warnings. She said: 'This drug improves symptoms but patients are not stuck for alternatives. 'There are strong arguments to revoke its marketing authorisations globally.' She added that a healthy young person’s . odds of having a heart attack or stroke is so low that taking diclofenac . will add little to their risk. However, the effect could be significant in elderly people with underlying health problems. Diclofenac is also available over-the-counter in a lower dose Voltarol tablets and cream. Diclofenac was prescribed almost five millions times by GPs in 2011 . The gel is not thought to have any cardiac side-effects but the pills may, if taken in large numbers, said Dr McGettigan. Dr McGettigan, who makes her argument . in the journal PLoS Medicine, urged patients not to panic and stressed . that no one should come off their tablets without first speaking to . their GP. Maureen . Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, said that anyone taking . diclofenac and other NSAIDs should be made aware of the risks as well as . the benefits. Concern: Dr McGettigan said there were strong arguments for banning diclofenac . The charity Arthritis Research UK said . there are few other effective options for those with painful, long-term . conditions such as arthritis and it recommends that people take the . lowest dose of the most appropriate of the painkillers for the shortest . amount of time. A spokesman added that painkilling gels and creams are a safer alternative to pills. Britain’s drugs watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory products Agency, said that a European review of the safety of diclofenac is already underway. A spokesman added: ‘Diclofenac is an extremely important NSAID used for the treatment of arthritis and other painful conditions. ‘For most patients, the risks of side-effects are outweighed by the benefits these drugs bring in managing pain. ‘If people have any concerns about any NSAID they are taking, then they should speak to their doctor.’ Novartis, which makes Voltatol, the low- dose form of the drug, said patient safety is its top priority and if fully supports the European review of diclofenac's safety. A spokesman added that the company is confident that the information available to date shows the benefits outweigh the risks.","Research shows that taking the painkiller diclofenac increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 63 per cent .

Ten years on, Lord Prescott has finally admitted that the disastrous war in Iraq was ‘unjustified’. The Labour politician, who was Deputy Prime Minister at the time, said he had supported the intervention because he was assured that George Bush had a plan to bring peace to the Middle East. But the US president apparently lost interest in solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and now Lord Prescott says he thought the war was wrong. Talks: Lord Prescott greets Dick Cheney at No 10 in 2002 . During an interview on the BBC’s This Week programme Lord Prescott said that despite changing his view of the conflict, he could not ‘just disown’ his previous support for the invasion. Lord Prescott added: ‘I go through my thoughts trying to justify it, but it cannot be justified as an intervention.’ Britain lost 179 servicemen and women in the US-led Iraq conflict, which began on March 20, 2003. At least 100,000 Iraqis died. Earlier this week Tony Blair, the Prime Minister at the time, admitted Iraq was not as safe as he would like it to be, but insisted the situation would be far worse now had Saddam been left in power. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair admitted that Iraq was not as safe as he would like it to be . Declining once again to offer an apology for the invasion, he said: ‘If we hadn’t removed Saddam from power just think, for example, what would be happening if these Arab revolutions were continuing now and Saddam, who’s probably 20 times as bad as Assad in Syria, was trying to suppress an uprising in Iraq? Think of the consequences of leaving that regime in power. So when you say “do you think of the loss of life since 2003?” of course I do. You would have to be inhumane not to, but think of what would have happened if he had been left there.’ Lord Prescott told the BBC on Thursday that, ahead of the invasion, Mr Blair had been keen ‘to get the US in’ on the United Nation’s approach to dealing with Iraq. He said that after Mr Blair had sent him to speak to vice-president Dick Cheney, he told the PM it was clear ‘they’re going to go in without you; whether you come with them or not, it doesn’t matter to the Americans – they’re getting ready’. Lord Prescott added: ‘But I tell you something that persuaded me. 'You know Bush was quite prepared to have a plan for Israel and the whole problem in regard to Palestine and he promised. And, therefore, that plan was something.’ But Lord Prescott said the plan ‘fell apart as it often does in American politics because the influence domestically is too great’. The former deputy Labour leader said that, despite these factors, ‘at the end of the day, Tony Blair  obviously said to himself, “I’ve promised to do this and I’m going to do it”, and that’s today’s consequences.’ Ablaze: Baghdad pictured on the first night of the Shock and Awe operation in March 2003. Tony Blair said Iraq was better off without Saddam Hussein in power . Lord Prescott’s comments go further than the previous doubts he has expressed over the Iraq War. In 2009 he admitted in the New Statesman magazine that he wondered how he had agreed to go along with Britain’s participation in the war. A year later he gave evidence to the Chilcot Inquiry, when he revealed he had doubts about the intelligence on Saddam Hussein’s weapons programmes before the invasion.","Said he was assured that George Bush had plan for peace in Middle East .

Mr Manners, has amassed the staggering collection of agricultural vehicles so he can break them down and sell on the parts, and his huge haul is now so large it is visible on Google Earth's satellite cameras. The enterprising farmer, 69, runs his business from Battle Bridge Farm near Alnwick, Northumberland, having started it when he was hunting for wheels for his digger. Scroll down for video . They're all mine: Mr Manners stands among some of the 350 combines he has hoarded as part of this parts business . Landmark: Mr Manners' collection of combines is so vast it is easily visible on Google Earth, as in this image . He started his sideline with just one vehicle, an ageing MF 500 combing, but his business has grown with the combines taking up acres of land. Mr Manners, who has run the farm where he lives with wife Ann, 65, since 1968, said: 'It all started when I got a price for new tyres for a digger. 'I found I could buy an old combine for less and get the tyres off that. Then somebody wanted its engine so I sold that. 'A year later at the Highland Show, I was talking to someone from not far away who had two MF 500s and I bought them both. 'The next thing I knew I had about 50 of the things and it became more of a business than the farming - it’s the main business now.' High turnover: Mr Manners said he has bought between 50 and 60 combine harvesters each year for the past two decades . Well-oiled machine: Mr Manners' combine parts business in Alnwick, Northumberland, is now bigger than his farming business . His business, Manners Combine Parts, has now grown into the biggest breaker of combines in the UK, supplying farmers and trade with used parts. Most of the combines arrive in tact at the farm but are dismantled to order when parts are needed. The business has even shipped parts as far away as Lithuania, Malaysia, Morocco, Cyprus, New Zealand and Thailand. Mr Manner’s buys the combines and his sons Richard and Fraser are in charge of sales and distribution. Lucrative: With some combines worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, Mr Manners' sideline has become his main source of income . Valuable: Mr Manners is currently enjoying his most profitable time of year, as farmers seek combine parts for the harvesting season . John travels the country buying harvesters, paying anything from a few hundred pounds to a few thousand pounds and sells on second hand and reconditioned parts, which include grain pans, wheels, unloading augers, engines, sieves and shaker shoes. With a brand new combine harvester costing hundreds of thousands of pounds farmers are looking to save money by buying parts. John added: 'It’s harvest season so it’s the busiest time of the year for me. 'We’ve bought about fifty to sixty combines a year for the last twenty years.

The bump could be worth up to £18,000 a year for Chief Constables at a time when the starting salary for a Constable was cut by £4,000 to £19,000. The fall of a fifth left starting salaries at the same level they were a decade ago and less than a trainee manager at McDonald’s. and sparked fury among rank-and-file officers. Both changes were among recommendations from the overhaul of pay and conditions proposed by former rail regulator Tom Winsor. Starting salaries for new police recruits have dropped £4,000 to £19,000, while top officers could get £18,000 more. File picture . Last night Steve Williams, chair of the Police Federation, said: ‘At a time when police budgets are being slashed and police pay is being reformed to the detriment of serving officers, we are amazed that PCCs will have the budget available to increase the salary of Chief Constables by 10 per cent.’ Coming months will see the appointment of top officers in around a quarter of forces, as incumbents retire or move to new jobs. Many were temporary appointments in advance of the elections for Police and Crime Commissioners last year. Last week Nick Gargan, former head of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) was appointed as to head the Avon and Somerset force. The Police Federation chair said he is 'amazed' at the proposed wage hike . Yesterday acting Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall Police Shaun Sawyer was appointed to fill the job on a permanent basis. The new pay regulation, signed off by Home Secretary Theresa May, will allow PCCs to vary the existing starting salaries for Chief Constables by up to ten per cent. The pay levels for senior officers are set according to the size of the force they are commanding. At the top end are the West Midlands and Greater Manchester forces which came with a starting salary of £181,455 in 2010. The West Yorkshire chief earns £169,359 and Merseyside and Northumbria chiefs £157,260. Salaries are then staggered down to the lowest level, £130,044 for five smaller forces, including Gloucestershire, Lincolnshire and Warwickshire. The Home Office said it was right for PCCs to be given the ‘flexibility’ to change salaries, which they would have to account for to the electorate. The new arrangements for new recruits will see those with no experience seeing their starting salary cut by 17 per cent. Recruits with experience, such as those who have volunteered as a special constable, can earn up to £22,000 a year. Mrs May is yet to decide whether to accept another Winsor recommendation that would allow chiefs to sack under-performing officers. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘PCCs have been elected by the people to hold the police to account and it is only right they are given some flexibility on employing chief constables. ‘That is why independent reviewer Tom Winsor recommended chief officer basic pay could be raised or lowered by up to 10per cent when PCCs are recruiting new chief constables. ‘Our police reforms are introducing modern management practices at all levels of policing, giving the added flexibility required to forge a force fit for the 21st century.’","Proposed wage rises come after junior police's pay is slashed .

Initially, the team believed the bright flecks were shed by the rover, similar to bits of plastic debris discovered last week. Scroll down to see the rover's first scoopful of mars . Curiosity on the red planet with the scoops of ground it has taken clearly visible. The soil was placed in the analysis instruments at the bottom of the picture. The rover's Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument is analyzing this sample to determine what minerals it contains. It will identify minerals using X-ray diffraction - the first time the techniques has been used. CheMin will direct a beam of X-rays as fine as a human hair through the powdered material. When the X-ray beam interacts with the rock or soil sample, some of the X-rays will be absorbed by atoms in the sample and re-emitted or fluoresced at energies that are characteristic of the particular atoms present, allowing Nasa to identify minerals in the sample. 'The science team started to classify these sort of differently, calling them 'schmutz,'' Curiosity lead scientist John Grotzinger, with the California Institute of Technology, told reporters in a conference call. 'We had a lot of fun with that, labeling them and comparing, but in the end it turns out we really feel this is a different sort of particle,' he said. While not completely ruling out the chance that the flecks are rover debris, most of the team now believes they are naturally occurring, perhaps a mineral that was fractured by the rover scoop. To be on the safe side, scientists commanded Curiosity to dump that sample and collect sand from another site for processing in the onboard laboratory. The aim is to get an ingredient list of minerals in the Martian soil. The rover's Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument is analyzing this sample to determine what minerals it contains. The rover's robotic arm delivered the sample to CheMin's opened inlet funnel on the rover's deck. 'We are crossing a significant threshold for this mission by using . CheMin on its first sample,' said Curiosity's project scientist, John . Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 'This instrument gives us a more definitive mineral-identifying method than ever before used on Mars: X-ray diffraction. 'Confidently identifying minerals is important because minerals record the environmental conditions under which they form.' The robotic arm on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity delivered a sample of Martian soil to the rover's observation tray for the first time. The Mars Science Laboratory rover took the sample after arriving at Glenelg Intrigue, an area where three different types of terrain meet, said Grotzinger. The information scientists glean about the rocks here will help them decide where to finally break out Curiosity’s drill, he explained. 'We consider ourselves now to be in sort of the promised land,' Grotzinger added. 'We got to believing there were things around us and began to look at everything through that lens,' said mission manager Richard Cook, with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. 'We definitely are more aware of what's out there now and are more careful about everything we look at,' Cook said. The previous day, the rover shook the scooped material inside sample-processing chambers to scrub internal surfaces of any residue carried from Earth. One earlier scoopful was also used for cleaning. Additional repetitions of this cleaning method will be used before delivery of a future sample to the rover's other internal analytic instrument, the Sample Analysis at Mars investigation, which studies samples' chemistry. In August, Curiosity landed inside a 96-mile-wide (154-km-wide) impact crater near the Martian equator on a $2.5 billion, two-year mission to determine if Mars had the chemistry to support and preserve microbial life. The mission is NASA's first astrobiology initiative since the 1970s-era Viking probes.

A father who lost 13 stone after gastric bypass surgery has spoken of his misery of being left with two stone of excess skin hanging from his stomach. Stephen Dockerill, 48, ballooned to 31 stone after he began comfort eating in his thirties. His weight has since plummeted to 18 stone after gastric bypass surgery - but he is unable to move properly, sleep on his back or swim due the huge apron of excess skin that comes to his knees. Mr Dockerill, who also has excess skin . on his arms and thighs, told ITV's This Morning: 'I feel like I've traded one problem for . another - it's like being a prisoner in my own body.' He is now desperate for an NHS operation to get the excess skin removed, which he describes as 'like a hanging skirt'. Despite being active in his twenties, playing rugby and swimming, the weight piled on his thirties. 'It was a . psychological thing - I had a few bad relationships and turned to booze . and comfort eating,' he said. 'Over the years I got bigger and bigger and my weight . got out of control.' After years of depression and snacking . on fish and chips, kebabs and fried breakfasts, his weight hit 31st 9lb. He said: 'Even then, my skin was hanging from my belly like a skirt because I was so big. It was very uncomfortable. 'My belly was on my knees - I couldn't get a pair of trousers on, only XXXXXXL jogging bottoms, and even then I had to wear braces to keep them up.' Mr Dockerill (pictured here with sister Karen) lost 13 stone after gastic bypass surgery. He told ITV1's This Morning he had been left with 2 stone of excess skin around his stomach . The crunch point came when his doctor told him if he didn't lose weight, he would be dead by the age of 55. Too fat for a gastric band, he first underwent  a gastric balloon procedure in February last year to make his stomach feel full. Uncomfortable: The 2 stone of excess skin means Mr Dockerill struggles with the most basic of tasks, such as walking and sleeping . Then in October, he underwent gastric bypass surgery. This is where part of the digestive system is removed so the patient can only absorb around 50 per cent of the calories he consumed. Despite losing a staggering 13 stone in total, his success has turned to agony. Although he has lost the fat, his skin still sags to his knees. People who lose weight quickly, such as those who've had weight loss surgery, are particularly prone to excess skin. Mr Dockerill also struggles with the most basic of tasks, such as walking and sleeping. He addded: 'I can’t sleep on my back . because of the pressure on my belly, so I have to lie on my side. If I . want to turn, I have to lift the skin. It’s exhausting.' The excess skin also means he can't go swimming, as the excess skin hangs from the bottom of his trunks. He must also tuck it down one leg of his jogging bottoms in order to get dressed. He also suffers from sores and fungal infections and is the butt of cruel jibes in the street. 'It would be nice to have a relationship - I have been on my own for 11 years.' This Morning's resident doctor Carol Cooper, said: 'Skin is elastic, but it will stretch so much. 'This means people who have lost huge amounts of weight can be left with massive folds of loose skin - and we are seeing more and more of these cases. 'Cosmetic surgery will remove the skin folds that Stephen needs, but it will be quite intensive surgery. It also costs at least £6,000 to have it done privately. 'There are no national guidelines as to who can get a tummy tuck on the NHS. Doctors have to make a strong medical case to get the op on the NHS, such as the patient suffering recurrent skin infections and severe restrictions in daily living.' Excess skin is extremely common after weight loss surgery, explains Guido Kohler, a plastic surgeon who works privately and at Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. ‘This excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body,’ he says. Factors that affect how much skin is left after a dramatic weight loss include age, how quickly the weight was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for women, the number of children she has had. ‘After extreme weight loss, many patients develop an “apron” of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs,’ explains Mr Kohler. ‘It can all be very uncomfortable and upsetting.’ This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems, too. One of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry. Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo bariatric (weight loss) surgery. Mr Kohler says: ‘Sadly, there are some patients who do not seem to have been prepared for this situation beforehand, and post-weight loss can be a very disappointing and psychologically damaging time for them. Some do question why they had the surgery in the first place.’","Stephen Dockerill, 48, ballooned to 31 stone after he began comfort eating .
