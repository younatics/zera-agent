A woman who kept a book about female murderers next to her bed stamped her boyfriend to death when she become fed up with his messy habits. Maxine Oliver, 45, was jailed for life for murdering 37-year-old Carl Jones after he came home drunk and spilled beer on the carpet of the flat they shared. On the night he was killed, neighbours of the apartment in Ash Vale, Surrey, heard Oliver screaming: ‘Do you want me to kill you? Do you? Do you?’ followed by a loud banging noise. Maxine Oliver, 44, was jailed for life for the brutal murder of her partner Karl Jones . The court heard how Mr Jones, who walked with a stick following a previous injury, suffered brain damage, broken ribs and a crushed larynx – injuries police said were consistent with being repeatedly stamped on. Oliver was jailed after being convicted at Guildford Crown Court and was told she must serve a minimum of 17-and-a half years behind bars. She had denied murder and throughout her trial insisted someone else must have been responsible for Mr Jones’ fatal injuries. She complained to the court that Mr Jones had been stumbling around inside the apartment and spilled beer on the carpet after she had cleaning up. Reading material: Maxine Oliver kept this book about female serial killers in her bedside table . Sentencing the defendant, Judge Critchlow said Mr. Jones was a heavy drinker who consumed strong lager on a daily basis. ‘You became less and less tolerant of him and wanted him out of the flat. ‘It is clear that you were in a temper when you carried out the assault from which he died.’ Judge Critchlow added that the victim was 11-and-a-half stone, while his murderer was 16 stone. Richard Button, defending, said that there had been genuine affection between the couple. He said: ‘My client became less and less tolerant of him and more and more frustrated at his excessive drinking. ‘The situation culminated in a terrible loss of temper by my client.’ Neighbours . testified that they heard Oliver berating Mr Jones for coming home in . an drunken state, hours before he met his death on the night between . March 1 and March 2 this year . Scenes . of crime officer, Nicola Devlin, said a book called ‘Deadlier than the . Male: Ten true stories of women who kill’ had been found in the . defendant’s bedside drawer. Mr . Jones was found dead and naked in the hallway of the flat and his . clothes were found in a washing machine still damp - an analysis found . traces of blood on them. When . the sentence was announced members of Oliver’s family shouted abuse at . the relatives of her former boyfriend, and ‘are you happy now?’. Oliver was sentenced to life at Guildford Crown Court after a jury found her guilty of murder . During the trial it was revealed that a police officer, Richard Phillips, was dismissed after failing to follow proper procedures. At one point Mr Phillips was said to have stepped in a pool of blood which was then tracked outside the flat as Mr Jones’ body was removed. The Court was told that there was a failure to ensure that no blood ended up on the floor and that Mr Phillips had neglected to change his soiled overshoes because there was not another pair available. In addition, Jurors heard that items found by the investigating team were not dealt with correctly - leaving open the possibility that they were contaminated by other factors.","Maxine Oliver, 45, from Surrey, was jailed for life for the murder .

Slammed: Wayne Rooney has been censured for passing off an advertisement for Nike as a personal comment on his Twitter account . Wayne Rooney has been censured for passing off an advertisement for Nike as a personal comment on his Twitter account. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruling comes amid mounting concern that celebrities are cashing in by turning Twitter into an advertising platform. Many celebrities are promoting products and luxury brands via tweets in return for freebies. Some, particularly in the US, go further and are being paid by big companies to promote their businesses. Famous names such as Kim Kardashian, who has more than 15million followers, can earn thousands of pounds for a  one-line endorsement on Twitter. Rap star and actor Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan have also cashed in. In the US, the Federal Trade Commission insists that stars must include the word ‘ad’ or ‘spon’ to show if something is an advert or sponsored. Similarly, British celebrities are required to make clear where a tweet is part of a commercial arrangement under a code that is policed by the ASA. England footballer Rooney and his sponsors Nike failed to comply, while a similar tweet from Arsenal and England midfielder Jack Wilshere also broke the rules. The Rooney tweet read: 'My resolution – to start the year as a champion, and finish it as a champion... #makeitcount gonike.me/make itcount (a link to a film and promotion campaign for Nike)'. The ASA said: ‘We understood that, as part of their sponsorship deal with Nike, the footballers were required to take part in marketing activities and that both were asked to submit their own ideas as to what to write as part of their tweet. Twitter power: Rap star and actor Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan can make thousands for a one line endorsement on Twitter . 'We understood that the tweet’s final content was agreed with the help of a member of the Nike marketing team.' However, the watchdog said: ‘We considered there was nothing obvious in the tweets to indicate they were Nike marketing communications. 'In the absence of such an indication, for example #ad, we considered the tweets were not obviously identifiable as Nike marketing communications and therefore concluded they breached the code.' The watchdog has banned any repeat of the tweets in their  current form and it has put Nike on notice that it must ensure any advertising on Twitter is clearly identified. Nike said the use of the company’s name in the tweets should have been sufficient to alert people who follow Rooney and Wilshere that they were commercial messages. the personal message is brought to you by . The ASA is receiving an increasing number of complaints in relation to stealth advertisements via Twitter and Facebook. The Office of Fair Trading has also warned celebrities and big brands against using what it describes as 'deceptive' advertising. It said: ‘Online advertising and marketing practices that do not disclose they include paid for promotions are deceptive under trading laws.' Nina Best, a specialist in brands and advertising law at legal firm Browne Jacobson, said: 'This ruling does not mean the end to celebrity endorsement on social media. However, brands will need to become more aware and more creative when it comes to social media marketing. 'The advertising watchdog will not let social media slip through its gloves, so brands need to pay close attention to their social media campaign messages.'","Mounting concern that celebs are cashing in on Twitter .

Ashley Cole yesterday backed his ‘good friend’ John Terry and insisted it was wrong to prosecute him for alleged racist abuse. Giving evidence for his England and Chelsea team-mate, the footballer told Westminster Magistrates’ Court: ‘We shouldn’t be sitting here.’ He was supported by a host of football stars, including their Chelsea team-mate Frank Lampard and former manager Jose Mourinho, who vouched that Terry was not racist. Friends: Chelsea left back Ashley Cole, left, was summoned to give evidence in defence of Terry, right, at Westminster Magistrates' Court . England defender John Terry, pictured arriving on Tuesday to face a second round of grillings over his alleged racial abuse of Anton Ferdinand . Former England captain Terry is accused . of calling QPR player Anton Ferdinand a ‘****ing black c***’ during a . game after being goaded over his extra-marital affair with Vanessa . Perroncel, the ex-girlfriend of former team-mate Wayne Bridge. Support: Ray Wilkins told the court Terry was a peacemaker in training if players had words . But Cole told the court that he believed Terry was only repeating back the slur that Ferdinand mistakenly thought he had used. He said that while racism should never be tolerated, saying back what you thought someone said was ‘completely different’. Cole said he did not hear what Terry said to Ferdinand despite being . only about a car-length away from the row at the end of a bad-tempered . West London derby between QPR and Chelsea last October. But he said he saw Ferdinand shouting either the word ‘black’ or . ‘Bridgey’ – an apparent reference to Wayne Bridge – and make a lewd . gesture at Terry. Cole said he told Ferdinand: ‘What you’re doing to JT [Terry] is out of . order’. He added that he did not shake Ferdinand’s hand after the game. The left-back said abuse towards Terry over his affair with Miss . Perroncel was commonplace during games, but he had never seen him react . to it, explaining: ‘He would probably laugh about it, it’s part and . parcel of the game and you get used to it.’ Describing what happened after the match, when Terry invited Ferdinand . into the Chelsea dressing room to try to put the row ‘to bed’, Cole . said: ‘I think John said, “Did you think I called you a black c***, did . you think I was being racist?” Then I said, “Did you think John was . being racist?” Anton said, “No, no”.’ Parents' support: Anton Ferdinand's parents Janice Lavender, left, and Julian Ferdinand, right, arrive at Westminster Magistrates' Court .

Scandal: Terry's alleged comments came in response to taunts by the other player about his alleged affair with an ex-team-mate's girlfriend, Vanessa Perroncel, pictured, the prosecution said . The players then shook hands and left. Cole said he remembered little . else about the discussion because he was ‘looking forward to a night . out’. Later that evening Terry phoned Ferdinand’s brother, England defender . Rio Ferdinand, in another attempt to try to ‘smooth over’ the incident, . but he did not take the call. Cole insisted on sitting in the witness box as he testified, despite . Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle suggesting that most people in the court . would prefer it if he stood up as it would be easier to hear him. Cole described Terry as a good friend and a great captain. He said: ‘He’s one of the best, very inspirational. He gets the team  going in big games. He’s cool, calm and collected.’ But he said he felt an internal ‘conflict’ in giving evidence on his . behalf, because he is also friends with Ferdinand and his brother, and . had not wanted to get involved in the dispute. Cole was also asked about having ‘lurid details’ about his sex life . published in the media, an apparent reference to allegations of his . infidelities during his marriage to Cheryl Cole. But Cole replied: ‘I . don’t mind, I’m a grown man.’ Statements were also read from 17 Chelsea players and former manager . Mourinho, all saying that they had never heard Terry make a racist . comment. Terry, 31, denies a racially aggravated public order offence. The trial continues.

A JetBlue Airbus was sent careering wildly through the skies for fours after a mechanical meltdown. The 155 people on board the Las Vegas to New York flight were left terrified as the A320 aircraft lurched from side to side and went into steep turns after its hydraulic system failed.

Terror in the skies: A mechanical problem on a JetBlue flight from Las Vegas to New York this Sunday caused it make an emergency landing . Fear: Passengers said they knew something was wrong on the flight because a 'screeching' noise started after take-off . Another passenger, Tom Mizer, told the New York Post: 'People were getting sick. Some people were throwing up. There were a lot of people getting nauseous.' They . said that crew members of Flight 194 'did everything they could to prevent panic', . with one attendant walking down the aisles trying to reassure people. Mr Mizer said: 'She said ""Look at me, I'm smiling. If I was scared, you would know it. If I'm not scared, you don't need to be.""' Mr McGhie added that there was no screaming, but 'there were definitely people reacting out loud'. He said: 'The plane kind of felt out of control. It wasn't able to balance itself, and the air was choppy.' Making it public: One passenger tweets about her horrendous experience on board the JetBlue flight . Positive feedback: Tom Mizer, who was on board the troubled plane, said that staff walked up and down the aisles to prevent passengers panicking . The pair, both from Brooklyn, said . they realized something was wrong with the aircraft as soon as they took . off from Las Vegas airport. Mr Mizer said: 'You could hear a screeching - an obvious mechanical screeching. We were bouncing around a lot. Problems began for Flight 194 after the pilot radioed to say his Airbus had lost two hydraulic systems. David Learmount, operations and safety editor of Flightglobal website, explained that the Airbus has three sets of hydraulics which means 'it can lose some and keep flying at the same time'. In the JetBlue Airbus incident, he said: 'It sounds as if the auto-pilot tripped out which puts flying completely in the pilots' hands. 'If there is also natural turbulence at the same time, it doesn't help with regards to making passengers nervous.' The aviation expert added: 'The hydraulic system can stop working because of the failure of a hydraulic pump or a leakage of fluid. 'The pilots would have been warned if this had happened and it can happen very suddenly.' Mr Learmount said that it was normal for pilots to keep a plane in the air for this length of time to use up enough fuel to make it safe enough to land. 'This is standard procedure on all planes, no matter what the emergency,' he said. 'People on board got a little freaked. People were upset. 'Nobody was crazy, but everyone was upset. It became a long, sort of very tense waiting game.' A pilot soon declared an emergency and radioed air traffic controllers to tell them that they had lost two hydraulic systems. But as the plane contained five hours' worth of fuel, and the A320 cannot dump the excess, the pilots had to circle the area until they had burned enough to land safely. The plane landed at Las Vegas' McCarran Airport at 7.37pm where the flight had taken off. The aircraft had to be towed to the gate because the front wheels had stopped working. Another plane was made available to take passengers to JFK. The flight left at 10.13pm from Las Vegas and landed at 5.59am local time in New York. The Federal Aviation Administration has started an investigation into the incident. JetBlue said in a statement: 'JetBlue takes all incidences seriously, and the safety of our customers and crew members is our No. 1 priority. 'The actions the crew took in response to this event truly represent who we are and our core value - safety.' It is the latest in a long line of embarrassing incidents or accidents to hit the company. In April, a plane was forced to make an emergency landing at Westchester County Airport, New York after two geese smacked into its windshield.

But the usually tranquil community has been rocked by a vicious hate campaign sparked by a business owner's application to hold late night parties in a stately home. Robert Rous, who owns the 700-acre Bruisyard Hall, a wedding and conference centre, is the focus of a rural rebellion after trying to get a licence extension to boost business. Stately: Bruisyard Hall was vadalised after the owner and manager angered villagers with and application for late night parties . Revolt: Plans to allow late-night drinking at Bruisyard Hall, by Paul Daws, left, and Robert Rous, right, provoked a campaign of poison pen letters, vandalism, and graffiti attacks . His bid sparked a sinister series of events, including vindictive poisoned pen letters being delivered to every . resident in the village, obscene graffiti daubed near the site . and the hall's gates being vandalised by a mysterious perpetrator. Now the backlash he and his manager Paul Daws have unleashed has become so serious the parish council's chairman has had to appeal publicly for an end to the bitter dispute. In an open letter on the village’s website parish, councillor Peter Robinson said: ‘What has happened to our peaceful quiet village? ‘We have been torn apart by the recent goings on, anonymous letter drops, the latest of which libels various members of the community, vandalism of the new gates at Bruisyard Barn, red paint spread across the entrance to the drive, obscene graffiti scrawled on one of the signs at Bruisyard Hall gates.’ Rural idyll: The picturesque, and normally peaceful, Suffolk village of Bruisyard has been 'torn appart' by the vicious dispute over new wedding venue . Ructions: The chairman of Bruisyard parish council has appealed for an end to the unrest in an open letter to villagers . Trouble erupted when Mr Rous launched a number of applications to allow the hall to stay open until 2am, to boost the business and increase revenue. Historic: The tiny village of Bruisyard was mentioned in the Doomsday Book and has a population of about 175 people . After opposition from Suffolk Coastal District Council and the parish council, a revised bid to open as late as 12.30am and 2am . on 10 nights a year, won support from officials.

Mr Rous and his venue’s manager Mr Daws have now spoken out in an attempt to pacify furious villagers. Mr Rous said: ‘A number of recent events, including numerous letter drops, have led to the misconception that Bruisyard Hall and Barn is going to be something other than an upmarket wedding and events venue, which it’s simply not. ‘The original licence application may have sounded frightening because of the hours that they covered, but of course we only ever planned to be open for a fraction of the time allowed. ‘There has been a lot of misunderstanding. It’s never been our intention to do anything other than a wedding and events venue.’ Dispute: Bruisyard Hall owner Robert Rous has spent thousands of pounds improving the barn as part of plans to extend the drinking hours at the wedding and conference venue . The venue has hosted weddings and conferences for many years but wants to capitalise on that . Sinister: A backlash provoked by an attempt to be allowed to hold late night parties in the historic Bruisyard Hall has shocked a quiet community . He added: ‘We have been holding weddings here for some time but instead of a marquee we now intend to use the newly-renovated barn, and subsequently need to apply for a licence. ‘I take my stewardship very responsibly. We are very much part of the community, my uncle used to live here and I’ve been here since 1979. It’s a family-run business, Paul is marrying my daughter, the buck will stop with us.’ Mr Daws said: ‘The people who will come here will be wanting to enjoy a weekend away in the country. The barn is designed to cater for a wedding of up to 140 people. We have absolute control over the venue and the types of events held there.

A computer programmer and entrepreneur who murdered his wife and buried her in a shallow grave near their home has been ordered to pay their children $60million compensation. Hans Reiser, 48, whose company Namesys has developed software used across the globe, was jailed in 2008 for the second-degree murder of his Russian wife Nina. Now a civil jury in a California court has decided he should pay their two children, aged 12 and 11, after they filed a lawsuit for unlawful death. Punished: Software entrepreneur Hans Reiser (right) has been ordered to pay his children $60million compensation after he was convicted of murdering their mother Nina . Lawyers for the Reisers' children, Rory and Niorline, had asked jurors in Alameda County to pay $10million to each and an additional $5million in punitive damages. However, after deliberating for several hours over two days, the jury went further and decided he should pay $25million to each child, plus $10million damages. Reiser, whose company developed the journaled computer file systems ReiserFS and Reiser4, is serving 15 years to life for strangling his wife in their Oakland Hills home. Mrs Reiser was reported missing in September 2006 and her husband was arrested and charged with her murder the following month. Murdered: Nina Reiser's body was found in a shallow grave near her California home in July 2008 . But her body was not discovered until July 2008, when Reiser agreed to lead police to the site in return for being allowed to plead guilty to second-degree murder. Reiser had previously been accused of first-degree murder, which carries a heavier sentence. Mrs Reiser's remains were found about a half a mile from the couple's home. Reiser, who represented himself during the civil trial and claimed that he had rightfully killed his wife to protect their children. Jailed: Reiser is serving 15 years to life for strangling his wife in their Oakland Hills home . He claimed his wife suffered from a range of conditions including Munchausen by proxy syndrome, in which a parent makes up illnesses in their children to gain sympathy from others. But authorities said there was no evidence that Mrs Rauser had the disorder or had abused her children. Reiser showed no emotion as the jury's verdict was read out. He had claimed that he was representing himself because he could not afford an attorney. Arturo Gonzalez, the attorney representing the Reisers' children, told the San Francisco Chronicle: 'I can't tell you how happy we are right now. 'When you fight a case like this for four years and you have jurors come back and do the right thing like this, is just a wonderful thing about our system for justice.' Jury foreman William Smith, 65, said: 'We wanted to make it reasonable for everyone involved, and so we didn't want to come up with an astronomical amount that would be thrown out and be considered unreasonable.' He said Reiser had made clear during the trial that he hated his wife, which garnered little sympathy from jurors. He said women on the panel 'quite frankly were like, ""Screw you""'. The foreman added that the Reisers' children were 'horribly damaged by this' and the jury wanted to make 'darn sure' they were well cared for. The children live in Russia with their maternal grandmother.","Software boss Hans Reiser murdered wife Nina, who went missing from their California home in 2006 .

An Air Force instructor implicated in a sweeping sex scandal at one of the nation's busiest military training bases was convicted in military court Friday of raping one female recruit and sexually assaulting several others. Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, the first Lackland Air Force Base instructor to stand trial in the scandal, was found guilty by a jury of seven military personnel on all 28 counts he faced, including rape, aggravated sexual contact and multiple counts of aggravated sexual assault. The jury deleted a clause from two counts that accused Walker of making flirtatious and lewd comments to trainees. However, it upheld the overall counts containing the deleted clauses, which accused him of trying to cultivate a sexual relationship with two trainees. Guilty: Air Force Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, seen arriving at his trial earlier Friday, was convicted of all 28 counts he faced . Sentencing: Walker, seen in a July 16 photo, faces up to life in prison and a dishonourable discharge at his sentencing hearing, which starts Saturday . Walker faces up to life in prison and a dishonourable discharge at his sentencing hearing, which starts Saturday. He showed no emotion upon hearing the verdict. Outside the base courtroom afterward, Walker was met by his father and other relatives, some of whom were crying. He will remain free pending sentencing. Walker is among 12 Lackland instructors investigated for sexual misconduct toward at least 31 female trainees. Six instructors have been charged on counts ranging from rape to adultery. Walker faced the most serious charges and was the first to stand trial. Lackland is where every American airman receives basic training. It has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year. About one in five is female, pushed through eight weeks of basic training by a group of instructors, 90 percent of whom are men. The sexual misconduct at the base apparently began in 2009, but the first woman didn't come forward until last year. The first allegations were levied against Walker, who is accused of crimes that allegedly took place between October 2010 and January 2011. Busy: Lackland is where every American airman receives basic training and has about 475 instructors for the approximately 35,000 airmen who graduate every year . According to prosecutors, Walker had sexual intercourse with 4 of the 10 female recruits. He was also accused of making flirtatious or sexually suggestive comments, sending inappropriate text messages and sometimes groping his recruits. Walker also is accused of forcing five recruits to engage in sexual acts by threatening their military careers and intimidating two of the women into lying about his alleged misconduct, prosecutors alleged. Several of Walker's alleged victims testified during his court-martial, including one airman who described how Walker lured her into an office and sexually assaulted her on a bed, ignoring her pleas to stop. The women told jurors that Walker gained their trust to get them alone in his office or an empty dormitory where he forced them into kissing, touching and intercourse. Those testifying said they didn't tell anybody at first because they feared being booted from the Air Force. Last arrival: Air Force Staff Sgt. Luis Walker, right, arrives for the fourth day of his trial at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas . The Associated Press is not naming those who testified because they are alleged sexual assault victims. Meanwhile, the case of another former Air Force training instructor has been referred to a general court-martial, according to an Air Force statement issued Friday evening. Staff Sgt. Craig LeBlanc is charged with sexual misconduct, obstructing justice and making a false official statement. He is accused of using his post as a military instructor to sexually assault and pursue a sexual relationship with one female trainee, and have a wrongful sexual relationship with another. No trial date has been set. One of the other instructors charged in the case, Staff Sgt. Peter Vega-Maldonado, pleaded guilty in June, admitting he had sex with a female trainee in exchange for a sentence of 90 days' confinement. He later acknowledged he had been involved with a total of 10 trainees - a number previously unknown to investigators.","Lackland Air Force Base instructor Luis Walker found guilty on all 28 counts .

But under tough new plans to clampdown . on litterbugs, car owners could be traced and fined up to £80 for any rubbish thrown . from their vehicle - whether they were driving at the time or not. Bringing those responsible for littering from cars to justice is currently a tall order for councils who often struggle to prove who the perpetrator was. If introduced, the new proposals - . tabled in the House of Lords - will enable them to pursue vehicle owners who can then be handed a penalty or required to name the person responsible. They will be liable even if they have no idea who threw the rubbish. Britain . currently has some of the most rubbish-strewn roads in Europe, which . councils in England alone spend more than £860 million a year to clear up. Last year, nine million drivers threw . litter from their cars. Lord . Marlesford has introduced a Private Member’s Bill to get the law changed . so that councils can try to recoup some of the cash they spend cleaning up litter by issuing fines directly to . car owners. He also wants councils to report to the public each year on how much they have spent . on contracts for clearing rubbish and which streets they clean in order to make the process more . accountable. Britain's streets are currently some of the dirtiest in Europe . The public would then be able to complain direct to councils and contractors if their streets were still dirty. The plans have been backed by Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman. CCTV cameras could be used by councils to enforce the new law, while fines would also be issued by Civil Enforcement Officers. Bin it: Car owners could be traced and fined if litter is seen being thrown from their vehicle . Councils in London already issue £100 for . littering from cars but this could be extended to the rest of England. Littering is a criminal offence which can lead to a fine of £2,500 if taken to court. Councils also hand out fixed . penalty notices of up to £80 to those caught dropping rubbish in the street. 'Nothing degrades a road more than litter,' Lord Marlesford told the Telegraph. 'The roads in England are some of the dirtiest in Europe. And it can so easily be dealt with.' American author Bill Bryson, a former president of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, last month described the country's roads as 'an informal linear tip.'

A devastated husband broke down in tears as he today told how he found his wife collapsed on the floor after she was repeatedly stabbed by her jealous lover because she ended their eight-year affair to save their marriage. Jilted Martin Bunch, 44, is accused of stabbing Jeanette Goodwin 19 times in the chest at her Southend home in Essex and then leaving her to bleed to death on her patio. Mark Goodwin, 49, a gas engineer, told the jury how he and his wife of 21 years had been planning a barbecue at her home in Southend, Essex, when Martin Bunch walked into the front room. Heartbroken: Mark Goodwin, 49, pictured left, told how he found his wife Jeanette Goodwin, 47, collapse on the floor after being 'stabbed 19 times' by her former lover Martin Bunch, 44, because she ended their eight-year affair . A jury at Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex, heard Bunch went straight up to the mother-of-three and allegedly plunged a five-inch kitchen knife into her chest. Mr Goodwin told the court: 'He walked straight up to Jeanette and from where I was standing I thought he had punched her in the stomach which I thought was very odd at the time. 'Jeanette reeled back and she was holding herself and there was blood everywhere. Jeanette said, 'he has stabbed me'. 'She grabbed me at the waist to go round me and get out of the living room door.' Crime scene: Mark and Jeanette Goodwin's family home where she was killed . He told the jury how Bunch had appeared 'smug' as he struck out with the knife and then said: 'I told her I would kill her'. Mr Goodwin continued: 'He was not in a frenzy - he was just calm.' Mr Goodwin said he tried to fight off Bunch by picking up a large lamp and swinging it at him in a desperate bid to stop him. He told the court how he had rushed . out of the frontdoor of the couple's  cul-de-sac home hoping to find his . wife but then was locked out as he realised she was still in the . property. Mr Goodwin then rushed to the back of the house and realised panels from the 6ft-high fence had been removed. He spotted his wife slumped to the ground next to a hedge in the backgarden. Mr Goodwin, who then called 999, said: 'There was blood everywhere - blood on Jeanette, blood on the plants. 'She was slumped against a hedge at . the bottom of the stairs next to the patio - she had two wounds that I . could see were not bleeding anymore and . 'I remember thinking ""that's not good"".' As Mr Goodwin gave his evidence from the witness stand the defendant could be seen smirking and at times shaking his head. At one point during the proceedings, . Bunch appeared to be mouthing words towards Mr Goodwin from behind the . re-enforced glass in the dock. The jury heard how Mrs Goodwin had . engaged in an eight-year-long affair with Bunch but broke it off in late . 2010 after confessing to her husband. Investigation: A forensic tent in the back garden of Mark and Jeanette's family home where she was found collapsed on the ground . John Dodd QC, prosecuting, said: . 'This was a brutal and determined attack by the defendant - a man who . was unwilling to accept Jeanette Goodwin had called an end to their . affair. 'He set out on that summer’s day almost a year ago intent on killing her or, at least, causing serious harm.' She called an end to the romance in late 2010 but complained to police about a number of incidents of harassment by Bunch throughout the beginning of the following year. Bunch was handed strict bail conditions banning him from contacting Mrs Goodwin or going to her house - but he was caught breaching those conditions on a number of occasions. Less than a month before her death Mrs Goodwin made a statement to police after she received voicemails, text messages and unwelcome visits from Bunch. The court heard the statement was triggered by a conversation with Bunch’s own mother, Veronica Webb, who had warned her that her son had spoken of his intent to kill his former partner. Martin Bunch, on trial for the murder of Mrs Goodwin at Chelmsford Crown Court pictured above, was on bail for allegedly harassing her at the time of her death . In a statement to police Mrs Goodwin said: 'This behaviour has left me fearful for my life. I feel extremely harassed from all the phone calls and texts I have received. I just want him to leave me alone.' Despite this statement and evidence Bunch had removed an electronic tag used to monitor a 6pm-6am curfew order, he was once again granted bail at Southend Magistrates Court, just four days before Mrs Goodwin’s death. The court heard that on the day of the attack Mrs Goodwin had seen Bunch on a grassy bank overlooking her garden but failed to report the breach of bail conditions to police. Mrs Goodwin later alerted police by pressing a specially installed panic alarm at 7.39pm but when officers arrived at the house six minutes later they found Mrs Goodwin lying on the floor with numerous stab wounds. Bunch was arrested less than 30 minutes after the attack at his mother’s home half-a-mile away. He was taken into custody where officers described him as 'verbally aggressive and emotional'. He refused to answer any questions and officers later reported hearing Mr Bunch shout: 'I can’t believe I killed the woman I love. I f****** loved that woman.' Bunch, from Southend, Essex, denies a single charge of murdering his ex-partner. The trial continues.

Ogogo, whose build-up has been disrupted by his mother's serious illness, was roared into the ring by the capacity 6,000 crowd and visibly relaxed as the bout went on.

A Dallas woman abducted at gunpoint to be be sold into the sex trade made a dramatic escape from her captors and alerted the police 24 hours after being kidnapped. Elia Beltran and her friend Karla Uribe were abducted after leaving Club Rio in West Oak Cliff in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

Driving around Dallas in Beltran's 1997 Ford Explorer, which Alcala had also stolen, Uribe said that she and Beltran were pleading for their lives. 'We were just trying to convince him,' said Uribe to WFAA.Com . 'You know, 'We have families, please don't do this, you know, if you have a heart just don't do this.'

'They were not only able to locate her, but the three people she escaped from,' said Gensler. Her 1997 Ford Explorer was found abandoned near to where the arrests were made and now police specialist victims units are working with her to piece together a case against her alleged kidnappers. 'She was very emotionally distraught over the incident that happened that day,' said Gensler. 'We were able to calm her down. 'My heart and soul goes out to her and her family.

Boris Johnson and a string of other leading politicians yesterday admitted paying tradesmen ‘cash in hand’ – 24 hours after a Treasury minister declared it ‘morally wrong’. David Gauke claimed making small cash payments was as bad as large-scale tax avoidance. Yesterday London Mayor Mr Johnson said: ‘I have certainly paid a lot of cash in hand.’ Confessing: Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, has admitted paying cash-in-hand after Tory Minister David Gauke, right, claimed such behaviour was 'morally wrong' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg also admitted it, but said he did not negotiate discounts for doing so. And sources close to Prime Minister . David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne said both men had used cash . to pay for services. Business Secretary Vince Cable . dismissed Mr Gauke’s remarks, saying: ‘Of course, it’s perfectly legal . and perfectly moral,  providing you’re not doing it with the objective . of avoiding tax and I certainly wouldn’t do that. ‘There’s nothing wrong with paying people cash. Absolutely nothing wrong at all.’ Hidden economy: A woman pays a workman, handing over cash (posed by models) He added that the real abuse was . ‘multi-billion-pound tax dodges, and that is where the Government is now . starting to crack down hard’. Mr Gauke made his comments on Monday as the Treasury launched a crackdown on tax avoidance. He later tried to row back, insisting . that he meant it was wrong to be motivated by the prospect of a discount . if no tax was paid on the work. ‘I’ve never said to a tradesman, “If I pay you cash, can I get a discount?”,’ he told BBC Newsnight. Asked if colleagues had, he replied: . ‘I don’t know, but if people do that they have to do so with the . recognition that that means taxes will be higher for the rest.’ His aides said Mr Gauke had been trying to say that paying cash was wrong if the purpose was artificially to reduce a tax bill. Yesterday a string of politicians were asked if they had paid cash in hand. Retort: A Labour MP said it was 'ridiculous' to put small payments such as five pounds for cleaning and gardening through the tax system . Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt  refused to answer, instead saying: ‘I don’t personally dodge tax.’ James Brokenshire, the Security . Minister, gave a more technical answer, saying: ‘Would I make cash . payments to avoid VAT? No, I certainly would not.’ Mr Clegg said he ‘may’ have paid tradesmen cash in hand ‘but never to avoid paying tax’. Labour leader Ed Miliband said he had . paid tradesmen in cash and accused Mr Gauke of ‘shooting from the hip’ with ‘ill-judged, off-hand comments about plumbers’. He said: ‘Just because some people are paid in cash doesn’t mean people are avoiding tax. ‘He shot from the hip without thinking about it and just started bandying around words like “morally wrong”.’ Mr Miliband accused the Government of . targeting tax avoidance to justify the cut in the top rate of income tax . from 50p to 45p for those earning more than £150,000 a year. But Tory MP Mark Garnier warned that . continued tax avoidance by tradesmen meant Britain ‘will get ourselves . into a situation like Greece’. He said stopping cash in hand payments would increase tax revenue by £120billion a year. Mr Gauke also came under scrutiny as . it emerged his wife had worked as a tax lawyer and he once worked as a . solicitor for a firm that had expertise in tax structures. Labour MP John Mann accused him of . going after the ‘working class’, saying: ‘George Osborne and his team . cannot resist attacking the working classes in Britain, while leaving . millionaires and large multinationals free to hide money in UK secured . overseas territories.’ Tax lawyer Miles Dean, of Milestone .

Both Israel and America think Iran's programme under the leadership of  President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is aimed at developing bombs, and not for peaceful purposes as Tehran claims. Iran has threatened to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by 40 per cent of the world's oil tankers, in revenge for sanctions imposed on the country. But the U.S. has insisted that it will not allow Iran to choke off one of the world's busiest shipping routes and an American military official said that 'any disruption will not be tolerated.' A Pentagon spokesman warned that Iran would destroy its own 'economic lifeline' if it disrupted the international oil trade. Tensions rose after Iran’s top naval commander bragged that shutting down the Gulf would be ‘easier than drinking a glass of water.’ And they continued to escalate with Iran revealing one of its surveillance planes has recorded video and photographed a U.S. aircraft carrier near an area where it was carrying out military maneuvers . If Iran were successfully to block access to the Strait of Hormuz, the price of crude oil would almost certainly rise dramatically. Following a mistaken report last year that the strait had already been closed, the oil price jumped by $2, to over $100 a barrel.

A classic ‘Bugatti’ left to rot in a rubbish-filled garage for almost a decade is expected to fetch more than £100,000 at auction, despite the fact it's a fake made in the 1980s. Its eccentric owner, engineer Alan Riley, bought the car in 1987, convinced it was a real grand prix-winning Bugatti Type 51 and worth up to £2million. Its true value was only discovered after Mr Riley died in 2010 and auctioneers handling his estate found it under a mountain of rubbish at his home in Worcestershire. Left to rot: The green Bugatti was left to rot in a rubbish-filled garage in Worcestershire for nine years . Classic: Eccentric engineer Alan Riley bought the Bugatti Type 51 in 1987 believing it was an authentic from the 1930s . Experts at auctioneers Brightwells discovered the 'Bugatti' was a clever fake built in the 1980s by London-based engineer Keith Butti. It has only two authentic Bugatti components, its fuel tank and the rear cross member. But the auction house, based in Leominster, Herefordshire, still expects the car to attract global attention when it is sold in September. And they're estimating the replica will fetch in excess of £100,000 when it goes under the hammer. If it was an original and authentic Type 51 Bugatti, it would be worth a staggering £2million.

Value: Incredibly, experts still estimate the fake will fetch more than 100,000 when it goes under the hammer in September . David Sewell, an independent Bugatti consultant, said: 'We never had the chance to inspect this car but now we know everything about it. 'Alan never raced the car but he took it to Bugatti meetings all around the UK. He would always say it was an original . 'It is not a genuine Type 51 but it has been built to Type 51 specification.

A benefits cheat who claimed to be wheelchair-bound is facing a hefty jail sentence after swindling £1.5m to fund a luxury lifestyle, including scuba diving holidays and a high-powered motorbike. Barry Brooks, 49, who claimed he was unable to climb stairs, had to use an electric wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich, set up a business aimed at helping get disabled people into work entitling him to receive grants. He then siphoned off cash into his own accounts. The self-styled ‘Knight’, who insisted on being called ‘Sir Barry’, stole hundreds of thousands of pounds for himself in claims put through the fake business for taxis to the office and support. 'Sir Barry': Brooks, 49, claimed he was unable to climb stairs, had to use an electric wheelchair and could not lift anything heavier than a sandwich yet was able to play in a swimming pool while holidaying in Gran Canaria . Devious: Brooks set up a business aimed at helping get disabled people into work entitling him to receive grants. He then siphoned off cash into his own accounts . Disability claims made on behalf of other ‘employees’ meant that £1million worth of grants went to the company, making the scam amount to £1.5m . The monthly claims on behalf of the company were submitted by Derek Arnold, 55, named as a co-director of the company and who described himself as Brooks’s 'sexual playmate'. Brooks, of Bromley, south east London, was put under surveillance at the end of 2009 and a search of the Bromley house he shared with Arnold revealed photographs of the pair on holiday together. Photographs included Brooks diving . around a wreck in Gran Canaria, playing ball games in a swimming pool . and driving a high-powered Suzuki motorcycle. He even ran his own . motorcycle shop. Taxi . receipts along with an extensive range of wine and other alcohol, a . newly fitted kitchen and evidence of a gym membership indicating the . pair were living in ‘comfort’ were also found. Extravagant: Brooks was put under surveillance in 2009 and a search of his Bromley house revealed photographs of him diving around a wreck in Gran Canaria . Brooks . claimed he would wear a support called a reciprocating gait orthosis, . which enabled him to walk, but nothing of the sort was found at his . home. He also claimed he . had a specially adapted motorcycle suit which enabled him to wear the . contraption underneath, but that he could not get on and off the bike . himself. The court heard that Dr Michael . Gross, a consultant neurologist called as an expert witness for the . prosecution, had reached the conclusion that Brooks 'was elaborating his . circumstances to convince or deceive, otherwise known in medical terms . as malingering. 'It is impossible to come to any conclusion other than that there is an elaboration to deceive,' he said. The court heard prosecutor Andrew Marshall turn to Brooks and say: 'Arise Sir Barry'. Brooks . and his co-defendants were involved in setting up the ‘Access Audit . Corporation’ (AAC), in 2004 to provide training and advice services to . disabled people, but found a way to defraud the access to work programme . - funded by the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP). Lies: There were also photographs of him riding a powerful Suzuki motorbike unaided . Able bodied: Brooks claimed he would wear a support called a reciprocating gait orthosis which enabled him to walk, but nothing of the sort was found at his home . Once a disabled person finds work, they may need grants to assist them in getting to work, travel whilst at work and support - and monthly claims were submitted on behalf of AAC and Brooks himself. Mr Marshall, prosecuting, said: 'What the evidence has revealed is a wholesale assault on a part of the benefit system that was designed to assist some of the more vulnerable members of our society.' It is not just the figures that are surprising, he said, 'but the audacity, the confidence and the cynicism with which this was done over a very long time'. He said Brooks had an ‘extremely persuasive and charismatic personality’ and still had supporters who saw no wrong in him despite the overwhelming evidence against him. Southwark Crown Court heard he even managed to dupe medical professionals to advance his fraudulent claims. Lover: The monthly claims made on behalf of Brooks' company were submitted by Derek Arnold, 55, named as a co-director and who described himself as Brooks's 'sexual playmate' Simon Clements, Head of Welfare, Health and Rural Prosecutions at the CPS said: 'Barry Brooks and his associates claimed . to run a business that would help people with disabilities get back to . work. Today, that business was confirmed as a complete sham. 'From the outset, Brooks himself . exaggerated very minor injuries to falsely claim £1.2m through the . government's Access to Work scheme. 'Despite his claims that he could not . walk unaided and was forced to live on the ground floor of his home, . Brooks had gym membership, was an active advanced scuba diver, and . holiday snaps show him jumping energetically into a swimming pool.' They . had surveillance going back to 2010 showing Brooks walking, shopping . and driving unaided, he said, and towards the end of 2011 there is also . evidence he was actively managing a pub. He continued: 'He has been a very active scuba diver, reaching advanced diver status...This is a clear sham. He was physically able to carry out all these activities but at the same time was purporting to be severely disabled in order to make these claims.' Brooks along with Arnold were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. Brooks was found . guilty of obtaining a living allowance dishonestly by . stating he was dependent on his children for lifting and carrying on a . form dated May 30, 2009. Both men will be sentenced at a later date. Judge Beddoe said he expected Brooks, who spent the entire trial in a wheelchair, to be standing when he sentenced him. Arnold was also convicted on a charge of making a false . representation in order to obtain benefit. Co-defendants Robert Harris, 55, and John White, 78, were cleared of conspiracy to defraud. It . can also now be revealed that Arnold may face further criminal charges . after being linked to a blog apparently accusing the trial judge of . corruption. Arnold is . thought to be the behind a series of postings uploaded to the internet . under the title 'Diogenese Associates' in which repeated references have . been made to his trial. One . posting uploaded on July 15, which has now been removed from the . internet, showed a picture of Judge Beddoe next to the heading . 'Corruption at Southwark Crown Court number 8?'. The . article states at one point: 'One imagines and hopes that if we're . every [sic] brought to trial that we'll be assured of a fair hearing and . that our voice will be heard - this isn't necessarily the case . however.' It goes on to list a series of pieces . of 'evidence' said to have been withheld from jurors trying the case in . what it describes as a bid to 'to prevent justice; to allow the . prosecution to hold the upper hand and to ensure that the defence is at a . disadvantage'. The . blog concludes by saying: 'Justice be damned, it's face-saving and . cost-saving that counts here; hiding prosecution and CPS mistakes is . what counts.' After . hearing of the blog Judge Beddoe remanded Arnold in custody for the . remainder of the trial saying it was necessary to 'take a preventative . measure which may prevent further publication of this kind'.

Millions of customers’ banking details are at risk after it emerged that card readers used in shops and restaurants can be hacked. Experts have found a security flaw in chip and PIN terminals that allows thieves to download customers’ card details. There are more than one million such readers in the UK according to the UK Cards Association, which processes about 800million purchases each month. Flawed: Experts have exposed a serious weakness in the chip and PIN system. (posed by model) Thousands of terminals must now be reprogrammed. The chip and PIN system replaced the use of signatures to authorise card purchases in 2006, and combines two effective security features: a microchip to ensure the card is not counterfeit, and a personal identification number (PIN) to prove the user’s identity. However, researchers discovered that criminals can use second-hand devices purchased on eBay to load fake cards with malicious software. Once used in shops, the fakes – made to look like a normal credit or debit card – infect readers, which begin storing the details of all subsequent transactions. The criminal then returns later and uses a second card to download this data, which includes card details and PINs. A spokesman for security firm MWR told Channel 4: ‘In our demonstration we just got the card number and PIN, but a real criminal would probably reprogramme the reader to request that the card is swiped. This would give magnetic strip data which could be used to clone the card.’ Insecure: Criminals can use second-hand devices purchased on eBay to load fake cards with malicious software to scan bank details from unwitting customers . VeriFone, which makes most of the terminals used in Britain, said it is working on an update to fix the flaw. A spokesman said: ‘MWR implemented a sophisticated scenario that is technically feasible on some older systems. ‘VeriFone has developed a software update to resolve this issue in deployed systems and has already submitted the code for testing and approval on an expedited basis.’ Account numbers and PINs are sold, often in bulk, on hundreds of so-called ‘carding’ websites, often based in Eastern Europe or China. Anyone with an email address can sign up and receive access to a global network of criminals selling details from victims over the world, contributing to the £308million of card fraud committed in the UK each year. A Daily Mail investigation found one seller on a Russian website offering British credit cards, with full details of the original owner’s identity, for just £19 each. For £190, they also claimed to be able to offer access to a bank account with a credit limit of £8,000. It recently emerged that 15million Barclays customers using new contactless credit and debit cards could have their details stolen by ‘electronic pickpockets’ who brush past wallets with a mobile phone. The cards, billed as the latest in payment technology, contain a chip so that payment can be made without the need to enter a PIN. However, investigators found criminals could obtain a customer’s name, card number and expiry date by holding a smartphone fitted with simple software over a wallet containing the card.","About 800million purchases each month are processed by chip and PIN machines .

Cyclist Victoria Pendleton – ‘Queen Victoria’ – wept after winning gold in the keirin track event just 24 hours after the heartbreak of being disqualified in the team sprint. Earlier on a magnificent day, rowers Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins powered to a thrilling victory on the waters of Eton Dorney.

Jessica Ennis goes for gold in the heptathlon after a inspirational . start with a stunning victory in the 110m hurdles, while the  British . cycling  trio of Joanna Rowsell, Laura Trott and Dani King are favourites to win . the team pursuit gold at a packed velodrome. There was disappointment for swimmer . Rebecca Adlington who failed to defend her 800m freestyle title, but still picked up a bronze. That medal was matched by British judoka Karina Bryant's third-place finish in the women's 78kg+ category. The . men did their bit too when cyclists Ed Clancy, Geraint Thomas, Steven . Burke and Peter Kennaugh won gold in the team pursuit smashing the world . record as they beat Australia. Alan . Campbell cried after winning bronze in the men's single sculls and George Nash and William Satch also took bronze in the men's pair.

After her victory, Pendleton told how . she searched the crowd for her fiancé  Scott Gardner. They finally kissed . in front of 6,000 fans in an emotional scene. She said: ' I was searching for him . desperately in the crowd. I didn't know where he was... I am so glad I . found him.'

I love you,’ the 86-year-old said to his frail wife, lying on a hospital bed, in Tampa, Florida. Within 24 hours both had died peacefully. 'I love you': John Clark (left), who had been unable to speak for months, spoke clearly to tell wife Grace (right) his feelings as she lay in hospital. Within 24 hours they had both died peacefully . Mr Clark had been residing in an assisted living facility in Tampa, Florida. His wife Grace, 81, would visit him everyday until she suffered a heart attack in late June. His step-son Fred Hearns, 63, told Mr Clark that his wife was sick but did not go into details until her condition deteriorated. Then on July 22 he told his step-father that Mrs Clark was getting worse each day and then drove him to the hospital to visit his wife of more than 40 years. After seeing his wife Mr Clark returned to the home but just four hours later was found unresponsive and taken to St Joseph’s Hospital in Tampa where he was pronounced dead. The next morning doctors removed Mrs Clark’s ventilator and she died at noon, just 16 hours after her beloved husband. Two months earlier Mr Clark had moved into the Amrose Care facility after his wife could no longer care for him at home but she continued to feed and care for him. Last visit: Mr Clark spoke his final words to his wife of more than 40 years at Tampa Hospital where Mrs Clark was admitted after suffering a heart attack . The facility’s administrator Angie de la Rosa told the Tampa Bay Times that Mr Clark understood when spoken to but struggled to speak. She said: ‘If he really wanted to express himself he could emit words, almost whispering sounds.’ The couple married around 1970, spending many summers in the American state of Maryland where Mr Clark worked as a chef in resort hotels. Mr Hearns, a retired director of the Tampa Department of Community Affairs said of his step-father: ‘He was the custodian, the chef, the painter and the plumber…could cook better than anybody.’ His mother, a former data processors, was a strict enforcer of rules, even locking Mr Hearns out church when he arrived moments too late as a boy. Mr Hearns said: ‘She gave me that look that said “You know you're late. Now just wait until the singing starts”.’ After their death Mr Hearns said: ‘In my mind I could hear her telling him “John, I'll see you at 12 noon sharp”.’ Rev David Green the pastor of the Allen Temple Church in Tampa, where Mr Clark served as a trustee, said: ‘They had a marriage that was grounded by their faith.’","John Clark, 86, spoke after months of being unable to express himself .

Team GB Ambassador Prince Harry cracked a string of Olympic jokes at a reception yesterday – ribbing Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt about his bell clanging disaster, the scandal of empty seats at Olympic venues and even the drugs furore surrounding teenage Chinese swimmer Ye Shiwen. Echoing the antics of his notoriously gaffe-prone grandfather, Prince Phillip, the third in line to the throne entertained a group of young sports hopefuls in the gardens of Clarence House with a host of asides about the London Games. Top of his list was Mr Hunt who was left cringing after the prince reminded him about his by now infamous TV blunder when a bell he was ringing at an event to celebrate the opening of the Olympics flew off its handle – and narrowly avoided hitting a group of women. Scroll down for video of Prince Harry . Joker: Prince Harry raises a laugh from former sprinter Daren Campbell at a reception at Clarence House . The prince entertained a group of young sports hopefuls in the gardens of Clarence House .

Harry . had another dig again later when he told a group of young athletes: ‘I . hope you've all got tickets to watch your events’ before gesturing at . Jeremy Hunt and adding: ‘If not, this is your man.’ The School Games is a year-round . school sports initiative which uses the inspiration of London’s Olympics . and Paralympics to transform competitive sport in schools and get more . people playing sport.

Harry . told a group of children: ‘We saw what that Chinese girl did, she . knocked five seconds off her time - apparently teenagers can do that.’ Pointing at 16-year-old Jermaine Hamilton he said: ‘If they can you'll be running in seven seconds.’ The . teenager, who attends Rushcroft Sports College in Chingford, Essex won . two gold medals in the School Games - one for the 200m and one for the . 4x100m relay.

He said: ‘It was a good experience to meet Prince Harry. ‘He said good luck to me and he's looking forward to seeing me in 2016.’ Harry went on to tell the assembled guests: ‘Hopefully you’ll grow and grow and grow to be very famous and then we can beat China.’ Jason Gardener, who won a gold in the 4 x 100m relay in Athens, added: ‘It's amazing to be here to hopefully inspire the next generation. ‘To meet some of the young athletes is amazing, some of these will go onto fly the flag for our country.

It shows how important sport is to this country to have someone like him. ‘He seems to have a connection with these young people and he's in touch.‘I asked him who he thinks will win the 100 metres.

He already has the most hardware of any Olympian, but is Michael Phelps on his way to the boob tube? The Olympic swimming sensation, who is hoping to build on the sensational 19 medals he has won in the pool, has made no secret about the fact that he plans to retire after the London games. Though Phelps hasn't divulged post-retirement plans, America's top TV networks are reportedly falling over themselves hoping to land Teams USA's golden boy as a sports commentator. Most wanted: Michael Phelps could make millions after his retirement from swimming if he becomes an Olympics analyst for networks like NBC and ESPN . TMZ reports that NBC, ESPN and ABC are preparing to capture Phelps as a future Olympics commentator with huge contracts that could be worth millions - in a possible bidding war. While the networks try to woo Phelps with dollar signs, there is only one thing on the swimming champ's mind: His final race today with rival Ryan Lochte. Their first showdown of the London Olympics went to Lochte in a runaway on the opening night of the swimming competition. This one figures to be a lot closer. The U.S. stars will compete against each other for the last time in the 200-meter individual medley tonight. Teammates: Phelps' rivalry with fellow American Ryan Lochte, right, is one of the biggest stories of the 2012 games . Lochte qualified fastest in 1 minute, 56.13 seconds. Phelps was 98-hundredths of a second back in third. 'We love racing against each other,' said Phelps, who plans to retire after the games. 'Neither one of us likes to lose. I like to say we bring out the best in one another.' In between them again is Laszlo Cseh of Hungary. He's been the perennial also-ran in the last two Olympics, taking bronze behind Phelps at the 2004 Athens Games and silver four years ago in Beijing when Phelps won and Lochte was third. Phelps could accomplish one more bit of history on Day 6 at the pool. Head-to-head: The swimmers will face each other during the 200m IM in London today . Golden: Phelps and Lochte pose with the gold medals they won in the men's 4 x 200-meter freestyle relay . A victory would make him the first male swimmer to win an individual event in three consecutive Olympics. Japanese star Kosuke Kitajima failed to defend either of his titles in the 100 or 200 breaststrokes, leaving Phelps a chance to accomplish the feat. He missed on his first two tries at a three-peat, finishing fourth in the 400 IM (Lochte won) and second in the 200 butterfly. Lochte has a busy schedule on what could be a big night for the U.S. Calling it quits: Phelps has said that he plans to retire at the end of the London Olympics . He'll try to defend his title in the 200 backstroke final, with teammate Tyler Clary pressuring him as the fastest qualifier. Then a short time later, Lochte returns for the 200 IM final. Though friends, the two have sparked a rivalry in the pool, with many Americans split on who to support. But Phelps appears to have one backer that Lochte does not - the leader of the free world. Phelps, still reeling from the previous day's tweet, described the call as 'pretty cool'. 'I answered the phone and the voice said ""Michael?"" ""Yes."" ""Please hold for the President of the United States,""' he told reporters today, after qualifying for the 100-meter butterfly semi-final. 'I was like, ""wow.""' Glory: Though friends, the two have sparked a rivalry in the pool, with many Americans split on who to support . The president, he said, told Phelps the country was supporting him and proud of his performance.'He finished by saying 'make sure you tell your mom I said hi'.' Phelps' mother Debbie, who raised Phelps and his two sisters single-handedly, is considered to be a great contributor to his success, helping him with his hyperactivity, and egging him on from the stands at every meet. The U.S. team continued its strong showing with victories yesterday by Nathan Adrian in the 100 free and the team of Missy Franklin, Dana Vollmer, Shannon Vreeland and Allison Schmitt in the 4x200 free relay on Wednesday. Adrian won a thrilling race that came down to the end. He got to the wall one-hundredth of a second ahead of James 'The Missile' Magnussen of Australia, becoming the first American to win the 100 free since Matt Biondi at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.

The horse with the weight of a U.S. presidential campaign riding on her back did not disappoint. Ann Romney said today that Rafalca 'thrilled me to death' with a solid performance at her Olympic debut in dressage - an ancient equestrian sport that has been thrust into the political spotlight thanks to Mrs Romney's partial ownership in the horse. The 15-year-old, German-bred mare has been the source of political jokes and Democratic ads questioning how U.S. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney can presume to know the problems of ordinary Americans when he inhabits the rarefied world of dressage. Proud owners: Ann Romney, Elisabeth Meyer and Amy Eberling applaud after Rafalca's performance in the equestrian dressage competition in London . Mrs Romney was in the VIP section of the equestrian stadium at Greenwich Park for Rafalca's competition, watching literally from the edge of her seat as the mare completed the 7-minute Grand Prix test. She and Rafalca's other two owners gave horse and rider Jan Ebeling a rousing standing ovation and a wave as they left the arena. Their score of 70.243 per cent put them in 13th place with half the 50 competitors still to go. 'She was consistent and elegant,' Mrs Romney told the AP. 'She did not disappoint. She thrilled me to death.' Ebeling, too, was pleased with the performance. Ride on: Jan Ebeling from United States rides Rafalca in the equestrian dressage competition . 'She felt really strong and is peaking at the right time,' he said. 'She was amped up, a little stronger than usual. She had more oomph. The trick is to manage that.' He said he hadn't spoken to Mrs Romney before the competition - he never does - but said her final words of advice to him were to 'Do what you know (how) to do, and do what you do best.' 'It was a good score. Overall it was great,' he said. 'Knowing my three ladies, they're probably in tears right now,' he said of Mrs Romney and co-owners Beth Meyer and Amy Ebeling, his wife. At the halfway point in the first phase of the team dressage competition, Britain and Germany were vying for gold and the Netherlands and Sweden for bronze. Britain's Carl Hester on Uthopia scored 77.72 per cent in the early going, followed by teammate Laura Bechtolsheimer on Mistral Hojris with 76.839 per cent and Germany's Dorothee Schneider on Diva Royal with 76.277. Horseman: Jan Ebeling, seen here riding Rafalca, is the husband of the horse's co-owner Amy Ebeling . Anky van Grunsven of The Netherlands, who won the individual gold in the past three Olympic games, trailed in fifth with 73.343 on Salinero, her partner in 2004 and 2008 and now considered somewhat past his prime but still a solid team horse. 'The only thing I want now is a good team score,' said van Grunsven. 'I'm not here for myself but for the team.' All 50 riders perform the Grand Prix dressage test - half each on Thursday and Friday. They return to perform the harder Grand Prix Special test on August 7 to determine team medals. The highest scoring riders will then move forward to the freestyle competition Aug. 9 to decide individual medals. The sport is the equine equivalent of ballet. A rider, clad in top hat and tails, takes the horse through a series of steps that look like the horse is dancing: twirling pirouettes, prancing trots and the crowd-pleasing 'flying change,' which looks like the horse is skipping. In addition to Rafalca, another athlete grabbed attention at Greenwich Park on Thursday: Japan's Hiroshi Hoketsu, who became the oldest competitor at the 2012 London Olympics when he and his horse Whisper cantered into the ring. The 71-year-old Hoketsu was also the oldest competitor at the 2008 Beijing Games. An even greater feat may be that it's been 48 years since his first Olympic appearance. He competed in equestrian show jumping at the 1964 Tokyo Games. 'The biggest motivation I have to keep competing is that I feel I am improving,' Hoketsu said.Hoketsu is currently the second-oldest Olympian ever. Hoketsu will have to wait until 2016 to catch the record-holder - Oscar Swahn of Sweden - who won a silver medal in shooting in 1920 at age 72. Spectator: Rafalca's turn in the arena put a spotlight on an equestrian sport popular in Europe but not well-known beyond, as well as on the vast personal wealth of Mitt and Ann Romney, pictured . Rafalca's turn in the equestrian arena put a spotlight on an equestrian sport that is popular in Europe but little known beyond, as well as on the Romneys vast personal wealth. The issue has become a campaign sore spot given the tough economic times in the United States. He is worth as much as $250million. A topflight dressage horse can cost more than six figures. Upkeep runs a few thousand dollars a month and transport and competition fees cost tens of thousands. The Romneys own several horses; Ann Romney rides as part of her therapy for multiple sclerosis. Yet while horse owners may need deep pockets to maintain their dancing steeds, the riders very often come from more modest means. Ebeling emigrated from Germany in 1984 hoping to find greater financial and professional opportunities in the U.S. than he could at home. That said, the sport does have an aristocratic background. Dating from ancient Greece, dressage was revived in European royal courts during the Renaissance as an art form.","Rafalca finishes in 13th place in Olympics debut during Grand Prix test in equestrian sport of dressage .

I'm going to be voting for him,' Eastwood told Romney supporters Friday night. 'He just made my day,' Romney said. 'What a guy.' Standing at Romney's side, Eastwood said . he was filming Mystic River in Massachusetts almost a decade ago when . he first saw political advertisements featuring Romney, who was running . for governor at the time.

On Monday Holmes was formally charged with 24 counts of murder and 116 counts of attempted murder in the shooting rampage at the midnight screening of the Dark Knight Rises on July 20. Holmes appeared just as dazed as he did in his first court appearance last week, but at one point exchanged a few words with one of his attorneys in the packed courtroom. Each death carried two separate murder charges, one for showing premeditation and one for showing extreme indifference to life. Both of the charges carry the death penalty as a possible sentence. Holmes was also charged with one count of possessing an explosive device and one count of violent crime. The suspect faces a total of 142 criminal charges. Prosecutors have 60 days to decide whether or not they are going to seek the death penalty.","Carli Richards, 22, was shot on her right arm, both of her legs, chest, back and rear with a shotgun by James Holmes during a Batman screening .

She became known to the world as the Angel of Mostar for her work in saving wounded children and their families in the besieged Bosnian city during the Balkans war. And with the huge dangers she faced in the war-torn country, Sally Becker has spoken previously of the debt she owed to Major Bill Foxton - who, she says, helped to save her life after she was ambushed by a masked gunman in 1998. But as well as owing her life to the highly-decorated officer, the 51-year-old has also revealed for the first time that Major Bill Foxton was the father of the unborn  daughter she was carrying at the time of the attack. The Angel of Mostar Sally Becker, pictured with Major Foxton in the Balkans, who she has revealed for the first time also father her daughter . Sally, who rescued up to 250 children from Bosnia and Kosovo during the Nineties conflict, says that she has only now decided to reveal the truth following Major Foxton's death in 2009. Tragically, the former army officer committed suicide after losing up to £1 million of his life savings in financier Bernard Madoff's £35billion fraud. In an interview with The Sun, the Balkans hero said she had always hoped her daughter - named Billie, after her late father - would be reunited with him - a dream which she says broke her heart when she knew it could not come true. Speaking about when she first told the former Army Officer that she was expecting his child, she said: 'I rang to tell Bill and his first words were, 'I would be honoured to father your child.' British aid worker Sally Becker rescued the lives of up to 250 children during the Balkans conflict . 'Then he dropped the bombshell that he was still married and he asked me to never reveal he was Billie's father. 'I have always respected that but when Bill died I realised I had no-one to protect any more.' Sally, who now lives in Brighton, has previously said that she owed her life to Major Foxton, who headed up the European Commission monitoring mission in the Balkans war. Major Bill Foxton, pictured, whom Sally has now revealed also fathered her baby daughter who is named after him . 'I met Bill in 1998 during a mission to deliver aid to the refugees on the Kosovo-Albanian border,' she said. 'He was very charismatic and extremely knowledgeable, with a great sense of humour. 'When the nurses left, there was no one around to perform the minor surgical procedure necessary for my leg wound to heal. So Bill, who was trained in field medicine, took over. 'Five or six times a day, I gritted my teeth while he dug away at the wound. He patiently removed the blue cotton threads that were blasted through my leg on the point of the bullet. He also had to snip away dead tissue to avoid the gangrene. 'I have no doubt that without his help, I would have lost my leg.' As well as making the startling revelations about the identity of her daughter's father, the former aid worker - who was tasked with being part of the team who carried the Olympic flag into the stadium at last weekend's London 2012 Opening Ceremony - spoke of her devastation upon hearing news of Major Foxton's death in her new book 'Sunflowers and Snipers'. She wrote that it broke her heart that he had chosen to die alone. In a previous interview, the Angel of Mostar has also spoken of the admiration for the man she now admits fathered her child. She said: 'On his days off, Bill liked to go fishing. On one trip he saw a group of people in some distress. A small boy had been chasing after his dog when there was an explosion and the dog was killed. Sally Becker, far right, carried the Olympic Flag during the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Games last Friday night . 'The child was now trapped in the minefield, afraid to move. 'Slowly, Bill crawled towards the child, using a knife to gently detect mines buried just beneath the surface. He managed to reach the boy and brought him safely back to his family. 'Bill hadn't mentioned it to anyone, but when the family entered the town talking about the heroic action of the man with red hair and a hook, he was soon tracked down and was later awarded a medal for his bravery.' Sally Becker, right, was imprisoned during her time in the Balkans after trying to cross the border between Albania and Yugoslavia with refugees . Major Foxton served in the French Foreign Legion before joining the British Army in 1969, serving with the Royal Green Jackets until 1975. He went on to serve with British officers in the Sultan of Oman's Armed Forces. He was awarded both the MBE and the OBE. His last overseas trip saw him run humanitarian projects in Afghanistan before retiring last November. Sally added: 'I hadn't seen Bill for several years but I knew he was in Afghanistan recently. So when I heard the tragic news, I immediately assumed he had been killed by a stray bullet or bomb. 'I was profoundly shocked to hear that he died alone on a park bench in Southampton.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Sally Becker, 51, who saved the lives of 250 children during the Balkans conflict, has kept the dramatic truth about the father of her daughter a secret until now .

Upset: Anthea Turner is said to be considering divorce proceedings against 50-year-old Grant Bovey after claims he cheated on her with heiress Zoe de Mallet Morgan, pictured . He has broken Anthea Turner’s heart with a woman young enough to be his daughter. And yesterday it emerged that Grant Bovey is linked to his alleged 24-year-old lover through his own children. Miss Turner is said to be considering divorce proceedings against 50-year-old Bovey after claims he cheated on her with heiress Zoe de Mallet Morgan. But as the former GMTV presenter told how she was ‘devastated’ by her husband’s apparent infidelity, it emerged that his daughter Amelia shares friends on Facebook with his new flame. A girl called Natalia Shand is friends with both Amelia, 19, and Miss de Mallet Morgan on social networking sites. According to her Facebook page, Miss Shand was a pupil at the private Hurtwood House school near Dorking in Surrey, which Bovey’s eldest daughter, Lily, 20, also attended. And Miss Shand is not the only link. Another of Miss de Mallet Morgan’s friends on social networking sites, Olivia Stovold, is also friends with Miss Turner. Miss Turner is very selective about whom she allows as friends on Facebook, requesting that those who are ‘not a family member or a close friend’ do not contact her. It is not known where Miss de Mallet Morgan went to school and she has now removed her Facebook profile from the site. The revelations come as friends of Miss Turner say she has been desperately trying to work out how her husband could have met Miss de Mallet Morgan, her initial suspicion being that they met at a race meeting in Ascot last year. The romance is believed to have started while Miss Turner was working on a TV programme in Canada. Rumours of Bovey’s extra-marital relationship with Miss de Mallet Morgan first surfaced as early as two years ago. At the time Bovey publicly boasted about being home alone while his wife worked abroad trying to keep the family afloat after he was made bankrupt. ‘In Guildford having lunch with my children Anthea in Canada!!’ he wrote in the first message at the end of  May 2010. Then, on June 7, he wrote  ‘AT [Anthea Turner] in Canada’, before adding a minute later: ‘Anthea in Canada On my own for a few weeks!!!!’. After no further tweets for a week, he then posted: ‘AT in Canada at home tonight with some mates watching footie!!’ In September Bovey sent another message remarking on his wife’s absence, but this time before she had even gone. ‘Anthea back to Canada in two weeks!!’ he wrote. Miss de Mallet Morgan is thought to be out of the country. Yesterday a friend said: ‘We have no comment.’ On her mind: Friends of Miss Turner say she has been desperately trying to work out how her husband could have met Miss de Mallet Morgan . Link: It has emerged that Bovey's daughter Amelia shares friends on Facebook with his new flame . Miss Turner, whose career includes stints on Blue Peter and GMTV, married property developer Bovey 12 years ago after he left his wife Della for her. He is no longer at the couple’s £5million mansion in Esher, Surrey. A friend of Miss Turner’s said: ‘Anthea is getting into the angry phase now. She’s going away for a few days to celebrate her step-daughter’s birthday and she will decide what to do then. 'She was devoted to Grant and only went away to earn money because he lost all of their money.’ Another source said Bovey’s alleged affair may have gone on for longer than originally thought, saying: ‘A couple of years ago there was a rumour going around Surrey that they were seeing each other.’ Plush: The couple's £5 million Surrey home, with Anthea has asked her husband of 12 years to leave . The couple managed to keep hold of their luxury home, despite Grant being declared bankrupt last year . Interior designer Miss de Mallet Morgan comes from wealthy country stock. Her parents Tommy and Louise are millionaires. Miss Turner, who has also had stints on reality shows including Celebrity Big Brother and Hell’s Kitchen, talked several years ago about the financial pressures she and Bovey had faced. The one-time TV golden girl had to sell her £10million estate in 2009 and a year later Bovey was declared bankrupt after the collapse of his property company. Last night, Bovey declined to say whether he has been seeing Miss de Mallet Morgan for two years, telling the Daily Mail: ‘I don’t want to add any fuel to the fire.’ Happier times: The pair married in 2000 after meeting two years earlier, when Grant left his wife for Anthea .","Miss Turner is said to be considering .

Everyone remembers that scene from Only Fools and Horses where Del Boy and Rodney donned too tight Batman and Robin outfits... Well, they do in the UK at least. And while the rest of the world may have been baffled why two men were driving a battered old van in the middle of the Olympic Stadium, it did give the British crowd a laugh, with even the Royal attendees Prince Harry and Kate obviously amused. In typically British humour, the classic Only Fools and Horses scene that sees Del Boy played by David Jason and Rodney played by Nicolas Lyndhurst becoming real-life crime fighters while dressed as the comic heroes for a fancy dress party was recreated with a bang in the stadium. 'You plonker!': Del Boy and Rodney's Reliant Robin - complete with the 'Trotters Independent Trading Co' written on the side - drives on to the stage with an overheating engine . Off with a bang: The battered old van then blew up as scenes from the movie The Italian Job were shown on big screens around the stadium . 'You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!': The sketch was a mix of the classic British film The Italian Job and the most popular episode of the Only Fools and Horses TV show . The old bright yellow Reliant Robin was driven on to the stage before it suddenly exploded as the two characters dressed as Batman and Robin jumped out. Michael Caine's classic 1969 film The Italian Job with the famous line: 'You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off' was shown on the big screens at the same time as 1980s pop stars Madness singing one of their most popular hits, Our House. Echoing the song's original video, saxophonist Lee Thompson was lifted to play solo high above the track. More than 21 million viewers watched in 1996 when the comic pair ended the 13th series of the eternally popular sitcom Only Fools and Horses based in a London tower block dressed up as the comic pair. Even Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton couldn't help but laugh at the sketch inspired by the typically British sense of humour that made the series so popular. 'Who dares wins': Performers dressed up as Batman and Robin from an episode of the Only Fools and Horses make a run for it . Lovely jubbly: Batman and Robin then rushed off the stage to go and fight some local crime... or to get changed . Do the Mobot: The Only Fools and Horses sketch was performed along to Madness playing Our House as the lead singer Graham McPherson paid homage to Mo Farah by doing the Mobot . Having a laugh: Prince Harry and Kate Duchess of Cambridge laughing at the sketch . The funny sketch was reminiscent of the opening ceremony when the Queen filmed a sketch with James Bond actor Daniel Craig appearing to show her jumping out a helicopter and parachuting into the Olympic stadium. One person joked on Twitter that a NBC Commentator on the Olympics told his American viewers: 'That is not actually Batman but a British folk hero known as Del Boy. Sort of like Robin Hood'. The music then continued right through the show with a host of great British music acts and songs, including Oasis, Annie Lennox, Kaiser Chiefs, the Spice Girls and George Michael. But that wasn't the last comedy moment for the crowd after home-made flying machines made several attempts to get off the ground as a would-be rocket man played by Monty Python comedian Eric Idle collapsed under the stage - only to return to lead the crowds in a new version of Always Look On The Bright Side of Life.

A six-year-old boy who died last . summer after falling from the grand staircase at his father's luxurious . mansion was likely assaulted before plunging to his death, a new medical . report claimed. Max Shacknai's death was the first in a . bizarre series of events that led to his father's girlfriend being found . hanged, bound and naked, from a balcony at the palatial home in . San Diego two days later. Police declared both deaths solved . and that pharmaceutical millionaire Jonah Shacknai was not involved in . either. Tragedy: Max Shacknai's death was the first in a bizarre series of events that led to his father's girlfriend being found hanged, bound and naked, from a balcony at the palatial home in San Diego two days later . Max Shacknai was in the care of his father's girlfriend Rebecca Zahau at the time of his death. Max's death was ruled an accident and Miss Zahau's death deemed a suicide. Max's mother Dinah Shacknai - who divorced from Max's father in 2010 - refused to believe these findings and instead hired her own team of investigators. The new report claimed that Max was the victim of a homicide. Jonah and Dinah Shacknai were said to have had a tumultuous and sometimes violent relationship and they repeatedly accused each other of verbal and physical abuse in the short time they were married. Police had to be called to the 27-room mansion on three different occasions. Ms Shacknai called on the Coronado police to reopen the case after the findings from Dr Judy Melinek, a San Francisco-based . forensic pathologist, and Dr Robert Bove, an injury biomechanics . expert. Search for answers: Dinah Shacknai hired a new team of investigators who cast doubt on the original autopsy report that her son Max's death was an accident . She told Fox News: 'I can't imagine anyone in the world wanting to harm Maxie. He was the most sweet, loving and gentle boy.' In the new report, both medical experts said that Max had injuries consistent with being beaten. Dr Melinek reported that the child had injuries on his body which could not just have come from a fall, adding that it was impossible for Max to have bumped into the balcony and fallen over. The claims appeared to point the finger at Jonah Shacknai's girlfriend Rebecca which the late woman's sister strongly denied today. Mystery: Max Shacknai's multimillionaire father, Jonah Shacknai, was not home at the time, but Mr Shacknai's girlfriend, Miss Zahau, 32, was along with her 13-year-old sister . Mary Zahau told RadarOnline: 'The thought that Rebecca would cause Max harm is preposterous.' Mary added that the relationship between her sister and Max was a close and loving one, with her treating him like her own child. The Coronado police department said it would review the report and decide whether to reopen the investigation. Max died at the hospital shortly after he tumbled down the grand staircase at the historic Spreckels manor. From above: An aerial view of the historic mansion in California where the tragedy happened in July . His multimillionaire father, Jonah Shacknai, was not home at the time, but Mr Shacknai's girlfriend, Miss Zahau, 32, was along with her 13-year-old sister. Jonah Shacknai founded pharmaceutical giant Medicis and has been chairman and chief executive since 1988. The company makes dermatological and aesthetic pharmaceutical products and took $700million in revenue last year. Shacknai . has two other children from a previous marriage to Kimberly James, a . pharmaceuticals sales representative for rival firm Johnson & . Johnson. The couple married in April 1993 in Bel Air, California, before filing for divorce in 1999. She later told a psychologist that on their honeymoon he asked her if she thought the marriage was a mistake. Family . Court records show the couple reached a joint-custody agreement in 2001 . for two children: a 14-year-old girl and a 13-year-old boy. Shacknai later married Dina Romano,Max's mother, and the couple divorced in 2008. Miss Zahau, from Myanmar, had been dating . the multimillionaire for two years and friends said he had been planning . on proposing to her. Miss Nalepa began working as an ophthalmic technician in April 2008, but left in December 2010 to devote more time to Mr Shacknai and his three children. Two days after Max's death on July 16, Mr Shacknai discovered Miss Zahau hanging dead from an outside balcony. She was naked, gagged and her hands and feet bound. Miss Zahau's parents also believe that their daughter was murdered. They hired a private pathologist to conduct a second autopsy. That expert said his findings cast doubt on the suicide ruling. However, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore said the second look revealed no new information and the case remains closed. Her sister said she spoke with her sister the night before her body was found and she gave no hint that she planned to take her life. She said she planned to bring Mr Shacknai breakfast and a change of clothes the next morning to the hospital where his son was being treated. Dr Cyril Wecht, a private consultant in high-profile investigations ranging from the Kennedy assassination to the death of Anna Nicole Smith, made a nationally televised appearance today on the Dr Phil show to render his opinion about the bizarre death of Rebecca Zahau. Dr Wecht performed a second, independent autopsy on Miss Zahau's body last month at the request of relatives who have challenged the official determination of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and coroner that she took her own life. He agreed with the official autopsy finding that the cause of Miss Zahau's death was asphyxiation by hanging, but said he strongly doubted she killed herself. 'While I am not prepared to unequivocally, with absolute scientific certainty, say that it was a homicide and that it was not a suicide, I lean very strongly toward it being a homicide, something involving foul play. And I lean very strongly against it being a suicide,' he said. Dr Wecht said he was particularly troubled by findings in both autopsies that Miss Zahau had suffered blows to the top of her head, indicated by four separate hemorrhages beneath the scalp. He said such an injury pointed to the possibility that she was knocked unconscious with a blunt object and could explain why police said there was no sign of a struggle at the scene. Dr Wecht said he was also puzzled as to why Miss Zahau's neck was not broken by the force of her fall from the balcony. He said the way in which Miss Zahau would have had to tie herself up was possible, but implausible.","Max Shacknai found on first floor of the palatial home in San Diego .

A whale skeleton which featured in the classic novel Moby Dick has been brought into the spotlight after over £400,000 was awarded by the National Lottery to repair its final resting place. The remains of the 1825 sperm whale have been immaculately preserved since inspiring author Herman Melville to write his sea-faring classic. But after nearly 200 years of being kept at Burton Constable Hall in East Yorkshire, the whale's historic home is to be restored. House technician Gary Dewson with the skeleton of the sperm whale at its final resting place in Yorkshire . The 58.5ft skeleton was visited by Melville in the 1800s when he came to England to research Moby Dick. He was so taken in by an exhibit of the whale that he included a direct reference to it in his 1851 novel. The stable block at the Grade one listed stately home, where the whale is now housed, will benefit from £417,800 of funding. The sperm whale became a national sensation after it was washed up on a beach at Tunstall and found by a local woman on April 28 1825. Tourists travelled from far and wide to gawp at the astonishing sight, hacking off bits of the carcass to take home as souvenirs before science arrived at the scene. Hull doctor James Alderson performed a dissection on the beach and his findings were the talk of the Royal Cambridge Philosophical Society. After providing one of the first scientific studies of a whale, the remains were claimed by the Constable family, who occupied the hall for 700 years. The family also owned the title to the Lord of the Siegniory of Holderness. The Seigniory was a title founded by William the Conqueror in 1067 which made royal fish, as whales were called, the property of the holder. The skeleton was brought to Burton Constable Hall and set up in the park as a public attraction. Burton Constable: the stately home where the skeleton of the whale has been for nearly 200 years . The paying visitors included author . Thomas Beale who wrote up an account of the dissection in his hugely . influential The Natural History of the Sperm Whale. It was a few years later when Melville came to England to research Moby Dick that he was . so taken by the story of the exhibit he referenced it in his novel. The passage states: 'Moreover, at a place in Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale. 'Sir Clifford's whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony cavities - spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan - and swing all day upon his lower jaw. An 1825 illustration of the beached whale that inspired Moby Dick, based on a drawing by Richard Iveson of Hedon . 'Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side. 'Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead.' The remains of the skeleton were recovered from the park in 1995 and are now exhibited in the Great Barn in the stable block. The estate is now owned by the Burton Constable Foundation which manages it as a museum. Director Dr David Connell said the award was 'a fantastic opportunity' which meant the 'renaissance' of the Hall and its surrounding parkland could continue. Repairs will start later this year on the stable block which includes stalls, grooms' quarters and the stable master's room. It consists of two buildings arranged around two courtyards, one to stable riding and carriage horses, the other to accommodate farming stock. The Heritage Lottery Fund grant will restore the original 1770 and later 19th century features and create new volunteer facilities, community exhibitions and workshop spaces. Fiona Spiers, head of the lottery fund in Yorkshire and Humberside, said the stable block was 'of national significance'. 'This project, once complete, will bring to life the important role that horses played in our social and economic history,' she added. Records dating back hundreds of years . outline claims of various whales coming ashore, including sperm whales, which . were the most valuable because of their oil.","Author Herman Melville wrote about skeleton of sperm whale after visiting it at stately home in Yorkshire .

Murphy then tried to disarm Page but suffered multiple gun shots to the neck and his extremities. Despite these injuries, he waved off help so his fellow officers could save others. Oak Creek Police Chief John Edwards said that Murphy, along with another police officer who eventually shot the gunman dead, 'stopped a tragedy that could have been a lot worse'.

His neighbours in Cudahy, where he moved just two weeks ago, noted that the man was covered in tattoos and 'kind of kept to himself'. 'I just remember seeing (a tattoo that said) 9-11. I just remember thinking it was weird, thinking ""Why would you have that tattooed on you?""' April Reyna told TMJ4.

The airfield was developed in 1914 after the outbreak of the First World War. It was one of several airfields established in the South East of England whose role was to provide home defence cover for London. In the earliest part of its existence . the accommodation consisted of wooden hutting and tents - the buildings . now present on the airfield were added later.

'We have been working our way tirelessly through the restoration and I think we are on building number nine now.'

Actor Bob Hoskins has put his £895,000 country retreat up for sale after announcing he is retiring from showbusiness following his diagnosis with Parkinson’s disease.

The announcement brings to an end a silver screen career which spanned four decades and included Hollywood hits such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit. His most recent appearance was in Snow White and the Huntsman, released this year and starring Kristen Stewart. A statement released by his agent said: 'Bob Hoskins wishes to announce that he will be retiring from acting, following his diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease last autumn. 'He wishes to thank all the great and brilliant people he has worked with over the years, and all of his fans who have supported him during a wonderful career. 'Bob is now looking forward to his retirement with his family, and would greatly appreciate that his privacy be respected at this time' Symptoms of Parkinson’s include tremors, muscle stiffness, difficulty with movement and a gradual slowing down of the body.

Judge Mushtaq Khokhar said it had been 'natural' for Vincent Cooke 'to put up a fight' after he stabbed career criminal Raymond Jacob, 37, up to eight times following the raid in September last year. During the terrifying burglary at Mr Cooke's £350,000 four-bedroom house in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, Jacob held a knife to the businessman's throat before frogmarching him upstairs in search of jewellery and cash. Vincent Cooke, left, who was told by . the Crown Prosecution Service that he will face no further action after . stabbing Raymond Jacob, right, to death in self defence after the career criminal broke into his home . But when the victim’s wife Karen, 34, and 12-year old son Anthony returned home from a football tournament, Mr Cooke grabbed a carving knife and repeatedly stabbed Jacob during a violent struggle. Mr Cooke, 39, who said he acted in lawful self defence, was questioned for 12 hours and later released without charge but was kept on bail for almost a month until he was told he would not be charged. He and his family have since left their luxury home after suffering nightmares about the tragedy. Yesterday full details of the raid emerged as Jacob’s accomplice Michael Thorpe, 33, of Heald Green, Manchester, was jailed for ten years after admitting aggravated burglary. Passing sentence, Judge Mushtaq Khokhar told Thorpe: 'For anyone who lends themselves to an enterprise of this nature, it would be perfectly obvious that you would scare the victim with a knife by brandishing it and it was foreseeable that it might be used.

He added: 'It . was a sad loss of life but at the same time if you embark upon unlawful . enterprise with all the risks that are attached, serious injuries can . occur.' It also emerged the raiders had been given . information about Mr Cooke’s safe from the victim’s uncle who helped him . run a transport storage firm. Mr . Cooke had been at home watching TV when he answered a knock at the door . from a man in a high visibility jacket claiming to be from the gas . board only for Jacob and Thorpe to burst in. Mark Kellet, prosecuting said: 'One was holding a clipboard and paperwork which was part of the deception to gain entry. 'One shouted ""you are being robbed"" and were brandishing knives. One of the men shouts ""upstairs, upstairs"" and holds a knife to the face of Mr Cooke and frogmarched him upstairs to the study where the safe is. 'The relative and former business partner of Cooke was said to be the source of information that led to the house being targeted.' Mr Kellet explained how the men then went downstairs to the kitchen when Mr Cooke's wife and son returned. Grand: During the terrifying burglary at Mr Cooke's £350,000 four-bedroom house in Bramhall, near Stockport, Greater Manchester, Jacob held a knife to the businessman's throat . 'The panic and confusion that followed caused Mr Cooke to grab the first thing that came to his hands and that was a knife from the knife block,' Mr Kellet said. 'Raymond Jacob lunged at him and the two collided and fell to the ground and it became a knife fight. Mr Cooke said ""I felt like I was now fighting for my life, if I did not stab him first he would stab and kill me"".' Mr Cooke managed to break free but then heard screaming and saw Jacob fighting for his life and dialled 999. Paramedics were unable to revive Jacob and he was declared dead at the scene. Thorpe was arrested later after a neighbour spotted him fleeing the scene in a Citroen Berlingo and made a note of the registration plate. He later claimed he and Jacob had been invited into the house by Mr Cooke to discuss a business deal importing trainers, but a violent row broke out and Jacob was killed. Mr Kellet said: 'In a victim impact statement from Karen it said stress and anxiety had been caused to the whole family caused by having men in the house. 'It had an effect in terms of mental health and a financial impact and impacted Anthony in particular and they had to move out of the area at a time when Anthony was involved in GCSE’s. Moving away from family and friends has a significant impact on him and what happened to his house.' 'I felt like I was now fighting for my life, if I did not stab him first he would stab and kill me'Vincent Cook, homeowner . Jacob had dozens of convictions for burglary, robbery and theft. He once served an 18-month prison sentence for beating a man unconscious and leaving him looking 'like a piece of meat'. In a statement issued at the time he was vindicated Mr Cooke said: 'I hope to now be able to get on with my life but will never forget the day that I had to fight for my life. 'I just want to get my life back on track. I’m still very traumatised by what happened. I’m still having nightmares every night about this incident.' After the case, Senior Investigating Officer, Andy Tattersall, of Greater Manchester Police said: 'The fact that Thorpe was not armed that night and did not take part in the planning of the burglary is of little significance when you examine the tragic and unnecessary events that unfolded. 'One man lost his life, another, an innocent homeowner, lives with the knowledge that he took it, and a third will now spend several years behind bars. This incident has ended one life and destroyed two others.' Mr Cooke was the third man in Greater Manchester in as many months to be vindicated after stabbing an intruder to death in self defence. Peter Flanagan, 59, who stabbed an intruder armed with a machete to death at his Salford home, was told the following month that he would not be charged with any offence. Then Cecil Coley, 72, was told he would not face any charges after he stabbed an armed robber to death during a raid at his florists shop in Old Trafford, Manchester.","Raymond Jacob and Michael Thorpe broke into Vincent Cooke's Manchester home last September .

William Saunderson-Smith 58, was murdered in his home by the three Polish builders who were each sentenced to life in prison today . Three Polish builders who beat a reclusive multi-millionaire to death and went on a spending spree with his money have each been jailed for life. Dawid Rymar, Slawomir Bugajewski and Ireneusz Mydlarz crept into 58-year-old William Saunderson-Smith’s bedroom and ambushed him as he slept, before making off with £2,000. £250,000 in cash in the attic of the property, as well as £100,000 secreted in another house owned by Saunderson-Smith, went unnoticed by the killers. The court heard Rymar, 24, and Bugajewski, 39, spent the money they had stolen on a trip to Paris, where they posed for photographs in front of the Eiffel Tower, en route to their native Poland. 37-year-old Mydlarz, flew directly back to his homeland, but not before spending some of the money he had stolen on an iPad and designer clothes. The Old Bailey was told that the trio had planned their raid in meticulous detail, scoping out nearby streets in a bid to avoid detection on CCTV. And Rymar was so confident he had cheated justice he agreed to fly back from Poland for questioning by police without an extradition warrant. But the killers had failed to notice a camera on a West Kensington hotel, which captured their movements on the night of the murder. The reclusive multi-millionaire was ambushed as he slept at his home in West Kensington, pictured . DNA from Mr Saunderson-Smith was also found inside a Land Rover Bugajewski had bought from a friend a few days earlier. The three had all denied murder but were convicted following a three-week trial at the Old Bailey. Mydlarz attempted to deny his involvement by claiming he had only been employed by the pair to watch their victim’s car. The Recorder of London, Judge Peter Beaumont QC, sentenced them all to life imprisonment with a minimum of 30 years before parole. He said: ‘I see no reason to distinguish between any of you. Each of you lent yourself and involved yourself in a deliberate planned attack on a man in his own home for gain. ‘It was predicated on violence to beat out of him where the money was hidden in that house. In furtherance of that plan he was literally beaten to death in his bedroom in circumstances of extreme violence. ‘He didn’t stand a chance.’ Mr Saunderson-Smith, known to friends as John, owned a large portfolio of properties in west London, many of which were let to visitors from Australia and New Zealand. He dealt mainly in cash, stashing vast sums around the houses he owned, and preferred to use Polish builders for renovation work. His killers had carried out renovations for him in the weeks before his death and detectives believe he had unwittingly revealed the location of some of the money to at least one of them. On the night of his death they lay in wait until he turned off the lights and went to bed before forcing open a sash window and attacking him in his bedroom. He was discovered by a young assistant at his property in West Kensington, last October 21. The trio were each sentenced to life in prison at the Old Bailey today after being convicted of the murder . Each of the killers, who had all been having financial problems, got away with around £2,000 - but a further £250,000 stashed in his attic went ‘plainly undetected’, the court heard. Mr Saunderson-Smith, described by friends as ‘reclusive’ and ‘scruffy’, had been obsessive about the possibility of being burgled since his stepfather was attacked years earlier. He often kept a bayonet-type blade close to his bed as he slept but did not have it with him on the night he was killed. Mr Jafferjee said: ‘He was plainly taken was surprise, the range and extent of his injuries being far beyond anything required merely to subdue him, which suggests a beating to get him to reveal where his money was before he was finally finished off.’","Dawid Rymar, Slawomir Bugajewski and Ireneusz Mydlarz crept into the home of reclusive millionaire William Saunderson-Smith, 58, as he slept .

The estate on Carbon Beach, Malibu, in California with 151ft of beach frontage and nine bedrooms sold for $37million after it was listed in May for an asking price of $50million. Semel's house is on the strip of beachfront mansions known as 'billionaires' beach' for its many wealthy homeowners, who have included Pierce Brosnan, Courtney Cox and John Travolta. Price cut: Former Yahoo CEO Terry Semel has reportedly sold his Malibu mansion for $37 million, $13 million less than his asking price . Complete with nine bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, a huge outdoor swimming pool and 10,317 square feet of living space, it is clear from his asking price that Semel had high hopes when selling the property.

They are among motorists' pet hates, with councils constantly under pressure to fix potholes as soon as they blight any road. But one local authority appear to have different priorities - after they ignored the two-inch deep hole and instead painted white speed camera lines straight over it. Drivers in Kelvedon Hatch, near Brentwood, Essex, have been left astonished after highways engineers refused to fill in the pothole and simply painted over it. Safety first? Essex County Council opted to paint over this pothole near Brentwood rather than fill it in . The speed camera next to a pothole is on the A128 near Kelvedon Hatch on the way to Brentwood, Essex . Officials ignored the one foot-long dip in favour of painting small white stripes along the road in line with a speed camera placed a few metres away. The bizarre action has left furious villagers convinced that Essex County Council are more interested in making money from speeding fines than making roads safe. Paul Bonnet, parish councillor for nearby Stondon Masey. said: 'You couldn’t make this up. It is absolutely crazy. I’m a taxpayer and I couldn’t believe what they had done. 'If they’d had enough white paint they could have filled the whole thing up and made it level. The pothole is around two inches deep and has already caught out dozens of drivers on the way through Essex . 'When the lorry turned up my immediate reaction was, at least they are fixing the pothole, but then they just repainted the lines, one of them actually in the pothole itself. 'They obviously care about the money from the camera more than the safety of motorists and cyclists. 'Why are they not prioritising people’s and motorists’ safety rather than a speed camera?' The camera is in the pretty village of Kelvedon Hatch on the A128 road which runs towards Brentwood. The side of the road is littered with hubcaps that have come off when motorists have driven through the huge pothole too fast and numerous drivers have suffered split tyres. 'The pothole is at least two inches deep and really dangerous if you don’t know it’s there,' said resident Sarah Clarke. 'It’s ridiculous that they have painted the white lines before repairing the damaged road.' A spokesman for Essex County Council said last night: 'Essex Highways is currently renewing the lining at various safety camera sites across the county. 'Unfortunately, on this occasion the lining crew proceeded with the lining renewal as instructed, despite the appearance of this defect. The pot hole is due to be repaired within the next three days and any damaged markings will be repainted immediately afterwards. Instructions have been issued to the crews to prevent this from happening again.'",Villagers in Kelvedon Hatch angry at council for painting speed camera lines over pothole on A128 .

A child rapist, who attacked three young children in a ‘truly abhorrent’ way, was caught by police when they saw a porn film playing through the letterbox of his house after he lured the children there. Darren Mackrell, 45, pleaded guilty to raping the children he had drugged and forced to sexually abuse each other while he watched in a six-hour ordeal. In what Judge Gary Burrell QC called a ‘truly abhorrent thing to do’, two boys aged eight and ten years old, and a girl, nine, were lured to Mackrell’s flat in Southampton, Hampshire, after he approached them in a nearby park. Truly abhorrent: Darren Mackrell lured three children under ten to his house in this street in Southampton, Hampshire, where he sexually abused them, forcing them also to abuse each other . Judge Burrell said today Mackrell was likely to spend a long time behind bars at his trial. One of the parents yelled from the public gallery  that he should hang. The children, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were drugged with cannabis, amphetamine and Viagra  by the unemployed man before he abused them on April 21 last year. One of the children’s mothers alerted police when she became concerned for her child’s whereabouts after finding out they had gone to Mackrell’s house. Drugged children: Mackrell gave the children Viagra, cannabis and amphetamine to 'stupefy' them during the six hour ordeal . When Mackrell did not answer the door, she . phoned police who broke the door down when a porn film was seen playing . through the letterbox. The children were found in the house and Mackrell was arrested. Today he admitted 18 charges of raping the three children, sexually assaulting them, causing them to engage in sexual activity, forcing them to watch a sexual act and administering drugs. Judge Burrell told the drug addict he was ordering a pre-sentence report to find out how dangerous Mackrell was to children. He said: ‘You pleaded guilty today to the rape of three children aged, 10, nine and eight. You forced these children to engage in sexual activity between themselves, a truly abhorrent thing to do. ‘You administered drugs to them, including cannabis, amphetamines and Viagra with the intention of stupefying them. ‘As night follows day, you will be sentenced to a very lengthy sentence in any event. ‘If you satisfy the criteria of dangerousness or imprisonment for public protection, you could be subject to a life sentence.’ Mackrell pleaded guilty to all the charges on the eve of his trial at Southampton Crown Court before the judge adjourned the case for sentencing at Winchester Crown Court on September 21. As Mackrell was taken down, one tearful mother of a victim shouted: ‘It’s not over until I say it’s over.’ Another mother shouted: ‘He should hang.’ Judge Burrell responded: ‘The court understands the situation you are in and your outburst is perfectly understandable.’ Sentencing in September: The judge has adjourned Mackrell's sentencing to Winchester Crown Court in September and said he could be subject to a life sentence .","Darren Mackrell pleaded guilty to raping three children and forcing them to sexually abuse each other last year .

Cost of being healthy: The price of salad vegetables is soaring after an unusually wet summer slowed production (file picture) More and more of us are trying to improve our diets by eating plenty of fresh, varied salads. That may be more easily said than done this year, however, because prices of vegetables including onions, tomatoes, cucumber and carrots are rocketing following our wet summer. The problem has been blamed on unusually damp conditions slowing ripening and potentially increasing the chance of fungal disease. The wholesale price of salad tomatoes is 45 per cent more than last year, while the cost of beef tomatoes has rocketed by 42 per cent. Cherry tomatoes are currently 22 per . cent more expensive than last year and plum tomatoes 33 per cent more, commodity analysts Mintec revealed yesterday. Trade magazine The Grocer said: 'After last year's . deadly E.coli outbreak in Germany, demand for salad vegetables across . the UK tumbled, leading to bargain bin prices. But as memories fade, . fresh tomatoes are back in favour and prices are soaring.' The problem is not just confined to the UK either. The climate across northern Europe is still cooler and more humid than expected for this time of year. The bad weather in countries including the Netherlands has led to lower production over the summer - driving prices even higher. Supply and demand: Last year, prices dropped as the market for veg faltered following an outbreak of E.coli. Pictured, cucumbers being thrown out in Spain . Mintec senior analyst Robert Miles . said: 'Humidity and a lack of sunshine and heat remains a concern and . there are some fears that persistent dampness and high humidity in the . month ahead may continue to slow ripening and may lead to increased . incidences of fungal disease.'

V.M. worked for Annie George (pictured) and her late husband at their 20,000-square-foot mansion . A woman accused of keeping an illegal immigrant as a servant at her upstate New York mansion says the housekeeper has become a prosecution witness in an effort to get legal status to remain in the United States. But prosecutors say the woman, who faces a federal felony, kept her emigre servant overworked, underpaid and essentially captive for several years. Both sides agree the housekeeper, identified in court papers only as V.M., a middle-aged widow from India, worked for Annie George, her late husband and six children for five years. Immigration investigators removed her in May 2011 after her son in India called the National Human Trafficking Resources Center, which says it has identified hundreds of similar U.S. cases. Bradley Miles, executive director of the nonprofit Polaris Project, which runs the 24-hour phone service, said the most frequently reported type of labor trafficking the organization hears about on the hotline are domestic servitude cases. Since 2008, it has received more than 2,500 calls directly from survivors of sex and labor trafficking, and about 60 or 70 daily looking for referrals, resources, training or 'crisis calls', he said. 'I feel it's just the tip of the iceberg,' Miles said. They try to determine if there are specific indicators of force, fraud or coercion and since 2008 have recorded 340 domestic servitude situations 'with high indicators' that the cases constitute human trafficking. The callers are referred to a network of nonprofits and police across the country. Miles said other highly publicized household forced labor cases over the past decade involved emigres from the Philippines, Indonesia and Egypt. His organization is guided by a federal definition of human trafficking from the 2000 federal law and looks for types of control that include violence, threats, isolation or holding debt over someone's head. The 40-year-old George, who faces trial on August 27, is accused of harboring an illegal immigrant for private financial gain, a crime punishable by up to 10 years in prison. U.S. District Judge Gary Sharpe dismissed the charge in July on a scheduling technicality but prosecutors got a new indictment days later. George has pleaded not guilty. Her lawyer, Mark Sacco, had requested dismissal and said he hoped prosecutors had better things to do with their time. Palatial home: V.M. worked in the George family's more than 20,000-square-foot stone mansion called Llenroc, 15 miles northwest of Albany . He also said the pay dispute, using . corrected math, was about $40,000 and could easily be settled in civil . court. Prosecutors said V.M. is due at least $240,000 in wages and . $79,000 in overtime based on the minimum wage. In . a trial brief, Sacco said V.M. had legal papers and was working with a . family in New Jersey in 2005. She left that job for a romantic . relationship that ended, leaving her homeless. Deal gone awry: The woman hired in 2006 to work for the Georges as a live-in domestic servant for $1,000 a month . She was taken in by a church - which she asked to help her find work - claimed to be a legal U.S. visitor, and was hired by George's husband, Mathai Kolath George, in 2006 to work for his family as a live-in domestic servant for $1,000 a month. She filled out no paperwork and didn't change her visa status. 'She was provided room, board and a stipend which was forwarded to her children in her home country,' Sacco wrote. 'As an avenue to secure permanent legal status in the United States for both herself and her children, she has condemned my client.' Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Belliss said V.M. is still in the United States and self-supporting at this point. She has temporary status in the country pending the outcome of the trial, he said. She also may testify at trial, along with the immigration investigators who removed her from George's home, after first being told she wasn't there. Prosecutors said V.M. was eventually pushed out a side door of the mansion without her bags, later got them and found her diary missing. They said V.M. was paid about $26,000 for more than five years of cooking, cleaning and child care every day from 5:30 a.m. to almost midnight. She spoke little English, never saw a doctor or dentist, seldom left the house and was taken to an immigration lawyer once but got no documents. She worked in the family's homes first in Catskill in the Hudson Valley, suburban Albany and then the more than 20,000-square-foot stone mansion called Llenroc, 15 miles northwest of Albany. Prosecutors could claim the mansion as the 'vehicle ... used in the commission of the offense' if George is convicted. Mathai George, a native of India who built a hotel and real estate development business in the U.S., was killed in 2009 along with his 11-year-old son and another man when their private plane crashed after takeoff.","Prosecutors said V.M. is due at least $240,000 in wages and $79,000 in overtime based on the minimum wage .

A man dubbed Britain’s worst neighbour has dodged jail - despite a 25-year reign of terror that has seen him jailed three times. Serial pest Gordon Clarke was found guilty of harassment without violence earlier this month after he repeatedly lit bonfires in his back garden in Crawley, West Sussex, to deliberately send smelly smoke all over the neighbourhood Magistrates Court heard. The 52-year-old - who was jailed for 70 days in 1998 for harassment, 30 days in 2001 for breaking a restraining order and for nine months in 2008 for breaching his Asbo - has caused misery to his neighbours John Ferraira, Lara Sanger and Graham Sanger for the last 25 years, the court heard. During the screening of the 1995 documentary about nightmare neighbours Clarke’s wife Jay bragged how she painted her house pink, bought a goat and wanted to buy crowing cockerels ‘just to annoy locals’. Previously Dad-of-five Gordon Clarke has been given two Asbos for a string of anti-social behaviour. But last week Clarke was spared jail, despite repeated breaches of an Asbo handed to him in 2001 and 2006 preventing him from ‘harassing and tormenting his neighbours’. He was handed a one year community order, 150 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay £300 in court costs at Horsham Magistrates Court last week - to the disgust of his neighbours. The court heard how he repeatedly lit bonfires in the summer of 2010 - some which burned for as long as seven hours - to send smelly smoke into neighbouring gardens.

'I can’t convey just how much of a detrimental effect this is having.' At a trial at the Old Bailey in September 2008 - where Clarke was jailed for nine months after being found guilty of breaching his Asbo - the court heard how Clarke had routinely ignored police and council warnings about his vile behaviour for ‘more than two decades’. One neighbour, who refused to be named, said this week: 'How he cannot be sent to jail after 25 years of this type of behaviour is beyond me. 'He has shown that he cannot change his ways, but instead of punishing him they just give him a bit of work to do and a fine. 'He’ll be back causing hell the moment he thinks he can get away with it.' She added: 'Many people have left the street because of Gordon’s behaviour, but some people simply can’t afford to move away - he’s made life hell for everyone for a quarter of a century, surely that’s enough.'","Gordon Clarke, 52, was found guilty of harassment without violence after he  lit bonfires to deliberately send smelly smoke all over the neighbourhood .

Parents in a New York suburb are outraged as information comes to light about a deal struck over a decade ago by a local public school that filled their sports fields with toxic chemical waste. A possible lawsuit is now tying the years of exposure to a string of cancer diagnoses and deaths among students who spent hours playing football, lacrosse and golf on the dangerous fields. The fields in the Briarcliff Manor school district were closed two years ago, but only in the past few months have parents begun to piece together the possible connection between the illegal levels of toxins in the playing grounds and the blood-based cancers and tumors that lead to the deaths of two teens and treatment of more than ten others. Known victims: Nicholas Birch died of a brain tumor last February when was 12-years-old (left), and Demetri Demeropoulos died in 2010 from a spinal cord tumor when he was 18 years old (right) The debate dates back to 1998, when Briarcliff Manor school district struck a deal with Whitney Trucking in Yonkers that allowed the construction company to dispose of the waste from their sites in the fields so long as the company paid to have the fields constructed afterwards. The legal claim filed by the parents of one teenager who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer states that as quickly as one year later, the New York State Department of Environment Conservation took note of the toxic fill, which was tested and found to contain at least 20 carcinogenic substances. The State agency informed the school district of their findings but the school did nothing to alter the use of the fields nor did they tell the parents. ‘They knew 12 years ago that there was some risk of this field and they really covered it up,’ said Paul Mazzilli, the parent who filed the claim after his son Nicholas was treated for thyroid cancer. Mr Mazzilli told MailOnline that by filing the claim, it gives his family the option to sue the school for damages, making it the first step in a possible lawsuit against the school district. Fortunately for the Mazzili family, Nicholas’ was given a positive prognosis after his thyroid was removed and he underwent radioactive iodine treatment. Land in question: The toxic playing fields used by Briarcliff Manor middle school and high school were finally closed in 2010 but documentation shows that the school was initially warned in 1999 . The Mazzillis are not alone in their legal fight, as The Journal News reports that the families of Nicholas Birch and Demetri Demeropoulos have also filed notice of claim actions. Nicholas Birch died of a brain tumor last February when was 12-years-old, and Demetri Demeropoulos died in 2010 from a spinal cord tumor when he was 18 years old. The Mazzilli’s claim reads that even though the school district was warned in 1999, then faced further calls for investigations into the toxicity levels and notifications by the environmental agency in 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2007, the school continued to do nothing. The last straw came in 2010 when the neighboring little league field- which was also part of the deal with Whitney Trucking- was tested and found to be unsafe. It was only then that the Briarcliff fields were closed and middle school and high school sports practices were moved elsewhere. A lengthy article in The Huffington Post explains that since new town board members were elected in 2010, transparency has increased regarding the schools investigation and the demands of the environmental agency. While such transparency may be helpful in going forward, what has enraged the parents involved further is the response by former school superintendent Frances Wills. Dangerous fields: The Briarcliff Manor school . district made a deal with a construction company in 1998 wherein the . company dumped their toxic waste in their sports fields . Ms Wills told The Huffington Post that the issue of the contaminated fields was discussed during various board meetings, but the information was not disseminated through the school community because ‘it was a different time’ before email was so commonly used to communicate with parents. Though the Mazzillis, Demeropouloses and Birches are all considering their legal options, some have chosen to wait when it comes to any court action. Blaise Benza, who is now-21-year-old, spent his middle school years playing baseball at Briarcliff and was diagnosed with Burkitt’s leukemia just weeks after he transferred to a private high school. He went through extensive chemotherapy treatments that left the strapping athlete a skeleton of his former self. Though his bright spirits never dipped towards his family or friends, his eight months spent in and out of hospitals took a toll on his body. One would not know it by looking at the 6-foot-tall young man now, Blaise weighed only 82 pounds during the worst of the cancer fight. Six years later, he continues to be cancer-free and focused more on his senior year at Villanova University than his past health battles. His father Brett Benza told MailOnline that while they are not ruling out the possibility of legal action later, their concern now is simply one for all of the other would-be baseball stars. ‘The most important thing is that he is okay,’ Mr Benza said. When Blaise was diagnosed, Mr Benza said that ‘we never heard anything about (the contaminated fields), no one was talking about it at the time. We hadn’t heard about any other kids.’ He said that since their family had no history of cancer, the teen’s diagnosis came as a shock, and one that he hopes no other families have to go through if the proper action is taken by the school district. ‘The first and foremost thing is concerning the community, and making sure that this doesn’t ever happen again,’ he said.","Fields of New York public school filled with waste from construction sites .

A fraudster plundered his dying friend's funeral fund, leaving the sick man to die penniless. Ciaran Hoey drank and gambled his way through £6,738 of Brendan O'Sullivan's savings after he was entrusted with the dying man's debit card to do his shopping. Hoey, who has previous convictions for defrauding workmates and a former employee, cleared out the account and left it £99 overdrawn. Mr O'Sullivan has since died penniless and his relatives were forced to foot the bill for the funeral - something he did not want to burden them with, Gloucester Crown Court was told. Hoey, originally from Dublin, Ireland, was this week jailed for two years after he admitted 18 charges of fraud. Describing the abuse of trust as 'despicable', Judge William Hart told Hoey: 'Brendan O’Sullivan was 80. He was in very poor health and he has recently died. He was a friend of yours and he had reposed a high degree of trust in you. 'You abused that trust in the most despicable way. The peace that he should have been entitled to find in his final days was contaminated by the memory of your betrayal. 'You used your access to his financial affairs to steal all his money from him - his modest life savings - and having stolen it you squandered it on yourself, on drinking, gambling and some consumer durables. 'When he died very recently the money he intended to put towards the cost of his funeral had gone. It is a case that is sad and in some ways tragic. 'It represents a breach by you of a high degree of trust. 'You had complete control over his affairs. One is tempted to say with your record: Once a fraudster, always a fraudster. You simply cannot divorce yourself from dishonesty.' Hoey and Mr O'Sullivan had been friends for between 10 and 12 years after meeting at the Russell Arms pub, where they both regulars. Hoey, originally from Dublin, Ireland, was jailed for two years at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) after admitting 18 charges of fraud . Prosecutor Julian Kesner told the court: 'Mr O’Sullivan began to suffer from very, very poor health and eventually was unable to leave home. 'He became reliant on his old friend, the defendant, who would do his shopping for him. 'To assist with the shopping Mr O’Sullivan gave the defendant his debit card and his PIN. 'Unknown to Mr O’Sullivan his friend then started taking them money from his account. 'In two months the account went from a healthy credit balance to a debit of £99. There were in that time 28 cash withdrawals starting on February 3 this year for £300. 'Shortly after February 3 Mr O’Sullivan was admitted to hospital but while he was there the defendant continued stealing his money. All of a sudden he did not figure in Mr O’Sullivan’s life much any more. 'He did not visit him in hospital and Mr O’Sullivan spent a lot of time endeavouring to contact him to get his debit card back.' 'Mr O’Sullivan's mission was to make sure . that he had enough money to cover his funeral expenses because he did . not want it to be something his family had to pay for' Mr Kesner added that the last withdrawal on March 27 was for £180 and it left the account in the red. He said: 'In total £6,738 was stolen. It was money he had accumulated very slowly over the years from his modest lifestyle and the small pension he was getting. 'In a statement he said that the money was for his family to pay for his funeral. His statement ends with him saying ""I remain deeply upset and traumatised by the whole event"". 'That statement was taken in June and Mr O’Sullivan has unfortunately recently died.' The court also heard a statement from Paul Barratt, Mr O'Sullivan's nephew, who said his uncle 'gave up on life' after discovering what Hoey had done. Mr Kesner added: 'Mr O’Sullivan’s mission was to make sure that he had enough money to cover his funeral expenses because he did not want it to be something his family had to pay for.' Sarah Jenkins, defending, said Hoey was ashamed and remorseful about what he had done - especially since recently learning that Mr O’Sullivan had now died. She added that Hoey had drink and gambling problems which were at the root of his offending, she said. However, she said, he was anxious to repay Mr O’Sullivan’s family and was prepared to cash in a pension fund from his former NHS job to raise the full amount. Ms Jenkins said: 'I hope Your Honour feels that is a genuine expression of how he feels about what happened in the final months of his friend’s life.' Hoey pleaded guilty to 18 charges of fraud against Mr O’Sullivan with a further nine offences taken into consideration. He was jailed for two years. In 2008, Hooey was jailed for 20 months . at the same court after he admitted getting a hospital porter's job by . failing to reveal his criminal past, stealing from a Christmas savings . club at work before stealing £1,150 from a cafe where he worked.","Ciaran Hoey was entrusted with friend's debit card to do his shopping .

An affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun claims that 25-year-old Vivek Shah was registered for handgun training classes in Los Angeles, and that he mailed letters to several affluent individuals demanding hefty sums of cash. The Los Angeles resident was arrested at his parents’ Chicago-area home on August 10th, and is currently in custody in lieu of a detention hearing.

While none of the alleged victims are named, the Smoking Gun designates a 60-year-old man who lives in Connecticut as famed movie producer Harvey Weinstein. A spokesman for Harvey Weinstein did not immediately respond to request for comment. In addition, The Smoking Gun says other letters were sent out to Helen Mirren’s estate and to the home of Florida coal magnate Christopher Cline. It was the threatening letter sent to Mr Cline that started the police’s investigation. Postal inspector Joshua Mehall testified in an affidavit that a $13million extortion letter was sent to the billionaire’s home. Shah allegedly threatened to kill his family members if the sum was not deposited in an off-shore bank account in Cyprus, Mr Mehall said.

U-turn: Prime Minister Julia Gillard said her government is now backing detention camps for asylum seekers, despite previously opposing the idea . Australia plans to deport asylum seekers to detention camps in the poorer nations of Papua New Guinea and Nauru. The proposal is a U-turn for the ruling Labour party, which previously argued that Australian-funded detention camps were a waste of money that would fail to deter new arrivals. But in the face of 'too many lives being lost' in rickety boats, prime minister Julia Gillard said her government has accepted recommendations to reopen camps established ten years ago by a conservative administration. Laws to enable the deportation of asylum seekers will also be introduced to parliament. 'When our nation looks at what is . happening at sea as people attempt dangerous journeys to Australia, too . many lives have been lost and I'm not going to play politics or look at . political scoreboards when too many lives have been lost,' said Ms Gillard . after the cabinet backed all the . recommendations in the expert panel's report. Drawn up by a panel headed by former Australian . Defence Force Chief Angus Houston, the report combines proposals from all the . major political parties, who have been bitterly divided on the issue. Ms Gillard commissioned the report six weeks ago after two people-smuggling boats capsized between Indonesia and Australia within a week. It is believed more than 90 asylum seekers drowned in the incidents. She said she hoped the report's findings would break the political deadlock on the issue. But human rights group Amnesty International said the recommendations are a major setback for Australian refugee policy. More than 7,000 asylum seekers - many from war-torn countries including Afghanistan, Iraq and Sri Lanka - have reached the Australian Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island in more than 100 boats so far this year. Many Australians resent the growing numbers of asylum seekers arriving and the issue has emerged as a major threat to the survival of Ms Gillard's government, which is up for election again in late 2013. Risky: A boat laden with refugees was driven onto rocks at Christmas Island in December 2010, killing many of those on board . Seeking a new life: More than 7,000 asylum seekers have reached Christmas Island this year alone . As the death toll from the dangerous voyages grows, the government has been keen to curb the traffic. In June, a boat carrying around 150 suspected . asylum seekers capsized just off the coast of Christmas Island, just a . week after 90 people drowned on a similar journey. Similarly, in December 2011, as many as 200 died . when an overcrowded boat sank off the coast of East Java. In 2010, 50 . asylum seekers died when their boat was thrown onto rocks at Christmas . Island and in 2001, a crowded boat known as the SIEV X sank on its way to Australia with the loss of 350 lives. Despite the rising toll, the Senate rejected legislation that would have allowed asylum seekers to be deported to Malaysia. The Labour party has wanted to send asylum seekers to Malaysia as part of a swap deal, in which Australia would resettle bona fide refugees from Kuala Lumpur registered with the United Nations. But the conservatives argue that asylum seekers' rights would not be respected by Malaysia because it has not signed the UN Refugee Convention. Reduced to tears: Asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran had to be rescued after their wooden boat began to sink off the coast of Indonesia in April . Too much to bear: The asylum seekers were hoping to get to Australia to start a new life . The opposition maintains the detention camps should be in Nauru and Papua New Guinea, where both governments have expressed support. The report recommends the Nauru and Papua New Guinea centres be quickly re-established. It also said that the Malaysian deal needed more work to address human rights concerns, 'rather than being discarded or neglected.' Opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison welcomed the report as an endorsement of his party's policies. But he did not promise the opposition would provide the support needed by the government to pass the law through parliament.","Expert panel recommends building new camps in poorer nations of Papua New Guinea and Nauru .

An animal protection charity has condemned Edinburgh Zoo for offering visitors the chance to become panda keepers - if they stump up £1,000 for an hour. OneKind, an Edinburgh-based animal protection charity, has called the scheme ‘exploitative’ and claim it is a money spinning scheme thinly-veiled as a conservation project. The new 'experience' was launched . yesterday and provides panda fans with the opportunity of a private, . after hours, encounter with the UK's only giant pandas. A OneKind spokesman said: ‘As much as it’s portrayed as a conservation project, this is a commercial exercise and these pandas are being exploited to generate revenue for the zoo. ‘Our primary concern is the welfare of the pandas and we would expect that because the zoo has a large financial stake in their well-being, they will do their utmost to ensure they don’t come to any harm. 'We would urge the zoo to demonstrate how the pandas will be protected from any physical or psychological pressure that may be caused by this process. ‘It’s quite an obscene amount of money to ask for in the current economic climate and it seems almost a throwback to the Victorian era when animals were used as entertainment. It’s a bit tacky. ‘The pandas are the property of the Chinese government and we hope they have consulted with them about exploiting the animals in this way. ‘If people love pandas that much, would it not be better to donate that money to conservation efforts to protect their habitat?’ Come play with me! Visitors can get up close and personal with male panda Yang Guang at Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland . Who wouldn't want to give her a bear hug? Those willing to fork out could hand-feed Tian Tian the female panda . Visitors can now get up close to female Tian Tian (Sweetie) and male Yang Guang (Sunshine) for the first time but for a fee. The zoo is offering the hour long panda keeper experience at £1,000 for up to four people, where visitors can meet the creatures which spend up to 14 hours a day sleeping. Customers are being charged per panda keeper experience meaning that at it's lowest, the 'experience' costs £250 per person if four people are using it - they same amount charged for a full day keeper experience with other animals. At its highest, the keeper experience will still cost £1,000 even if only one person uses it. A half an hour rhino keeper experience will only cost you £70, as does an owl, lemur or 'creepy crawly' keeper experience. A spokeswoman for Edinburgh Zoo said: 'Launching Panda Keeper Experiences is not about extra income. 'To date we have welcomed over 400,000 people to visit the giant pandas at Edinburgh Zoo and in terms of projections made before their arrival, we are happy with the numbers. 'Similar experiences take place in zoos around with world with pandas, including China, and are extremely exclusive and limited experiences, with only around 2 to 4 taking place each month. 'It is important to remember that RZSS is a charity and receives no external funding and that our conservation programmes, including panda support, are achieved because of funds from our zoo activities and how they uniquely reconnect people with vanishing nature. 'Conservation remains one of the RZSS key goals regarding giant pandas and is at the heart of everything we do.' Feed me! The experience is designed for people over the age of 16 and offers a chance to get close to the Chinese imports . The adorable, clumsy creatures have been a hit feature of Edinburgh Zoo - despite sleeping for about 14 hours a day . The giant pandas arrived at Edinburgh Zoo from China in December 2011 - the first pandas kept in Britain since 1994. The Giant Panda project is funded entirely from charitable donations from the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland. The zoo pays the Chinese government £660,000 a year to house the black and white pair, poured £285,000 into building a special enclosure for them, and spends £70,000 a year on bamboo imported from Holland for them, the Daily Telegraph reported. Darren McGarry, Head of Animals at Edinburgh Zoo, said: 'We're delighted to be able to offer people the chance to get closer than ever before to these fascinating, rare and iconic animals. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is 99 per cent bamboo. Pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents or carrion. The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China, mainly in Sichuan province, but also in the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. As a result of farming, deforestation and other development, the panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived. The panda is a conservation reliant endangered species. 'Our panda keeper experiences, which will last around an hour, are exclusive opportunities for panda fans. 'Unique private encounters, people will be able to see the giant pandas at very close proximity in the private area of their enclosure - which isn't on show to the public. 'The private audience with our keepers will also give the chance to really learn first-hand more about Tian Tian and Yang Guang. 'We hope people really enjoy and treasure this incredible and truly rare once in a lifetime experience with our giant pandas.' The panda keeper experience allows visitors to meet one of the panda keepers and learn about the training with the pandas. Visitors may also have the chance to feed the pandas and they will receive drinks and canapes on the panda walkway. It had been hoped that the pair would breed cubs but attempts to encourage any romance between them has failed so far. The keepers built private rooms linked by a tunnel for Tian Tian and Yang Guang so they could take advantage of the only 36 hour window when a female panda ovulates, but so far the duo remain just good friends. Meanwhile, the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has urged the zoo to take all possible steps to ensure the well-being of both the pandas and the guests. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: 'The biosecurity and safety of both the animals and humans is paramount therefore we would expect Edinburgh Zoo to have taken all the necessary precautions to ensure these experiences are conducted in an appropriate manner.' Panda keeper experiences run are designed for people aged 16 years and over.","Hour-long experience at Edinburgh Zoo allows visitors to get up close and personal with the black and white creatures .

The founder of an animal welfare organization that bought NFL star Michael Vick's former dog-fighting compound is facing cruelty charges. Dogs Deserve Better bought the 15-acre tract and five-bedroom home last year for use as a dog sanctuary for animals who have been chained and penned. Chief Animal Control Officer Tracy Terry said numerous complaints about the property prompted a visit from the state veterinarian's office in Surry County, Virginia.

Disgrace: Vick was jailed in 2008 for his part in the dog-fighting ring which disgusted his many football fans . The sheriff's office has been unable to find the organization's founder, Tamira Thayne, to serve warrants for animal cruelty and inadequate care of animals. Vick, the Philadelphia Eagles quarterback, served 18 months in federal prison in 2008 for his involvement in the Bad Newz Kennels dog-fighting ring that operated from the property. While serving the search warrant of a . property owned by Vick in rural Virginia, police discovered evidence of . an alleged dog-fighting operation, including rape stands, pry bars, . treadmills modified for dog training, and a blood-stained carpet. Animal-control officers eventually removed 66 dogs from the property, 55 of which were pit bulls. Dogs deserve better: The local sheriff now wants to serve the charity with a warrant for animal cruelty in Virginia . Bloody past: The estate was once used as a gruesome dog-fighting arena by NFL player Michael Vick and associates . He was reviled by fans when he was released from jail in 2009, lost everything and was forced to file for bankruptcy. However Vick bounced back. Last year, he signed a six-year deal with the Eagles worth $100million, with $40million guaranteed. In June, he wed his fiancée Kijafa Frink at the Fontainebleau Miami Beach in front of 300 people. Ms Frink and Mr Vick have three children together and have been together for several years, throughout the turmoil of his incarceration. He even filmed a reality show with BET that chronicled his road to redemption and featured his children Mitez, Jada, and London.

Britain's first bionic veteran has a new brain-controlled robotic arm that is transforming his life. Andrew Garthwaite, 25, had his right arm blown clean off by a rocket-propelled grenade during a firefight with the Taliban in Afghanistan in September 2010. In January he had the state-of-the-art limb wired to his nervous system during a six-hour operation in Vienna, Austria. Andrew Garthwaite, 25, became Britain's first bionic veteran after having a state-of-the-art limb wired to his nervous system . Andrew flew to Birmingham to have shrapnel removed from his body . Now he is getting to grips with his new body part and is able to ride his motorcycle and drive a car again. Mr . Gathwaite, who lives with his new wife Kailey, also 25, in South . Shields, Tyneside, said: 'It's been incredible. I thought I might never . be the same. 'But my life is . starting to get back to normal - I'm on my motorbike and I'm back in a . car. I can do things that I never thought I would have been able to do. 'It's . small things that are easier now - like opening a jar or holding . cutlery. These are the things I wasn't able to do before and now I'm . learning again. 'I feel so much better and I'm quite happy with my disability. I'm proud of what I've achieved and what I've done.' Mr .

Andrew Garthwaite had his right arm blown clean off by a rocket-propelled grenade during a firefight with the Taliban . The former soldier is hoping that one day he could have feeling in his bionic arm . Reliving the moment, he said: 'We were patrolling through the night and as the morning came a big firefight broke out. A few rounds were exchanged and then it broke down for a while. 'I went to get some breakfast but then more rounds started coming through. I realised I had hit someone so I went to get some binoculars and as I was doing that an RPG hit my arm. 'It blew me back and the comrade behind me was killed in the explosion. I thought I was going to die. I was getting lights flashing through my mind and the lads had to keep on slapping me and keeping me awake. 'After the initial panic though, I was happy for them to take pictures of my arm. They tried to put a tourniquet on but it wouldn't stay on and they had to stop the blood leaking from my arm.' Mr Garthwaite spent a day at Camp Bastion after he was airlifted from the scene of the fighting. He was eventually taken to Birmingham where he underwent surgery on his chest to remove shrapnel. Happily married: Andrew in his military attire with his wife Kailey on their wedding day . He said: 'I thought I would get a new hand of a prosthetic arm. 'But in Vienna they did surgery on the nerves and it's changing my life. In the future they are talking about sensitivity so one day you could actually feel the arm.' Mr Garthwaite, who was a corporal with the Queen's Royal Lancers when he was injured, was previously fitted with a prosthetic limb, which he controlled by flexing his pectoral and back muscles. But during the pioneering treatment in January, surgeons dissected his right shoulder to redirect nerve endings that previously controlled his arm and hand. After isolating the nerves, they re-attached them to his chest muscle. Brain signals are picked up by electrodes which trigger motors meaning his arm is controlled completely by his mind. Mr Garthwaite still has a long road to recovery - experts predict it could take up to 18 months before he fully masters his new arm. He added: ""I'm still on the basics stage. I know I'm only going to get better.'","Bionic arm was wired to soldier's nervous system during a six hour operation in Vienna .

An RAC patrolman has been jailed for battering a colleague unconscious after discovering him on a bed with his wife. Chris Van Niekerk left his friend and fellow mechanic Neil Child, with a broken nose, shattered eye socket and fractured ribs after  finding him in his estranged wife Linsey’s bedroom. Van Niekerk, 34, claims he saw Mr Child having sex with his wife of 12 years. He became suspicious after spotting a work van in her drive and had peered through a window. However, 37-year-old Mr Child, a married father himself, denied sleeping with his workmate’s wife. RAC patrolman Chris Van Niekerk, left, attacked colleague Neil Child after he saw him on the bed with his estranged wife, Lindsay, right . He says the mother-of-three had become upset when he stopped by to pick up a birthday gift she had for him and he was merely ‘comforting’ her when the pair happened to fall on to the bed. The prolonged assault began in the bedroom of Mrs Van Niekerk’s £425,000 bungalow – where she had been living during a trial separation from her husband – and spilled on to the street, Winchester Crown Court heard. Judge Keith Cutler said although the pair may have been on the bed there was no evidence of sexual activity. Prosecutor Rebecca Austin said the Van Niekerks, who have three children together, were separated at the time of the attack, March 16 this year. They were living less than a mile from each other in the leafy village of Sherfield-on-Loddon, near Basingstoke. Mr Child and his wife Sharon became friends with the couple when Van Niekerk joined the RAC eight years ago. The families would often socialise and once went on a camping trip in Norfolk together. On the night of the assault, Mr Child, who lives only minutes away from Mrs Van Niekerk in Bramley, had gone to her bungalow at her request to collect a birthday present but when he got there she became upset. Miss Austin said: ‘In comforting her, they both fell on to the bed. ‘Mr Child then gave an account of being assaulted by the defendant and the attack caused him to lose consciousness. The attack continued outside and there were further punches  to his head that caused him to fall on the floor.’ The court heard Mr Child managed to call the police just after midnight. Van Niekerk, who had moved to the UK from South Africa 12 years ago, was arrested and admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm. In a police interview, Van Niekerk  told officers he had been peering through the bedroom window and ‘acted out of rage’ after seeing his wife with Mr Child. Richard Wheeler, defending, said Van Niekerk had gone to the bungalow because his employer was unsure of the location of Mr Child’s RAC van. The defendant then attacked Mr Child out of ‘extreme provocation’, claiming that he had seen Mr Child have sex with his estranged wife, Mr Wheeler added. However, Judge Cutler rejected this version of events and jailed Van Niekerk  for 15 months. He said: ‘You accept that you were responsible for these injuries and on the face of it they appear quite horrific. Recovering: Neil Child, pictured at home with wife Sharon, was beaten unconscious by colleague Chris Van Niekerk . ‘You came to the house and saw what you believed was not an innocent contact between him and your wife. Certainly, in your mind you were jealous and you lost your temper.’ Mr Cutler said he took into account the seriousness of the injuries in imposing the length of prison term. Mr Child claims he still suffers nightmares because of the attack. His physical injuries have healed, however a damaged nerve below his right eye can still cause his face to twitch. He said he has also been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and has been signed off from work. His wife Sharon is standing by him. He said after the sentence: ‘I’m just pleased that it has come to an end now. I was not really that bothered with what sentence he got. I want us to get on with our lives.’ Mr Child said he found it difficult to understand why Van Niekerk attacked him. He said: ‘Linsey sent me a text to say I could pick up this present for me and my son as our birthdays had just passed. That’s all it was. ‘He was wound up and he thought he saw something that was untrue. Even if it was true, it does not give him the right to do that.’ Mr Child said his relationship with his wife had become strained because of the effect of the attack on his mental state. A neighbour at the flats where Van Niekerk lived after splitting from his wife said he was ‘a devoted dad’ and added: ‘He seemed a really gentle guy and not somebody I would suspect of violence at all.’ Winchester Crown Court heard that Van Niekerk acted out of 'extreme provocation' when he carried out the 'horrific' attack .","Chris Van Niekerk gave Neil Child fractured eye socket, broken nose and fractured ribs after 'horrific' beating ."

A multi-millionaire best friend of Prince Harry who was partying with him in Las Vegas has called the girl who sold his naked pictures 'despicable'. Arthur Landon said the incident 'put a real dampener' on their trip to Sin City and confirmed the culprit was one of 15 bikini-clad women in a VIP suite when the prince was playing 'strip billiards'. He added it was an abuse of the third in line to the throne's 'hospitality' by someone the prince and friends met in the five-star Wynn Hotel and invited back to his room to ‘continue the party’. In photographs seen by more than 40million people around the world, the Prince was snapped on a mobile phone wearing nothing but a distinctive necklace giving a topless . girl a 'bear-hug' with his bottom facing the camera. In another photo he cups his hands to protect his modesty while his nude companion . hides behind him. Witnesses said that the prince later disappeared with his playmate. Party-boys: Harry, centre, is said to have been the first to strip at the raucous party and his friends say the leaked photos put 'a real dampener' on the Vegas trip . 'I obviously think it is really despicable that someone . would accept Prince Harry’s hospitality and then take these pictures,' he said. Furious: The prince's pal Arthur Landon says the girl who sold the pictures was 'despicable' 'I . know it has put a real dampener on everybody who was on that holiday.' Mr Landon, 30, who is one of Britain's richest young men with an estimated £200million fortune, said any suggestions one of Harry's friends sold the pictures were untrue. 'Some people have been hinting that it was one of his . friends who took the pictures. But that is absolutely not true,' he said. 'None . of his friends would ever do that. We are really careful. All that I . know is that Harry’s friends would never have taken them.' The pictures were published by The Sun . today, despite the Palace trying to block the British press from using . them on privacy grounds. Landon, who is very close to the prince, is the son of Austro-Hungarian . Princess Katalina Esterhazy de Galantha and the . late Brigadier Tim Landon — known as the White Sultan or Landon of . Arabia. A former SAS officer, Tim made his fortune when he helped his Sandhurst friend . Qaboos bin Said Al Said overthrow his father in . Oman. Meanwhile the Prince of Wales is claimed to have torn a strip off his son for his antics when he returned home this week. 'He gave him a talking to and told him to lie low,' a source told the Mirror. It came as a girl at the now infamous party in the Wynn Hotel in Vegas said Prince Harry was the first to strip off in his hotel suite. Apparently . the playboy prince had his eye on a particular blonde girl and . persuaded her to shed her clothes too during a game of 'strip . billiards'. He later disappeared with his playmate, witnesses claimed. A reveller at the party also revealed that when other members of the group began to take photographs . Harry said: ‘I will shield you, I will protect you, I won’t let them see . you’ – making clear he was aware the pictures were being taken. The unnamed woman told The Sun that she . had personally been invited up to the room by a friend of the prince and . found 25 people there, including at least 15 girls. Games room: Suites like this one at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas, which could be the same as Harry's, each have a pool table used for the infamous game of strip billiards . As they stood in the billiards room . with stunning views of the Vegas Strip at about 4am a friend said: ‘I . have an idea, let’s spice up a game of pool.’ ‘Harry said: “Let’s do it”. That was what jump-started the party,’ she said. The . rules of the 'strip billiards' game were if a player potted the ball . they got to go again but if they missed they took a piece of clothing . off. Harry chose a pretty, petite . blonde to play with him. ‘She had her eyes on Harry so she was going to . do anything,’ the source said. ‘He was helping her hold the cue. He was very attentive and hands on, showing her how to do it. He only had eyes for her…she was definitely someone he met for the first time that night.’ Harry went first and was only wearing swimming shorts. When he missed he was forced to go naked straight away. ‘Everyone was watching when he took his clothes off. It was exciting for the girls. He was in great shape,’ said the partygoer. Breathtaking: The room used by Harry will have had stunning views of the Vegas strip, like this one . Rich and famous: The three bedroom duplex suite costs thousands of dollars per night to rent . The girl then missed her shot and took her dress off. She shot again, missed and was then forced to take her bra off – which is when Harry hugged her from behind to ‘protect’ her modesty. Afterwards they put their clothes back on, Harry offered her a beer and they sat on a couch talking together. The witness told the newspaper: ‘He had his eyes on her from the start. He was very into her. She was giddy to be in the company of the prince and he was flirting with her.’ Crucially the witness added: ‘No one asked for our phones or anything about us when we arrived at the party. It was obvious people were taking pictures.’ The source recalled Harry was excited at the prospect of meeting pop star Jennifer Lopez at a pool party the next day. She revealed: ‘He loved Vegas. There was music, lots of noise and excitement. ‘He was very friendly, there was no mention of him being a prince. He was up for whatever was going to happen that night. ‘Harry also knew Jennifer Lopez was in town. He said “I’m going to party with J-Lo”. He was back by the pool to party again five hours after we left him.’ The partygoer and her friends had spotted Harry and his group at the Surrender nightclub in the Wynn Hotel earlier that night. She recalled: ‘We thought he looked hot. We wanted to get closer but couldn’t as he was very well guarded. Everyone was dancing and we became friendly with one of his friends. In the early hours we were invited up to the room.’ Just a day after Harry was called the 'Royal Boris Johnson', the Mayor . of London has come rushing to the defence of the beleaguered prince. Naked pictures of the third in line to the throne have swept across . the internet causing him huge embarrassment. But some commentators have predicted that like Boris Johnson, errors of . judgment and bungling incidents often end up being celebrated rather than . damaging. Earlier this month Mr Johnson somehow got stuck on a zip-wire, but in a precarious situation that would have finished most politicians, Boris somehow managed emerge from the farce unscathed, even glorified. Speaking today on BBC radio, Mr Johnson, pictured above with David Cameron as the Paralympic celebrations began in Trafalgar Square today, said he viewed Harry's naked billiards episode with 'deafening indifference'. 'I think it would be disgraceful if a chap wasn't allowed to have a bit of fun in Las Vegas,' he said. 'The real scandal would be if you went all the way to Las Vegas and you didn't misbehave.'","One of his best friends said today that the scandal 'put a real dampener' on their trip .

Discovery: A CBS reporter found the gun and immediately alerted the agent; Romney never appeared to be in danger . Prior engagement: Romney had been speaking to the American Legion National Convention in Indianapolis and was flying back to Tampa . ABC News reported that the agent accidentally left her weapon in the plane’s bathroom on a flight between Tampa, Florida, and Indiana.

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said on Wednesday that the 'matter will be handled internally.' 'We're aware of the incident,' Donovan told CBS News. 'We take the care and custody of our equipment, especially firearms, very seriously.'

Insufficient evidence: Noah Kantoh, 35, had also been accused of a string of charges against the teenager including trying to kiss her, groping her breasts and accusing her of spurning his advances because he was black . A male nurse who asked a teenage colleague to 'fill in' for his pregnant wife while he could not sleep with her has been allowed to carry on working. Noah Kantoh, 35, made the sexually motivated comment to the 17-year-old cleaner while working with her at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Kent. He had been accused of a string of charges against her, including trying to kiss her, groping her breasts and accusing her of spurning his advances because he was black. But a Nursing and Midwifery Council panel found there was insufficient evidence to support the bulk of the charges against him. However, the Council found Kantoh's lone remark - ‘You can fill in the three-month gap as I can’t sleep with my wife’ - amounted to misconduct and that his fitness to practise was impaired. Imposing a three-year caution order, panel chair Laurence Peterken said: ‘The panel accepts this was an isolated incident involving a colleague and patient safety was not compromised. ‘The panel accepts that your conduct, albeit serious, is on the lower end of the spectrum of sexually motivated conduct. ‘Although you have shown insight, you have not shown full insight and there was no admission to any of the facts proved.’ He added that in directing the caution, the panel wanted to make clear that Kantoh’s behaviour was ‘unacceptable and must not be repeated again’. A further charge relating to a clinical error while dispensing medication was also found proved, but the panel ruled it did not amount to misconduct. The cleaner, now in her early 20s, said she had made it clear to Kantoh that she was not interested and that his comments, made between October 2007 and October 2008, ‘disgusted’ her. Work place: Kantoh made the sexually motivated comment to the cleaner while working with her at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Gillingham, Kent . But defence witness Peterkin Ofori, who worked with the pair at the hospital, said they knew one another well and were on ‘friendly’ terms. He said the girl had told him she had been ‘bullied’ into reporting Kantoh, but would not confirm by whom. ‘I called her straight away to find out had happened. I was shocked,’ he explained. ‘She then told me she was bullied to make the allegation. I said by who but she would not say. She did not want to talk about it.’ Mr Ofori also confessed to having an affair with the girl in June 2008 and said he had heard rumours that there had been other relationships as well.","Noah Kantoh was handed three-year caution order by Nursing and Midwifery Council .

Attacker: Jay Soso was jailed for more than 12 years after he raped and killed Marie Reid in her sheltered home in Edinburgh . A young man was today jailed for more than 12 years for raping and killing a frail woman in her sheltered home. Jay Soso was only 18 when he attacked 63-year-old Marie Reid, who had lived next door to him and treated him 'like a grandson'. Mrs Reid was found dead in blood-stained nightclothes, lying on a sofa in her Edinburgh flat, after neighbours became worried when they had not seen her for days. Police initially thought her death was not suspicious, but the truth emerged after her family voiced concerns and post-mortem examinations were carried out. Soso, now 20, was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh today after pleading guilty at a previous hearing to rape and culpable homicide. He has no previous convictions. He was given an extended sentence, detaining him for 12 years and eight months, and a judge ordered for him to be supervised for a further five years on his release. The court heard that Mrs Reid was particularly vulnerable as she suffered from a number of significant medical issues and her health was more like that of an 80-year-old. When neighbours raised concerns after they had not seen her, housing support officers entered her home in Easter Drylaw Way on November 15, 2010, and found her dead in the lounge. Post-mortem examinations of Mrs Reid's body revealed that she had been raped four days earlier and had died on the day of the attack. Soso's DNA matched samples taken from the scene. He was originally charged with murder, but his plea of guilty to a reduced charge was accepted. Soso and his mother used to live next door to Mrs Reid, who treated him kindly. In . early 2008, he and his family moved to Hartlepool, County Durham, but . he returned to Edinburgh by June that year and eventually got a flat in . the Drylaw area. Victim: Marie Reid, pictured with her son Paul, was found dead in blood-stained bedclothes in her lounge . At the time of the attack, he was single and worked locally as a fishmonger. Outside . court, Mrs Reid's son Paul, 31, revealed how he persuaded police to . carry out a criminal investigation into his mother's death. 'I . noticed something funny when I first went to the home,' he said. 'There . was something strange about it, I couldn’t put my finger on it. 'I went to the police station and said ""I want you to look at this further because there’s something not right"".' Mr Reid said he had struggled to come to terms with losing his 'sweet and loveable' mother in such horrific circumstances. He said she had 'a big heart' and would do anything for people in her local community. 'I just hope it never happens to anybody,' he added. 'It’s hard to cope with, I’m struggling myself in life now. 'Losing my mum has been so hard. I’ve got so much anger towards Jay just now. 'I knew Jay since he was maybe eight or nine. I couldn’t believe that Jay would do such a thing like this, he didn’t seem the type. My mum treated him like a grandson.' Shock: Outside court, Paul Reid (left) said his mother had treated her killer, Jay Soso (right), 'like a grandson'. He said he felt angry that Soso had shaken his hand and consoled him shortly after Mrs Reid's body was found . Mr Reid, who was accompanied by his sister, Jacqueline Sanderson, 38, said Soso even offered his condolences to the family shortly after Mrs Reid's body was found. 'Now for me, knowing that he shook my hand and gave me condolences, that makes me even more angry towards him,' he said. Mrs Sanderson's husband Gordon, 54, of North Berwick, East Lothian, said the family was content with Soso's sentence. 'The way I see it now, he’s away and other women in the same situation are going to be safe from him,' Mr Sanderson said. 'He’s off the streets and the public’s safe. 'Marie was so quiet, friendly and trusted people. She didn’t deserve to go the way she did. 'To die the way she did, being left alone in that place for five days, is just horrible. 'We can’t fathom what he was thinking to have actually done it. He must have snapped somewhere.' Passing sentence, judge Lady Dorrian said: 'You have pled guilty to the rape and culpable homicide of an elderly lady in her own home. 'She was vulnerable in that she lived alone and suffered from poor health, both factors of which you were aware. 'You knew her and there was an element of trust in the relationship you had with her.' Brian McConnachie QC, defending, said Soso accepted full responsibility for what happened, although he continued to insist he cannot remember the attack. The lawyer said Soso had smoked cannabis since he was a young teenager, but there was nothing in his past behaviour to suggest he would commit such a crime. 'It is almost incapable of explanation as to how this offence came about,' he said. 'It is a tragic case in so many ways for Marie and for her family. 'Her untimely death has undoubtedly affected them and clearly they will have to live with the consequences of this act forever.'","Jay Soso attacked Marie Reid in her sheltered home in Edinburgh in November 2010 .

An indebted house painter shot dead his wife and 11-year-old daughter, drove to McDonald's for a snack with the girl's body in the car and then handed himself in to police. Dean Holmes, 40, of Spanaway, Washington, murdered his wife, Kristi, 41, whom he had been lying to about the family's flailing financial affairs, while she slept on Tuesday night.

Violet's dead body was in the car while he stopped at McDonald's. After . several hours spent scrubbing blood from the vehicle and the family home, Holmes walked into . the county jail in Tacoma and confessed to the shocking double-murder at around 4.45am on Wednesday. Police say a second child was not at home at the time of the shooting, according to King 5 News. Holmes, who owns a house painting business, told investigators that he felt he was drowning in debt -- something he'd been hiding from his wife. The . man owed $18,240 in unpaid . taxes and had lied to Kristi about a home they were supposed to be moving into.

'I had no idea they had these kinds of problems. I never would have even called them. I just would have let the money ride.'

'Could become more dangerous': Jason Fairfax (not pictured) has been spared jail despite amassing around 2,700 indecent images of children (file picture posed by model) A paedophile who downloaded child porn has been spared jail after a judge said locking him up could be more dangerous to society in the long term. Jason Fairfax, 35, of Bargoed, south Wales, had amassed a collection of around 2,700 indecent images when police raided his home earlier this year. The photographs and videos were later graded from one to five - with the higher the category, the more serious the offence. Cardiff Crown Court heard almost a third of the images were at the higher end of the scale - with 786 level four and 29 level five images. The details of the photographs were so serious, Judge David Wyn Morgan asked the media not to publish their details. He said: 'When the police investigated your computer, they found a staggering number of images that were indecent. 'There was a very large number of them at the top end of the scale, at level four and five. 'The natural reaction of any decent human being would be that you should go to prison for as long as possible. 'But when the revulsion has subsided, the court must consider precisely what that would achieve. 'You would go into prison as sex offender and still come out as one - just as dangerous if not more so than you are at the moment. 'And the protection of the public must be of paramount concern to the court.' Fairfax’s home was raided by police in March this year. Despite a no-comment interview to officers, he later pleaded guilty to downloading indecent images before magistrates - who said their sentencing powers were not strong enough and referred the case to Crown Court. Defending barrister Andrew Jones said his client was deeply ashamed of his actions - but said Fairfax had accessed the images when he was suffering with severe depression. Depraved: Cardiff Crown Court (above) heard almost a third of the images downloaded by Fairfax were at the higher end of the scale . Mr Jones told the court the cause of the depression had been due to the defendant’s difficulty in coming to terms with his sexuality. In mitigation, he added Fairfax had also not distributed the images and had no previous convictions. Judge Morgan decided to make the defendant the subject of a sex offenders treatment programme for three years. He will also have to sign the sex offenders' register until at least 2017 and undertake 250 hours of unpaid work. Furthermore, Fairfax is not allowed to have any contact with any children under the age of 16 - either in person, on the telephone or via the internet - without the approval of their parents. He is also banned from deleting the browsing history on his computer as well as erasing any images from a digital camera or camera phone without permission from the police. Judge Morgan said: 'This is not a soft option. It is a particularly difficult one. 'Everybody now knows about you and your reputation has been exploded. 'Should you fail to comply with any of the court’s orders then you will wind up in custody.'","Jason Fairfax amassed nearly 3,000 indecent images .

Ready to talk: FARC spokesman Rodrigo Londono, aka Timochenko, announced that the group is ready to negotiate with Colombian authorities . For more than 50 years they have waged a violent war against the state which has led to thousands upon thousands of deaths. With a campaign of kidnapping they exerted a chilling influence over their country's political process and made every policeman and soldier a target. But now Colombia's Marxist rebel group FARC have announced they are ready for a political solutions - by releasing an acoustic rap music video telling how they are ready for peace. The video, on the website of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and quickly reposted by a string of YouTube users, also carried a message from leader Rodrigo Londono. 'We come to the table for dialogue without rancour or arrogance,' announced Londono, who also goes by the noms de guerre Timoleon Jimenez and 'Timochenko'. It was the first comment from Latin America's oldest guerrilla army since President Juan Manuel Santos announced a week ago that preliminary talks were under way ahead of a formal, full-fledged peace process. Timochenko gave no specific details. The video part of his message included footage of young FARC fighters singing a rap song with lyrics that were in favour of dialogue with the government. The song, performed to accompanying guitar and bongos, features several FARC fighters dancing and singing while dressed in Che Guevara T-shirts and paramilitary uniforms. MailOnline was unable to interpret the lyrics. President Santos said full peace talks would start in 'several weeks' but warned that 'the process will likely be difficult.' Colombian press reports said the talks would begin in October, first in Norway and then continuing in Cuba. The discussions would likely address issues such as distributing land to peasant farmers, rebels' links to drug trafficking and reincorporating guerrilla leaders into everyday life - a sensitive point, as many of them have been convicted of crimes against humanity. Musical youth: FARC fighters perform a rap music track with lyrics supporting dialogue with the government. MailOnline was unable to independently verfiy the track's meaning . Revolutionary chic: The FARC fighters appeared in Che Guevara T-shirts and paramilitary uniforms in the video . President Santos said a week ago that Bogota would not cease military operations against the FARC or withdraw security forces while contacts were under way, and seven rebels were killed in clashes yesterday. Without referring to the latest FARC statement, the president said: 'With much hope, we the people of Colombia are going to see if we can end this conflict, which has caused us so much pain.' He warned against 'repeating the mistakes of the past' - a reference to a vast demilitarised zone set up for the FARC during the last talks, in 2002, that allegedly just helped them regroup. But some analysts say a ceasefire may be necessary as a confidence-building measure for any successful peace talks. Political scientist Fernando Giraldo said Timochenko's word choice was cause for hope after decades of fighting and suffering. Class struggle: The FARC are Colombia's oldest rebel group and draw their roots from anger among landless peasants in a country with a gaping divide between rich and poor . Fighting a losing battle? The FARC have some 9,200 fighters, down by half over the past decade after a series of military defeats, and have been largely corralled in rural areas . 'The FARC have suffered many tough blows, . and to say that they are going into the dialogue not seeking revenge . reflects a good attitude, although later at the negotiating table there . could be many difficulties,' Mr Giraldo told AFP.

Colombia has seen peace talks come and go before, three times since the Eighties. The last attempt was in 2002. Colombian media said on Sunday that the preliminary talks took place in Venezuela and Havana, and produced a six-point negotiating agenda. President Santos is halfway through a four-year term. When announcing the fledgling talks in a speech to the nation on August 27, he said peace was his priority. 'Since the day my government took office, I have respected my constitutional obligation to seek peace, and we have undertaken exploratory talks with the FARC, to seek an end to the conflict,' he said.",First comment by Marxist paramilitary group since Colombia's president announced preliminary peace talks were underway .

The 13-feet tall window that crushed an 'extremely talented' young lawyer to death weighed more than half a tonne, an inquest heard today. Lawyer Amanda Telfer, 43, was . fatally injured as she ate a banana while passing by a construction . site on Hanover Square, off Oxford Street in central London. Criminal charges could now be brought after she was killed by the frame that took ten people to pull off her body, the inquest was told. Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox opened and adjourned the case today to allow the Metropolitan Police and Health And Safety Executive to continue their investigation. 'This investigation will take a considerable amount of time as at the moment we still do not know whether . charges will be brought in this case,' she said. Floral tributes were left where she died, including a note reading ‘sorry we . couldn’t save you’, just metres from where the frame that killed her lay . for several days as police cordoned off the area. Describing what happened coroners officer Barry May told Westminster Coroner’s Court today: 'Amanda Barrie Telfer died on August 30 this year. She was walking along Hanover Street. 'On the pavement there were two window frames weighing approximately half a tonne each that had been propped against a wall of an office building. 'As she walked past a window frame fell on her pinning her to the ground. Members of the public removed the frames and started CPR.' It was confirmed that “a gust of wind caused the frame to fall over'. Miss Telfer, who worked for legal firm Keystone Law, was a volunteer for the charity Reprieve, helping represent British-born Neil Revill, 40, who faced a possible death sentence for the double murder of a drug dealer and his girlfriend in California in 2001. He was eventually sentenced to life after a trial last year. Speaking from Guantanamo Bay, Clive Stafford Smith, the founder of Reprieve, said her death was 'tragic'. 'I heard about poor Amanda a couple of days ago - what a tragedy,' he told the paper. 'She was a volunteer at Reprieve, and an excellent one, and then very kindly ‘legalled’ my new book, so it was a pleasure to have the chance to catch up with her then. 'How very sad it was to hear, and my heart goes out to her family. Poignant: The giant window frames lay strewn on the pavement outside the building site for several days . Heartfelt: Flower tributes included one note apologising to the lawyer for not being able to save her life . Devastated colleagues have paid tribute to the 'extremely talented' 43-year-old. James Knight, partner at Keystone Law in central London where Ms Telfer . was an intellectual property and media consultant, said: 'It is with . great sadness that we confirm Amanda Telfer, a lawyer at Keystone Law, . was killed last week, in a tragic accident in Hanover Square. 'Amanda joined Keystone in 2005. She was an extremely talented lawyer, . much admired by her clients and colleagues. They, like us, are . devastated by this news. Obviously our thoughts are with Amanda's . family.' Ms Telfer previously worked as senior legal counsel at Random House and as a litigator at Denton Wilde Sapte, both based in London. She was also a freelance consultant for human rights campaign group Reprieve UK between 2004 and 2009, where her role involved gathering evidence for reports on British Nationals awaiting trial and up for the death penalty in America. In 2005 she produced a play called 'Lorilei' which was performed at the London Fringe theatre and Edinburgh Festival that year. Tragedy: . A police tent was put up where a window fell on top of Amanda Telfer as she passed by Hanover Square, just off . Oxford Street, in central London . Shock: . The accident happened as workmen were installing windows at a new . multi-million pound six-storey office block. Ambulance crews rushed to . the scene and battled to save the woman but she was declared dead . She studied at Maths and Philosophy at Manchester University before gaining her law qualification at BPP Law School in London and starting her first job as a trainee at Rouse & Co/Willoughby & Partners in 1997. The emergency call was made by a man delivering electrical cables to the area. He said that the woman was 'flattened', and that he thought he saw her 'draw her last breath'. The 999 operator told him to get closer and probably saw the moment she died. 'Her eyes were open and I saw her hand move and then I think I saw her last breath and then the light went out: she'd gone,' he said. 'You'd have more chance of winning the lottery than that happening to you. 'She was in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time.' The construction company running the site, Westgreen Construction Ltd, said they would do 'whatever is necessary' and called it a 'terrible accident.' Dr Nichola Lloyd, an out-of-hours GP at the Princess Elizabeth Hospital in Guernsey tried to help. ‘I walked past there about ten second beforehand,’ she said. ‘It . was really just the wrong place at the wrong time and it could have happen to . any of us. ‘I almost went into autopilot. She clearly had very bad injuries, but you . just have to think that is a person whose life needs saving and you do what you . can to help.’ Witnesses claimed the ‘very . heavy’ window had been left ‘propped’ on a wall on the ground floor, . and that barriers guarding the building site had recently been removed. The accident happened at 11.30am in . Mayfair’s Hanover Square, which houses some of London’s most expensive . offices. An art gallery is on the ground floor and the Vogue building, . the headquarters of publisher Conde Nast, is opposite. Dario Motti, 65, said the 12ft-high . frame had been propped up against a wall before it fell on the woman. ‘I . saw the frames delivered,’ he added. ‘They were so heavy they . were lifted in by crane.’ Taped off: Police officers were stationed around the scene where a woman has died after she was struck by a falling window pane . Investigation: The Health and Safety Executive launched an investigation into the tragedy and shocked witnesses took to Twitter to express their horror and the freak accident which was caused by high winds . A man delivering electrical cables to another building, who did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the frame off the woman . Kohei Matsumoto, manager of a nearby . Itsu sushi restaurant, added: ‘Two of my team members saw a girl turn . left into Hanover Street. She was eating a banana. ‘The next thing they saw was this . window frame falling down on her. She didn’t scream – it happened so . quickly.’ A man delivering electrical cables to another building,  who . did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the . frame off  the woman. ‘I heard this incredible loud bang,’ he said. ‘I turned round and the frame was on the ground.

She was in the wrong place at the wrong time.’ Building site: Workmen were installing windows in a six-storey office block in Hanover Square in London when the incident happened . Beverley Hazel, from Kennington, South London, was on her way to work at 11.30am when she saw the woman lying in the road. She said: ‘She was very young and . slight. I’ve got two daughters, one younger and one older than this . woman. I was in bits. If it had been my daughter I would have wanted . someone with her.’ A spokesman for Westgreen Construction .

Controversial: A new rival book titled No Easy Op alleges that Matt Bissonnette, who wrote No Easy Day, could have been motivated by revenge on SEAL Team 6 . He claimed to be out to tell the truth on the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. But the Navy SEAL who wrote the first hand account of the mission could actually have been motivated by revenge - on his own comrades. A rival book alleges that Matt Bissonnette, who wrote ‘No Easy Day’, had ‘bad blood’ between his former colleagues and commanders because he was kicked out of the unit. ‘No Easy Op’ claims that the soldier was ‘ostracized’ when he inquired about leaving the Navy to start a business and was sent home suddenly before quitting. Feeling scorned Bissonnette could have penned his novel as a way of getting back at the military in which he served for 14 years with distinction. No Easy Day, which is due out tomorrow, is the first account of the bin Laden operation from a member of the squad who was there. But it has proved controversial because Bissonnette, writing under the pseudonym Mark Owen, did not seek approval from the authorities before he wrote it. It also disagrees with the official White House version of events which was put out at the time and has caused the Obama administration consternation. According to the New York Times, the book says that Bissonnette was ‘repaid for his honesty and 14 years of service’ with nothing but rejection. The rival book claims that Bissonnette, seen in this photo talking to TV show 60 Minutes about the Osama bin Laden Pakistan raid, was rejected by his comrades after he inquired about leaving the Navy to start a business . It claims he was ‘ostracized from his unit with no notice and handed a plane ticket back to Virginia from a training operation’, before eventually leaving. The book says: ‘In the infantry-bred world of Army Special Operations, no one wants to hear braggarts telling tall tales of their heroics,’ Commando: A photo purported to be of Matt Bissonnette was published by Business Insider last Thursday . No Easy Op has been written by sofrep.com, a web site for former Special Operations team members. Brandon Webb, a former SEAL sniper who founded the site, said that the book was the product of conversations he and others had with serving members of the bin Laden team, although none of them are identified. Talking to the New York Times, Mr Webb refused to say whether Bissonnette was involved in No Easy Op, even though he has spoken to him in the past.

In a statement, Kevin Maurer, one of the co-authors of No Easy Day said: ‘After spending several very intense months working with Mark Owen on this book, I know that he wrote this book solely to share a story about the incredible men and women defending America all over the world. ‘Any suggestion otherwise is as ill informed as it is inaccurate. ‘What’s more, Mark has an unshakable respect for the US military, in particular the men he served with. ‘That’s why not one negative word was written about anyone he served with.’ This . undated file photo shows al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, in .

The man accused of murdering his wife and three children, confided in a stripper about his failing marriage and resentment toward his family obligations in the lead up to the gruesome slaying, according to testimony in his murder trial. In the case against Christopher Vaughn, prosecutors are painting the picture of a man who had grown tired of his Chicago suburban life and whose frustration fueled his rage against his family. Vaughn, from Oswego, Illinois, is accused of the fatal shootings of his wife Kimberly, 34, and their three children - 12-year-old Abigayle, 11-year-old Cassandra and 8-year-old Blake on June 14, 2007. Tragedy: Christopher and Kimberly Vaughn with their children (from left) Cassandra, Blake and Abigayle, in an undated photo celebrating Kimberly's graduation from the University of Phoenix . Cut short: Christopher Vaughn allegedly told his family they were taking an adventure, when he drove them into the woods and shot them dead . Police say the father told his family they were going to take an adventure in the woods. He packed the family into their SUV but when they arrived at the campground, he allegedly shot them dead as they were strapped in their seat belts. Vaughn has pleaded not-guilty to four counts of first-degree murder, claiming that he did not kill his family but that his wife had killed the children and then turned the gun on herself. In the third week of Vaughn's trial at the Will County courthouse in Joliet, outside Chicago, an exotic dancer, Maya Drake, testified that Vaughn had visited Scores Gentlemen's Club, where she worked, in the weeks before the crime, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. She described how Vaughn came to the Chicago area strip club, on four or five occasions and had discussed a feud he had with his wife over expensive drapes that she had ordered for their home. Christopher Vaughn Vaughn is accused of the fatal shootings of his wife and their three children . Vaughn was said to be enraged that his . wife was materialistic and he shared how he dreamed of breaking free of all . responsibility for his family. 'He told me that he wanted to leave his wife and move to Canada and build his own home or cabin in the woods,' Drake said. 'He said [his wife] was going to get what she deserved. She wasn't going to see it coming,' she added. Vaughn had been stockpiling wilderness gear, according to police. Officers uncovered a storage unit he had rented that was full of camping gear, tin cups and plates, sleeping bags, boots and camp tools in addition to a jar of peanut butter and a bottle of Jameson Irish Whiskey. Another stripper, Chrystal Miller, had testified in late August about Vaughn's visit to the club, describing him as a 'very timid'  customer. She said he spent upwards of $5,000 each on two visits to the establishment, in the weeks before his family's murder. In addition to the testimony from the exotic dancer, prosecutors discussed Vaughn's psychological state by introducing journal entries from Vaughn following his arrest in June 2007. In the entries, he poetically describes his life without making a single mention to his wife and three children. 'They were musings, some daily event items, just kind of a journal,' Scott Hull, an FBI forensic examiner said on the stand, before reading several of the entries. 'This journal will serve as a written daily meditation,' Hull said, quoting the writings, 'The ups and down, feelings and thoughts and lessons of each day.' Much of Vaughn's jail house writings include his list of dream activities he would like to take part in, were he not incarcerated. His wish list includes wanting to sit outside to feel the sun or take a walk barefoot. Other reveries includes feeling a breeze on his face, enjoying an embrace, taking a nap in his Jeep, drinking apple brandy by a campfire and eating biscuits and gravy — with lots of sausage.

A mother whose nine-year-old daughter was kidnapped, raped and slashed to death in South Dakota 22 years ago has raised enough money to attend the convicted killer's execution. Tina Curl, 50, appealed for help last month after she was unable to afford the 1,400-mile road trip from her home in Lake Luzerne, New York to South Dakota for Donald Moeller's execution. After news coverage of her predicament, donations flooded in from as far away as Chicago and Alaska, and she has now raised the $4,000 she needed to drive and stay in Sioux Falls. Looking for closure: Tina Curl, pictured with her husband Dave, has raised $4,000 to travel from New York to South Dakota to watch the execution of the man who killed her nine-year-old daughter . But as well as generous donations from strangers, Curl also received an onslaught of negative comments telling her to move on and seek help. 'Everybody wants to put me down because I want to be there to see the execution,' Curl said. 'Unless you've walked in my shoes, don't judge me. Don't tell me what you would do if it happened to you. You don't know until it happens to you.' Moeller, who murdered Curl's daughter Becky O'Connell in 1990, will be executed with lethal injection between October 28 and November 3. But with the exact date of the death unknown - the warden will give 48 hours notice - Curl and her husband also needed money to cover motel costs for the week. Murderer: Donald Moeller, left, kidnapped Becky O'Connell, right, as she was on her way to a convenience store in 1990. He raped and repeatedly stabbed her, and she died from a sliced throat . Missed: Curl, pictured with Becky, will start the 1,400 mile journey to the prison at the end of October . They also needed help with gas money as Curl needs to travel by car as she suffered a heart attack and quadruple bypass in May 2003, is registered disabled and cannot fly. Her husband Dave, who was not Becky's father, has been out of work for a year. A neighbour helped Curl set up an online PayPal account and open a fund at a local credit union. Any money she does not spend on the trip will cover unpaid bills from O'Connell's funeral, she said. 'I have waited 22 long years for this,' Curl told ABC News. 'He watched her die and I am going to watch him die.' 'The sooner they get him strapped . down, the better I’ll feel,' she added to the Argus Leader last month. 'I’ve been preparing for the day for 20 years. I’d been thinking he’d . die from health problems.' Death sentence: Moeller will be put to death between October 28 and November 3 in Sioux Falls . Guilty: Moeller, now 60, repeatedly tried to overturn the conviction but now his lawyer said the killer accepts the execution as the consequences of his actions . Her daughter, Becky O'Connell, vanished on May 8, 1990 when she went to a . convenience store a block from her home in Sioux Falls. Moeller grabbed . her as she walked along the busy intersection. The youngster's naked body was found . in a ditch in Lincoln County, South Dakota the next morning; she had . been raped and stabbed and died after her throat was slit, according to . court documents. Moeller, now 60, was found guilty in 1992 and . sentenced to 25 years in prison for the rape charge and death by lethal . injection for the horrifying murder. Donald Moeller has repeatedly tried . to overturn his death penalty after it was set in 1992. In 1996, the . South Dakota State Supreme Court agreed he did not get a fair trial. Loved: Tina said the death would not bring her closure for her daughter's death but would help her heal . But when he was retried a year later, the verdict remained the same - death. Moeller said through his attorney that he accepts the execution as the consequences of his actions. Before the murder, he had a criminal . history including sex abuse and the use of a knife against women and a . 13-year-old boy. On the day he killed Becky, he had a meeting with his . parole officer.

Severe weather, protesters and gaffe-filled speeches are always a worry at political conventions, but unfavorable hotel reviews hint that bed bugs may also be an issue for the Democratic delegates this year. According to a bed bug complaint website, nine of the hotels being used by convention delegations have had bed bug sightings in recent months. Even though county health officials said that they inspected all of the hotels in question in July, some of the complaints from angry visitors allege that the problems may not have been fully exterminated. Pesty past: The Charlotte Marriott City Center had the highest number of complaints on a bed bug message board site but their spokesman said that they maintain strict cleaning schedules . Nice exterior: The Holiday Inn Center City, which is hosting the Illinois delegation, had previous complaints about the insects but they deny that it is a problem . The Bedbug Registry, an online message board where hotel guests can write reviews of their various visits, shows that of the 21 hotels in Charlotte that have had complaints, nine of those were assigned to various delegations including the ones from Minnesota, Illinois, and Pennsylvania. Florida delegates may be in the most trouble, however, as their Charlotte Marriot City Center location had the highest number of complaints on the website. Of the hotel's six complaints, the most recent was logged at the beginning of August, one month after the county officials said they checked for bedbugs. The hotel denied these allegations, telling The Washington Times that they maintain 'strict cleanliness standards, which includes constant monitoring and routine assessments of guest rooms and public space.' Up close: Bed bugs can bite unsuspecting guests who may accidentally carry them to other places . Another hotel that was given a poor pest review was the Holiday Inn Center City, which received three complaints and has received representatives from the Illinois delegation for the past few days leading up to tonight's kick off. While a hotel representative declined to give MailOnline a statement, she denied that they have bedbugs and said that the web claims alleging otherwise were wrong. Bed bugs aren't the only problem plaguing the traveling delegates, as seven of the rooms reserved for California representatives were deemed unsafe after a large portion of stucco from the Blake Hotel  fell off on Friday. Local station WSOCTV reported that nine stories of stucco fell from the side of the uptown building and required quick construction to be fixed in time. Appealing to the masses: On his way down to North Carolina, President Obama appeared at a campaign rally at Norfolk State University Tuesday afternoon . The event: The convention is being held in the Time Warner Cable Arena which begins Tuesday night . The Sacramento Bee said that state senator Ted Lieu tweeted his complaints about how he had to switch rooms five times in the first two days he was in the hotel because of broken locks, a 'funny smell' and- in keeping with the insect theme- cockroaches. Adding to the list of complaints that is sure to grow and the convention continues, delegates from Texas, Maryland and Tennessee all woke up on the wrong side of the morning when the fire alarm at the Great Wolf Lodge went off at 3am on Tuesday, prompting an evacuation. Once it was determined that it was a false alarm, some of the upset early risers jokingly tweeted that it might have been a Republican prank.","Nine of the 21 hotels being used by Democratic delegations have complaints lodged against them on a message website about bed bugs .

Under fire: David Cameron has offered to knight four former ministers he sacked this week . David Cameron was accused last night of bringing the honours system into disrepute after rewarding ministers sacked in his reshuffle. No 10 slipped out a statement on Wednesday night revealing that the Prime Minister was recommending four male former ministers for knighthoods. It also emerged that the two women axed from the Cabinet are likely to get peerages. The knighthoods will go to three Tories – James Paice, Edward Garnier and Gerald Howarth – and one Liberal Democrat, Nick Harvey, even though they have served for only two years. Both the decision and timing of the announcement have been criticised. Sir Alistair Graham, former head of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ‘Why have these been announced separate from the normal twice yearly lists? ‘It is fatal to the dignity and credibility of any honours system if they are seen to be automatic.’ Labour MP Paul Flynn said: ‘The distribution of consolation prizes to sacked ministers is likely to bring the honours system into further disrepute and ridicule.’ Graham Smith, of Republic, which campaigns for reform of the process, said it appeared to be ‘rewards for failure’, adding: ‘It is a straightforward abuse of the system.’ Rewarded:  (Clockwise from top left) Edward Garnier, Jim Paice, Gerald Howarth and Nick Harvey have all been put forward by the PM for knighthoods .

The report contained details of a late-night championship party in 2009 at the Agganis Arena which revealed that: . Details of the party have now only emerged after a task force was launched in February when two Boston University hockey players were charged with sexual assault. The investigation by the task force found that some hockey players - when surrounded by fans - had 'the perception that they need not seek consent for sexual contact.' One player told investigators: 'You don’t ask [permission for sex] when you are drunk.' Wild: The report contained details of a late-night championship party in 2009 at the Agganis Arena, pictured here for basketball, which revealed that party-goers took to the ice naked to shoot ice pucks . The task force was told by one female . student that a hockey player had put his hands down her pants at a . party and, despite the fact that she was punching him, refused to stop. When asked why she had not reported the incident to authorities, she replied: 'that’s just what [BU hockey players] do.' The reports also found that some hockey players at the university boast about their sexual exploits on Facebook, often referring to conquests as 'kills'. Many of the hockey players, the investigation found, regularly engage in group sex. The university campus police and administrators did not find out about the controversial 2009 party until this year once the task force investigation started. Party goers were having sex in the penalty box, drank from beer kegs in the locker room showers and took to the ice naked to shoot ice pucks. Players also put on Facebook their female conquests . It has emerged that during interviews with investigators hockey coach Jack Parker said at first that he did not know about the party. However, he later acknowledged that he knew some of the men had been drinking in the locker room. Despite this, two players and a member of staff said that within a few days of the party, the coach had reprimanded the team for its behaviour. The subcommittee report also found that some of the hockey players are less academically gifted than the vast majority of their classmates. One professor described how six hockey players intimidated their classmates and answered their mobile phones during lectures.  Eventually all six of the players dropped out of the class. However, another professor said hockey players were respectful and prepared. Following a recommendation by the task force, Parker has been stripped of the title of executive athletic director. He still keeps another title. However, he will still continue as coach and will earn the same salary. The public report has made 14 recommendations, which the university intends to implement.","The debauched details emerged following a Boston University report on the 'culture of sexual entitlement' by its hockey players .

Two police officers are to be prosecuted after a 52-year-old man died in his flat while under their custody. The Kent police officers are due to appear in court after an investigation into their actions was carried out by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). PC Maurice Leigh and PC Neil Bowdery were present when Colin Holt, 52, died in his flat from positional asphyxia in Goudhurst Road in Gillingham, Kent on 30 August 2010. The Colin Holt, 52, died in his flat in Goudhurst Road (pictured) while under the custody of two Kent police officers . That day, Mr Holt, who had been sectioned under the Mental Health Act, was reported missing by staff at Medway Maritime Hospital. He was found at home by the officers at 1.30pm. At the time, the IPCC said it appeared Mr Holt became “unwell” while officers were attempting to restrain him. An ambulance was called but the man was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later. A post mortem found that the cause of death was positional asphyxia. IPCC investigators carried out house to house enquiries in the local area, examined officers’ accounts, checked police logs and examined CCTV. An IPCC Family Liaison Manager kept Mr Holt’s family up to date with progress of the investigation. Now, two years later, IPCC Commissioner Mike Franklin said: 'We welcome the decision by the CPS following its review of the evidence to authorise charges against PC Maurice Leigh and PC Neil Bowdery for misconduct in public office. 'That decision follows an independent investigation by the IPCC into the actions of Kent Police officers who were at Colin Holt’s flat when he died. 'Investigators will continue to work with the CPS to assist in the preparation for those criminal proceedings.' Rene Barclay, principal crown advocate with the Special Crime team at the CPS, added: 'It is alleged that on 30 August 2010, whilst acting as a police officer, namely as a police constable, PC Leigh and PC Bowdery misconducted themselves in that, without lawful justification or excuse, they wilfully neglected to take reasonable and proper care of Colin Holt, a person in police detention. 'On the evidence I have reviewed, I am satisfied that there is a realistic prospect of conviction and that the public interest requires a prosecution. 'PC Leigh and PC Bowdery will now be summonsed on a criminal offence and have the right to a fair trial.' Both officers will appear at Medway Magistrates’ Court on 8 October.

But these six raiders fled empty-handed from a motorbike showroom after tough staff fought them off with relative ease. CCTV footage from the In-Moto showroom in Croydon, south London, shows two raiders, wearing motorbike helmets, walk into the shop and try to wheel away two £25,000 red Ducati Panigale motorbikes. But when one of the workers at the showroom, Paul Read, discovered what they were doing, he grabbed the men, hauled the bikes back into the showroom and shoved the raiders out of the door - as well as two other thugs who had joined them.

And outside the showroom more raiders turn up - only to be confronted by the In-Moto manager Adrian Couzens and his team at around 5.30pm last Tuesday. The footage captures Mr Couzens charging at a thug and knocking him off his moped outside the showroom and fending off another thug armed with a pair of bolt cutters.

A lorry driver has suffocated under an eight tonne 'avalanche' of animal feed after it accidentally poured on top of him as he worked inside a giant dockside silo. The haulier, who has not been named but is said to have been in his 60s, was attempting to open the back of his truck in the Port of Liverpool, Merseyside, when the soyabean meal he had just loaded tumbled out and buried him. The driver was freed by work colleagues from the mountain of grain - described as having the texture of biscuit crumbs - and resuscitated but died later in hospital from asphyixia and the effects of a heart attack. A man died after being buried under eight tonnes of grain at the Cargill plant in Bootle, Merseyside (pictured). He is said to have died from the effects of suffocation and a subsequent heart attack. The health and safety executive are now investigating the tragedy which happened at 11am yesterday morning at the Cargill terminal at Seaforth docks. A worker at the docks, who did not wish to be named, said: 'He had loaded a trailer and then went to the weigh bridge but it was overweight. 'He reversed back into the building, to the soya pile, and went to the back of the trailer to open the door only for the mountain of soya in the container to collapse on him like an avalanche, burying him.' The driver worked for haulage firm Reid Atkinson based in Kellbrook, Lancashire. The soybean was being held in a silo - a large suspended container widely used in agriculture to store grain. Cargill, a company which produces high protein soyabean meal and crude soya oil for use in animal feed said in a statement: 'Cargill can confirm that an accident involving a driver, employed by a third-party haulage company, occurred at our Seaforth site.

The North West ambulance service confirmed the man had been suffocated and suffered a heart attack after the meal had fallen on him in the storage shed. He was resuscitated at the scene but died a short time later at Fazakerley Hospital. A hospital spokesman said: 'The feed fell on top of the man.

'Our team has worked with our subcontractors and vendors to create an exceptional home for an extremely deserving American hero,' said Marty Langpap, Inland Empire division manager for Standard Pacific Homes. In a poignant coincidence, the street names at the Reserve at Paseo del community in Temecula are named for the victims of the September 11 attacks.

One of the special features in Cpl. Dominguez's new home is a music room equipped to allow him to continue playing the guitar and drums - which are his passions. Indeed, the Marine and Sinise have played frequently together at Lt. Dan band concerts in California, as the two joined forces to help raise the $600,000 needed for his new home. At the unveiling of Cpl. Dominguez's home a motorcade will be lined with 1,000 U.S. flags as his comrades march past to salute the veteran and his family.

A father crushed his eight-week-old baby’s skull while he was left in charge of her for just 20 minutes after secretly drinking whisky and vodka, a court heard today. Richard Barnes, 27, allegedly went to buy more alcohol after inflicting the horrific injuries on baby Grace last November at the family home in Castleford, West Yorkshire. The Haribo sweets employee either kicked or stamped on the back of her head, or he may have crushed her skull by pressing it against a hard surface such as a floor, prosecutors said. Tragic death: Eight-week-old Grace, whose father allegedly either kicked or stamped on the back of her head, or may have crushed her skull by pressing it against a hard surface such as a floor . ‘There is no doubt that he did cause those injuries in a deliberate and unlawful assault upon his daughter,’ Richard Mansell QC, prosecuting, told Leeds Crown Court today. ‘When he inflicted these injuries, he can only have intended to cause her really serious bodily harm and therefore the prosecution alleges he is guilty of her murder.’ He said the incident happened ‘during a short period of time when he was in sole charge of Grace while her mother Stephanie was out of the house’. There were no concerns about Grace’s care during her short life, and the family home Barnes shared with Stephanie Rudd, his partner since 2006, was ‘spotless’, the prosecution said. But Barnes had a drink problem which he hid from Miss Rudd - and before attacking Grace he drank at least four miniature bottles of whisky, two vodka miniatures and two beers, the court was told. He filmed himself in his bathroom drinking two whiskies that lunchtime, saying ‘Pretty strong is that’ before belching. After the attack he bought two more miniatures and didn’t ring 999, the jury heard. Couple: Richard Barnes, 27, pictured with Stephanie Rudd, his partner since 2006. The family home they shared was 'spotless', the prosecution said, and there were no concerns about Grace's care during her short life . Mr Mansell said drink ‘certainly played a part’ in the murder and the amount he had consumed was ‘worrying’ if he was caring for an eight-week-old baby. Ms Rudd was away for 20 minutes while driving her mother Rinatre home. When she got back, Barnes called out to her to say he clashed heads with Grace after she was sick while he fed her. 'He did cause those injuries in a deliberate and unlawful assault upon his daughter. When he inflicted these injuries, he can only have intended to cause her really serious bodily harm' Richard Mansell QC, prosecuting . An ambulance took her to Pontefract General Infirmary, and after doctors became suspicious, the father was arrested and later bailed. After she died he was re-arrested on suspicion of murder but before detectives spoke to him, he told his father Kevin: ‘I’ve fallen on her, dad.’ He maintained they banged heads and that he then fell on the baby. He cut his wrist with a razor and later told a forensic nurse it was ‘an accident, I didn’t mean to do it’, the jury heard. Mr Mansell said Barnes will maintain it was an accident, but a pathologist’s view was that a simple fall would not have been forceful enough to cause the severe skull fracturing. Barnes denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Haribo employee Richard Barnes 'went to buy more alcohol after attack'

Royal protection officers who failed to stop naked pictures being taken of Prince Harry in Las Vegas last month cannot intrude into the private lives of royalty, Britain’s most senior policeman said today. Metropolitan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe told MPs that police protecting high profile individuals cannot cross ‘the golden line’ by getting involved in their personal life. He was questioned by Commons Home Affairs . Select Committee chairman Keith Vaz about the naked photographs of the . 27-year-old Prince in a hotel room, first published on a US . website. Boys about town: Tom 'Skippy' Inskip, Prince Harry and the Prince's Protection Officer relax in a jacuzzi in Las Vegas last month, just days before the naked pictures scandal arose . Having fun: Britain's most senior policeman today insisted that royal protection officers cannot intrude into the private lives of royalty . Mr Hogan-Howe, 54, said today: ‘We’re already in the process of reviewing that particular incident. ‘Our role is to maintain the security of our protected individual. They have to lead a normal life and we have to strike a balance between intrusion into their life and keeping them safe.' Days before pictures of his naked body spread across the internet, Prince Harry was photographed relaxing in a jacuzzi at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas with his best friend and his bodyguard. On his right was his longtime companion Tom 'Skippy' Inskip, and to his left was one of his royal protection officers, who has worked with the Royal Family since 1995, laughing and joking with him. Keeping back: Metropolitan Police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe told MPs that police protecting high profile individuals cannot cross 'the golden line' by getting involved in their personal life . It raised questions for the Metropolitan Police about why one of their employees, sent entirely at  taxpayers’ expense, was spotted having fun with the man he was meant to protecting. 'Our role is to maintain the security of our protected individual. They have to lead a normal life and we have to strike a balance between intrusion into their life and keeping them safe' Bernard Hogan-HoweMetropolitan Police Commissioner . But Mr Hogan-Howe added: ‘There is a golden line that cannot be crossed, which is getting involved in the social lives of the principals. There was nothing inappropriate and what appeared in photographs to be wrong was not as appeared.’ The embarrassment raised fears about the Prince’s protection, despite Met sources saying that there was no security breach and that officers were not there to protect his reputation. It is believed two of Prince Harry’s most high-ranking protection officers were interviewed by bosses back in London last month after accusations that they failed to stop the naked photos being taken. On tour: Prince Harry examines the cockpit of an Apache attack helicopter with a member of his squadron last week in Afghanistan, where he will be serving as a co-pilot gunner for four months . Global headlines were generated when pictures of Prince Harry frolicking in the nude with a naked woman during a holiday in the Nevada city emerged on celebrity gossip website TMZ last month. 'There is a golden line that cannot be crossed, which is getting involved in the social lives of the principals. There was nothing inappropriate and what appeared in photographs to be wrong was not as appeared' Bernard Hogan-HoweMetropolitan Police Commissioner . One shot showed the Prince holding his genitals and another featured him with his bottom exposed. Only the Sun newspaper defied a request to UK newspapers not to publish the pictures, made by St James’s Palace via the Press Complaints Commission. The newspaper watchdog has since said that it would be ‘inappropriate’ to open an investigation into the publication of the shots, because Prince Harry’s representatives had not made a complaint. The Prince moved on from the embarrassing incident with an appearance at the London Paralympics before a military deployment to Afghanistan to fly an Apache helicopter for four months.","Bernard Hogan-Howe told MPs that police cannot cross 'the golden line'

Radio 4 chiefs face accusations of ‘trivialising’ abortion after asking fans of The  Archers to vote on whether a character expecting a Down’s syndrome baby should terminate the pregnancy. The BBC soap currently features the moving story of an older couple dealing with the news that their unborn child has the condition. In the show, Vicky Tucker, who is in her mid-forties and pregnant for the first time, is adamant that she wants to go ahead and have the baby. The Archers fans were asked to vote on whether Rachel Atkins' (right) character - expecting a Down's syndrome baby - should terminate the pregnancy that her husband on the show, played by Terry Molloy (left), does not want . But her husband Mike, a sixtysomething dairy farmer, feels it will be too much for them to cope with. Some listeners have been in tears at the harrowing storyline and there has been praise for the sensitive way it has been handled. But fans who logged on to The Archers website recently were taken aback to find a poll inviting a yes/no vote on whether the Vicky character should have an abortion. The online vote was posted on the website on September 3 and remained in place for several days. Critics claimed its blunt approach trivialised what is a ‘life-changing decision’ for many couples and was presented in a ‘tasteless’ way. In the show, 62-year-old Mike, played by Terry Molloy, is distraught that his wife, played by Rachel Atkins, appears to have made up her mind to go ahead with the pregnancy without considering his views. Fans of the show have speculated whether the trauma could end their marriage. Listeners upset at the poll wrote of their concerns online and some had called for it to removed. One fan wrote: ‘Could we please get the distasteful poll on The Archers website removed?’ Another said: ‘Discussion on Archers website is really interesting and thought provoking. A simple “yes/no” poll just feels a bit wrong.’ Jane Fisher, from Antenatal Results and Choices, a national charity which supports expectant and bereaved parents, said yesterday: ‘It’s a hugely painful personal decision to which different parents and couples bring different things. ‘I think to reduce it to a simple yes/no vote can be seen to trivialise what is a life-changing decision. ‘There is no easy answer in these circumstances and we don’t think the BBC should promote the idea that the outcome of a difficult and painful decision should be based on the number of votes received by the public.’ In a letter to a national newspaper, Archers listener Karen Day-Milne wrote: ‘It is understandable that  the BBC should wish to explore this controversial plot line in the  show, and indeed the story is being handled with some sensitivity; yet to ask listeners to vote yes or no to the ending of an albeit fictional life seems tasteless.’ Last night a spokesman for the programme apologised and admitted the poll was ill-judged. ‘The storyline has been well-received by the audience and raises a number of important issues,’ the spokesman said. ‘However this issue is too complex and sensitive for an online poll and we regret any offence the poll may have caused.’",Radio 4 has been accused of 'trivialising abortion' by asking fans of The Archers whether a character expecting a Down's syndrome baby should terminate the pregnancy .

The boy was in her honors English class and the two carried on what prosecutors described in court documents as a 'sexual relationship' from June until recently. DePalo has been indefinitely suspended from her job teaching English at West Orange High School, according to school officials. Her attorney said she had been a teacher for nearly a decade and a career high point came when DePalo was named Essex County's teacher of the year in 2011. DePalo was accompanied to her Wednesday court appearance by family members. She did not speak during the hearing. Her attorney, Anthony Alfano, said . DePalo maintained her innocence and was ""extremely grateful for the . overwhelming amount of support"" she had been receiving from other . teachers and members of the West Orange community since her August 31 . arrest.

Assistant Essex County Prosecutor Gigi Scoles declined to comment on how the case had been brought to the attention of authorities, citing the ongoing investigation.

A Missouri man who provided key testimony in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing trial walked into a downtown Kansas City federal building setting off a bomb scare that closed several blocks after he asked if he's on a government terrorist watch list. Officers closed off several blocks of traffic near the Richard Bolling Federal Building following the incident on Friday said to have been a misunderstanding that sent a bomb-sniffing dog and robot to search the man's car, originally unbeknownst to him. The more than four-hour search turned up nothing threatening, according to the FBI, except for a bit of upset from the man, an Egyptian-born American citizen, who claimed to have been their target. Scroll down for video . Wrong man: Wahed Moharam said he was investigated by FBI officers over a possible terrorist threat after questioning federal officers on why he's listed as a potential terrorist . 'I love this country more than any place on the face of this earth, I would give my life for this country,' Wahed Moharam told KCTV on Friday night. ‘I never went to the building and said I have a bomb. If I said I had a bomb I wouldn’t be talking to you now,’ he defended over initial accusing reports. Mr Moharam had relocated to the suburb of Grain Valley after providing crucial testimony in the World Trade Center attack in 1993. It consequently helped lock away two major terrorists, one, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, who was called the most important man to call jihad against the U.S. by the late Osama bin Laden, according to The Kansas City Star. 'I should be honoured for what I did, not treated like this. It's very unfair,' he told the Associated Press. Law enforcement didn't identify the man themselves but Mr Moharam confirmed his car was the one searched during the incident. He said he wasn't in any trouble and was never detained. He said he was inquiring about being on the list after a recent traffic stop swarmed his car with officers, revealing his name as flagged. Reaction: Fearing a potential terrorist attack, a bomb squad closed down several blocks around the federal building, pictured left, while a robot inspected his car, right . 'The FBI treated me very well and they even took me home to make sure I am safe,' said Moharam. 'Whoever said, “I have a bomb and this,” is untrue. I never said, “I have a bomb” or anything whatsoever in that manner.' - Wahed Moharam on his possible listing on a terrorist watch list . FBI special agent Michael Kaste said . earlier on Friday that the large-scale response was based on the . 'initial limited information' police had from witnesses, adding: 'The . primary concern was for the public's safety, which made the actions . today necessary.' Mr Moharam said he had walked into the building and asked to speak to someone with Homeland Security to get more information following the traffic stop a day earlier. He said he'd been pulled over by a Jackson County sheriff's deputy, who told him his name had been flagged, and was later surrounded by five sheriff's vehicles but wasn't cited for anything. Mr Moharam said he was polite at the federal building, and that the individuals to whom he spoke were polite. Convicted: Mahmud Abouhalima, left, and blind cleric Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, right, were two men Mr Moharam's testimony helped convict in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing . He said an officer asked on Friday if . authorities could search his car, and he answered yes, gave them his . car’s key and offered to take them to the vehicle, but they declined. He . said he waited in the building with the officials, and that they bought . him a Starbucks coffee. Local news helicopters would later broadcast his parked vehicle being searched by a remote controlled robot and investigators in bomb squad gear. 'I had no clue what was going on outside. I gave them the key. I didn't mean to cause any problem,' said Moharam, who said he moved to the U.S. 35 years ago from Egypt. 'I have nothing to hide. I have no intention of doing any harm.' FBI officials are prohibited from discussing whether someone is on a national security watch list, but Kaste said the man walked into the building 'to clarify whether he was under investigation by a federal agency.' The source said no explosives were found on the man or in his car, but police did find a gun in the vehicle. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation. Businessman: Mr Moharam is seen centre left with some of his coworkers of his cleaning business whose cleaning products in his car first concerned federal agents during their search . Asked about the gun, Mr Moharam said it was a toy gun, 'like you buy for $10, like you see at Toys R Us.' He also said the search dogs may have . picked up the scent of his business’ cleaning supplies in his car, and . had told authorities the chemicals were there because he operates a . cleaning business in nearby Blue Springs. Neighbours of Mr Moharam defended him to KCTV saying he's a good man who uses his cleaning business to hire those recently out of a job. The searched car was parked near the Fletcher Daniels State Office building and the towering Bolling building, which houses numerous government agencies including the Social Security Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers. Donna Kerr, a benefits analyzer for SSA, said workers had 'absolutely no information from official sources, other than to stay away from the windows.' Workers were told to go home early. Mr Moharam insisted he wasn't trying to make trouble, saying he simply hopes to support his children and grandchildren. He wasn't told why his name had been flagged. 'I love this country. This is my country. Two-thirds of my life I've been here,' Mr Moharam said. Helmet Head: Mr Moharam is known by locals for his love of painting his face and head at Kansas City Chiefs football games though he had his tickets revoked while being in the witness protection programme . An expressed proud American, before Friday's incident Mr Moharam was already familiar to many Kansas City residents being the once-ardent fan dubbed 'Helmet Man' for the face paint and other gear he wore to Kansas City Chiefs football games. The Chiefs revoked his season tickets out of safety concerns in 2003 after the team learned he had been in the federal witness protection program for testifying while living in New Jersey for government prosecutors in the first World Trade Center bombing. At the time of his participation in the programme his name had been changed to another.

For 60-year-old Don Stranathan and Penny Blume, 50, who met in the most unlikely of places and on different ends of the country, battling lung cancer would be near impossible if they weren't doing it together. 'We weren't looking for a relationship, but we surprised each other,' Mr Stranathan, who’s currently battling non-small-cell adenocarcinoma, told ABC News. A divorced father of two, Mr Stranathan met Ms Blume, a mother of two herself, in 2011 through an online community called Inspire that connects those battling and looking to discuss health issues. Together: Seen hand-in-hand, Don Stranathan and Penny Blume are sharing not only a blooming romance from opposite parts of the country, but a fight for their lives against lung cancer . An at first unlikely match judging by location, with Mr Stranathan living in Santa Rosa, California and Ms Blume in Sullivan County, New York, the two became close over their shared interests and struggle. After some back and forth discussing nutritional benefits in juicing - on a website they both agree to be the furthest from a dating page - it didn't take long before they checked out one another's Facebook profiles, became intrigued, and then began messaging. 'We started chatting back and forth, different messages each day,' Mr Stranathan told ABC. 'At one time, I had over 5,000 text messages and they were mostly all with Penny.' After first messaging one another in October, by December, they decided to meet. 'Most people meet in a public place, but you go across the country,' Ms Blume recalled one of a friend teasing her of her on-set adventure out to California. Breaking distance: Since their diagnosis and meet in 2011, the couple say they want to spend the rest of their lives together, while traveling across the country together for their cancer treatments . Since then Ms Blume has made three trips to the West Coast while Mr Stranathanan has done the same east. 'We want to spend the rest of our lives together,' the couple not long later posted to their online friends in a note that was picked up by Inspire's communications director. While the couple's attachment to one another was easily amplified by their cancer treatments - with Mr Stranathan scheduling his appointments to match hers with doctors on the west  and Ms Blume doing the same on the east – they both mutually also shared the same hardship in their loved ones' reaction to their diagnosis of cancer. Diagnosed after seeing a doctor over what she thought was her asthma flaring up after six months, Ms Blume was entirely beside herself when an X-ray instead discovered small-cell cancer in her lungs while already at an 'extensive' stage. Her boyfriend at the time, she said, had a hard time handling it too. 'He walked out on me a week before we were talking about getting married,' Ms Blume told ABC. 'He said, ""I don't love you anymore.""' Time together: Seen in Woodstock, New York, the couple have made at least six visits to opposite sides of the country in the last year to be with one another . Mr Stranathan said he had the same reaction from his girlfriend at the time. 'She knew I had lung cancer and at some point, didn't want to deal with it,' he said, who was diagnosed after a spontaneous chest X-ray in 2009. Coming out of surgery on her adrenal gland and liver, not long after her breakup with her fiancé, Ms Blume said she never expected a single surprise waiting for her that could make her feel any less alone. 'When I came out of recovery and got into the room, flowers were awaiting me,' she said. 'They were from Don. 'It's hard to stay positive,' she said, 'But every day I have Don, I feel pretty positive.' 'We have been seeing each other long distance for a year and have never had a disagreement,' said Mr Stranathan. 'The fact is, we are going through this together and support each other. ... We laugh a lot.' Ms Blume's cancer has since tragically mutated though, leaving her with a large-cell lesion on her breast. She also has three lesions on her brain that have received 15 rounds of radiation. She said her steroid treatments weaken her muscles and her double-strength radiation on her chest once burned a hole into her esophagus, preventing her from eating for weeks. 'That was the worst,' she said. Diagnosis: Mr Stranathan, an avid hiker, was only diagnosed after a chest X-ray for a volunteer programme's requirements while Ms Blume was diagnosed after an X-ray over what she thought was her asthma acting up . Thirty-nine months after Mr Stranathan's diagnosis, including all of his own radiation, chemotherapy and oral medication, his cancer remains stable. 'I'm really fortunate,' he told ABC. While their struggle is potentially heart . breaking to hear for some, they say it's their love story, and one that . keeps their own hearts going. - Don Stranathan . 'It's critical to have things like that to keep you positive,' said Mr Stranathan. 'Any cancer survivor has to have short-term goals, so I look forward to being with Penny. We never know what will happen to either one of us.' It's also one they hope to use to save others, informing them about the importance of being screened for lung cancer. Ms Blume notes that people should be screened whether they smoke or not, herself having quit 15 years ago and Mr Stranathan 10. It wasn't until Mr Stranathan was tested for tuberculosis with a chest X-ray, in order to take part in a volunteer programme, that he said he first realized something was wrong. Currently on the west coast together, the couple plan to spend the next month traveling from Las Vegas to attend Ms Blume's son's wedding to a potential trip to Yosemite. These are all, of course, scheduled around their cancer treatments. In February they said they hope to make a trip to Hawaii as well. 'I admire her strength,' Mr Stranathan said of Ms Blume.

A 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death as he got off a bus has been named by police. Kevin Ssali was attacked as he stepped off the vehicle in Lee, South London, at about 9.45pm on Saturday. The teenager, from South Norwood, was taken to hospital but died from his wounds. A post-mortem examination is scheduled to take place at Greenwich mortuary on Monday afternoon. Kevin is believed to have been travelling on a route 202 bus through Lee Green towards Charlton. The attack happened about 500 yards from the spot where another teenager, 16-year-old Jimmy Mizen, was murdered in 2008. Jimmy's father Barry Mizen, who has campaigned against teen crime, appealed for witnesses to the killing to come forward. He said: 'This killing came as a great shock to myself and my wife Margaret and our hearts go out to the family of this young man. 'We actually do understand where they are going to be. 'We are always looking for answers but we would say let’s have a calm response to this. 'I would ask for witnesses to come forward because in Jimmy’s death the witnesses made the difference. 'The first instance is for witnesses to come forward and the judicial process to take its course, to identify the perpertrators and prosecute them. That has to happen.' Asked whether the problem of teen violence had changed since Jimmy's death, Mr Mizen replied: 'Has it changed? The actual figures reflect that there are less deaths. Shock: Mourners gather to leave flowers at the spot in Lee, South London, where Kevin Ssali was stabbed . 'But what hasn’t changed is the attitude which is still prevalent, where you get to a stage where it’s quite okay to actually kill somebody. 'It’s about changing people’s attitudes. We need to stand together and say ""this isn’t good enough, we don’t want to live in a society where people kill each other - we don’t want to live in communities which are blighted by violence"". 'This latest death make me even more determined. We have achieved great things and the actual figures have gone down, for whatever reason. 'But there are still some people who are prepared to go to these lengths to actually take a life, which is outrageous when you think about it. 'Things like this make myself and my wife more determined to work for peace in our communities.' Grief: Floral tributes are laid at the scene where Kevin Ssali was stabbed at about 9.45pm on Saturday . Detectives investigating Kevin's death have arrested three teenagers on suspicion of murder. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'As the victim alighted the bus in Burnt Ash Road, he was attacked and stabbed. 'Officers are trying to establish if there was some sort of altercation on board the bus which led to the incident.' Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dunne, from the Met's homicide and serious crime command, said: 'I am appealing for anyone who travelled on the route 202 bus on its way through the Lee area just before 9.45pm on Saturday night to speak to my officers. 'Did you witness an altercation or argument involving a group of male youths? 'I would also like to speak to anyone who was in Burnt Ash Road, where the victim got off the bus.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 08:21 EST, 14 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:21 EST, 14 September 2012 . Japan has called for the phasing out of nuclear power in the country over the next 30 years following the devastation of the Fukushima meltdown. A Japanese Cabinet panel today called for the phasing out of nuclear power, as it overhauls its energy policy in the wake of last year's disaster. Adopting the proposals would be a break with Japan's decades-long advocacy of nuclear power. Disaster: Smoke billows from the No.3 reactor at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant last year, in scenes of devastation which have caused Japan to overhaul its energy policy . The new energy policy faces opposition from powerful business interests but phasing out nuclear power is popular with the public. It calls for greater reliance on renewable energy, more conservation and sustainable use of fossil fuels and would see Japan joining Germany in turning its back on nuclear energy. The new policy requires endorsement by the entire Cabinet. Japanese news reports say the Cabinet has already agreed to the changes. Japan began reviewing its energy policy following last year's disaster at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, which was set off by a massive earthquake and tsunami. Before the accident, the resource-poor country relied on nuclear power for one-third of its energy and had planned to raise that to 50 percent by 2030. Wrecked: The tsunami-stricken Fukushima plant in Okuma town in April last year . 'Based on facing the reality of this grave accident and by learning lessons from the accident, the government has decided to review the national energy strategy from scratch,' said the policy document. 'One of the key pillars of the new strategy is to achieve a society that does not depend on nuclear energy as soon as possible,' it said. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda allowed two reactors to restart in July to avoid power shortages during the hot summer months. Growing anti-nuclear sentiment and mass protests made it difficult for the government and plant operators to restart reactors idled for inspections, and by early May all 50 Japanese reactors had gone offline. Imports of oil and gas for electricity generation have surged as a result and Japan's trade balance has swung into deficit. Officials acknowledge many questions remain unanswered, among them how to pay for the costly expansion of renewable energy and how to minimize the environmental impact of a return to heavier use of natural gas and other fossil fuels. The phase-out of nuclear power by the 2030s is to be achieved mainly by retiring aging reactors and not replacing them. The proposed new policy calls for adhering to a 40-year life span for each reactor and for building no more new reactors. It leaves open the possibility of restarting reactors before they are eventually phased out, but only if they have passed strict safety tests and won approval by a newly formed regulatory commission. 'We will launch all possible policy measures to achieve a nuclear-free society by the 2030s,' it said. 'Until the total phase-out we will only use nuclear reactors that are confirmed safe.' The new policy delays a decision on spent fuel processing and radioactive waste disposal, leaving open the questions of how Japan will handle its spent nuclear fuel and avoid accumulating stockpiles of plutonium. 'The road to a nuclear-free society is not easy,' it says, forecasting economic growth at a modest rate of 0.8 percent annually under a nuclear-free scenario. Before the Fukushima disaster, Japan relied on nuclear power for one-third of its energy . Following Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster, Germany decided to speed up phasing out its nuclear power plants, shutting them down within a decade and betting on renewable energies instead. Nuclear power had accounted for a little more than 20 percent of Germany's needs but has since fallen well below that level. Energy experts note that relying more on renewable energy is easier for European countries that can draw on surplus power from neighboring countries when volatile wind and solar power fall short. As an island nation Japan lacks that option. Still, the new policy calls for Japan to increase use of renewable energy by eight-fold over the 2010 level by 2030. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda allowed two reactors to restart in July to avoid power shortages during the hot summer months. At the time, Noda stressed that the restarts were crucial for Japan's economy and energy needs.","Japanese cabinet has agreed to changes as it overhauls energy policy .

Demands: Higher education minister David Willetts (pictured) said he wanted more students coming to the UK . A Tory minister is demanding the Government abandons its effort to bring immigration under control by slashing student visas, a leaked letter revealed last night. Higher education minister David Willetts told Nick Clegg he wanted more students coming to the UK, not fewer, despite admitting that the number who stay here illegally after their courses end is not known. He is siding with the Lib Dems to insist the 250,000 students who come to Britain each year should be removed from the net migration figure – the difference between the number of people who arrive in Britain and those leaving. The move would render the Tory election pledge to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ meaningless. It would also fly in the face of public opinion, with seven in ten voters wanting to see a limit on student visas, according to a poll released today. The Tories and Lib Dems have been fighting over whether to maintain the system of including students in net migration figures. Home Office minister Damian Green recently told MPs: ‘To say that someone who comes here for three years as a student is not here and doesn’t count is absurd.’ Request: In a letter to Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg (pictured), Mr Willetts makes it clear that he wants 'no limit' on legitimate students coming here to study . Given the huge number of students arriving each year, campaigners believe it would be impossible to meet the ‘tens of thousands’ target without slashing student visas. But in a letter to Deputy Prime Minister Mr Clegg, Mr Willetts makes it clear that he wants ‘no limit’ on legitimate students coming here to study. Universities want to double the number of foreign students, who pay larger tuition fees than Britons, to fund their expansion plans. However, estimates by the Home Office suggest one in five do not go home at the end of their course. Mr Willetts’s four-page letter, seen by the Mail, demands a ‘clear commitment that the Government will not seek to reduce legitimate student numbers in order to meet the net migration target and will explore ways of presenting net migration figures to make this apparent’. Mr Willetts – dubbed ‘Two Brains’ for his reputation as an intellectual – acknowledges ‘the difficulties of accurately removing students from the net migration statistics, particularly as we still lack robust data on the outflows of students from the country’. Public opinion: Seven in ten voters want to see a limit on student visas, according to a YouGov poll released today (file picture) But he adds: ‘However, I do not believe we can justify keeping students in the net migration target on this point alone, given the widespread concern that this could result in a reduction in the number of legitimate students. We should be seeking to increase the numbers of legitimate students coming to study.’ 'We should be seeking to increase the numbers of legitimate students coming to study' David Willetts, Higher education minister . He wants ministers to make a public commitment that they have ‘no intention’ of ever placing ‘a cap or limit’ on international student numbers. The news came as a YouGov poll found 70 per cent of voters want foreign students to be capped. The survey, commissioned by the Migration Watch think-tank, also found strong support for action against bogus students, with seven in ten saying those without sufficient English for their courses should be deported. Migration Watch chairman Sir Andrew Green said: ‘This gives the lie to those who have been claiming the public are not concerned about student inflows.’","David Willetts wants more students coming to the UK .

Allergic: Emma, a talented artist who attended Xaverian College, in Rusholme, Manchester had been warned that a single nut could kill her . A teenage girl died after having a massive allergic reaction to the nuts in a takeaway curry, an inquest heard. Emma Egerton took only one mouthful of the chicken tikka korma before the reaction set in. The student, 18, who was alone at the time, had the presence of mind to dial 999 and leave her front door open for the ambulance crews to get in. But, by the time they arrived she was unconscious and she died in hospital that night. The inquest heard there was no warning on the menu that the dish she chose may contain nuts. Yet the korma from the Spice of India restaurant had been cooked in nut oil and contained ground almonds. South Manchester deputy coroner Joanne Kearsley said she was concerned there was no legal requirement – as there is in restaurants – for takeaways to have clear nut warnings. She said: ‘We hear an awful lot about food standards and labels – and despite the fact these signs are required in restaurants, they aren’t in takeaways. 'I intend to write to the Food Standards Agency to highlight the issues in this case.’ Emma, whose father John is a chief inspector with Manchester Police, had been warned that a single nut could kill her when she was diagnosed with the hypersensitivity at the age of five. She was said to be very careful about what she ate and would ask restaurants to cook her meals in separate pans. Closed: Emma was at home on her own, logged onto the Just Eat website and ordered the dish from the Spice of India takeway in Sale . Tragedy struck in November 2010 when she was at home on her own and logged on to the Just Eat website and ordered the dish from the takeaway. Police officers later printed a copy of the website menu which showed there were no nut warnings for the korma. Mohammed Abdul Hannan, owner of Spice of India in Sale, Manchester, said he had repeatedly called the website to ask for nut signs to be put against certain dishes. Just Eat boss David Butress, said putting warning signs next to dishes was ‘not obligatory’ but the website had reviewed its policy. A verdict of accidental death was recorded.

Over the course of about two decades, the Boys Scouts of America (BSA) has failed to report hundreds of cases of child sex abuse involving counselors and officials, according to the organization’s confidential internal files. An explosive expose by the Los Angels Times based on 1,600 documents dating from 1971 to 1991 has revealed that Boy Scout officials would often urge admitted molesters to quietly resign and then hide the allegations from the victims' parents. Volunteers and employees linked to possible abuse were allowed to leave the organization citing such far-fetched excuses as 'chronic brain dysfunction' and duties at the Shakespeare festival. Explosive allegations: Boy Scouts of America's internal files indicate that the organization failed to report - and in some cases actively covered up - hundreds of cases of child abuse . Facts about the alleged molestation cases were documented in the Boy Scouts' ‘perversion files' which the group has used since 1919 to blacklist suspected pedophiles and keep them away from the organization. The Boy Scouts of America, founded 1910, is the nation’s largest youth group with 111,668 units, 2,723,869 young scouts and more than a million adult members. In more than 500 cases, BSA officials learned about suspected child abuse from children, parents, staffers or anonymous tips, but in 80 per cent of the instances, the allegations were never reported to police. In 100 of the cases, officials within the national organization actively covered up the abuse and facilitated the suspected child molesters conceal the truth from the public, according to The Times. In a statement, BSA spokesperson Deron Smith said, 'We have always cooperated fully with any request from law enforcement and today require our members to report even suspicion of abuse directly to their local authorities.' Culture of secrecy: In many of the cases, admitted molesters were allowed to resign citing bogus excuses . Secret files: More than 1,600 instances of alleged child abuse were laid out in BSA's internal documents known since 1919 as the 'perversion files' The organization put that requirement in place only 2010. Prior to that, the official modus operandi was to obey state laws, which did not always require youth groups to report abuse. In many cases, officials said they were keeping allegations under wraps so as to protect the young victims. As a result, some of the suspected pedophiles went undetected for years and continued molesting children, according to documents and court records. One case in point involved assistant troop leader William Lazzareschi, who was caught in 1971 engaging in oral sex with a 12-year-old behind a tent at a Rhode Island Boy Scout camp. 'Mr. Lazzareschi made me do it to him,' the young Scout told officials, according to the file. Face of evil: Assistant troop leader William Lazzareschi was caught in 1971 engaging in oral sex with a 12-year-old at a Rhode Island Boy Scout camp, but he was not reported to police . Lazzareschi 'admitted his role in the . act' and said he'd never done it before. He was ousted from the youth . organization and told to stay away from the boy, but nothing indicates . that the incident was reported to the police. The records show that the teenage victim was counseled 'with positive results' by the Rev. Edmond C. Micarelli, the camp's Catholic chaplain, who later ended up in the 'perversion files' himself after a man told officials that he and his bother were raped by the cleric as young boys. In 2002, the Diocese of Providence paid $13.5million to 36 victims who sued Micarelli and 10 other priests over sexual abuse going back to at least 1975. Meanwhile, Lazzareschi was convicted of sexual assault in 1997 and possession of child pornography in 2005. In another case from the 1970s, a Pennsylvania scoutmaster who was accused of two rapes and other sex crimes abruptly stepped down, writing in his resignation letter that he had to travel more for work. ‘Good luck to you in your new position,’ a top troop representative wrote back. He said he was accepting the resignation ‘with extreme regret.' Those accused of abuse got a form letter from the Boy Scouts that read in part, ‘We are making no accusations and will not release this information to anyone, so our action in no way will affect your standing in the community.’ BSA attorneys have long been fighting in court to keep the ‘perversion files’ secret, citing the importance of protecting the victims’ privacy. However, over the years, hundreds of internal files have been admitted into evidence in lawsuits brought by alleged victims, and hundreds more are  expected to see the light of day in the near future. Widespread: The Boy Scouts of America is the nation's largest youth organization with over 111,000 units and nearly 2,724,000 young members . In June, the Oregon Supreme Court ordered the release of 1,247 of the Scouts' confidential files covering two decades beginning in 1965. The files played a key role in a 2010 court case that resulted in a nearly $20million judgment against the Scouts. Although the youth group has made strides to curtail sex abuse, instituting mandatory background checks for all volunteers in 2008 and perfecting child abuse prevention training, BSA may yet face a slew of costly lawsuits for failing to report past crimes, or even in many cases notify the victims’ parents about the allegations.","1,600 confidential files cover time period from 1971 to 1991 .

An 'outstanding' associate head teacher crouched in front of a train and waited to die because she 'lost confidence' in her ability to do her job, an inquest heard. Judith Bleach, 44, killed herself hours before she was due to attend an interview to complete her headship training. Married mother-of-two Mrs Bleach was supposed to board a train from her home city of Bristol to Birmingham. But she drove 22 miles in the . opposite direction to Alderton, Wiltshire, parked her Fiat Punto and . climbed over a fence near a train tunnel. She . then walked up an embankment on to the train tracks, where she was hit . by a First Great Western train travelling from Bristol to London at . 101mph. An inquest . in Salisbury heard how Mrs Bleach was identified by fingerprints taken . from a wardrobe door at her home in West Croft, Bristol. Executive . head teacher Mark Dee, of Parkwall Primary School in Cadbury Heath, . Bristol - where Mrs Bleach worked - said she was an 'outstanding' teacher. Many of her pupils were left in tears after hearing about the death and hoards of floral tributes piled up outside the school. Parkwall Primary School had made significant progress in the few years since Mrs Bleach joined - and achieved a ‘good’ rating from Ofsted shortly before her death. Mr Dee said: 'I had known her for about eight years and she was excellent at her job. She would have made an outstanding head in her own right. 'She worked hard and was popular with staff, pupils and their parents. I saw her on the Monday (the day before her death) and she was a bit nervous about the interview. 'But she would have passed it with flying colours. It was just a formality. There was nothing fundamental (to cause me alarm).' Mrs Bleach left two suicide notes in her car, which she left locked with one window open. One of the notes was for Mr Dee and the other for her husband Matthew. Mr Dee added: 'From the tone of the letter it appears that her confidence had gone. 'I do think there were also some personal issues in the background, which contributed to this.' A map of the spot where Mrs Bleach died on May 22 was also found open in her car. Her husband Mr Bleach, 45, a bookkeeper, told the inquest he had no concerns about his wife when she left for her interview. She had been due to board a train from Bristol Parkway at 9.10am, with her interview - the final part of headship training she started last September - set for 11am. Executive . head teacher Mark Dee, of Parkwall Primary School in Cadbury Heath, . Bristol (pictured) - where Mrs Bleach worked - said she was an 'outstanding' teacher . Mr Bleach said: 'She left the house at about 8.20am. She was smartly-dressed and had the papers she needed for the interview with her.' In a statement, train driver Brian Nugent told how he spotted Mrs Bleach near to the train tracks and sounded his horn. He said: 'I saw a woman walk from left to right. She would have been about seven or eight seconds away. I sounded the horn. She then crouched in a foetal position.' Mr Nugent applied the brakes of the train, the delayed 11.32 from Bristol Parkway to London, but it was impossible to avoid hitting the talented teacher. A post mortem examination found that Mrs Bleach suffered multiple head and body injuries after being struck by the train. Police confirmed that there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding her death. Ian Singleton, assistant deputy coroner for Wiltshire, said Mrs Bleach had intended to take her own life. He said: 'She voluntarily positioned herself on the railway line in a crouching position.

Missiles fired by Syrian warplanes hit Lebanese territory Monday in one of the most serious cross-border violations since Syria's crisis began 18 months ago. Four missiles fired by two Syrian jets hit a rugged and remote area on the edge of the Lebanese border town of Arsal. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that the warplanes fired three missiles that fell on the outskirts of Arsal about 500 metres from the border between the two countries. Rebels: Officials believe that Syrian government forces may have been chasing rebel fighters- like this one seen in Aleppo on Sunday- who were headed into Lebanon . 'I heard several explosions and saw four clouds of dust billowing from the area,' Arsal resident Nayeh Izzedine said by telephone referring to the border. 'I don't know if it was an air raid but there was a plane in the sky.' He added that the town had been quiet two hours after the 10am attack. The Syrian forces were believed to be chasing rebels in the area, which has been the site of clashes in the past between opposition fighters battling Syrian troops just on the other side of the frontier. Lebanese armed forces have previously detained people in the region caught trying to smuggle weapons into Syria from Lebanon. Arsal is a predominantly Sunni Muslim town, like the majority of Syria's opposition that is trying to oust President Bashar Assad from power. Assad belongs to the minority Alawite sect, an off-shoot of Shiite Islam. Syrian shells have hit Lebanese territory in the past but the air raid appears to be the most serious violation. Several Lebanese, including a journalist, have been killed and dozens wounded by fire coming from the Syrian side. Protests continues: Demonstrators protested near Damascus on Sunday evening, just hours before Syrian war planes launched missiles into Lebanon . Also Monday, inside Syria, troops shelled rebel-held areas around the country including the northern city of Aleppo, Syria's largest, and the Damascus neighborhood of Hajar Aswad, activists said. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and the Local Coordination Committees also reported clashes between troops and rebels. In Geneva, an independent U.N. panel . confirmed that an increasing number of 'foreign elements,' including . jihadis, are now operating in Syria, in its first report to say that . outsiders have joined a war spiraling out of control. The . investigative panel appointed by the Human Rights Council says some of . these forces are joining armed anti-government groups while others are . operating on their own. 'Such . elements tend to push anti-government fighters toward more radical . positions,' the head of the panel, Brazilian diplomat and professor . Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, told diplomats. The Syrian uprising, which began with . largely peaceful protests, has since morphed into a deadly armed . insurgency. Hundreds of people are killed every week as the government . increasingly relies on air power to try and crush the rebels. Activists say more than 23,000 have been killed in the conflict. Destruction: The latest round of missile attacks are the most blatant examples of border crossing since the fighting began nearly 18 months ago . The government denies that there is any popular will behind the revolt, saying it is driven by foreigners and terrorists. The regime can use the U.N. panel's report to bolster its claims. Rebels deny that foreigners had any role starting the revolt, saying Syrians were seeking increased freedom from the regime. But as the conflict drags on, some rebels have acknowledged the presence of small numbers of foreigners among their ranks. The U.N. panel also accused government forces and pro-regime militiamen known as 'shabiha' of war crimes and crimes against humanity including murder, summary executions, torture, arbitrary arrests, sexual violence and abuse of children. It also accused anti-government armed groups of war crimes including murder, extrajudicial execution and torture. In a report Monday, Human Rights Watch said it documented more than a dozen extrajudicial and summary executions by opposition forces. It said three opposition leaders who were confronted with evidence of extrajudicial executions said those who killed deserved to be killed, and that only the 'worst criminals were being executed.' The New York-based group said torture and extrajudicial or summary executions of detainees in the context of an armed conflict are war crimes, and may constitute crimes against humanity if they are widespread and systematic.","Officials suspect Syrians were chasing rebels fleeing over Lebanese border .

Hail to the hosts: President Obama became the first sitting president to visit a daytime talk show in 2010, and appeared again earlier this year . Mr Romney said in private remarks to donors made public this week by Mother Jones that going on The View is ‘high risk’ because of the ‘four sharp-tongued and not conservative’ female hosts, only one of whom is a conservative. He singled out Whoopi Goldberg, saying: ‘The last time I was on the show, she said to me, “You know what? I think I could vote for you.” I said I must have done something really wrong.’ After seeing the video footage, co-host Sherri Shepard retorted: ‘If you can’t handle four sharp-tongued women, how are you going to handle the country?’ Mr Romney appeared on the daytime talk show in 2010 to talk about his book, No Apology: The Case For American Greatness.

Soaring numbers of British students are to head overseas to study as a crippling hike in tuition fees makes US universities seem an attractive prospect. Despite American universities once being viewed as jaw-droppingly expensive, a near tripling of the cost of a degree in Britain means fee differences are now negligible. To capitalise on opposition to rising tuition fees on this side of the Atlantic, top US universities are pushing a recruitment drive in Britain. Heading overseas: British students see studying in the US a cheaper alternative . Rising numbers of institutions - including many belonging to the elite Ivy League - are marketing themselves to bright school-leavers. Experts predict a year-on-year hike of the number of undergraduates and postgraduates studying in the US, from 9,000 last year to more this autumn and even more in 2013. The number of students taking the main . US higher education entrance exam in the UK has already soared by a . third in the past few years. The news comes as British universities prepare to charge up to £9,000 in annual tuition fees for the first time this term. Figures published earlier this month showed the change has had a damaging impact on enrolment rates, with the number of students accepting places onto British universities plummeting by almost 57,000 - 12 per cent - so far this year. J Robert Spatig, assistant . vice-president for admissions at South Florida University in Tampa, told the Daily Telegraph newspaper this was a 'carpe diem moment for recruitment of UK students'. He said: 'We believe that the floodgates are . going to open once British students learn that tuition at many top . research universities in the US may now be less than at a comparable . Russell Group university in the UK.' The cost of university in the US ranges from between £9,800 to £19,000 a year for an undergraduate degree. But some institutions provide more generous scholarships and grants than those available in Britain. A record 165 institutions, including . Harvard, Yale, Princeton and New York University, will exhibit at the USA College Day . fair on Friday and Saturday. The US-UK Fulbright Commission, which . stages the event at Kensington Town Hall, said exhibitors had soared by . 80 per cent in the last three years, with 3,500 students registering to . attend the 2012 event so far. Harvard University is one of the 165 institutions to exhibit at a big USA recruitment fair in London . Lauren Welch, director of marketing at . the Fulbright Commission, told the Daily Telegraph: 'American universities are chomping at . the bit to reach British students. We are seeing universities of all . shapes and sizes come over the pond this autumn, including many . newcomers.' And another major recruitment fair will begin in Manchester on Saturday before moving on to Leicester, Solihull, Bristol and London. The Student World .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 23:17 EST, 20 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 08:11 EST, 21 September 2012 . Paul Burstow, who was sacked in the Cabinet reshuffle, has hit out at Chancellor George Osborne . George Osborne was today accused of trying to consign reform elderly care to the ‘trash bin’. Liberal Democrat Paul Burstow, who was social care minister until this month’s reshuffle, accused the Chancellor and the Treasury of ‘bureaucratic inertia’ in holding back reform of the social care system. Mr Burstow told MailOnline that an overhaul of the way care is funded, based on proposals drawn up by economist Andrew Dilnot has been finalised, but the Treasury will not sign off on the £1.7bn cost.‘In the end there is a question of political will to overcome that bureaucratic inertia,’ he said. ‘The thing that has kept Dilnot alive has been the Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying this has got to stay on the table while there was a desire by the Treasury to get it in the trash bin as quickly as possible. ‘It is an institutional thing. There is a real inertia around reforms of this sort that has bedevilled reform of social care for two decades. ‘I have no doubt it was a key factor why Labour failed to deal with it when there was money around. ‘It has been a key drag on trying to make progress over the last two years of the coalition.’ Last month it was reported that David Cameron had pledged to find the money, which would cap the amount individuals pay at £35,000 – with the taxpayer picking up the rest. But Mr Burstow said there was little sense of urgency: ‘There was certainly no sign of the Treasury beating a path to the door of the Department of Health.’ However, government insiders sought to play down Mr Burstow’s insight into the progress of the plan. ‘If this former minister really believes what he has said he was clearly out of the loop,’ said one source. It is utter nonsense.’ Mr Burstow also claimed that the controversial reforms of the NHS, drawn up by Andrew Lansley who was demoted in the reshuffle, had made senior minister reluctant to tackle social care. ‘There is no doubt that the controversy around the health reforms made some of the actors in this worry about future reform. ‘But many of those players, including the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and others, probably hadn’t tuned into enough at the time to see the fact that this was a popular set of changes not a controversial set of changes.’ Chancellor George Osborne was accused of having 'no sense of urgency' about helping the elderly fund their long-term care . Mr Burstow said he had received scores of ‘heart-rending’ letters form families in despair at the care system’ ‘I still think there is a good chance . this can happen but the only way to help it happen at this point is . bringing into sharp relief the Treasury’s role.’ Mr Dilnot suggested a cap of £35,000 . for care bills. The state would pay costs over this amount while people . could also take out insurance to pay fees up to £35,000. Ministers said they supported the idea in principle but have not committed the £1.7billion needed to fund the reform. The Government is considering a . watered down version, which could impose a voluntary cap which would . only protect those who paid a fee to ‘opt in’. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr . Burstow added: ‘The Treasury’s view is simple, kick the can down the . road ... There’s no sense of urgency.’ But a Treasury spokesman said: ‘The . Treasury has been key in getting this issue back on the agenda, not . least by working to deliver stable public finances that are essential if . Dilnot is to be delivered.’ Campaigners responded to Mr Burstow's remarks with a call for government action. Michelle Mitchell, charity director general of Age UK said: 'Putting a cap on lifetime care costs would grant older people and their families the invaluable gift of peace of mind. 'Coming toward the end of life and having to ask for help in carrying out everyday tasks is often devastating in itself but in addition to risk losing nearly everything you have ever worked for in care fees is heart-breaking. 'Those living in a care home have to live with the fear of what will happen to them when their savings run out and whether they will be forced to leave. 'This is why the Government must show the vision and courage to bring in the Dilnot reforms as the report recommended and so create a just and compassionate legacy for generations to come.' Labour today repeated its offer of cross-party talks to find a long-term solution to the funding of elderly care. Liz Kendall, shadow care minister said: 'Labour has been warning for months that the Government is kicking long-term care funding into the long grass. 'This issue has bedevilled Governments of all political persuasions for many years, because there are no simple solutions or easy options. 'All the parties must now come together to try and reach consensus about . how we tackle the immediate care crisis and develop a better, fairer . system for the future.'","Sacked Lib Dem Paul Burstow says Chancellor lacks urgency in finding £1.7bn needed to fund social care .

Theme park managers are taking the drastic measure of breath testing students, after too many have vomited on rollercoasters while drunk or hungover during the first week of university. But far from turning them away, Thorpe Park staff are instead happily directing those who are over the limit to the most extreme rollercoaster - which hurtles them through the air head-first at up to 60mph. It might sound like a harsh lesson, but research supported by the park has found the blast of fresh air on The Swarm is exactly what queasy guests need to settle their stomachs and avoid being sick. Staff members will now be breathalysing students and directing those over the limit to adrenaline-boosting rides to cure their hangovers . Staff have seen a massive 250 per cent increase in the number of people being sick on rides this week, as new students arrive at university for the first time and get stuck in to the infamous alcohol-fueled freshers week. The Surrey park, which is close to a number of universities,will breathalyse students to avoid an increase in ‘sick shutdowns’, on some of its most vomit-inducing rides and attractions. Those who have more than 35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath will then  be fast-tracked onto the park’s proven hangover-busting rides, and turned away from others until they are feeling perkier. The move will hopefully appease families, who will no longer be forced to wait while  rides are closed during clean-up operations. The Swarm sends riders shooting through the air head-first down a drop of 39m - but has been found to be the perfect solution to settling queasy stomachs . The research, carried out by neuropsychologist Dr David Lewis, foundthe  blast of oxygen on the high-speed Swarm improves drunk riders' metabolic rate, which boosts speeds at which toxins are broken down. Mike Vallis, divisional director of Thorpe Park, said: ‘Thorpe Park does not condone drinking and riding, however, during this Fresher’s Week period, we realise that a number of our guests do not recognise that they are suffering from the effects of the night before. ‘We felt it was our duty to ensure that all of our guests enjoy the extreme nature of our rides and by putting them on The Swarm, which is proven to be the ultimate hangover cure. ‘We are confident our guests will have a great, and hopefully vomit-free, day.’ Thorpe Park hopes the move will end years of 'sick shutdowns', which force guests to wait while rides are cleaned of vomit .",Park has seen 250 per cent increase in people being sick during the infamous student 'freshers week'

Youcef Adjerid, 18, a friend of Toby’s who was the driver of the Fiat Punto, was not to blame for the accident as he was unaware the 17-year-old had lain down in front of him, the inquest heard. Toby, a rugby player who had been at the party dressed as a Christmas present, had a blood alcohol level of 159mg per 100ml of blood - double the legal drink drive limit of 80mg/100ml. Several of Toby’s friends told the Trowbridge inquest that they had met up at Hal Bailey’s home before walking the short distance to the party, hosted by local villager James Melvin. Youcef, who had only passed his driving test two weeks earlier, had been working that night and arrived late at the party - just 15 minutes before it ended at midnight. He was giving Scott Laing and another teenager a lift back to Chippenham. Toby and Hal, with friends Sam Riley and Joe Bodman, both 18, decided to walk the three-minute journey back to Hal’s house, where they were all staying. As they walked along the lane, Youcef drove up behind them and stopped. Sam and Toby decided to climb on to the bonnet of Youcef’s car and take it in turns to ‘car surf’ as he drove at walking pace. Joe told the hearing: ‘Sam and Toby were both on the bonnet of Youcef’s car and Youcef drove and Sam fell off and Toby got off. Youcef drove off and so we carried on walking along the road.’ A minute later, Toby and his friends . caught up with the Fiat again as Scott had left his wallet at Hal’s . house and wanted to collect it. Incident scene: Kington Lane in Stanton St Quintin, near Chippenham, Wiltshire, where Toby Hearne died . The teenagers were talking to the occupants of the car when Toby lay down in the front of the car. Ian Singleton, assistant deputy . coroner for Wiltshire and Swindon, recorded a verdict of accidental . death, saying Toby’s judgment had been impaired by the amount of alcohol . he had consumed. ‘We heard . from the pathologist that the toxicology revealed a level of alcohol . that was nearly twice the drink drive limit,’ Mr Singleton said. ‘We heard from a number of witnesses that Toby was in high spirits and was as drunk if not more as in previous occasions. ‘He . was walking unaided and committed various acts, such as falling over . deliberately and riding on the bonnet of a car without causing himself . any apparent injury. ‘I . heard evidence from one of the group outside the car, who had a clear . view, that without warning or comment Toby lay down in front of the car . while the driver was talking to other members of the group. ‘Before . the witness had a chance to say or do anything the driver moved off . with the front wheels of the Fiat passing over Toby. Due to the shouting . of those from outside the car the vehicle quickly came to a halt. ‘There is no evidence to suggest that the driver was aware of Toby’s presence or deliberately drove over him. ‘I . note the conclusion reached in the collision investigation report that . this was a tragic incident that occurred as a result of Toby placing . himself on the ground in front of the car in such a position that the . driver could not see him. ‘On . the balance of probabilities I find that Toby’s actions and assessment . of risks that he was placing himself at were affected by the level of . alcohol he had consumed impairing his critical judgment capability. ‘The . appropriate verdict would be of accidental death, which is not in any . way to trivialise Toby’s death, but reflects the fact it came about as . an unintended consequence of a deliberate act on his part.’ Hal, 18, said: ‘As I walked up towards my house and turned back, I saw him lying in front of the bonnet. I saw clearly what happened. I saw him lay down but no-one in the car had seen that he had gone to the floor. I thought he was joking about. ‘Youcef was talking to Sam at the driver’s window and I don’t think he had seen Toby lying on the floor as otherwise he wouldn’t have driven off.’ The teenager told the hearing he did not have a chance to shout and alert Youcef to the danger. He said: ‘It happened so quickly. He went down and it was probably a second or two seconds before the car moved off. I think Toby may have been laughing as a joke but I don’t think he said anything.’ Sam told the inquest: ‘I think I said to Youcef “I think you’ve run Toby over” but I knew he had hit him and that’s when Youcef got out of the car. He was really shocked and didn’t believe it. ‘I bent down and touched his leg and tried talking to Toby but obviously there was no response.’ Youcef, who had not been drinking, told the inquest that he did not know Toby had lain down in front of his car and described the moments before the accident. ‘Hal walked past the car first and then Joe came towards the front of the car and started messing with the front windscreen wipers and then both came to the driver’s window,’ he said. ‘Sam walked behind the car and started doing something to the car but I can’t remember what. Joe walked off behind the car and that’s when I moved away. ‘It seemed as if we went over a bump in the road. That’s when I tried to reverse and Scott said not to reverse. ‘We heard shouts from outside the car and they came to the driver’s side of the car and told us what happened and told us to get out of the car.’ Road accident investigator Pc Alan Kyne, from Wiltshire Police, read to the inquest extracts from the report he had prepared. He said there were no mechanical faults with the Fiat and speed was not a factor in the accident. ‘Sam Riley mounted the bonnet of the Fiat, which Youcef drove forward a short distance at low speed, at which Sam fell off the car but was uninjured,’ he said. ‘Toby also mounted the bonnet and travelled a short distance before climbing off the car. Having turned his vehicle around in the junction, Youcef stopped in the junction having seen his friends approaching on foot. Car involved: Youcef Adjerid, 18, a friend of Toby's who was the driver of the Fiat Punto (file picture) was not to blame for the accident just as he was unaware the 17-year-old had lain down in front of him, the inquest heard . ‘The group of young men reached the vehicle and there was a level of interaction around the vehicle, which could be considered as a distraction to the driver. ‘Toby then lay down in front of the Fiat in a position he could not be seen by Youcef. Unaware of Toby’s actions Youcef drove forward over Toby and immediately stopped, reversing slightly before coming to rest with Toby beneath the vehicle. 'I saw him lay down but no-one in the car had seen that he had gone to the floor. I thought he was joking about. Youcef was talking to Sam at the driver’s window and I don’t think he had seen Toby lying on the floor as otherwise he wouldn’t have driven off' Hal Bailey, 18, friend of Toby Hearne . ‘Toby suffered a significant injury to his chest, aggravated by his position beneath the vehicle. Sadly Toby died at the scene.’ A post mortem examination found that Toby had died from compression of the chest. Toby’s parents did not comment as they left the court. In a statement released by police at the time of the teenager’s death, they said: ‘Toby was a great sportsman and a gifted child in all areas of his life. He enjoyed life and was full of fun. ‘He had a really wide circle of friends and was a generous, kind, sensitive, affectionate and gentle young man. ‘He had an inexplicable magnetism which attracted everyone to him. Toby has left a void in all our lives and in many more who knew him. ‘To sum Toby up in his own words on a tweet “... (I) Take everything as it comes. Sometimes things go my way and sometimes they don’t. Love music, love sport, love life”.’ Toby was a talented rugby player and played for Chippenham RFC in the under-18s side.","Toby Hearne, 17, died in Stanton St Quintin, near Chippenham, Wiltshire .

"By . Meghan Keneally . PUBLISHED: . 17:51 EST, 15 March 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 21:39 EST, 15 March 2012 . A spread in Playboy is a well-tested move for rebellious political spawn. And while former Republican presidential candidate John McCain’s daughter Meghan chose to keep her clothes during her interview with the lad mag this month, she was certainly open to talking about her sexual preferences. ‘I’m not a lesbian, if that’s what you’re asking. I’d be the first person to tell the world I was gay. I’m not private about anything. I think you should live how you should live. But I’m strictly dickly. I can’t help it. I love sex and I love men,’ she told Playboy. Provocative: Meghan McCain chose to stay covered up during her Playboy interview but she does show some cleavage . The outspoken 27-year-old political commentator discussed a wide range of issues, from her love of whiskey and shotguns to her distaste for Bristol Palin, who bashed Meghan in her book after the two spent time together during their parents’ ill-fated presidential campaign. But, given the nature of the men’s magazine, she talked at length about her ‘party girl’ image. ‘What am I supposed to do, stay in and read a book? I come from a family of whiskey drinkers. My brothers like to drink and have a good time. It’s America, man. There’s nothing wrong with going out and listening to music and having a little Jack and Coke,’ she said. Though her mother’s family has been the long-time owners of a beer distributor, she claims to have had a very low-key social life prior to hitting college. She only started dating once she moved to New York to attend Columbia University. Wrong message? In 2009, Meghan Tweeted this picture of herself holding a book and received a massive outpouring of angry messages afterwards because many found it oversexualized and inappropriate . She said that two of the problems she faces while in the dating world is that prospective suitors either want to talk endlessly about political policy- which is a turn off for her- or feel that they know all there is to know about her and her family from a simple Google search. As a result, she is currently single- which she is very happy about. The only picture that accompanied the Playboy interview is one of her wearing a glittery red dress, lying on a bed. Her much-talked-about cleavage does show, however, and this is not the first time. Meghan’s breasts have been the subject of public discussion for years, with one self-inflicted incident standing out in particular. On the trail: In the Playboy interview, Meghan said that she went up four dress sizes during the 2008 campaign, seen here with her father and mother, because of a diet of Starbucks and candy bars . The blonde was the center of a . firestorm after she Tweeted a picture of herself at home wearing a . low-cut tank top and holding an Andy Warhol book beside her in October . 2009. After receiving a . flood of angry responses, she Tweeted: ‘so I took a fun picture not . thinking anything about what I was wearing but apparently anything other . than a pantsuit I am a slut, this is why I have been considering . deleting my twitter account, what once was fun now just seems like a . vessel for harassment.’ The incident, though she later admitted was a life lesson, did not change her attitude and she doesn’t think twice about having fun with friends at bars. She said that she has embraced the advice of fellow buxom blonde Jessica Simpson and likes to flaunts her assets from time to time without care of repercussion. Reflecting on the 2008 campaign trail, she said that she gained weight by living off Starbucks and candy and even went up four dress sizes. Work and play: Meghan is a regular columnist for The Daily Beast and is a commentator for MSNBC . As she originally wrote in her book, Dirty Sexy Politics, which she published last year, Meghan passed out on Election Day when she nearly overdosed on Xanax due to the stress of the campaign. This year, the stress that the Republican campaign is causing her is over her lack of enthusiasm. In the interview, she bashes the presidential hopefuls and expresses her hope that a fellow straight-talking ‘maverick’ like New Jersey Governor Chris Christie will get involved in the race as a potential vice presidential candidate. Though he has not publicly ruled out the possibility, she believes he is the only obvious way to improve the current crop of candidates.","Daughter of former Republican presidential candidate John McCain tells all about life on the 2008 campaign trail where she nearly overdosed on Xanax and jumped four dress sizes .

Wealthy pensioners should be stripped of universal benefits such as free bus passes, Nick Clegg suggested yesterday. Anyone with assets of more than £1million could lose out on payments including the winter fuel allowance and free TV licences. The Deputy Prime Minister insisted age-related payments would be protected for the duration of this Parliament. But he indicated they could be curbed afterwards. Idea: Nick Clegg, pictured with his wife Miriam yesterday in Brighton, said wealthy pensioners should be stripped of universal benefits such as free bus passes . Mr Clegg said the welfare budget could not be ‘immune’ from the swingeing cuts aimed at reducing Britain’s budget deficit. The controversial plans are expected to be included in the Liberal Democrat manifesto at the next General Election, due in 2015. But some senior Lib Dems are calling for them to come sooner. Mr Clegg’s comments follow demands for a £2million ‘mansion tax’ for the ‘stinking rich’ and Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander’s warning that the Government would go after tax dodgers. David Cameron promised to retain free bus passes during the live television debates between the party leaders before the last election. But Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith wants an end to universal benefits for the elderly to help shave £10billion from the welfare budget. Mr Clegg said it would be ‘very difficult to explain’ if low earners lost state help while better-off pensioners continued to receive universal benefits. Middle class parents are already due to lose their child benefit payments next year. Proposal: Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith wants an end to universal benefits for the elderly to help shave £10billion from the welfare budget . ‘It would be quite interesting if you could ask the Labour party for this, because they appear to be saying that at a time when people’s housing benefit is being cut, we should protect Alan Sugar’s free bus pass,’ Mr Clegg told Radio 4. He said that the Coalition Agreement ruled out changing age-related universal benefits, but that would change ‘in the future’. 'The Labour party appear to be saying that at a time when people’s housing benefit is being cut, we should protect Alan Sugar’s free bus pass' Nick Clegg, Deputy PM . But one of his ministers called for cuts to be made immediately. Local Government Minister Don Foster told  Radio 5 Live: ‘It’s not yet Liberal Democrat policy, it’s something we’ll work on. But you know, if there is something that can be done now then we need to get the economy moving now, not just put it in a Liberal Democrat manifesto for 2015. ‘If we can get something like this implemented now then that would be better.’ Former Lib Dem Treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott added that Mr Cameron should take a ‘hit’ by axing universal benefits for the elderly. Unhappy: Nick Clegg said it would be difficult to defend the state giving a free bus pass to wealthy pensioners like businessman and TV star Lord Sugar . He said: ‘I’ve been raising these questions about winter fuel payments going to people who don’t need them, whether they are sipping Sangria in the sun in Seville or people like me in their 60s with good jobs: why at least should these not be taxed? 'If you start means-testing pensioner benefits, many of those who need help will not get it, as they won’t claim, it will cost huge sums in administration and you will be penalising those who have saved' Ros Altmann, Saga . ‘Nick has bravely taken hits for the Coalition team on tuition fees and the NHS, for example, why on earth can’t David Cameron at least accept that if we’re all in it together, rich pensioners in good jobs should take the hit too? Why aren’t we fighting for fairness on well-off pensioners’ perks now rather than waiting for 2015?’ But Ros Altmann, of Saga, warned: ‘If you start means-testing pensioner benefits, many of those who need help will not get it, as they won’t claim, it will cost huge sums in administration and you will be penalising those who have saved.’ Later Mr Clegg shot down Mr Foster’s calls for the change to happen before 2015. He said: ‘He’s wrong and it’s not going to happen in this Parliament, and I cannot stress enough that what I mean is people, who are very wealthy indeed, receive off millions of ordinary taxpayers across this country free bus passes, TV licences and winter fuel support; even though they frankly don’t need it.’ Fight: Nick Clegg, who yesterday visited the Red Roaster Coffee Shop in Brighton, is preparing to do battle with the Tories over cuts to the welfare bill . Last night Lord Sugar, 65, hit back at . Mr Clegg’s comments – saying he didn’t even have a bus pass and that Mr . Clegg was an ‘idiot’ and a ‘twit’. 'Idiot. Even if I did have a bus pass, I’ve personally paid tens of millions in tax, my companies hundreds of millions in the past 45 years. What has Clegg done?' Lord Sugar . The Labour peer tweeted: ‘The twit . Nick Clegg moaning about me having a bus pass. Idiot. I haven’t got one. Even if I did have a bus pass, I’ve personally paid tens of millions in . tax, my companies hundreds of millions in the past 45 years. What has . Clegg done.’ The attack on . universal benefits is the Liberal Democrats’ latest plan to target . wealthy Britons.  The party was yesterday reported to be looking at . increasing council tax on multi-million pound homes by creating . additional bands for properties worth over £1million.","Clegg: Can't defend free bus passes for Lord Sugar .

A British man has been shot dead in Pakistan after bravely returning  to testify against a gang who allegedly kidnapped him. Father-of-four Malik Iqbal from Bradford knew he was in danger but was determined to seek justice. He was assassinated by masked gunmen in front of relatives at a house in the city of Rawalpindi. Mr Iqbal’s MP, David Ward, who yesterday visited his grieving widow Rukhasana and their four school-age daughters, said the family wanted the world to know the dangers that British Pakistanis faced when visiting the country. Rawalpindi: Mr Iqbal had returned to Pakistan to give evidence against the men accused of kidnapping him in 2011 (file photo) ‘They want the clear message to go out . that this is a very dangerous place,’ he said. ‘The fact that you are . British is irrelevant as far as kidnappers are concerned. ‘Malik’s family is obviously distraught and their priority is to get his body back to Britain. ‘After that they want to see these bastards caught and brought to justice.’ Lib Dem Mr Ward said he met Mr Iqbal following the 2011 kidnap. He said: ‘He was in a dreadful state and could hardly get up my office stairs because his legs were still injured from being chained to a bed. Since then he has gone back to Pakistan three times to assist with court proceedings. ‘Most people would not have done that. He knew his life was at risk but he was an extremely brave man.’ A friend of the murdered man today said the killing raised questions about the protection provided for the 55-year-old by Pakistani authorities, and claimed the attack was 'something Mr Iqbal was afraid of'. Riaz Ahmed, a former Bradford City Councillor, said: 'Everyone is shell-shocked by it. It was something Mr Iqbal was afraid of and I think the authorities in Pakistan have let down everybody. 'There should have been some kind of security for him.' Mr Iqbal was kept blindfolded and chained to a bed during his 20-day kidnapping ordeal in 2011, and survived solely on occasional tea and biscuits. Mr Ahmed said his 'determined and brave' friend had been adamant about giving evidence against his alleged kidnappers. 'He was very, very determined to go through with this,' he said. 'It was very important to him that this would not happen to anyone else. It is testament to his courage.' Mr Ahmed said his friend's death was terrible for Mr Iqbal's widow, Rukhasana, and their four daughters. He said Mr Iqbal had flown back to Pakistan in August, but said he was not sure what stage the kidnapping trial had reached.","Malik Iqbal was shot by masked gunmen in Rawalpindi, Pakistan .

Dressed in a Muslim veil and surrounded from all angles by armed officers, this was the astonishing scene yesterday as a tranquil seaside resort was plunged into a full-scale terror alert. Scores of officers carrying sub-machine guns and wearing full protective uniform descended on Saltburn-by-the-Sea, near Middlesbrough, at 11am after reports that a woman had a bomb in her bag. During a dramatic stand-off with police negotiators, the woman – said to be local to the area – was ordered to place the rucksack on the ground. Armed Police surrounded the woman in Saltburn, Teesside, and took aim. Her bag was behind her . In the tense moments that followed, a . police helicopter hovered overhead as she was then told to drop to her . knees while keeping her hands up. As negotiators continued to talk to . her, she was instructed to get to her feet and walk away from the . rucksack. As officers trained their weapons on . her, they watched every step towards the seafront before ordering her to . sit on a nearby bench. Once there she placed her hands on her head. The terrifying stand-off went on into . the evening as Army bomb disposal experts headed to the scene from . nearby Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, to carry out a controlled . explosion on the rucksack. Witnesses said the woman, who was . white and wearing a dress with a veil, had earlier been to a hardware . store in the town and purchased items. A resident, who did not want to be . named, said: 'She doesn't say a lot, she's always walking around wearing . a white hijab. My friend tried to say hello to her once, she just . snapped at him.

Sales assistants at the store would . not confirm that the woman had been to the shop but a shopkeeper nearby . said she had been in yesterday morning.

Disgraced teacher James Hooker, 42, and his teenage lover made a brief court appearance today for his pretrial hearing on a charge of sexual misconduct with a minor. Jordan Powers, 18, held her former teacher's hand in the Modesto courtroom after being reunited following a public break-up last month. Hooker was arrested for oral copulation with a minor he taught at a California school in the 1990s, causing Miss Powers to fly home to Ohio and move back in with her mother. Grabbing attention: Jordan Powers, 18, and her 41-year-old boyfriend James Hooker face the media as they arrive at court in Modesto today for his pre-trial hearing on a sexual misconduct charge . The pair appeared this morning at Stanislaus County Superior Court for less than a minute where Judge Thomas Zeff scheduled Hooker to return to court on June 12. He was allowed to leave on $50,000 bail. Jordan had left Hooker after his arrest on April 6 over the sex charge which dates from 1998. The alleged victim says she had a sexual relationship with Hooker when she was 17  after they met at a business club event, the subject which he taught. Police said the alleged victim came forward after Hooker's relationship with Jordan Powers gained national attention. According to officers, the case stems from a 1998 relationship he had with a 17-year-old student from Davis High School in Modesto. Together: Hooker moved in with Jordan Powers, 18, in May after leaving his wife and three daughters and things have not went smoothly . After the arrest, Miss Powers said she had moved out of Hooker's apartment. Modesto police arrested Hooker on April 6 on a sex charge . However her mother Tammie Powers confirmed last month that her daughter left her Ohio home to return to Hooker. Ms Powers wrote on her Facebook page that Hooker 'has been relentless in contacting and talking to Jordan, as well as inflicting stress on all of my children'. She added: 'James, you have primarily dealt with the very, very, sick version of Jordan's mother -- I am getting stronger daily - do you hear me? Leave this kid and this family alone.' The investigation into the 1998 incident began after Hooker announced his relationship in February with Miss Powers, whom he taught at Enochs High School in Modesto. Hooker had moved in with the teen in February - the same day he quit his job in the school's business department. The teacher told police he had left his wife and their three daughters the previous week. Miss Powers' mother, Tammie, had confronted the couple on Dr Phil and accused Hooker of brainwashing her daughter. Furious: Tammie Powers believes her daughter Jordan was brainwashed by Hooker . Troubling: The arrest relates to the alleged sexual abuse of a different student at a separate school in 1998 . Where it all began: James Hooker quit his job at Enochs High School in Modesto - where one of his daughters, 17, is a student and where he met his teenage lover - so he could be with Jordan .","Jordan Powers, 18, and James Hooker reunited last month ."

I went back to work, because I had a mortgage, I had a house. I couldn't afford not to. Ian has worked full time, Ian has paid lots of tax. 'But you're not working now,' Kate Garraway points out. 'We are not currently,' Stephanie agrees. 'I gave up work before I met Ian because I had three children under 5 and I couldn't work and afford childcare.' 'The plan for the last 18 months has been I want to go to work. 'However, I can't get a job that's going to cover my rent, my council tax and my bills. For Ian's part, he says he worked 'straight' from 1969 to 1992 until he was forced to give up his job after collapsing while at the welding machine at the firm where he worked. He says that every three weeks he has to spend three or four days in bed with serious migraines and hasn't been able to work since. 'I didn't want to leave my job,' he says. 'They made me give my job up, they said it was just too dangerous.' 'There will be people watching who say you have every right to have as many children as you wish, but you can't expect the public to pay for them, which is what's happening now, Daybreak's Dan Lobb says. Shameless: . Stephanie, 28, centre, pictured with partner Ian, 56, and their ten . children - Bobbie, Cameron, Jack, Stephen, Sian, Charlie, Alex, Summer, . Callum and Nicole - says she knows she is taking advantage of the . benefits system - but blames the government for making it 'so easy' Ian replies: 'We agree with that. Stephanie works 40 hours in a week in a charity shop to get experience so that she can get a job [Stephanie says she volunteers in order to get experience and to meet people, and so her children are instilled with a good work ethic]. 'But what people don't understand is that our housing benefit [the two receive £1,700 a month, or £20,400 a year] goes straight to the landlord. People think we are getting the money but we're not. Ian goes on to explain that their house, owned by a private landlord, has a much higher rent payable than the £400 they would need to pay for a council house. Therefore, their housing benefits need to be correspondingly much higher to pay their landlord. The benefits system allows for this, setting high rent caps that critics have slammed as extortionate, especially for larger properties like the privately rented house the Government has allocated to the Fennessy-Sharp family live in. Garraway asks Ian what he would say to the taxpayers who are paying for him and his family to live in their five bedroom house in Kent and their lifestyle. 'They are funding your life,' she says. 'What would you say to them?' Stephanie, who is mother to three of the children from a previous marriage and step-mother to seven of Ian's children,  interjects, saying that they have 'paid their way' previously. 'We have also contributed to that. We have both paid taxes,' she says. Not at the moment, but in the past. And I want to contribute again. 'I want to come off of benefits and I want to go to work full time. It's the system that is stopping me.' 'It's somewhere higher up in the Government that's stopped me from doing it.

Ian steps in to defend his partner, saying: 'If Stephanie didn't want to go to work, she wouldn't go from half past eight in the morning and work til 6 o'clock at night in a charity shop for free, every single week.' 'Nevertheless,' Lobb says, 'Many of our viewers will say 50k a year is probably twice as much as people watching this programme actually earn doing a full time job. 'They find it an affront, although . it's perfectly legitimate, what you are claiming, and an affront that . you are able to get that from the State.' 'I . understand why people are angry,' Stephanie says. 'I'm saying, if I had . a council house, my rent would be £400 a month, and I could cover that. I could work to cover that and I wouldn't be on benefits any more. 'I . need someone to help me to come off the benefits system. Then I will be . back out working. I will be working to help support other people who . have children.' Garraway . steps in once more, asking Stephanie what her children make of their . lifestyle. 'Does it worrying you that they are seeing you living off . benefits?' she asks. 'All the children think Stephanie get paid for her job,'  Ian says. 'But she doesn't,' Garraway says. Ian . goes on, saying his children are well-educated, well-behaved, and . nothing like the 'typical' children people expect those on benefits to . have. 'All my children have 100 per cent attendance at school,' he says. 'All of them are going to have good careers. 'My . oldest wants to be a doctor in the Army. None of my children roam the . streets. They are not the typical children that people would think . people like us have.' Going . back to the contentious subject of the housing benefit the two claim, . Ian speaks out against the Government's use of expensive private . landlords, saying that if they could have a council house, they would . not be trapped within the benefits system. 'To me, if we could have a house that cost £400 a month, we'd be fine,' he says. As for Stephanie, she believes the children will look at their life of hardship and be inspired to work hard to achieve more. 'The children can see that we are struggling on benefits,' Stephanie says. 'And that's not what I want for my children.'","Stephanie Fennessy-Sharp, 28, and Ian Sharp, 56, claim £72k a year before tax .

Barack Obama's half-brother is making his film debut in a documentary where he talks about his non-existent relationship with his relative who is the most powerful man in the world. George Obama, 30, lives in Nairobi, Kenya and first came into the public eye in 2008 when his half-brother was a rising presidential candidate. At the time, he was living in a hut in the slum neighborhood of Haruma, which prompted many critics to deride Barack for not providing financial support. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Opening up: A clip from a documentary that features George Obama, left, the President's half-brother, was released Tuesday . In his interview with conservative journalist Dinesh D'Souza, who based the documentary off his book, The Roots of Obama's Rage which focuses largely on the President's views on colonialism, George Obama keeps his comments about his famous relative fairly positive. In a clip released to The Hollywood Reporter, Mr D'Souza asked whether he felt dejected that Barack has never offered to help George, but he simply brushed such claims aside. 'I think he has a family of his own, he's supposed to help his family,' George responded. The journalist didn't let go, saying that they are blood relatives which should entitle him to be considered a part of Barack Obama's family, but George still didn't take the bait. Familial similarities: Though they had different mothers, there are a number of physical similarities between Barack (left) and George (right) Searching for answers: In 2008, George Obama was interviewed about his relationship- or lack thereof- with his half-brother Barack and he is seen here reading the then-Senator's book about his Kenyan roots . 'Yea, I'm part of his family, but I'm over-age so I can help myself. 'He’s got other issues to deal with. He’s taking care of the world, so he’s taking care of me.' George says that when he was five or six years old, he met Barack briefly. 'I was just surprised- he is some half white guy,' George said in a clip from the documentary. Barack was born in Hawaii by his mother Ann Dunham, who was white with various European ancestry. The two men share the common bond of their father, Barack Obama Sr, but even that was not very strong because of their age gap. Barack is 50-years-old while George . is only 30-years-old, and Barack Sr died in a car accident just six . months after George was born. Family tree: Old family photos show a young Barack Obama (second from left in the back) among some of his Kenyan relatives . Back to his roots: While he was a senator from Illinois in 2006, Obama visited Nairobi, Kenya . The . President reportedly has seven half-siblings on his father's side- . including George, though the paternity of two of his reported . half-brothers, named Abo and Bernard, is questioned. While President Obama hasn't spoken . for years about his trip to Kenya as a child, he did write about it in . his book Dreams For My Father. Thinking back: George Obama said that he was about five or six years old when he met Barack, remembering that he was 'surprised' because his half-brother was 'some half white guy' In the book, he wrote that meeting . George was a 'painful affair' that was 'hastily arranged' with the help . of Barack's half-sister Auma. Towards the end of the book which . describes a young Barack's trip to Kenya to connect with his extended . family, he tells the story about how he and Auma drove to the school . where George was at school and had his teacher pull him aside during . recess. 'He was a handsome, roundheaded boy with a wary gaze,' he wrote. 'The boy shook our hands bravely but kept glancing back at games he'd just left. I realized then that we'd made a mistake. 'I took comfort in the fact that . perhaps one day, when he was older, George, too, might want to know who . his father had been, and who his brothers and sisters were, and that if . he ever came to me I would be there for him, to tell him the story I . knew.' In a 2008 interview . while then-Senator Obama was rising through the Democratic presidential . primaries, George said that he ended up taking Barack's prescient advice . without knowing it. 'I . think I wanted to learn about my father the same way he did,' George . Obama told a CNN reporter about his decision to read his half-brother's . book. Happy: Though an initial report said that George was living on less than $1 per day, he has since rebuked those statements and said that though he lives in a slum, he is happy and has had a good life . Different lives: There is a 20-year age difference between George and Barack Obama, as well as a vast distance between their homes as Barack has moved between Hawaii, the Philippines, New York, Chicago and D.C. while George lives in Kenya . 'He came here searching for his roots, and I was also trying to find my roots.' In the documentary interview, George said that he remembers little about his father except the stories that his mother told him. 'He was really educated,' George said of his deceased father. 'My mom was disappointed in me because I actually didn't finish my schooling. I really did let her down, I let my father down because he was an intellectual guy.' That said, George did write a book, entitled Homeland, which was published in 2010. While many conservatives- including the interviewer- were likely hoping for a more controversial and damning take on his half-brother, George seems to be one of the least problematic members of the wide-ranging Obama family. By comparison, Mr Obama's 'lost' half-uncle Omar Onyango was arrested for driving under the influence which was coupled with an outstanding deportation warrant.

New warning signs have been erected around Blackburn Cathedral to stop prostitutes and drug addicts using the grounds. Cathedral bosses in Blackburn, Lancashire have finally run out of patience with prostitutes using the building's grounds as an open air brothel. Diocesan authorities are threatening to remove the vice girls who use the alcoves and churchyard of the Anglican cathedral to ply their seedy trade, as well as drunks and drug addicts who desecrate the grounds. They have spent £1,000 on more than a dozen signs erected on lampposts around the churchyard warning potential wrong-doers that the site is a 'sacred ancient burial ground.' They fear the ‘disgraceful behaviour’ will deter people from enjoying the calm and tranquility of the surroundings. The cathedral's canon Andrew Hindley . has complained of having to move unconscious drunks from a bench when he . arrives in the morning and of dirty needles and other drug . paraphernalia being found in the churchyard. He . said clergy and other staff have also been threatened by drunks and . anti-social youths when asked to move on - as well as muggings in the . grounds, with police being called to deal with several incidents. Canon . Hindley, who is in operational charge of the cathedral, said: 'Things are . getting worse but that is a reflection of society at large. 'We decided we had to replace the existing signs with new tougher ones in view of what has been happening.' After warning potential offenders that 'CCTV cameras operate in this area,' the new signs say the cathedral 'reserves the right to ask people who are treating these grounds disrespectfully to leave.' Canon Andrew Hindley is fed up with prostitutes and drug addicts using the Cathedral's grounds. The warning notices erected around the . cathedral's grounds also say no litter, ball games, shouting or . swearing, alcohol, drugs or bicycles will be allowed. Canon Hindley said: 'The cathedral surrounds are an ancient burial ground and deserve to be treated with respect. 'We do not have a problem with young people coming and using the cathedral grounds to sit, talk and even have a cigarette. 'But we do not want people playing ball games, shouting and swearing in the grounds. This is not what they are here for. 'People should not be treating the many previous residents of Blackburn buried here with disrespect.' He said problems had escalated in recent months with drunks coming into the grounds leaving bottles and cans around and increasing amounts of anti-social behaviour 'with broken bottles, dirty needles and drug paraphernalia left around.' 'There is a real problem with people dropping and leaving litter,' he said. 'It takes our gardeners an hour every morning to clear the grounds and obviously broken bottles and dirty needles are a health hazard. “If people ignore the signs they will be asked to leave the grounds by clergy, vergers, and other staff. If they refuse, the police will be called to remove them.'","Vice-girls use Cathedral's doorways for sex .

Court: Peruvian Enrique Milla testifying in a Miami court over Skype in a case relation to his penis amputation . Attempts to put the spark back into his marriage have ended very, very badly for one man. His wife isn't too happy either. Enrique Milla decided to have an operation to help cure his impotence which saw doctors put an implant in his penis. But the former Miami resident later had to have his member amputated after a small infection that developed after the operation went gangrenous, The Miami Herald reports. The 65-year-old Peruvian has now launched unusual medical malpractice trial in a Miami court in a bid to get compensation. He is blaming his anaesthetist Dr Laurentiu Boeru for decisions that led to the infection and eventual life-saving amputation of his penis. The case which opened on Monday will see a jury will have to decide whether an anaesthetist can be held liable. Mr Milla is testifying at the trial via Skype because American authorities deported him and his family back to Peru last year. Spencer Aronfeld, Milla’s lawyer said: 'This has been devastating, painful and embarrassing. 'Mr Milla lived in Miami for 40 years and worked in the medical supply business and paid taxes. Unhappy: Mr Milla, with his wife, testifying at the trial via Skype in his penis amputation case, after American authorities deported him and his family back to Peru last year .

Operation: The Coral Gables Hospital where Mr Milla had the penis implant that he claims caused an infection that resulted in him needed a life saving organ amputation . Mr Aronfeld said Mr Milla, then 60, didn't go under the knife to have a bigger penis. He said: 'This was because of medical reasons: He just wanted to have relations with his wife.' The lawyer is arguing that anaesthetist should have known that Milla wasn’t in top physical shape at the time of the surgery and would have a hard time recovering. He said: 'Milla had high diabetes and high blood pressure when they cleared him for surgery. They should postpone the surgery until he got better.' The procedure took place in August 2007 at the Coral Gables Hospital in Miami. The infection that consumed Milla's privates and led to the amputation started more than a week later. Milla originally filed the lawsuit in 2009, naming Boeru and urologist Dr Paul Perito, the penile implant expert who performed the surgery,  Local 10 reports. Court records show Dr Perito settled with Mr Milla last year, although the details of the deal were not publicly available.Dr Boeru’s lawyer Jay Chimpoulis said: 'What happened to Mr Milla was just bad luck.

Former BBC presenter Dan Penteado was jailed yesterday for pocketing £25,000 in benefits while he was being paid to track down cowboy traders on television. Penteado, who admitted eight offences of dishonestly or knowingly claiming the benefits, was sentenced to 12 weeks. The father of two, who co-hosts the Rogue Traders part of the show Watchdog, received £24,077 in housing benefit and £868 in council tax benefit while the BBC paid him £56,000 over four years. Penteado, 40, who lives in a rented £375,000 townhouse in Bournemouth, was caught out when a council housing benefit officer recognised him on TV. Sentencing, chairman of the bench John Corben told him: 'This is not a victimless crime, it is actually a crime of stealing from the public purse.' A tearful Penteado was escorted to the cells as his wife burst into tears. His solicitor Terrence Scanlan told Bournemouth magistrates that Penteado was a man of good character but was 'sinking in debt' and owed £20,000 in student loans. He was only on short-term contracts with the BBC. Portuguese-born Penteado, who also works as a private investigator,  had 'lost his burgeoning career in broadcasting', the solicitor added. The court heard that Bournemouth council was seeking to recover all the cash and he had already paid back £280. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Camera-shy: Dan Penteado, who famously uses a . motorcycle to track down fraudulent traders on the show, arrives at . court on the back of a bike . Today, the BBC confirmed the presenter is to be axed from the show following the case. A BBC spokesman said: 'In light of the prosecution, Dan Penteado will not be returning to Rogue Traders.' Scanlan said Penteado committed the fraud from 2008 to 2012 . because he was on a short-term contract with the BBC and made the 'very . poor judgment not to interrupt the flow of housing benefit'. Debt-ridden . Penteado was only caught when a council housing benefit officer . recognised him on Rogue Traders and matched the name to his fraudulent . application. In court: Rogue Traders' Dan Penteado has been jailed after pleading guilty to council tax and housing benefit fraud to the tune of more than £24,000. Pictured right is his co-presenter Matt Allwright (right) Chairman of . the bench John Corben told Penteado, who is from Bournemouth: 'This is . not a victimless crime, it is actually a crime of stealing from the . public purse. 'It was . planned over four years and it was calculated and we consider it so . serious that only a custodial sentence is appropriate - you knew exactly . what you were doing. 'You will be sentenced to 12 weeks in prison and it will not be suspended.' His wife was in court and burst into tears as her husband was given a custodial sentence. Earlier . in the hearing Mr Scanlan told the court that Portuguese-born Penteado . was a man of good character but was 'sinking in debt' and owed £20,000. Mr . Scanlan explained that Penteado first applied for benefit in 2007 when . he was a student at Bournemouth University. The solicitor said Penteado had 'lost his burgeoning career in broadcasting and that itself is quite a punishment for him'. Upsetting: Dan Penteado's wife leaves Bournemouth Magistrates court today carrying his motorbike helmet after her husband was jailed for 12-weeks . Earlier in the trial, the court heard how the offences went back to 2007 when Penteado filled out his first claim form . and failed to declare he had another bank account. The court heard that Penteado repeated the fraud in subsequent years up to 2011. In that time he failed to tell . Bournemouth Borough Council he had been paid more than £56,000 for his . work on Rogue Traders from 2008 to 2011. Penteado appeared in court dressed in . trademark leathers and crash hemlet, ensuring he wasn't snapped by . cameramen - a similar tactic used by many of the crooks he exposed. Magistrates in Bournemouth were told . that Penteado began claiming benefits in 2007 after he enrolled on as a . full-time student at Bournemouth University. He went to work for the BBC six months later on Rogue Traders but failed to disclose his earnings. Johanne McNamara, prosecuting for Bournemouth Borough Council, said: 'The offences . came to light when a housing benefit officer recognised the defendant . from the television programme Rogue Traders and recognised the name from . a form they had just processed.' She outlined eight charges Penteado . pleaded guilty to, explaining he received sums ranging from £16,000 and . £18,000 from the BBC from April 2008 to December 2011. He pocketed £24,077 in housing benefit and 868 pounds in council tax benefit. Terrence Scanlan, defending, said: . 'Mr Penteado first obtained his claim for housing benefit in October . 2007 and at that point he was not working for the BBC. 'He had enrolled as a student as Bournemouth University trying to improve his prospects and was taking a degree course. 'He had no income and was relying on a student grant. His wife was not working and the family was struggling. 'In March 2008 the BBC contacted Mr . Penteado and invited him to return to the programme that he had . previously worked on; Rogue Traders. 'The BBC was going to recommission . the programme and between March 2008 and December 2011 Mr Penteado had a . series of short-term contracts - not continuous employment. 'That uncertainty about his work raised a question mark that fed into his decision not to interrupt the flow of housing benefit. 'It was very poor judgement and the claim was wrongful for a period of four years.' Dan Penteado's house in Bournemouth, Dorset. He said last month the matter was a 'misunderstanding' Mr Scanlan said the BBC paid him over £56,000, which worked out at about £14,000 a year. He added: 'Throughout this period . this was not a man living extravagantly, for most of the time he was a . student and a family was living quite frugally. 'He has worked hard and always tried . to improve his circumstances and always had the interest of his young . family at heart. He is married with two children; twins aged nine.' The presenter started working with Mr Allwright in 2001. He is familiar to viewers of Watchdog as . one half of the motorbike-riding team of investigators who chase down . unscrupulous tradesmen and bring them to justice. In the last series of Watchdog, the pair confronted eight business owners who they felt were ripping off the public. Mr Scanlan told the court that as a . result of the conviction, Pentreado's 'burgeoning career in . broadcasting' was likely to have been scuppered. He also said his client had £20,000 in debt from student loans and faced paying back £24,000 to the local council. Penteado wore a white shirt, black tie and black jumper when he appeared in court today. He looked pale and nervous and breathed deeply throughout the proceedings and at one stage wiped a tear away with a tissue. Penteado lives in the leafy suburb of Westbourne in Bournemouth with his family. The rented three-storey, terraced . townhouse property is in a gated, private road, has a balcony on the . first floor and is worth about £375,000. Earlier, the court heard the council, which . brought the prosecution, would be seeking to recover all the cash. Councillor David Smith, from . Bournemouth council, said: 'The amount of money stolen in this case is . truly shocking. We are pleased that Mr Penteado has now been . successfully prosecuted and brought to justice. 'The council will not tolerate . benefit fraud.

Eva Rausing’s body may have lain for up to two months under a pile of bin bags, clothes and bed linen several feet deep which had been stuck together with gaffer tape, a court heard yesterday. Officers found her decomposing body after gaining access to a ‘secure annex’ buzzing with flies at the 50-room Chelsea mansion she shared with her billionaire husband, a court heard yesterday. Mrs Rausing, one of Britain’s richest women, was last seen alive on May 3, suggesting she might have died more than two months before her body was found on July 9. The TetraPak billionaire, pictured leaving court, is charged with preventing the 'lawful and decent burial' of his wife Eva . In court: Hans Kristian Rausing, pictured in the dock at West London Magistrates Court in an artist's impression, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address during the hearing . Yesterday her husband Hans Kristian Rausing, whose father is a former boss of food packaging giant Tetra Pak, appeared before magistrates looking frail and withdrawn. The 49-year-old is charged with preventing the lawful burial of his American wife. Standing in the dock at West London Magistrates’ Court, bearded and bespectacled Rausing, wearing a light blue shirt and dark blue suit with gold buttons, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address. He sat quietly listening to proceedings, clutching a copy of As Seen On TV, a satirical novel by Irish author Chris Kerr. Last night, Mr Rausing’s parents issued a statement saying their daughter-in-law’s death was a reminder of the ‘distorted reality of drug addiction’. The court was told that on April 29 this year, mother-of-four Mrs Rausing, a crack cocaine and heroin user, had looked ‘unwell’ after returning home from a rehab clinic in California, and had a swollen face and right leg. She was last seen on May 3 by a financial consultant who visited the couple’s six-storey mansion in Cadogan Place. Grim discovery: Police found the badly . decomposed body of Eva Rausing, right, several hours after arresting her . husband Hans Kristian Rausing, left . Family photo: Eva and Hans Kristian Rausing photographed during happier times . On July 9, her husband was pulled over for ‘swerving and driving erratically’ in South London. When he got out he was unsteady on his feet and his pupils were dilated, the court heard. Police found a crack pipe in the driver’s footwell, along with cannabis and a white powder that was sent away for analysis. Eva and Hans were married in London's Swedish Church by the Archbishop of Sweden in 1992 . In the boot, they found several unopened letters addressed to Eva Kemeny – the maiden name of his wife of 21 years – the court heard. Brinkman May, prosecuting, said: ‘He was asked where his wife was. Then his demeanour changed and he appeared to well up. He said, “She went to America two weeks ago”. They asked where. He said, “California”. When they asked where, he became very vague and was unable to say where she was. He was arrested and taken to the police station.’ When police went round to search the £70million mansion, the stench of decomposition led them to a second-floor bedroom. Mr May said: ‘They continued to search and discovered part of the floor had been cut off to form a secure annex. ‘Various doors of the annex were barricaded or locked and silver gaffer tape was around the bedroom door frame. Officers entered and noticed a stronger smell of decomposition. The bedroom was in a state of disarray, with clothes and household items on the floor, the windows open and there were house flies present. ‘On the floor to the right of the bed they found a large quantity of clothes, bedsheets and bin bags, stuck together with gaffer tape. ‘Under these items, which were several feet deep, they discovered the remains of a deceased person in an advanced state of decomposition. It seems to suggest she had remained at that location for some time.’ Her death is being treated as ‘unexplained’, as a post-mortem examination failed to find a cause of death due to the advanced state of decomposition of her body. Eva with her father Tom Kemeny on her wedding day. Mr Kemeny said: 'Eva and Hans Kristian were a devoted and loving couple for the 21 years they spent together.' Family event: Eva's family said they hoped her death would raise awareness of drug addiction and financial support for those blighted by it. Test results to determine whether drugs played a role in the incident are expected back soon. Rausing and his wife had both suffered . from drug issues for the past 30 years and both had spent time in the . US trying to treat their problems, said Mr May. The couple, who met two . decades ago while in a drugs rehabilitation centre in Surrey, were . active philanthropists. Mr May described their home as an . ‘extremely large, multi-millionpound residence in Chelsea and . Kensington, with six floors and over 50 rooms’. Eva as a teenager: Her parents described her as a 'philanthropist' who was dedicated to helping others . They also spent time in their 11-bedroom mansion in Barbados. Rausing is heir to a vast fortune from . his Swedish father’s packaging business Tetra Pak. The family is the . 12th richest in Britain and is worth £4.3billion, according to The . Sunday Times Rich List 2012. Rausing’s lawyer, Alexander Cameron . QC, David Cameron’s elder brother, applied for his client to be bailed . to his home address on the condition he surrender his passport but this . was rejected by District Judge James Henderson, who said: ‘For a man as . wealthy as your client, I don’t think a little matter of his passport . would prevent him leaving the country.’ There was also a problem locating the passport, which is believed to be somewhere in the unkempt house, the court heard. Rausing was granted conditional bail and ordered to remain at a psychiatric hospital in Marylebone, London. The judge told him: ‘I grant you bail on two conditions. ‘The first is that you must reside at . the Capio Nightingale Hospital and that you live there and sleep there . overnight, and you do not leave that hospital unless you are accompanied . by a member of hospital staff.’ In a statement issued after the . hearing, Mr Rausing’s parents said: ‘Hans and Marit Rausing and their . families are mourning the death of their son’s beloved wife, Eva.

The retired Pepsi Cola executive said: . ‘At the time of her death, her overriding concern was for the safety of . her beloved husband, for whom she interrupted her own treatment to . return to London in an attempt to take him back with her to California, . but tragically to no avail.’ Mr Kemeny described his daughter as ‘a beautiful, generous and fun daughter, wife, mother, sister and aunt’. He said: ‘They bravely battled their . demons and supported each other and Eva will be a devastating loss to . our beloved “son” Hans Kristian, whom we love unconditionally with all . our hearts.’ Rausing, who has yet to enter a plea, is due to appear at Isleworth Crown Court on July 26.

Two joyriders whose 'cat and mouse' car chase at twice the speed limit caused the death of a young schoolgirl have both been jailed. Leanne Burnell, 21, and her 42-year-old boyfriend Leonard Jones were speeding through Taunton, Somerset, at an average speed of 65mph when Jones lost control and overturned his Vauxhall Vectra, killing 13-year-old Amy Hofmeister. Jones had moments earlier overtaken Burnell's Ford Focus during a 4.6 mile death race where terrified bystanders said he approached speeds of 81mph. Joyriders: Leonard Jones, 42, and then girlfriend Leanne Burnell, 21, were speeding at an average 65mph in a 30mph Taunton road when Jones collided with teenager Amy Hofmeister . Schoolgirl Amy was killed and her friend Lucy Hawkins badly hurt in the impact which happened as they were cycling along Blackbrook Way in Taunton in June last year. A court heard Burnell was 'egging on' Jones when the pair were seen tearing through Taunton at average speeds of 65mph. Jones - who crash specialists calculated reached a top speed of 81mph - was heard telling a front seat passenger, 'I'll catch her, I'll catch her', as he raced after Burnell. Jones was jailed for seven years for causing death by dangerous driving and two years concurrent for having no insurance and a licence. He was also banned from driving for seven years. Burnell was jailed for 18 months for causing death by dangerous driving and banned from driving for two years. She had originally denied causing death by dangerous driving, but was convicted following a four-day trial at Taunton Crown Court. Tragic: Amy Hofmeister died after being struck by the Vauxhall Vectra of Leonard Jones in June last year . Prosecutor William Hunter told the court the pair 'used their cars as toys and the roads as a playground' in the lead-up to the deadly collision. He said: 'She was effectively encouraging Leonard Jones to drive dangerously by egging him on smiling and smirking at him.' Lucy Hawkins told the jury: 'There was a huge impact and I just remember coming to rest in the hedge. I looked over and saw Amy on her back in the hedge with her bike next to her. 'She was completely still and wasn't moving at all. I screamed at her and got no response.' The chase began when Burnell sped off from a pub where she had been drinking with Jones and pals - witnesses said each had had a pint of cider. The jury was showns CCTV footage showing Jones chasing the speeding Burnell through the town and as she turned down a no car bus lane. Burnell was in front and Jones caught her up and overtook at 80mph - as his passenger Larry Grant told him to slow down. Police crash specialists calculated Burnell s average speed to be 65mph while Jones was doing nearly 81mph. Giving evidence Burnell claimed she was only doing 20-25mph and that her car was chugging as it was low on fuel and could not do more than 30mph. She told the jury: 'His car rolled, I panicked, I was in shock.' Sentencing them at the same court yesterday, Judge Graham Hume Jones blamed Jones for the tragedy as he jailed him for seven years and Burnell for 18 months. He said: 'However it was not Miss Burnell that caused Mr Jones to overtake in these circumstances. 'I consider that Miss Burnell was trying to get home first and Mr Jones decided he was trying to beat her. Amy's mother Jane Hofmeister condemned the prison terms and said she had 'not received justice'. Mrs Hofmeister, who blames Burnell for the chase and is considering appealing to get her a longer sentence, said: 'I said right from the offset I wanted justice for Amy; justice for my daughter; she was killed and taken from me. 'I don t believe I have received justice today. So the fight will continue. 'As far as I am concerned I am going to do everything in my power to take this forward. 'Eighteen months - I don t understand. Eighteen months is five months more than it has taken to get this case to court in the first place. 'My life sentence started on June 15, 2011 at 7.30pm. I have no reduction in that. Neither does my son Benjamin or my family.' Chief Supt Daimon Tilley, District Police Commander for Somerset, said: 'This was an unnecessary death. Amy should not have lost her life because she wore a helmet and she did everything right.'","Leonard Jones and Leanne Burnell averaged speeds of 65mph during chase through Taunton, Somerset .

A streaker who dashed in front of the Olympic flame appeared in court today where he denied a charge of indecent exposure. Daniel Leer charged through the streets of Henley-on-Thames as the torch passed through earlier this month, naked but for a pair of trainers and the words 'Free Tibet' painted across his back. The blond 27-year-old had admitted his daring dash, but today denied a charge of indecent exposure, a sexual offence, when he stood in the dock at Oxford Magistrates’ Court. Write caption here . During the 15-minute hearing the court, including the District Judge, broke into giggles as Leer’s exploits were outlined. On July 10, as the torch was carried through Henley, Leer’s home town, the waiter took to the streets himself, carrying his own version of the Olympic flame, just minutes before the real version was handed to celebrated rower Sir Steve Redgrave. 'Approximately 2,000 people including school children were waiting for the torch to pass through,' said Sarah Mackay, prosecuting. 'Naked apart from a pair of training shoes on his feet he was carrying a replica Olympic torch in his hand and was smiling and waving at the crowds. 'As well as adults there were school children and he was arrested straightaway.' The man's time in the limelight was short-lived, however, as he was bundled away by officers . District Judge Lynne Matthews was told . that Leer admitted causing a public order offence due to his disruptive . behaviour, but would be denying the charge of indecent exposure when . the trial took place at the same court in October. 'This . wasn’t a sexual offence, the offence as charged requires the intention . to cause alarm or distress,' said Sally Thompson, defending. 'That . wasn’t the intention.' Mrs Thompson said that Leer’s actions had been a 'high spirited' political protest to draw attention to the situation in Tibet. 'This is a young man of good character, he accepts the facts of what he has done,' said Mrs Thompson. Leer, . who wore a dark grey suit and tie, looked serious throughout most of . the hearing, apart from when District Judge Matthews made a joke about . the conditions under which he had been placed on bail. He . has been banned from coming within 100 metres of any Olympic venue, . including roads where the torch relay and events were taking place, or . going within 100 metres of the River Thames - unless underground or . going about his employment as a waiter for the duration of the games, . until September 3. Leer had . also been told that he could not enter Henley town centre, the Royal . Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, the City of London and the City of . Westminster for fear that he might disrupt further Olympic events. Judge Matthews prompted laughter when she suggested that these restrictions be amended to 'unless fully clothed.' She added: 'Being clothed can be defined as to whether in his mind it means wearing a pair of trainers.' The man ran past crowds naked carrying a fake Olympic torch in upmarket Henley-on-Thames . As well as carrying the fake torch, the 27-year-old streaker also had 'Free Tibet' written on his back . Leer, . who attended court with members of his family, was told that he must . return to court tomorrow where the bail conditions would be reviewed . after prosecutors had examined them overnight. Judge Matthews told Leer that the existing conditions would remain in place until then. He . had also been barred from taking part in any activity which disrupts . any intended or anticipated activities of the Olympic games, from . obstructing the movement or passage of any Olympic participants between . their residence, practice venue or place of work and venues being used . for Olympic competition or cultural purposes. Leer . was told that his trial, expected to last around two hours, would take . place on October 30 at Oxford Magistrates’ Court, once the Olympic Games . had concluded.

The Foreign Office said anecdotal . evidence from embassies and consulates overseas suggested many incidents . were alcohol-fuelled, particularly in popular holiday destinations such . as the Canary Islands, mainland Spain, the Balearics (which include . Majorca and Ibiza), Malta and Cyprus. Consular Affairs Minister Jeremy . Browne said: 'It is important that people understand that taking risks . abroad can land them on the wrong side of the law. 'The punishments can be very severe, with tougher prison conditions than in the UK. While we will work hard to try and ensure the safety of British nationals abroad, we cannot interfere in another country's legal system. 'We find that many people are shocked to discover that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office cannot get them out of jail. We always provide consular support to British nationals in difficulty overseas. However, having a British passport does not make you immune to foreign laws and will not get you special treatment in prison.' Meanwhile, the number of deaths of British people overseas in the year to April increased by 4 per cent - from 5,972 to 6,237. The highest number of arrests and detentions was in Spain, followed by the USA. Spanish arrests rose nine per cent in 2011/12, while the United States was up three per cent.

The snapshot of the perils of travelling abroad were highlighted in the Foreign Office's annual British Behaviour Abroad survey. In total, consular assistance was needed on nearly 20,000 occasions - up 3 per cent. Of these, 5,405 were in Spain, 1,822 in the U.S. and 1,319 in France. Spain had the highest number of Britons hospitalised, with 1,105 cases, followed by Greece (494) and Thailand (217). Injured: Ten Britons a day are ending up in hospital abroad having hurt themselves . Even though the country has a large number of elderly UK expats, over half those requiring medical help were in Majorca, which has seen a 132 per cent rise in incidents since 2009-10, and Ibiza. The report found: 'Many involve teenage holidaymakers. Common causes include road accidents, pedestrian accidents, balcony incidents and heart attacks.' Spain also had the largest number of UK deaths - 1,755. The large British retired community again accounted for the majority of fatalities but an alarming number involved young people. Top jockey Campbell Gillies, 21, drowned in a swimming pool within four hours of arriving in a holiday resort on the Greek island of Corfu . Earlier this year, three Brits - Adam Atkinson, 20, Benjamin Harper, 28, and Charlotte Faris, 23, - died within a few days of each other plunging from balconies or stairs in the beach resort of Magaluf on Majorca. And last month top jockey Campbell Gillies, 21, drowned in a swimming pool within four hours of arriving in a holiday resort on the Greek island of Corfu - after going boozing with his pals. Rapes reported to consular staff last . year soared by a shocking 10 per cent - from 115 to 127 - as young women . often let their guard down overseas. A Foreign Office source said: 'A lot of young people go wild and the sunshine combined with drinking cheap beer and cocktails all day leads to risky behaviour which can land them in serious trouble. At worst, they are brought home in a coffin.' On the alarming rape statistics, officials urged women to 'take the same precautions they do at home to avoid putting themselves at risk' - staying with friends, avoiding car rides with strangers and keeping an eye on food and drink so they can't be spiked. More than 56million Britons travelled abroad in 2011-12. But the Foreign Office research revealed that half of Brits surveyed did not realise that without travel insurance they would be liable to pay medical bills running into thousands of pounds if they were injured or fell ill abroad. Launching a drive to encourage holidaymakers to take out cover, Consular Services Minister Jeremy Browne said: 'Whilst the prospect of ending up in a foreign hospital may be the last thing on your mind as you head overseas for a summer break, sometimes things do go wrong on holiday and many people deeply regret not taking out comprehensive travel insurance.'","Foreign Office said more than 6,000 people were jailed abroad last year .

An unemployed artist found himself in literally in the doghouse after he fell on hard times and decided to move into a kennel. After being forced out of his rented home last year, Jamie Curtis, 46, camped in a farmer’s field in Silsden, West Yorkshire, before moving into a derelict kennel on the land. When his tent disintegrated, he made the 12ft-by-15ft hut habitable by kitting it out with a carpet, bed and solar-heated shower. Creature comforts: Jamie Curtis, 46, moved into the kennel three months ago, after living in a tent when he was forced out of his rented home last year . Minimalist: Mr Curtis was offered the derelict 12ft by 15ft kennel by a sympathetic farmer three months ago, after his tent began to leak . Mr Curtis has been living in the kennel - complete with dog run - for three months, and has made it a home fit for a King Charles Spaniel. Mr Curtis said: 'It’s got pros and cons. I’m happy with it, but it is a bit lonely. 'It’s mostly quiet, but every time I’ve rented a house before there have been problems with neighbours with noise and that from the stereo. 'If I had the choice between a quiet house and living in a kennel, I would have to pick the house, but this will do me for now.' Back to nature: The kennel has two dog runs but no kitchen, so Mr Curtis usually eats pre-cooked or tinned food . Sprucing the place up: The unemployed artist has modernised his simple home by fitting a bed, carpet and a solar-heated shower . Few mod-cons: The little Yorkshire hut has a portable toilet outside but no electricity . Mr Curtis has not worked for more than two years and admits to being the ‘black sheep’ of his family, with no relatives who could help him out. He lived in a number of rented properties and bedsits in recent years before becoming homeless. Toughing it out: Mr Curtis has been jobless for two years but is trying to save up his dole money to buy a home . Once his tent started to leak, sympathetic local farmer Gordon Waite said he could use the old hut. Mr Curtis said: 'I initially camped on his land, but bad weather ruined it, so I moved into the kennel. 'There’s no alarm on it or anything like that, but I’m not saying I have any valuables, but you do worry about people coming in. 'It’s two kennels with dog runs that have not been used for ages. My single bed takes up a quarter of it. 'It’s not a doss hole or anything like that - I have carpets.' The kennel does not have a kitchen but Jamie mostly eats pre-cooked or tinned food. He has hooked up a shower and uses a portable toilet at the rear of the kennel. 'I’ve got a solar-heated shower,' he explained. 'It’s a bag you hang in the sunshine and the sun warms it up. 'I shower every day. I’ve just got to fix a leak at the moment. 'The biggest problem is that I don’t have electricity. I might have to get a generator.' But Mr Curtis hopes his days in the dog house will be short-lived as he is saving up his Jobseekers’ allowance to pay for a deposit on a flat. He said: 'I don’t have any bills where I’m living, so I’ve been able to save up. 'I’m hoping to buy somewhere someday. Apart from the bit of money I have saved up, I’m not exactly rich.'","Initially lived in a tent on the Yorkshire farm - until it sprung leaks .

'They didn't seem to have any problems, there was never any issue of them not paying their rent or anything. 'The police have been round to tell us there were two bodies found at around 8.30am. They couldn’t really tell us anything as they were still investigating.' A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police said the deaths were not being treated as suspicious. He added: 'Inquiries into the full circumstances are continuing but police are not looking for anyone else in connection with the deaths.'

A pregnant 17-year-old has gone missing after going to tell the father of her child she met on Facebook that she was having a girl. Morgan Martin, of St Petersburg, Florida, stepped outside her house on July 25 to give the father the results of an ultrasound. The scan had revealed she was expecting a girl. The man, aged 26, has not been identified beyond the fact that he is from Kansas City. Missing: Morgan Martin, of St Petersburg, Florida, stepped outside her house on July 25 to give the father the results of an ultrasound . Morgan's sister, Sierra Cahill, 20, saw her leave the house wearing a white tank top, a pink jacket, gray pants and pink slippers around 12.30am. No one has seen her since. Police spokesman Mike Puetz said there are few clues to her disappearance. 'We don't have any evidence of an . abduction, no evidence of a homicide or an assault,' Puetz said. 'We . just have a set of circumstances that strike a very ominous tone. 'There's obviously some concern that this just doesn't seem right. Scenarios like this usually don't have a positive outcome.'

Two experienced pilots who were . sacked after a having a furious row in the cockpit were rightly . dismissed, a tribunal has ruled. Captain Stephen Bird had referred to . senior first officer Stephen Akers as his ‘bitch’ before their Flybe jet . took off from Exeter to Spain, the hearing was told. But when they encountered turbulence just before landing at Malaga, Capt Bird ignored his co-pilot’s request to avoid bad weather and a heated argument ensued. 'Fairly dismissed': Captain Stephen Bird (left) and First Officer Stephen Akers (right) were sacked from FlyBe following an argument in the cockpit during a flight from Exeter to Malaga . Akers called Bird a ‘control freak’ and told him to ‘f*** off’ before refusing to shake his hand after they . landed the aircraft, the Exeter tribunal heard. An investigation was launched and both men, who are in their 50s, were sacked by the Exeter-based airline. They claimed unfair dismissal and took . their case to an employment tribunal where once again they sat . side-by-side during the three-day hearing. Bird claimed banter was commonplace . between colleagues, many of whom are ex-military, and said his ‘your my . bitch’ remark was said in ‘jest and a clearly jovial manner’. He said he did not realise ex-RAF squadraon leader Akers had ‘found it offensive’ and later offered him his sincere apologies. Flybe found there had been a breakdown between the pilots that could have put passenger safety at risk . Akers said he had been concerned about . the weather around Malaga because two weeks earlier his plane had been . struck by lightning and severe turbulence. The cockpit row was not captured on the black box voice recorder because it had been wiped on the return flight. Flybe said any breakdown in crew relationships caused a ‘potential risk to safety’ of passengers, crew and plane. The firm’s investigators said the two pilots, who had clean disciplinary records, had been ‘yelling at each other’. Captain Stan Wood, who led the inquiry . into the bust-up, said it was ‘completely inappropriate’ for the two . pilots to fly back to England after such a heated row. He said: 'In my view, Stephen Bird did . not act as a captain should have. As the captain and commander of the . aircraft, he had ultimate control of the aircraft. 'Stephen Bird should have taken . control of an aircraft on approach to landing. He chose to engage in the . argument with Mr Akers which exacerbated the situation. Swearing at your captain during the flight is completely unacceptable.' The pair were on a flight from Exeter (pictured) to Malaga when the argument broke out . He said Akers should have asked for . another pilot to take over for the return flight, saying: 'He chose to . put safety of innocent passengers and crew members at risk by operating . the return flight.' A pilot said: 'They broke the golden rule. If there is any dispute in the cockpit then they should not fly back together. “The plane should have been grounded and a relief crew flown to Malaga.” The Exeter tribunal heard that Bird and Akers did fly back together ‘in virtual silence’ with Akers reading a newspaper. Bird said he did not think the aircraft should have been grounded over ‘a relatively minor altercation’. Bird, from North Devon, said he had . not found any work since his dismissal and despite his flying skills, . said his future may be as a handyman. Akers, from Exeter, claimed that some people in Flybe hated ‘ex RAF people’ and ‘patronised and humiliated him’. Employment Judge Christopher Carstairs said he would reveal the tribunal’s full reasons for their decision later. But he said: 'The unanimous judgement of the tribunal is that the respondent (Flybe Ltd) fairly dismissed the claimants.' Flybe reported £6.4 million loses in April.","Captain Stephen Bird and First Officer Stephen Akers hadn't even got off the ground when an argument started .

Wells Fargo fired an employee over the cost of treating his daughter's terminal cancer with company health care coverage, according to a lawsuit filed last week. Yovany Gonzalez, a former mortgage broker, was sacked by America’s fourth-largest bank in August 2010. His dismissal came three days before surgeons were set to operate on his daughter Mackenzie in a last-ditch bid to save her life. The lawsuit claims Mackenzie’s operation . was cancelled because she was no longer covered by Wells Fargo’s . employee health insurance. Mr Gonzalez’s daughter died in March 2011. Shocking: Yovany Gonzalez claims in a new lawsuit that he was fired from his post at mega-bank Wells Fargo over the exorbitant cost of his daughter's cancer treatments under the company health care plan. Mr. Gonzalez's lawsuit was filed last Thursday at the Palm Beach County Courthouse, Florida. The suit doesn't link Mr. Gonzalez's ouster - and his policy's cancellation - to his daughter's demise, as a Good Samaritan charity subsequently spotted him a year's health coverage under COBRA, a lawyer for Mr Gonzalez reportedly said. But certain statements allegedly made by Wells Fargo personnel, as well as those on the part of United Health Care reps, just prior to Mr. Gonzalez's dismissal, cast the bank's acts in something of a suspicious light. Around the time of Mr. Gonzalez's ouster, Wells Fargo and United Health Care reps asked his wife ‘numerous questions’ about her daughter’s treatment and made ‘several references… to the cost of her treatment,’ the lawsuit states. Also, around the same time as these cagey comments, Mr. Gonzalez's Wells Fargo supervisor alighted on something of a witch hunt, the suit alleges, searching for reasons to fire the beleaguered employee. Gonzalez, a mortgage broker for the mega bank, was canned three days before a costly, scheduled operation to stave off Mackenzie's cancer . 'This was a loss of an innocent child's life,' The Huffington Post has quoted Jack Scarola as saying. Scarola is acting as an attorney for Mr.  Gonzalez. 'There were [some] Wells Fargo employees who not only lacked compassion, but seemed to have been motivated by entirely improper concerns about finances,' Mr. Scarola reportedly added of the suit. However, Wells Fargo strongly denied the the startling allegations laid out in Mr. Gonzalez's legal action. 'While we're very sympathetic to Mr Gonzalez for his personal loss,' a Wells Fargo spokesman wrote in a statement, 'his termination was unrelated to the allegations included in the lawsuit. 'We intend to vigorously defend the matter in court. We support and value our team members and our employment practices are in alignment with that focus.' According to the lawsuit, Wells Fargo claimed Mr. Gonzalez was fired because he allegedly handed in falsified time records. Mr. Gonzalez countered that allegation, claiming in court documents that his manager inputted his time sheets into the company system, and told him he could always recollect payment for the extra hours he worked. Doctors diagnosed Mackenzie with cancer in December 2008, and in order to assist with her treatment, Mr. Gonzalez started working in different locations. Pulling the plug: The procedure to fight MacKenzie's cancer was canceled, but a charity stepped in and paid for Gonzalez's COBRA coverage. His daughter died seven months later in March 2011 . The lawsuit also states that Wells Fargo failed to give Mr. Gonzalez information about how to continue his family's life insurance coverage - information he says he was promised after he was fired. The insurance plan, which included life insurance for his children, was consequently cancelled after he left the company. It meant that when Mackenzie died, Mr. Gonzalez was unable to receive life insurance compensation. Wells Fargo, which logged some $16 billion in profit in 2011, denies the link between Gonzalez's ouster and cost of Mackenzie's treatments. It has vowed to fight the suit . While an employee who loses their job is permitted to extend health insurance coverage under the COBRA law as long as they continue paying the full premium, it took more than 90 days for Wells Fargo to send Gonzalez information about how to extend his policy. Mr. Gonzalez began working for Wachovia in 2007. The company was bought by Wells Fargo in 2008 amidst the American banking crisis. He . is now employed by JP Morgan Chase for less pay, according to the lawsuit. The suit also says Chase . is not letting Gonzalez sell securities because of the reasons that . Wells Fargo gave for firing him. As for Wells Fargo, the company logged nearly $16 billion in net profits - and recorded almost $90 billion in total revenue - in 2011, the same year little Mackenzie died.","Yovany Gonzalez, a mortgage broker, fired three days before his daughter MacKenzie had a costly cancer operation .

Her tutor Sarah Beazley said: 'Lara was the perfect student, always working hard, popular with fellow students and staff.' Close: Norcott, pictured in these Facebook photos, was a family friend of Lara's and used to babysit for her . The court heard Norcott was a family friend of Lara’s and used to babysit for her when he was a teenager. On the night of the crash Norcott’s girlfriend had driven him and his friend Mr Brant to a party in Bristol. He drove back to his home in Pershore, arriving at 4am where he dropped his girlfriend off before picking up Mr Long and Lara. They then headed towards an all-night party at Baldock in Hertfordshire. Peter Shaw, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Brant heard someone from the back shouting and he turned to look out to see the car veering across the lanes towards the crash barrier. Injuries: Norcott shows off his injured arm on the social networking site. His solictor said he feels so guilt-ridden he has since raised £1,500 in Lara's memory and said he deserved a jail sentence . 'He looked at the defendant and saw his head hanging down and apparently asleep. Mr Brant tried to grab hold of the steering wheel. However, the car hit the central reservation.' The court heard Norcott, who worked as a farm worker and builder, had five previous convictions for 11 offences and three cautions, including driving with excess alcohol and driving while disqualified, possessing ecstasy and having no insurance. Derek Johashen, defending, told the court Norcott 'remembered holding her [Lara] as a baby when he was 10 years old.' He added: 'He says he deserves to go to custody. He treated her as a younger sister he never had. His own ridiculously bad behaviour led to her demise.' The court also heard that Norcott feels so guilt-ridden he has since raised £1,500 in Lara’s memory.","Matthew Norcott had been up for two days on ecstasy when he ploughed into a central reservation at 83mph .

Old Harrovian Neil Heywood was murdered by one of the most powerful women in China after he made a threatening demand for £13million from her playboy son, a court heard yesterday. Gu Kailai, who was said to be having an affair with the British businessman, lured him to a hotel room where she got him drunk and then laced his drink with cyanide. Four police officers were today said to have admitted covering up the murder in court. They will be sentenced later. The alleged motive behind 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s grisly death was revealed at the murder trial of Gu, dubbed the Jackie Kennedy of China. Her lawyer even argued that affable Mr Heywood, a father of two young children, ‘should bear some responsibility’ for his own murder. Scroll down for video and official Xinhua court report . In the dock: Gu Kailai, 52, and aide Zhang Xiaojun, 33, are escorted into the Hefei City People's Court to face charges relating to the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in November . No contest: Gu and Zhang did not raise any objections that on November 13, 2011, they went to Heywood's hotel room and, after getting him drunk, administered a fatal poison . Under heavy skies: The People's Court in Hefei, Anhui province in China, where Gu Kailai and a household aide are being tried for the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood . Tight security: A line of police officers stand outside the court, which has been closed off to foreign journalists. More traffic police patrol the streets around the courthouse . The court heard the Jaguar-driving . Englishman had fallen into an ‘economic dispute’ with Gu’s party-loving . son Bo Guagua, 24, whom Mr Heywood had once mentored to secure a place . at his alma mater, Harrow School. Mr Bo, known for a love of champagne . and shisha parties while studying at Oxford University, was allegedly . told by Mr Heywood: ‘If you do not give me £13million, you will be . destroyed,’ the judges heard, according to a reliable source who was in . the courtroom. These threats, in an email or letter, were said to have been forwarded by Bo to his mother. International media were banned from . the highly-politicised trial, which concluded in less than seven hours . in the Intermediate People’s Court in the eastern Chinese city of Hefei. The source added that the court heard it was not the first . assassination plot on Mr Heywood, with Gu having previously conspired to . kill him with a local police chief. Political scandal: Gu Zailai, left, with her husband - former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai. The murder case is one of China's biggest political scandals . Gu Kailai was a humiliated wife who had a ‘wolfish appetite’ for sex, Chinese investigators claimed. As her trial went ahead, police said she was vulnerable because her husband indulged in affairs and she was at an age when her sex drive increased. The claim was made to justify Beijing’s official version that Gu had been involved in an affair with Neil Heywood. It is also claimed that British spies pushed Mr Heywood into having an affair with Gu because they were convinced her husband Bo was a rich source of intelligence. The suggestions surfaced via ‘political insiders’ in Beijing quoted in a Hong Kong magazine. Its story begins in the 1990s after Mr Heywood began tutoring Mr Bo’s young son in English, and the boy was put into Papplewick, a prep school in Berkshire. Gu travelled to England to be near her son, taking a flat in Bournemouth. According to the magazine which quoted a police chief in the case, she was ‘hungry’ for sex. ‘At that time Gu Kailai was about 40 years old, which is an age when women have a wolfish appetite for sex,’ he said, ‘and they soon became lovers.’ After Gu returned to China, Mr Heywood married a Chinese woman, Lulu Wang. But the magazine alleges MI6 pushed him to resume the affair. Friends of Mr Heywood have dismissed the claims as nonsense. There have been reports, denied by Mr . Heywood’s friends, that he and Gu – the wife of deposed Communist chief . Bo Xilai – were having an affair. Last night, after the secretive trial . ended, officials gave brief details of the case. Poisoned: An undated photo of businessman Neil Heywood, who had close ties to the Bo family before his death in November last year . The court’s deputy director Tang Yigan . announced: ‘Gu Kailai believed that Neil Heywood had threatened the . personal safety  of her son Bo and decided to  kill him.’ Gu summoned him to Chongqing, the . mega-city in southwestern China where her husband was Communist Party . Secretary, on November 13 last year. They drank tea and wine together in . room 1605 of the ‘Lucky Holiday Hotel’, before  Mr Heywood became drunk . and was sick. After he had vomited, Gu, 53, helped . him drink a glass of water – which she had mixed with a lethal draft of . potassium cyanide. A tiny drop can cause agonising death within minutes. ‘She poured it into Heywood’s mouth, killing him,’ said Mr Tang. State television showed Gu, wearing a . dark trouser suit and a white shirt, being led into the courtroom and . seated in the dock. She appeared to have put on weight since she was . detained earlier  this year. Neither Gu nor her co-accused – family . bodyguard Zhang Xiajun, 33, who is alleged to have prepared the poison – . entered pleas but they did not contest the murder charge against them. A . student who was allowed to witness the case said Gu had appeared . ‘calm’, despite the possibility she could be sentenced to death. ‘There . were no tears. Both looked quite calm, peaceful. Both said they accepted . the court’s authority,’ said the student. Mr Tang said prosecutors . believed the facts of the ‘brutal’ crime were clear and backed by ‘ample . evidence’, and that ‘Gu Kailai is the main culprit and Zhang is the . accomplice’. Information blackout: As police control the situation outside the courthouse, the government has rigorously censored all reporting of the case within the country . Implicated: The official allegation against Gu suggests Heywood might have been making threats against her son Bo Guagua, 24 . During the hearing, Gu was in a stable . mood, said Mr Tang, but at the time of the murder, she had suffered . from a ‘weaker than normal ability to control herself’. Gu had reportedly made a full . confession to police, which it was in her interests to do because it . will act in her favour during sentencing deliberations. The judges . reserved their verdict to an unspecified date within the next 30 days. She will almost certainly be found . guilty, but could be spared the executioner’s bullet because of her . defence that she was only trying to protect her son. In a bid to further . lighten her sentence, Gu was said to have made accusations about ‘other . people’s crimes’, although no details were given. Gu, herself a career lawyer, was defended by a state-appointed lawyer with meagre experience in criminal cases. As Mr Heywood was a British citizen, . two UK diplomats were allowed rare access to witness proceedings. Friends and relatives of Mr Heywood were also among 140 people in court. This is the main part of the official account of the trial published by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. It refers to Gu by her official name, Bogu Kailai: . 'On August 9, the Hefei Intermediate People's Court in Anhui province held an open trial for the accused Bogu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun on charges of intentional homicide. 'The Hefei People's Procuratorate on July 26,  2012, submitted an indictment to the Hefei Intermediate People's Court, charging that the accused Bogu Kailai and her son Bo became involved in a dispute over economic interests with the victim, Neil Heywood. 'Bogu Kailai believed that Neil Heywood had threatened the personal safety of her son Bo, and decided to kill him. She then arranged for the co-accused Zhang Xiaojun - an employee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee office - to invite and accompany Heywood from Beijing to Chongqing. 'On the evening of November 13, 2011, Bogu Kailai went to Heywood when he was staying in Room 1605 at Building No 16 of the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel, and drank alcoholic drinks and tea with him. 'After Heywood became intoxicated, vomited and asked for a drink of water, she poured a poison into his mouth that had been prepared beforehand, and that she had given to Zhang Xiaojun to bring along, causing Heywood's death. 'The Hefei People's Procuratorate believes that the accused Bogu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun used brutal means to commit murder, and the facts of the crime are clear and backed by ample evidence. 'Their actions violated Article 232 of the Criminal Code of the People's Republic of China, and they should be prosecuted for the crime of intentional homicide. 'This case involved a joint offence, with Bogu Kailai as the principal offender and Zhang Xiaojun as the accessory. 'In court, the investigating body put forward relevant evidence, appraised witnesses, and lawyers spoke separately in defence of Bogu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun. 'The legal representative of the family of victim Neil Heywood participated in the hearing and issued an opinion, and more than 140 people - including, friends and relatives of the defendants Bogu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun and victim Neil Heywood, British consulate officials, journalists, representatives from the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Consultative Conference and citizens - were in attendance.'","Heavy security around Hefei People's Court .

The deepening crisis in the eurozone could see Britain quit the European Union for good, according to one of the world’s leading investment banks. Japanese giant Nomura said the UK government could be forced to set a date for an in-out referendum as soon as the autumn as the single currency bloc lurches closer to disaster.

Japanese giant Nomura said the UK government could be forced to set a date for an in-out referendum as soon as the autumn as the single currency bloc lurches closer to disaster . It was the first time a global bank has issued such a hard-hitting report on Britain’s deteriorating relationship with crisis-torn Europe. Pressure is mounting on David Cameron to call a referendum with more than half of Conservative backbench MPs in favour of a public vote. Pressure is mounting on David Cameron to call a referendum with more than half of Conservative backbench MPs in favour of a public vote . Former Prime Minister Tony Blair yesterday told a German newspaper that a British exit from the EU could be sparked by too much power being transferred to Brussels. ‘I am deeply worried that Britain could decide by referendum to leave the whole process,’ said Mr Blair. But many analysts and businesses believe Britain would benefit from leaving the EU and forging new partnerships with emerging economies around the world such as Asia, the Americas and Africa. Others favour a looser relationship with Brussels. ‘A referendum on the UK’s membership of the EU seems to be becoming a more realistic prospect,’ said Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at consultancy Capital Economics. ‘We think that concerns about the economic disruption if the UK were to leave are overdone. In fact, the economy could end up better off.’ The Nomura report - part of its ‘Issues which keep me awake at night’ series - dubbed a British exit from the EU ‘Brixit’. It was written by London-based analyst Alastair Newton, an-ex British diplomat and former head of Mr Blair’s G7 team. The report said: ‘The eurozone crisis has fuelled eurosceptic sentiment in the UK. The British government’s response to the crisis of encouraging closer eurozone integration while looking for a looser UK relationship with the EU appears to be fanning eurosceptic flames. ‘The next few weeks could be critical in the evolution of the eurozone crisis. Consequent developments in Europe could result in further pressure on the British government to commit firmly to a referendum on EU membership.’ Mr Newton said the impact of an exit from the EU or a looser relationship with Brussels on the economy and the City of London ‘is not clear at this time’. But he added: ‘The increasing possibility of either a looser UK relationship with the EU or a UK exit is bound to raise both economic and political concerns including in financial markets.’ A poll of 2,000 businesses by the British Chambers of Commerce recently found that most firms - some 85 per cent - do not want further EU integration. The survey found that only 12 per cent wanted to leave the EU altogether. But almost half - 47 per cent - want to negotiate a looser relationship and only 9 per cent of want further integration.","Nomura said the UK government could be forced to set a date for an in-out referendum as soon as the autumn .

A grieving father discovered that senior hospital staff dealing with the investigation into his baby's death exchanged 'deeply offensive' emails celebrating the end of his quest for justice. James Titcombe wrote to tell staff at the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust (UHMBT) that he was 'stepping back' from his personal investigations in the death of nine-day-old son Joshua in November 2008. He found that Angela Peil, who worked in customer services at the trust, greeted the news by emailing Angela Oxley, head of midwifery, writing: 'Good news regarding James T'. Grieving father James Titcombe, pictured with a photo of his dead son Joshua, discovered the 'deeply offensive' email exchange between UHMBT's customer services and the head of midwifery . Mrs Oxley replied: 'Has JT moved to Thailand? What is the good news?' Mr Titcombe, whose wife Hoa is from Vietnam, unearthed the emails as part of a Freedom of Information request. He feels his case may have become confused with that of fellow grieving father, Carl Hendrickson, whose wife, Nittaya, and newborn son, Chester, died in the FGH maternity unit in 2008. Mr Hendrickson, whose wife was from Thailand, is currently involved in legal action with UHMBT. Mr Titcombe said: 'It hints at an underlying prejudice.' UHMBT interim chairman, Sir David . Henshaw, said: 'We expect all staff to act in a respectful, sensitive . and professional manner at all times and any behaviour that does not . meet these standards is completely unacceptable. 'On discovering this information last . week, the trust launched an internal investigation into the matter and . will report the outcomes directly to the Titcombe family.' Baby Joshua, pictured with big sister Emily, died nine days after his birth at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria . Joshua Titcombe bled to death after picking up an infection from his mother. His parents asked medics if their newborn son needed to be treated too after they discovered his mother's illness but were told it was unnecessary. He was airlifted to two different hospitals over the course of the next nine days and died in Newcastle Freeman Hospital on November 5 2008. Police launched an investigation into standards at the Furness General Hospital last September after the deaths of babies including Joshua. The labour ward was threatened with closure by the Care Quality Commission unless it improved. At his son's inquest, Mr Titcombe said that NHS staff had also informed them a paediatrician was 'too busy' to examine Joshua. Joshua, who suffered a lung infection . and bled to death, would have had a 80 per cent chance of survival if . given antibiotics immediately after his birth, the inquest heard. James and Hoa Titcombe pictured last year outside the inquest into their son's death . Coroner Ian Smith accused the midwives who cared for Joshua of a cover-up and collaborating over their failure to recognise a sign that the baby had an infection. The inquest ruled that Joshua died of 'natural causes following a number of missed opportunities to identify he was ill and to provide him with appropriate treatment', but identified 10 failures by NHS staff leading up to it. The coroner accused staff of a cover-up and collaborating to hide mistakes over his care. Ian Smith said 'it was not beyond the balance of possibility' that the observation sheet, recording measurements such as his temperature, had been destroyed, 'and if that was done it can only have been done deliberately'. However, he conceded there was no proof this was the case. This is not the first time hospital staff have been caught making inappropriate comments in correspondence regarding Joshua’s case. Last year, it was revealed a midwife involved in an investigation into Joshua’s death sent her colleague a report intended for the Nursing and Midwifery Council - entitling her email 'NMC S**t'. Mr Titcombe said the latest email exchange is 'deeply offensive and hurtful' but 'sadly typical' of the attitude towards his son’s death. He said: 'To be honest it’s what I expected. It’s how it’s been all along. 'After Joshua died, I was fighting for answers and I was viewed as an issue - a problem they wanted to go away.' Mr Titcombe has vowed to fight on. He said: 'Going through this has been an absolute nightmare - and you’re torn between not wanting to give up on the truth and the impact it has on you. 'My family and I have no intention of moving to Thailand or Vietnam and we will continue to do everything possible to expose the full truth. 'We want to ensure that Barrow maintains a full, consultant-led maternity service that provides a safe level of care. 'We are calling for an independent inquiry to ensure the NHS as a whole learns from these events.'","Trust's customer services employee Angela Peil wrote to colleague it was 'good news' that James Titcombe was stepping back from his inquiries .

Pulling out: Derbyshire Police Authority's vice-chairman, Alan Charles, withdrew from the police commissioner elections because of a minor offence he committed 47 years ago . A senior councillor has pulled out of the race to become a police commissioner because of an offence he committed 47 years ago as a 14-year-old - the second candidate in a week to withdraw from the elections. Alan Charles, the vice-chairman of Derbyshire Police Authority, had intended to stand as a Labour candidate but withdrew after revealing he was given a conditional discharge for a minor non-violent crime in 1965. His case echoes that of Bob Ashford, who quit as the Labour candidate in Avon and Somerset on Tuesday over a £5 fine he was given for two minor offences committed 46 years ago when he was just 13. Mr Ashford has described as 'absolutely ridiculous' rules which bar candidates from standing if they have been convicted as a juvenile of something that would carry a prison sentence if committed by an adult. Mr Charles did not disclose the nature of his previous offence, which had not been revealed by a criminal records check. He said: 'I have taken the difficult decision to stand down as the Labour Party candidate for police and crime commissioner for Derbyshire. 'The Labour Party has only now received clarification from the Home Office and the Electoral Commission that juvenile convictions for imprisonable offences will bar people from becoming a police and crime commissioner.' Mr Charles added: 'Despite serving as vice-chair of Derbyshire Police Authority, I have received confirmation that a minor criminal offence I committed around 47 years ago, for which I was given a year's conditional discharge, has barred me from standing. 'Ridiculous': Mr Charles's case echoes that of former Avon and Somerset candidate Bob Ashford, pictured holding a photograph of himself aged 13, who pulled out of the race over a £5 fine he was given in 1966 . Mr Charles's withdrawal is a further . policy setback for Home Secretary Theresa May, who said earlier this . year that it had not been ministers' intention to bar people who were . guilty of minor offences as teenagers. Police commissioners, due to be elected in November, will have the power to hire and fire chief constables. Among the other candidates is the former Deputy Prime Minister, Lord Prescott, who is seeking office in the Humberside Police area. Setback: Mr Charles's withdrawal is embarrassing for Home Secretary Theresa May, who said it had not been ministers' intention to bar people guilty of minor offences as teenagers from standing . Mr Ashford, who has Whitehall security clearance, stepped down from his £90,000-a-year job as director of strategy for the Youth Justice Board partly to run for the role. But he was forced to withdraw from the race because he was convicted in 1966 of trespass on the railway and possession of an offensive weapon. The father of four, of Frome, Somerset, has received hundreds of emails of support and is to seek legal advice on whether there are grounds for him to challenge the legislation. He said: ‘This was a flawed policy idea from the beginning and it’s now proving to be absolutely and fatally flawed.’ The rules had already led war veteran Simon Weston to pull out because he feared that his £30 fine at the age of 14 for being a passenger in a stolen car would have disqualified him. The former Welsh Guardsman suffered horrific burns to 46 per cent of his body during the Falklands conflict in 1982. As a teenager he was arrested when he was in a stolen car with two or three other males aged between 18 and 27. Mr Weston always said he was not aware the care was stolen, but on advice, pleased guilty at the subsequent trial. He was fined £30 and put on probation for three months.","Alan Charles, vice-chairman of Derbyshire Police Authority, was given a conditional discharge in 1965 .

Police are hunting the owners of a 'drunk' dog that clamped its jaws around a cow's face for ten minutes after its owner goaded it into a violent frenzy. The sozzled Staffordshire bull terrier brutally attacked the helpless steer, on Midsummer Common, Cambridge,  after it staggered away from its owners - a man and woman, also described as inebriated. A fierce tussle ensued as the cow attempted to trample its canine attacker with its hooves in a bid to loosen the iron grip. As the dog's owners simply looked on, a passer by eventually caught the rampaging animal before tying it to a lead he had in his pocket. A good graze: The unnamed cow was left with a large gash on its face, but it has been treated and its owner said it is 'well and calm' Now Cambridgeshire Constabulary want . to find the owners after they were called to reports of a dog that . 'appeared to be drunk' attacking a cow on Wednesday evening. The suspected dog, thought to be . called Spike, is said to have been baited to attack the cattle which are . famous for having roamed the common undisturbed for hundreds of years. Vet Angelika von Heimendahl, who owns the cattle, said: 'I think the owners of the dog must not have realised what would happen, but it is stupid, cruel and irresponsible. 'The steer had lacerations to its face. The dog bit one steer’s leg then attached itself to the other steer’s face. It was really dangerous.' Anna Tristram, 30, who was running on the common when the attack took place, said: 'It was really horrible. I thought at first the cows were . attacking the dog but then we saw the dog has clamped on to the face of a . cow and was just dangling on it for about 10 minutes. Angry: Vet Angelika von Heimendahl, who owns the cattle, said the owner's actions were 'stupid, cruel and irresponsible' 'There was nothing we could do. The . dog eventually got off and then carried on chasing the cows until it . finally fell down with exhaustion. 'A really brave man came over and managed to get a lead on it. I don’t think the owner even had a lead and he was really drunk. 'He dragged it up the road because it was exhausted. It was horrific.' Another witness, who asked not to be named, said the dog was goaded into the attack. He said: 'It was disgraceful. To get a dog to attack the cows is awful.' And Barry Higgs, chairman of the Friends of Midsummer Common, said: 'There are people on the common who have given drink to dogs in the past. 'It’s deplorable but it is a very isolated incident. We are very keen on the cows here. ' The brutal attack happened at about 7pm on Wednesday evening in front of a crowd of passersby on Midsummer Common in Cambridge. The cow was left with a large gash on its face, but it has been treated and its owner said it is 'well and calm'. The injuries to the dog, which witnesses reported was called Spike - or Skype - was kicked by the cattle, have not been reported to Cambridgeshire Constabulary. Dangerous dogs? Staffordshire Bull Terriers are generally known for their good temperaments, intelligence and fierce loyalty. But in the wrong hands, these traits can be manipulated, turning pets into deadly weapons . Officers want to trace the owners of the dog, believed to be a man and woman, and have released a description. A spokesman said: 'The owners were described as a white man and woman. 'The woman was between about 5ft and 5ft 6in tall, in her 30s, with blonde hair and was wearing a pink top and had an orange jumper tied around her waist.

Rebecca Weiss, 50, headed out in the morning but failed to return home by the agreed time off 5pm, according to her husband Alan Weiss. Her clothes and other belongings were found near her BMW X5, which was parked at the Terennea resort on the Palos Verdes Peninsula, near Los Angeles, California.

A distraught mother screamed 'my baby, my baby' after her 18-month-old son was found dead in an apparent gas-related explosion that destroyed a house and injured 14 others. Toddler Rah-Quan Palmer was killed in the terrifying blast which took place just before noon on Tuesday in a Long Island suburb of New York City, reducing the building to a pile of wood splinters and rubble. The child's mother Christina Morgan, 23, was pulled from the rubble covered in blood. She sobbed as a police officer lifted her son's body from the remains of their home. Destruction: The home in Long Island, New York was completely destroyed after an apparent gas explosion. An 18-month-old boy died and 14 others were injured . Killed: Rah-Quan Palmer, 18 months, died in the huge explosion at a home in Brentwood, Long Island . Witness Maria Ayala, 54, told the New York Daily News: 'You could see blood on her ears and arms. Some neighbors brought the dad out, too. . . . I went to him. The skin was peeling off his arms. It looked painful. I could not look anymore.' The child's father Rashamel Palmer, 28, had tried to protect his son from the falling debris but was knocked unconscious, according to his uncle Leonard Knight. Mr Palmer posted on Facebook today: 'This pain is unbearable...please pray for me.' Seven people were inside the home on Prospect Drive, Brentwood at the time of the blast. All that was left after the explosion was a heap of wood, mattresses and children's toys. Shredded clothing could be seen hanging from a tree, 30 feet up in the air. The air conditioners in one neighbor's home were blown out and a window was knocked out of its casing. Brentwood Fire Department Inspector Robert Keane said the initial investigation indicated the explosion 'could be gas-related'. A . police official said there were two, 200-pound propane gas tanks on the . premises, but that no natural gas lines were present on the block. Carnage: The house was reduced to small shards of wood and other building material . The property had been illegally converted into a rooming house with eight bedrooms being rented out for $300-a-month . At the time of the explosion, a plumber was working on a leak in the basement.

The property had been illegally . converted into a rooming house with at least eight rooms, being rented . for $300 a month, according to Islip town spokeswoman Inez Birbiglia. Richard was fined $3,000 last year for the dangerous practice. The current tenants, distant relatives of Richard's wife, moved into the home in 2011 after a difficult resident, known as Duke, was forced to move out. Troubling remarks: Homeowner Marcel Richard forced a difficult tenant to move out in 2010 leaving comments on prayer websites saying he wanted to 'cleanse the place of all insanity' The situation came to light after homeowner Richard posted comments on prayer websites in November 2010. He wrote on ourchurch.com, that he wanted to 'cleanse the place of all insanity', according to the Daily News.

A couple in north-west India have been arrested for allegedly selling their newborn baby because they could not afford medical treatment for their sick toddler. Parents Sandhya Devi and Ashok Kumar are suspected of selling their baby to their neighbours in the Sri Ganganagar district of Rajasthan state for 40,000 rupees - roughly £460, or $700. The neighbouring couple, Vinod and Shakuntla Agarwal, have also been arrested and bailed. It is alleged they offered to pay for the child when they heard Mrs Kumar was pregnant. Ashok Kumar and Sandhya Devi were approached to sell their newborn son to raise money for medical treatment for their disabled toddler . The case only came to light when the . baby's parents complained to police that the Agarwals had not handed over all the money they were promised. The Kumars' baby boy was born on July 31 this year and handed to their neighbours four days later. The baby's older brother suffered a debilitating illness from birth and is disabled. His parents could not afford treatment and a middleman approached them to broker a deal with their neighbours. Ashok Kumar said: 'We had gone to the hospital just for my wife to have a check-up but a midwife, Madhu, approached us with an offer to give the baby for adoption. 'We desperately needed money for our older son's treatment and Madhu told us that the adoptive parents would pay 40,000 INR which would cover the medical bills. 'We were more than happy to see our paralytic child get medical help and walk so we agreed to give our new born up for adoption. 'But the adoptive parents took the baby when he was three days old but had only paid us 20,000 INR. Admission: Health minister Suresh Shetty revealed he's heard of Beed doctors feeding foetuses to dogs . 'They fraudulently completed the . adoption papers and then just disappeared, with the baby. That's when we . went to police for their help. 'We didn't sell our baby, we gave him for adoption. But now, I don't want to give him for adoption.' Sharwan . Das, Investigating Officer, said: 'The couple Ashok and Sandhya, had . taken money from their neighbours in exchange for their son. 'We came to know about the case when there was a problem about the money exchange. 'A . case has now been filed against all involved including the parents, . adoptive parents and the midwife. Five arrests were made. They have now . been released on bail. 'The baby was handed back to the mother after her bail release as he had become weak.' Police said they are investigating the roles of six other people in the case, including a government official. Sons are coveted in Indian society to the extent that last year's census in the state of Maharashtra showed a severe gender imbalance between girls and boys. Only 801 girls were born for every 1000 male births. Sex-selective abortion and ultrasound scans that are . carried out to determine a baby's gender are illegal in India. In May this year a charity discovered that some abortion doctors in the state were covering up selective infanticide by feeding female foetuses to dogs. Varsha Deshpande of Lek Ladki Abhiyan claimed her organisation had conducted a sting operation against Dr Sudam Munde in 2010, in which he openly talked about how he was aborting female foetuses and feeding them to his five dogs. Suresh Shetty, the public health minister for Maharashtra - India's second most populous state - also admitted he had heard of foetuses thrown to the dogs in Beed. Deshpande said: 'This is known to everyone in Beed, but the police are not taking action as Munde is influential.'","Neighbours allegedly agreed to pay 40,000 rupees - roughly the average annual wage in India .

Tragic: Teacher Jessica Philpott, 38, was found hanging in the grounds of a psychiatric hospital three months after inspectors expressed 'major concerns' that it was not safe for vulnerable people . Friends of a former teacher who was found hanging at a psychiatric hospital have criticised the Trust for failing to keep her safe. Jessica Philpott, 38, who suffered from Borderline Personality Disorder, had been a voluntary patient at Mill View Hospital in Hove, East Sussex, which had previously been reviewed over patient suicides. A jury returned a verdict that Miss Philpott died of hanging which was linked to her condition, but said they could not be sure she intended to kill herself. Yesterday, her close friends said that she should not have been allowed to die in a 'place of safety'which had a 'duty of care'towards her. The five-day inquest at Brighton Coroner's Court heard that the former assistant head of year was found hanging in the garden of the hospital. The garden had not been risk-assessed for ligature points and could not be seen from the main hospital because of its situation and because a light was not working. A Care Quality Commission report that identified 'major concerns' about the safety of vulnerable people because of the number of ligature points at the hospital also failed to include the garden. The inquest was told that the nurse most closely involved in her community care had contacted the hospital to warn them she was considering 'final acts'. Jude Godden, a community mental health nurse, told the inquest: 'She sounded to me even more final than she had sounded before.' But his warning was not passed on to the night staff responsible for her care, something other members of staff said should have happened. Brighton and Hove coroner Veronica Hamilton-Deeley said she was 'worried about the fact it hasn't been passed on... you knew she was in danger and you were right.' The jury also heard that Miss Philpott, of Brighton, had made two apparent attempts at self-harm that afternoon, but had still been able to get hold of a television cable which she used as a ligature. The inquest heard that one patient warned a nursing assistant on duty that night that someone was trying to hang themselves in the garden. The assistant found the ligature and cut it down, but did not associate it with Miss Philpott. Another patient warned nursing staff that a patient was trying to escape over the fence in the garden. Two members of staff found Miss Philpott in the garden but did not know about the incident with the ligature and so did not take further action after she insisted she was ok. Worrying: A report on Mill View Hospital, pictured, had identified that 'vulnerable people have unaccompanied access to environments where ligature points exist, placing them at risk of harm' The coroner paid tribute to staff who cared for Miss Philpott and said their attentiveness had 'shone through'. But consultant psychiatrist Dr Sabine . Munzinger said: 'When people are so infuriated and determined to do . something, no amount of observation can save them.' Yesterday, her close friend Justina . Percy said: 'Jess' death should never have happened. Yes, she engaged in . risky behaviour but that was part of her condition as was her . impulsiveness. 'I still find it hard to accept she died whilst in a place of safety where she was owed a duty of care. 'She was not kept safe and no amount of trying to explain this away takes away the tragic outcome.' Close friend Trudi Nicholas added: 'Jess shouldn't have died. She needed to be kept safe and this didn't happen.' Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation . Trust said it had implemented the 30 recommendations of an independent . review into the hospital which began after four patients died in 2010. The jury returned a verdict that Miss Philpott had died from the act of hanging, but that her intentions were 'indeterminable'. Helen Greatorex from Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are all so very sorry that Jess died as she did. 'The team supporting her over the years had come to know her well and were deeply saddened at her death. Their care and devotion to Jess were commended by the coroner. 'Our thoughts are with her family and those who loved her dearly.'","Jessica Philpott, 38, had made two .

The sickening details of a teenage girl's tortured death have been revealed in the autopsy report. Carina Saunders' dismembered body was found stuffed in a duffel bag and dumped behind a grocery store in Bethany, Oklahoma, on October 13 last year. The report, released on Wednesday, said the 19-year-old had a 'violent death' with someone trying to cut out a tattoo on her upper back so her body could not be identified. She was decapitated and her hands and . feet were missing - although it was unclear whether her body parts were . sawn off before she had died. The medical examiner had withheld details of the 19-year-old's death so that police could build a murder case. It . was believed she was killed . by a human and drug trafficking gang to intimidate female witnesses so they would . cooperate with the gang's demands. Jimmy Massey, 34, and Luis Ruiz, 37, were charged with the first-degree murder of the young woman from Mustang on July 23. The two men were being held in the Oklahoma County Jail without bail. Ruiz is a former elementary school teacher, according to his family, who later became deeply involved in the drug trade.

Tragic end: A makeshift cross marks the spot where the body of Miss Saunders was found in Bethany, Oklahoma . There is speculation that the tattoo is adopted by white women who like to advertise themselves for sexual relationships with black men. The tattoo is also taken by music fans of bands of the same name and has references in mythology. 'The body parts were wrapped with plastic wrap, a laundry bag and a duffel bag,' states the report, according to Newsok. There was prescription painkiller tramadol in the 19-year-old's system but the quantity was unclear. A witness told police last month that one of the men charged with Miss Saunder's murder . beat her, tied her to a table and tortured her by sawing off her left . foot. The suspect then tried to cut off the 19-year-old's right foot before the saw broke, it was claimed. According to a probable cause . affidavit filed in Oklahoma County District Court, Ruiz planned and . carried out the torture killing. In the affidavit, a woman named . Michelle Hanshaw told police she went to a house in the city with . Saunders and witnessed Ruiz 'physically beat Carina Saunders and then . tie her up'.

Coalition plans to impose a minimum price for alcohol could backfire as retailers will be encouraged to sell more cheap drinks, the Office of Fair Trading has claimed. The consumer protection watchdog has warned that if plans to impose a minimum 40p price per unit of alcohol are passed, it could have ‘unintended consequences’. It is concerned because extra money from the price increases would go back to retailers rather than being collected as a tax. Will it backfire? The Office of Fair Trading is concerned that any price increases from a cheap booze ban would go back to retailers rather than being collected as a tax . This could create an incentive for stores to promote  alcohol brands that cost them less to buy wholesale, giving them higher margins and generating easy profits. In written evidence to MPs, the watchdog said: ‘The OFT is concerned that the unintended consequence of this increase in profit may be to give retailers an incentive to sell more, rather than less, low-cost alcohol. ‘Retailers would gain additional profit for every unit of low-cost alcohol that they sold. ‘At worst, such an incentive could dull the effectiveness of the minimum price in reducing alcohol sales.’ Drink responsibly: The Government announced proposals to ban cheap alcohol in March after David Cameron became concerned about the violence caused by binge drinking . The OFT is also worried that the Government’s interference in prices could undermine the free market. It found similar price controls in France and Ireland meant households had a higher cost of living.

A Republican representative has said that women don't become pregnant if they are the victim of a   'legitimate' rape while explaining his anti-abortion views on TV. Todd Akin, a nominee for Senate in Missouri, also told the Jaco Report that it was rare for a woman to become pregnant after being raped because the 'female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down'. The GOP senate hopeful was explaining his no-exception rule when it comes to abortion. Scroll down for video . Controversial remarks: Rep Akin, known for his strict anti-abortion stance, said on TV today that it was rare for women to become pregnant after being raped . 'First of all, from what I understand from doctors, (pregnancy from . rape) is really rare,' the GOP stalwart told KTVI-TV. 'If it’s a legitimate rape, . the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.' He went on to say: 'But let’s assume that maybe that didn’t work or . something. I think there should be some punishment, but the punishment . ought to be on the rapist and not attacking the child.' Akin has served six terms and describes himself as Missouri's most conservative congressman. He is running against . Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill. After Akin made the remarks, Senator McCaskill tweeted: 'As a woman & former prosecutor who handled 100s of rape cases, I'm stunned by Rep Akin's comments about victims this AM.' McCaskill's campaign spokesman added: 'Akin's record is riddled with policies and votes that hurt women.' As Twitter buzzed with comments criticizing Akin's opinions, he quickly sought to backtrack. A statement from Akin read: 'In reviewing my off-the-cuff remarks, it's clear that I misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy I hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year.' Voicing his opinion: Rep Akin spoke to TV station KTVI in St Louis this morning . Opinions: Senate candidate Representative Todd Akin said that women were unlikely to get pregnant from 'legitimate rape' According to Talking Points Memo Akin voted in 1991 for an anti-marital-rape law. At the time, he queried whether the legislation might be misused 'in a real messy divorce as a tool and a legal weapon to beat up on the husband'. Akin was elected to the Missouri House of . Representatives in 1988. He is a vocal anti-abortion campaigner with no . exceptions for rape or incest. Akin's website bears the motto: 'Timeless principles for today's challenges'. He opposes embryonic stem cell research and stands firmly behind the right to bear arms. Akin has a history of stirring up controversy with his remarks. Last June, he said that TV network NBC's decision to cut the words 'under God' from a video clip of the Pledge of Allegiance was the work of liberals in the media motivated by a 'hatred of God'. He refused to apologize for the statement and clarified his remark by saying he did not mean that liberals hated God but 'public references of God'. The 65-year-old military veteran married wife Lulli in 1975 and the couple have six children.

The gold medallist and Tour de France winner said the popular talent show could not compare to  London 2012 in terms of gripping the nation. 'Let's not talk about the X-Factor,' he said. 'Compared to the Olympics, everywhere you . went the country was on a high, and as athletes it was phenomenal to see . that, then you see X-Factor and it's like, ""Oh God, everyone's got to . put up with that all winter now"".' Wigged out: Cycling hero Bradley has said he has no interest in appearing on Simon Cowell's X-Factor . His dismissal comes after insiders revealed that . the programme-makers are hoping to persuade the heroes of Team GB to be . guest mentors at the first live show. Contestants will be performing songs . with a sporting or winning theme such as Spandau Ballet's Gold, . Survivor's Eye Of The Tiger and David Bowie's Heroes. Unlike Wiggins, heptathlon golden girl Jessica Ennis was intrigued by the idea. She told ITV's Lorraine yesterday: 'This is definitely news to me but it sounds like a brilliant idea.

Dishonest: Pathologist Dr Freddy Patel could now be struck off for his post mortem of G20 victim Ian Tomlinson . The pathologist who examined G20 protest victim Ian Tomlinson may now be struck off after making a string of almost 70 errors during his post mortem, a medical disciplinary panel has ruled. Dr Freddy Patel was 'dishonest and misleading' when he found the newspaper vendor died of a heart attack after he had been hit by a police officer. Today his medical tribunal identified 68 failings, including the key fact that Dr Patel did not tell police that 47-year-old Mr Tomlinson suffered injuries that could have been consistent with a baton strike. Dr Patel’s fitness to practise was impaired, panel members said, and he acted with 'deficient professional performance' in his investigation when the father of nine was hit and pushed to the ground by Pc Simon Harwood during the G20 protest in the City of London in April 2009. An inquest jury found that Mr Tomlinson had been unlawfully killed but Pc Harwood was later cleared of manslaughter. Today the medical panel stated: 'The question of dishonesty is especially serious and the panel notes that you have previously been found to be dishonest in relation to your CV. 'Thus, the dishonesty found in Mr Tomlinson’s case is even more significant than it would otherwise have been.' Dr Patel carried out the first post mortem examination into the death and claimed Mr Tomlinson had died of coronary artery disease. The panel found that Dr Patel did not properly consider or comment on the fact that abdominal bleeding found on Mr Tomlinson could have caused his collapse and death. Upset: Ian Tomlinson's son Paul King and Julia Tomlinson have been left distraught by his death and she said today Patel 'misled everyone' They also found that the pathologist . did not adequately explain how Mr Tomlinson could have died from a heart . attack or properly consider any other possible non-natural causes of . his death. After receiving new evidence, Dr Patel . compiled a second post-mortem report but again made a series of . mistakes and incorrect conclusions, according to the panel. Today the Medical Practitioners . Tribunal Service, sitting in Manchester, highlighted how Dr Patel had . already been criticised at two previous panels in the past two years. It identified 68 failings in his handling of the Tomlinson case. Drunk: PC Harwood believed Mr Tomlinson, left, who was drunk at the time, was being deliberately obstructive during the G20 protests in April 2009 . Shove: Video footage shows Tomlinson being violently knocked to the ground . Fall: After being hit Tomlinson fell to the ground but got up, walked 75 yards before collapsing . Laid out: The 47-year-old later died in hospital from internal injuries . The police officer who was cleared of killing Ian Tomlinson during the G20 protests in London will face force disciplinary proceedings on September 17. Pc Simon Harwood was acquitted of manslaughter last month, but police watchdog the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) ordered that he should face the internal Metropolitan Police hearing in public. Scotland Yard confirmed that a gross misconduct hearing in front of a panel of three people including a senior officer and a lay person. It is expected to last up to four weeks. Harwood told jurors at Southwark Crown Court that he had used only reasonable force, and was cleared of killing the father-of-nine. Jurors in an inquest into the death had earlier returned a verdict of unlawful killing. The officer, 45, from Carshalton in Surrey, had a controversial disciplinary record before the fateful day when he came across Mr Tomlinson. A series of allegations were made against him over a 12-year period, and he was allowed to retire from the Met on medical grounds in 2001 despite unresolved disciplinary proceedings. Later, Harwood rejoined the force as a civilian worker, before becoming a police officer for Surrey. He was then allowed to rejoin the Met in 2004 as part of its Territorial Support Group, specialising in public order. His original conclusions were challenged when video emerged of Pc Harwood, 45, pushing Mr Tomlinson to the ground. Further . medical reports suggested that, in fact, he died from an injury to his . liver that caused internal bleeding and then cardiac arrest. The panel criticised Dr Patel, who is . suspended, for his 'closed mind set' in dealing with the case and said . he had 'deficiencies in the areas of observation, interpretation ... and . in the conclusions you draw'. They . found that Dr Patel had 'brought the profession into disrepute' and . that his integrity could not be relied upon. He also breached one of the . 'fundamental tenets of the profession' through his dishonesty. Panel chairman the Rev Robert Lloyd-Richards said: 'It is clearly in the interest of the general public that they should be able to have confidence in the coronial system and this confidence has been undermined by your failures. 'Having considered everything before it the panel has determined that your fitness to practise... is impaired by reason of misconduct and deficient professional performance in the case of Mr Tomlinson.' Mr Tomlinson’s widow Julia said today: 'The . incompetence and dishonesty of Freddy Patel helped Pc Harwood and gave . us an uphill battle for justice from the start. 'He misled everyone, saying that Ian had died of a heart attack when in fact he had died of internal bleeding. 'It’s good that people can see some of . the things we have been up against. Patel has a lot to answer for and I . would like to know why with all the good pathologists there are, he was . selected to do the first post mortem.' Dr Patel’s fitness to practice has also been found impaired in relation to a number of other cases, including the death of a victim of the so-called 'Camden Ripper'. He claimed that 31-year-old prostitute Sally White had died in 2002 from “natural causes” despite her injuries which included a bite mark and a head wound. Other botched cases include those of a four-week-old baby, a five-year-old girl and an elderly lady. The MPTS panel is now hearing submissions from the General Medical Council on what sanctions should be imposed on Dr Patel. They will also hear from his defence team before deciding whether he will be struck off.

Tim Blake-Powell, 51, who moonlighted as a pimp while working as a teacher, has been banned from teaching but could return to the classroom in three years . Blake-Powell was jailed for nine months in 2009, after admitting a charge of controlling prostitutes for financial gain.

However, he accepted a recommendation from schools disciplinary body the Teaching Agency that Blake-Bowell - who also uses the name Tim Smith- can apply to be restored to the Register in three years. In a decision issued on the Secretary of State’s behalf, Teaching Agency deputy director Alan Meyrick said: 'I have given this decision and the recommendations it contains very careful consideration. 'Mr Blake-Bowell has been convicted of a serious criminal offence. His behaviour therefore clearly brings the teaching profession into disrepute. He has failed to uphold the high standards required of the profession. The public need to have confidence in the standards of the teaching profession.

Turning to the period after which the decision can be reviewed, he continued: 'I support the recommendation that Mr Blake-Bowell be permitted to apply for restoration of his eligibility to teach after a three year period. 'This takes into account the seriousness of the offence, but also recognises the steps that Mr Blake-Bowell has taken towards rehabilitation.' The decision means that Mr Blake-Bowell is prohibited from teaching and cannot teach in any school, sixth form college, relevant youth accommodation or children’s home in England. He may apply for the Prohibition Order to be set aside, but not until 2015. If he does so, a panel will meet to consider whether the Prohibition Order should be set aside.

A teenage burglar who battered a 78-year-old man with a five-foot fence post was spared jail because his lawyer claimed he was terrified of prison - and then bragged about his sentence on Facebook only hours later. Luke Mansell, 18, of Telford, Shropshire, boasted about being able to remove his tag and take illegal drugs after he was given only a suspended sentence by magistrates. He walked free after claiming he had been acting in self-defence when he beat pensioner Arthur Ball, who had tried to stop him burgling a neighbour's home. Unrepentant: Burglar Luke Mansell, who was said to be terrified of going to prison, was given a suspended sentence and bragged about it on Facebook . During the sentencing hearing at Telford Magistrates' Court, Mansell's solicitor, Steven Meredith, said: 'For seven months he has been scared to his wits end about what is going to happen in this case. 'He is screaming out for rehabilitation, the youth offending service assert he has the ability to change, and I am certain you will not see him before these courts again.' But Mansell hid his fears in a Facebook message he posted shortly before the hearing, which read: 'Big fat joint before court judge best give me an orderr not a few months inside.' And only hours after his sentence was handed down, Mansell went on Facebook again to post: 'Im off tag woooo hip hip array and 12 month suspended sentence and supervision order 12 months.' Celebration: Posting messages as 'Luke Pukka Mansell', the burglar bragged about his sentence to friends on Facebook . Brag: Mansell told his friends he was 'so happy' that he could take off his electronic tag after being spared an immediate prison sentence . Messages: Mansell was said to be afraid of going to prison, but before the sentencing hearing he told friends he had a 'big fat joint' He also bragged of buying drugs paraphernalia online - and posted a picture of a bong, a device used for smoking cannabis, which he had ordered off the internet. Other messages posted by Mansell in the last seven months appeared to make light of his situation. Before previous court appearances, he made comments including 'court tomorra ooooooooo nooooooooooooo lol' and 'mr judge needs to be nice today lol'. After a court appearance in July, he even played a joke on his friends, pretending he had been sent to prison. He wrote: 'see you lot in 2 years lol'. Status update: Mansell wrote the message 'mr judge needs to be nice today lol' before a previous court appearance in July . Paraphernalia: Mansell posted a picture of a bong, a device used for smoking cannabis, on Facebook . The court heard that Mr Ball was hurt after he caught Mansell holding a laptop and clambering out of a neighbour’s home in Ketley Town, Telford, on January 13. Mansell grabbed a fence post and used it to strike the pensioner’s hip. Mr Ball was bruised and could only walk with the help of crutches after the attack. He was also unable to drive. Mansell admitted at a previous hearing causing actual bodily harm to Mr Ball and burgling the home of Anthony Edmunds. Thug: Mansell battered a 78-year-old man with a five-foot fence post during a burglary, but claimed he was acting in self-defence . Magistrates said it was a ‘serious offence’ which caused ‘grave harm’ to an innocent person, leaving them with no option but to impose a custodial sentence. But they decided to suspend the 16-week jail term for two years. Mansell was also ordered to pay £250 compensation to Mr Ball and will be on a supervision order for 12 months with a requirement to attend several courses. While on bail, Mansell had been on a strict curfew and electronically tagged preventing him from leaving the house between 7pm and 7am.

A plane that crashed into spectators at an air race in Reno last year bore modifications that weakened its structure and showed evidence that the pilot flew it beyond its limits, investigators said Monday. The National Transportation Safety Board . deemed the failure of a tail structure to be the probable cause of the . crash of the souped-up World War II-era P-51 Mustang fighter that killed . pilot Jimmy Leeward and 10 people on the ground at last year's National Championship Air Races in Reno. More than 70 were injured. Leeward . also was blamed for failing to fully document and test extensive . modifications to the aircraft before the September 2011 crash. Modified: The 'Galloping Ghost' P-51 Mustang had a series ill-tested changes that make it weaker, less stable and too fast . Crash: This is the split-second before the World War II-era plane crashed into spectators -- killing 10 people on the ground, as well as the pilot . Board member Robert Sumwalt said: 'If you want to go out and fly fast and try to win, that's one thing.' 'If . you're modifying an aircraft without fully understanding how the . modifications can affect the aerodynamics, you're playing Russian . roulette,' Sumwalt said. Structural modifications of the aircraft dubbed the Galloping Ghost made it lighter and reduced drag, according to the NTSB . report. But flight control modifications also made the aircraft less . stable. The NTSB found that an elevator trim tab malfunction created . aerodynamic instability that made Leeward's plane uncontrollable. High-resolution photos show the skin wrinkling and a the canopy separating the plane seconds before the crash, and NTSB investigators later found loose screws in the crucial tail assembly. At a board hearing in Washington, Chairwoman Deborah Hersman . blamed the 74-year-old Leeward for 'operating at the edge of the . envelope' without fully reporting and testing modifications to his . plane. Horror: More than 70 people were injured in the crash September 16, 2011, pictured a split-second after it occurred . Tricked out: The Galloping Ghost had its wings cut, its cockpit sheared down, the dorsal fuel tank removed and its tail clipped -- all in an effort to make it faster . Blame: Jimmy Leeward was faulted for not reporting or testing the modifications to his aircraft . Leeward was 'incapacitated' and probably became unconscious when gravitational . forces reached 17 times normal as the propeller aircraft -- flying faster . than it ever had before -- pitched skyward, rolled upside down and . slammed nose-first into the tarmac amid rows of box seats, NTSB . investigators found. The tail stabilizer fell from the plane during the . steep climb. NTSB officials say Leeward had perhaps one second to . respond, but the G forces on his body far exceeded the levels of human . tolerance. People can begin to experience loss of consciousness at 5G. With . races set to start September 12, the five-member panel has already issued . several preliminary reports and recommendations for the Federal Aviation . Administration and race organizers to improve safety. Some . recommendations were modified on Monday. Hersman noted that the board is an independent investigative and recommendation body, not a regulator. 'We make recommendations. It's up to others to implement them,' she said. 'They've done that.'

NTSB . officials say the 530 mph that Leeward reached during a qualifying race . was about 40 mph faster than he had ever gone before. His . age and physical condition weren't considered significant factors in . the crash, but Hersman was critical of Leeward's record-keeping and . reports of the modifications that he had made. 'He put that he was 59 . years old on the entry form,' the board chairwoman said. 'He was 74.' Anatomy of a disaster: This is a detailed map of the flight path and crash site of the Galloping Ghost.

It draws thousands every year to Reno Stead Airport, . where it features aircraft flying at speeds of over 500 mph sometimes . wingtip-to-wingtip around an oval pylon track. The crash spawned civil liability lawsuits against the pilot's family and mechanics and the host organization. Some . critics called for ending the event, but organizers pressed forward . with plans for this year's races amid promises that most NTSB safety . recommendations would be implemented. The National Air-racing Group Inc and the Reno Air Racing Association Inc . balked at requiring pilots to wear flight suits designed to mitigate . high gravitational forces. They said the expensive suits might prove too . bulky for cramped cockpits and too hot during competition. Insurance . premiums jumped from $300,000 last year to $2 million this year, but . the Nevada state tourism commission last month approved a $600,000 . sponsorship to help the Reno Air Racing Association Inc. meet a Sept. 1 . deadline for its final insurance payment.","Ten spectators were killed when Jimmy Leeward lost control of his WWII-era P-51 Mustang.

A couple only a year from their 50th wedding anniversary were killed while driving home from church after a U.S. Army private traveling the wrong way down a one-way street plowed into their car earlier this month. Teddy and Mary Ann Allison, 67 and 71 respectively, had just left Friendship Assembly of God Church on August 12 when their white Saturn was rammed by a Chevy Malibu driven by Pvt. 1st Class Khalil Sanders. The couple were taken to hospital in Colorado Springs, Denver in critical condition. Mr Allison, a retired Hewlette . Packard electronics technician died on August 15.

A Kansas couple pleaded guilty to murdering a mother of four, raping and torturing her in drug-fueled attack caught on tape and then dumping and setting her body alight in the woods. Richard D. Davis and Dena D. Riley, of Independence, Kansas, were sentenced on Tuesday to life in prison for murdering Michelle Huff-Ricci, the 36-year-old woman they suffocated in April 2006. The hearing in Clay County, Missouri, served as a formality as Davis is already on death row and Riley was given nine life sentences for the rape and torture of Huff-Ricci - in addition to rape, torture and murder convictions for another victim, Marsha Spicer, and a guilty plea for kidnapping and raping a five-year-old Kansas City girl. Triple tragedies: Richard D. Davis, 48, (left) is on death row and Dena D. Riley, 46, is serving nine life sentences for two rape and murder convictions, in addition to the rape of a young child . Grief and anger pervaded the court room, as Davis, 48, and Riley, 46, were paraded in to enter their pleas before the victim's family, in attendance to tell the court how the tragedy has left them devastated. 'As a Christian man, I want them to burn. I want them to go to hell,' Huff-Ricci's ex-husband, Matthew Lee, told WDAF-TV, after the hearing. 'It was wrong for them to kill someone. She was only 36. I mean, she didn't hurt nobody. She was so sweet,' said Stephanie Ricci, Michelle's now 17-year old daughter said about her late mother, echoing her father's wish, 'I want them to die.' The disgusting and terrifying rampage occurred in the spring of 2006, when Davis and Riley, high on meth, launched vicious attacks on two women, capturing the violence on video and storing the footage in their apartment. It . is not entirely known what connection the perpetrators had to Huff-Ricci but it is believed Huff-Ricci had agreed to sleep with them in exchange for meth. Using drugs to control the woman, . the pair allegedly kept Ricci as a sex slave for three days in late April, . subjecting her to rape, beatings, torture and choking. Fearing that she would tell police, the couple decided to kill her to keep her quiet after the torture. They drugged their battered victim and drove to Missouri to kill her and dispose of the body. Beloved mother: Michelle Huff-Ricci, 36, was raped, tortured and suffocated by Davis and Riley in April 2006 . Justice: Michelle Huff-Ricci's family wants justice for the perpetrators of the violent attack against the mother . of four . According to police, Davis attempted to strangle the woman with a rope in the woods but when that was unsuccessful he suffocated her. The pair poured lighter fluid on Huff-Ricci's naked body and then lit her on fire. Her family reported her missing but her charred body was not discovered until police discovered Davis and Riley's second victim, Marsha Spicer, later in May. Police began investigating the couple in May 2006, when the body of 41-year-old Spicer was found by fishermen in a shallow creek in Bates City, east of Kansas City. The second attack, around May 14, against Spicer occurred at the couple's apartment. Video footage, lasting more than two hours, show the couple violently attacking Spicer - who was subdued with duct tape around her wrists and over her eyes - beating, raping and then strangling the woman. 'I want them to die,' Michelle Huff-Ricci's 17-year-old daughter Stephanie (left) and her ex-husband Matthew Lee (right) both said of the crazed couple responsible for Michelle's death . When Spicer's body was discovered, . clues led officers to the couple but the pair evaded police and during an eight-day chase running from the cops, they kidnapped and raped a . five-year-old Kansas City girl. They were finally caught on May 25. 41-year-old Marsha Spicer was found dead in May 2006 . According to Huff-Ricci's mother, Sherry Ballew, her daughter had been an acquaintance of Marsha Spicer, who also had a meth addiction. Davis was given the death penalty after his August 2008 conviction for Spicer's suffocation death and the kidnapping, rape and torture of Huff-Ricci. Riley has been given nine life sentences after pleading guilty in Jackson County to the torture of both women and to Spicer's murder. Appearing in court on Tuesday, Davis, 48, was stoic as he heard his sentence read, simply stating, 'None of this should've . happened. I am sorry. It shouldn't have happened.' But Davis' comments offered little relief to the victim's family. 'I wanted them to jump over there and get that dude. It took my sons to . keep me under control. 'Cause she was the love of my life,' Michelle's ex-Matthew Lee said. Davis has a prior conviction for rape . and spent 17 years in prison before he was released in 2005, claiming . he had found religion and was ready to reform his ways. Riley, 46, appeared emotional in . court on Tuesday and dabbed tears from her eyes. She was full of emotion when the victim's family told the judge of the heartache the . victim's four children much endure. Death: 48-year old Richard Davis has been sentenced to death for the rape, torture and murder of two women . Life beind bars: Dena Riley, 46, has been given nine life sentences for her part in the sexual assault and murder of two women, in addition to the raping of a little girl in Kansas City . Riley had a long history of drug-use. 'She steadily talked about the drugs… . how she used it and how great it was,' a former coworker, who worked . with Riley at a local dog kennel before the crime, told the Kansas City . Star. 'She'd use anything. I don't think she was a pot-smoker, she was a needle freak. She also liked pain pills.' Meanwhile, the victim's family is attempting to move on and stay focused on caring for the children left behind.

Although the relay was about two hours behind schedule when the torch was lit from a miner's lamp just before 8.30am, organisers said they hoped to claw back the delay. A Locog spokesman said: 'A lantern lit by the unified flame will be carried by Paralympian, Chris Holmes, to City Hall for a celebration event this lunchtime. This flame will then travel to the stadium. 'Should the torch relay run late, this flame will be used to light the cauldron during the Paralympic Opening Ceremony this evening. The torch relay will continue to Stratford Park for the planned celebration. 'From there the relay flame will be transferred to a lantern and used as the back up flame during the Games.' Meanwhile Prime Minister David Cameron said the Games would change people's views about disability. He told Channel 4 News: 'I think they are going to to make the whole country incredibly proud. The Olympic Games made us proud but I think this will make us prouder still because you are going to see an extraordinary display of sport. 'We can be very proud that more Paralympians are taking part in more sports, in more stadia, watched by more people than at any time in the past. 'It's been a sell-out and that is, I think, a great story for our country and it will inspire a lot of people and change people's views about disability and that is absolutely crucial.' While temperatures will struggle to . get above 15C during the evening, the rain clouds will have disappeared . by 8.30pm, when the Games officially get under way. Helen Rossington, a forecaster for . MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'There . will be rain and showers throughout the day but it should be dry by the . time the ceremony starts. 'It might be chilly though compared to . how it was for the Olympics opening ceremony and there will be a brisk . south-westerly wind. But it won't be raining, which is the important . thing.

It was also revealed that G4S will play a bigger role in the Paralympics with an extra 3,000 workers available for the Games. This means the company will have up to 10,000 workers despite only needing 5,000 on the ground to prevent a humiliating repeat of the Olympics security fiasco. Nick Buckles, head of the firm, told the Daily Mirror: 'We are holding a buffer of staff every day to make sure that we can fulfil the contract.' The security company has also reported a £50million loss on the contract for both the Olympics and Paralympics. The band of rain will travel east, bringing showers behind it, with the most persistent downpours happening in the morning. During the day, temperatures will . reach a high of 20C in the south of England as the torch relay takes . place, with some sunshine between the showers. Despite much of the relay taking place under cover of darkness, thousands of people turned out on a clear and chilly night to watch its journey and cheer on the proud torchbearers. Working in teams of five, the torchbearers, both disabled and non-disabled, carried the flame from the stadium to the National Spinal Injuries Centre in the village, before bearing it through Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire to Watford and then on to London. The Paralympic relay made a pop stop off to visit Abbey Road in St John's Wood, north-west London.

Mr Helm, registered blind four years ago, was nominated as a torchbearer for his work with young people. Ria Amiraly, a special needs teacher from St John's Wood, said the atmosphere at the relay had been 'buzzing'. The . 28-year-old said: 'You don't get to see people talking every day to . each other like they did today, it was fascinating to be part of it.

'The Paralympics are more important to me because I work with special needs children, I think it's great that people with disabilities are going out there and taking part in sport, it's really important,' she added. Arvind Devalia, a 41-year-old writer and life coach, said: 'I had to be here, I live just round the corner. 'I have been waiting since 7.30 this morning and the torch went by fast, but it was well worth waiting for three hours. 'For me it was about the atmosphere and the camaraderie, people were so friendly and chatty and it was such a great vibe.'

This was the moment a hapless thief was caught trying to steal a florist's flower cart when he tried to make his escape - using a getaway horse. George Smith stunned onlookers when he approached the market stall in broad daylight and hitched his chestnut mare to the cart full of flowers. He then dragged the wheeled cart through the car park of a supermarket and over speed bumps before police finally caught up with him. Caught in the act: Police escort George Smith after he used his horse to steal a flower cart . Smith, 36, from Croydon in south London, was captured on camera making his bizarre getaway from the scene of the crime in neighbouring Carshalton, Surrey. The cart belonged to florist Christopher Tucker. The trade said his livelihood would have been lost had he not had the cart returned to him, a court was told. Smith was ordered to pay £210 after he pleaded guilty to one count of theft when he appeared at Croydon Magistrates’ Court. Prosecuting, Miss Elias told the court that despite the £2,500 cart being pulled over speed bumps, it was undamaged. She added: 'The cart had been in the family for 44 years. 'If the owner had lost it he said he would have lost everything, and had no way to make a living.' Defending Smith, Miss McClaren told . the court he had recently split from his wife and was struggling to find . work, carrying out odd jobs. The cart belonged to florist Christopher Tucker, who said his livelihood would have been lost had it not been returned (file picture) She said: 'On this day the reason he took the cart was he thought he could make something from it - thought he could use it. He has just separated from his wife, is living with his parents and is trying to get back on his feet. 'Unfortunately on this occasion he was silly enough to go and take this cart.' She said he was remorseful for what he had done. Delivering the verdict magistrates ordered Smith to pay a £110 fine, £85 in court costs and a £15 victim surcharge. Smith denied four charges of animal cruelty - forcing a horse to pull an unreasonable load, beating a horse, fitting an inappropriate harness and failing to provide parasite control. He will stand trial on these counts at Croydon Magistrates’ Court on November 2.

Authorities are searching for a suspect in the horrific gang rape of a Texas girl, after he apparently escaped from the courthouse during a break in the trial. Testimony continued despite the absence . of defendant Eric McGowen, 20, who is one of 14 adults accused . of having sex with the girl, who was 11 at the time, during a nearly three-month span two years . ago. Six boys also are charged in the case. Prosecutors and defense attorneys huddled briefly with District Judge Mark Morefield in front of his bench when defendant Eric McGowen, 20, failed to return to court following an afternoon break. The judge issued a warrant for McGowen's arrest, who was wearing a white shirt, jeans and tennis shoes, and increased his bail by $250,000. MCgowen's attorney thought his client was in the bathroom when he failed to return to his seat. The judge then told jurors the trial would go on without him. On trial: Eric McGowen, 20, pictured, is among 14 adults accused of raping the girl in the shocking series of attacks that took place in the small Texas community of Cleveland . The victim, now 13, broke down in court as she watched a video of one of the attacks. The girl, who authorities haven't named, is testified against McGowen in the first trial stemming from the shocking case, which involved the 'pack of animals' raping her sometimes two at a time, anally and with a beer bottle. McGowen is among 14 adults accused of sexually assaulting the girl in the series of horrendous attacks that took place in the small Texas community of Cleveland, 45 miles from Houston, over four months in 2010. He is charged with aggravated sexual assault of a child and faces up to life in prison if convicted. In court today, the middle school student, dressed in a plaid shirt and blue jeans and wearing a gold cross around her neck, described how McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. The girl said she was brought into . what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and . others took turns having sex with her. Missing: McGowen apparently escaped from the Liberty County Courthouse during a break in the trial . Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 . Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly. But she broke down on the witness stand when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks. She said the video, which several jurors turned away from, was of her being assaulted by another man charged in the case. She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.' 'Did the guys just take turns with you?' prosecutor Joe Warren asked. 'Yes sir,' the girl said. The girl seemed calm for most of the roughly one and a half hours she testified. She . mostly gave short answers to questions, often pausing to stare at the . floor or ceiling of the Liberty courtroom before responding. However, she had difficulty remembering names and exactly how all the assaults occurred, according to the Houston Chronicle. Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, police said . She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants . called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that . continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer. Asked by Warren if more than 20 males might have assaulted her that day, the girl responded, 'probably.' Jurors were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers found inside and outside the house in the November incident. McGowen’s attorney, Matthew Poston, questioned the girl for about six minutes, during which time he asked whether she twice told police early in the investigation that she never had sex with McGowen. The girl said she didn’t remember saying that. During opening statements on Wednesday, Warren told jurors he would present them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted to raping the girl. 'What took place to this girl was nothing better than a pack of animals attacking,' Warren said. Accused: Kelvin Rashad King, left, and Devo Shaun Green, right, were among those accused of raping the girl . Gang-rape: Xavier King, left, and Marcus Anthony Porchia, right, are among the 20 men and boys in the case . The prosecutor added that while the . girl may be seen smiling and even laughing at some times on the videos, . these individuals had 'duped, tricked and talked her into doing things . against her best interests,' according to the Chronicle. Authorities say the then 11-year-old was . assaulted at least five times between mid-September and early December . 2010 by a group of 20 males ranging in age from a middle school student . to a 28-year-old. The attackers filmed the girl being raped and took cellphone photos. Yesterday, . a videotaped police interview in which McGowen admitted he and eight . other men took turns having sex with the girl, sometimes two at a time, . was shown in court. Alleged attacker: Jared Glenn McPherson, pictured, is one of the men accused of raping the 11-year-old . In the video, which McGowen's lawyers . argued should not be allowed as evidence, the 20-year-old initially . denied ever touching the girl, but he later broke down and told . investigators he engaged in oral sex with her, according to the Houston . Chronicle. He also said one of the others penetrated the girl with a beer bottle. On Tuesday, Poston tried but failed to get the confessions thrown out, arguing that police improperly questioned McGowen. During his opening statement, Poston told jurors that the video evidence in the case doesn’t show McGowen having sex with the girl. 'The truth in this case is not always what it seems,' he said. He also said to jurors, regarding the video 'what you'll see will not be pleasant but the most unsettling parts do not contain McGowen having intercourse with this girl.' Today, Poston questioned how the girl learned McGowen's name since she was only aware of his street nickname 'Clyde.' She told him she believed the first time she heard that name was from school police who were questioning her about the rapes, the Chronicle reported. Two men and all six juveniles have pleaded guilty in the horrific case. A gag order has prevented prosecutors . and defense attorneys from commenting about the case. McGowen's . trial, which is being held in the nearby county of Liberty, is expected . to yield further details about the attacks in coming days. The investigation into the shocking gang-rapes began in 2010 after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a cellphone video that showed the 11-year-old being raped in an abandoned trailer. Those charged included two top athletes at the local high school and adults with criminal records. The case brought unflattering attention to Cleveland, a town of 9,000 people, after some residents suggested the girl was in part responsible for what happened, saying she wore makeup, looked older and wasn't properly supervised by her parents. Other community residents, as well as groups from outside of town, sharply criticised those suggestions. Two other adults have previously pleaded guilty, with one receiving a 15-year prison term and the other awaiting sentencing. Six juveniles who were charged also have previously pleaded guilty. They received 7-year prison terms, but their sentences were suspended and they were put on probation for that amount of time. Most of the adult defendants in the case face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child.","Girl was 11 when she was gang-raped multiple times over four month period in 2010 in Cleveland, Texas .

A woman at the centre of a massive search for two outlaw lovebirds snapped by a photographer has stepped forward to reveal her identity and lift the lid on her summer of love with her street artist boyfriend. Alexis Creque contacted the photographer who took the stunning picture through Facebook to admit she was the blonde-haired woman kissing her handcuffed beau, identified in a police report as 26-year-old Russell Murphy, as they were hauled to Manhattan Criminal Court last month. Mo Gelber, who specialises in street photography, snapped the well-timed smooch as he was walking past the court and entered the stunning result, entitled Last Kiss, in a picture contest. But officials overseeing the competition . told Gelber that he would have to get permission from the romantic . renegades if the photograph was to go any further in the contest. They found love in a hopeless place: Alexis Creque, 28, leans in to kiss her boyfriend, Russell Murphy, in this perfectly . timed snapshot after they were arrested . So he launched an plea on his Facebook page begging for the amorous couple to step forward - and a friend of Creque's told her she was the subject of a massive search. On Thursday, she messaged Gelber through Facebook to say she was the woman in the photograph. The 28-year-old has since revealed that she had enjoyed a whirlwind romance with her boyfriend of five months before their arrest on August 15. 'We had a crazy romance all summer,' she told the New York Daily News. 'It is like a movie.' Police had swooped on the couple as Murphy allegedly tagged graffiti outside the Milk & Honey lounge in Manhattan's Lower East Side just after midnight on August 16. 'I was just the look-out,' she insisted, . adding that they snatched a kiss as they were led to the court as 'we . knew that we were going to be split up once we got to Central Booking'. Who's that girl? Alexis Creque, pictured, . contacted the photographer to reveal she was the woman in the picture. She said she was arrested in Manhattan on August 16 while watching her boyfriend allegedly spraying graffiti outside an exlusive bar . The loyal lover said she would not . identify her 26-year-old beau as he is still behind bars in Brooklyn, . but an NYPD arrest report names the alleged ringleader as Russell Murphy, . 26. Thumbs up: Amateur photographer Mo Gelber is optimistic about his chances in the competition - and hopes the couple will sign the release forms . The report reveals Creque, who lives just three blocks from where they carried out their alleged crime, was charged with criminal mischief and making graffiti, while her boyfriend stands accused of criminal mischief, making graffiti, resisting arrest and possession of graffiti instruments. Now he has tracked the couple down, Gelber is on a race against time to sign releases from the sweethearts - as the competition has imposed a deadline of Saturday for the signatures. Creque, who has been let out of jail, said . she won't sign a release for the picture until her sweetheart, a well-known street artist, is also set free. But Gelber, 42, said he is hopeful they will give their permission when Murphy is let out - perhaps as early as Friday afternoon. 'We're hoping to meet altogether,' he told MailOnline. 'If they want to sign it that will be great as I'd really like to win the competition. If not, I will have no hard feelings.' Whether or not they agree to sign, he said he has printed them copies of the picture, which Creque has already admired. In her message, 'she said she loved it,' he added. 'Maybe they are proud of what they did. Maybe they think they did something artistic. The photograph captures that moment.' Even if they do agree to sign the release forms, he has the added complication of requiring permission from the police officers who also feature in the image. The task of tracking them down was slightly easier - he just zoomed in on their name badges, he said. When it came to tracing the lovebirds, he took to social media. 'Help!!!' he wrote on his Facebook page on August 17. 'Does . anyone know who this couple is? It is very important. I took this photo outside Manhattan criminal . court on Thursday August 16th. 'I . entered this photo in a major contest which I am about to win and need . them to sign a release form. When this photo wins the contest, they will . be in a very big movie with famous actors and directors.' The competition is bringing together famous faces who will try their hand at film-making for the first time. Further details will be announced during the results next week, Gelber said.

The number of drink drivers caught behind the wheel by police has soared in the last two years - with officers catching one boozy motorist who was just 14. The youth was among almost a dozen underage drivers suspected of drinking and driving over the past two years, along with eight 16-year-olds and two teens aged 15. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed the 14-year-old boy was stopped in 2010 by West Midlands Police. Meanwhile the oldest driver who faced prosecution for being under the influence of alcohol was 85. The force charged 3,094 people with drink-driving last year - 409 more than the 2010 figure of 2,685. The figures emerged after the force recorded a 19 per cent jump in the number of people failing breath tests during a month-long summer crackdown. Inspector Greg Jennings, who led the campaign, said: 'Drivers are putting themselves at risk of losing their licence, large fines and imprisonment as well as the guilt and shame of ruining the lives of others. 'The only safe level of alcohol to drive with is zero. 'Drinking any alcohol consumption will impair your ability to drive.' Police say there has been a worrying rise in the amount of underage drink drivers who are getting behind the wheel when they have had too much to drink (posed by models) Road safety campaigners said they were 'deeply concerned' at the rise in young drink drivers. Alice Granville, of the Institute of Advanced Motorists, said: 'It’s deeply concerning that there have been a number of recent drink-drive incidents involving minors in the West Midlands. 'Underage offenders need to be educated on the effects of drink driving and the dangers of being reckless behind the wheel.' Britain’s youngest drink driver was caught in 2005 in Thatcham, Berkshire, when police pulled over a swerving Vauxhall Corsa on Christmas day to find a 12-year-old girl at the wheel. Earlier this week it was revealed that businessman Arthur Kibble was selling controversial pills which claimed to help drivers beat police breath tests. He was condemned for marketing what safety campaigners called the 'dangerous and stupid' Alcopal tablets.","West Midlands police force charged 3,094 people with drink-driving last year - 409 more than the 2010 figure of 2,685 ."

A former Houston police officer is on trial for handcuffing a waitress, driving her to a secluded park and repeatedly raping her while on duty. In opening statements on Tuesday, the prosecution claimed the Houston Police Department had 'a rapist on its payroll,' referring to Abraham Joseph, 28, who is facing two counts of aggravated sexual assault against the woman, an immigrant from El Salvador. 'He had a badge, he had a gun, he had a marked patrol car and evil in his heart,' prosecutor Heyward Carter told jurors. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . On trial: Former Houston police officer Abraham Joseph, pictured, is on trial for handcuffing a waitress, driving her to a secluded park and repeatedly raping her while on duty . He accused Joseph of using his power as a . police officer to target someone who spoke little English and would fear deportation if she spoke up about the assault, which took place on January 2, 2011. The first witnesses to take the stand in the shocking case included the victim's aunt, Ana Riviz, and her partner Israel Ramirez, who described how the waitress came home crying and had bruises on her wrists, arms and legs, according to the Houston Chronicle. Denies charges: Joseph, pictured, claims the sex was consensual . They told jurors in Harris County courtroom . that the waitress said the officer handcuffed her outside her workplace . and drove her to an unlit park in southwest Houston where - still . cuffed - he raped her multiple times, including on the trunk of his . police cruiser. The couple said at first they didn't believe the distraught woman. 'I just never thought that a police officer would do that to a person,' Ramirez testified through a translator. They drove back to Townwood Park where she said it happened and found tyre tracks and body fluids, he said. But the family members debated whether to call police. 'She didn't have any legal documentation,' Ramirez said. 'The fear was that they'd come and say, 'look, you're lying,' then arrest her and deport her.' A number of hours after the attack, they finally called 911 and Ramirez returned to the park with an officer who recovered evidence. Meanwhile, Ana Riviz went to hospital with the victim, who is in her 20s. The waitress told police that Joseph picked up her and a man in the parking lot of the cantina where she worked but let the man out at a gas station before continuing on to the park. Joseph insists he isn't guilty of the alleged rape and defense attorneys claimed yesterday that the waitress consented to the sex. Trial continues: The woman, a waitress and immigrant from El Salvador, is expected to take the stand on Wednesday . 'Abraham Joseph was a police officer . and while he should have been doing his job and out patrolling, Mr. Joseph was having sex with someone who was not his wife,' defense . attorney Nicole Deborde said, according to ABC News. But she said Joseph didn't do 'anything that was not by agreement.' Deborde . added that the witnesses and the victim 'have a great deal to gain' for . their serious allegations as the woman has filed a lawsuit against . Joseph, according to the Houston Chronicle. She also said there were 'little things' that didn't add up in the case. Secluded park: Joseph allegedly raped the waitress in an unlit section of Townwood Park, pictured, in southwest Houston . Several other witnesses including Houston police officers testified on Tuesday. HPD patrol officer Vernon English was . one of the first responders to the call and reviewed photographs of the . tyre tracks and bodily fluids found at the park. He said he had trained Joseph, who . had been with the department for just one and a half years and was . relieved of duty the same day the alleged attack was reported. 'He was really quiet,' English said. 'I was one of the only senior officers to my knowledge he would have a conversation with.' Cruiser: The woman was allegedly raped multiple times, including on the trunk of Joseph's House Police Department cruiser, like that pictured . Prosecutors claimed Joseph used his position to target a vulnerable victim who spoke little English and would fear deportation if she reported the rape. But Carter said: 'Abraham Joseph made one mistake, just one: He underestimated (the victim's) bravery and her willingness to come forward.' The waitress is expected to take the stand on Wednesday to give her account. If he's found guilty, Joseph faces anywhere from five years to life in prison.","Former Houston police officer Abraham Joseph, 28, on trial for two counts of aggravated sexual assault .

But the International Paralympic Committee yesterday upheld the American team’s appeal and said she would be allowed to compete in the same ‘S6’ swimming classification as Simmonds. Simmonds became known as the darling of the pool at Beijing in 2008, when she won golds in the 100m and 400m freestyle at the age of just 13. Now 17, Simmonds, who has dwarfism, is hoping to defend those titles against Arlen, who broke both of her world records at the US trials in June. The American was paralysed in 2006 by a virus which affected her spinal cord and left her in a vegetative state for two years.

"By . Snejana Farberov . PUBLISHED: . 09:17 EST, 5 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 10:17 EST, 5 September 2012 . Phony: Elizabeth Hinojosa, 47, is accused of developing a scheme with her daughter in which she pretended to be a dentist and performed procedures on up to 100 unsuspecting patients . Officials in Oklahoma City are searching for two women who they say have been practicing dentistry for several years without a license, targeting mainly Hispanic illegal immigrants. Elizabeth Hinojosa, 47, and Monica Salazar Orozco, 28, identified as her daughter, were charged in absentia last Friday with felony practicing dentistry without a license. Hinojosa also was charged with one count each of forgery, medical battery and embezzlement.Arrest warrants were issued for both women, who remain at large. Hinojosa is believed to be in San Antonio, Texas, where she worked for a dentist until quitting Friday, according to Oklahoma Dentistry Board Executive Director Susan Rogers. Rogers said on Tuesday that as many as 100 adults and children are believed to have been victimized by Hinojosa and Orozco. ‘This is a Pandora's box,’ Rogers told NewsOK. ‘When we started this, we had no idea how big and bad it was.’ Officials said in a news release that Hinojosa was hired at two Oklahoma City area dental offices owned and operated by Dr Salam Ramadan as a Spanish translator and part-time dental assistant. Instead, the 47-year-old woman and her daughter, who have no known dental training, had allegedly come up with a scheme in which patients were given follow-up appointments set for times when the dentist offices were closed, according to officials. Scheme: Hinojosa was hired at two Oklahoma City area dental offices owned and operated by Dr Salam Ramadan as a Spanish translator and part-time dental assistant . The duo would then allegedly tell the patients Hinojosa was a dentist and would do the work at a lower price if they paid cash. It is believed that the women targeted undocumented immigrants since they would be more reluctant to file complaints if something went awry. Hinojosa allegedly performed dental extractions, fillings, bridges, root canals and other procedures. Investigators have identified 22 adults and children who had used Hinojosa’s services. Hinojosa, also known as ‘Dr. Liz’ to the victims, was a dental assistant and her daughter was a receptionist where the alleged crimes took place between September 2010 and May 2011, according to a probable cause affidavit filed with the charges. Stolen smile: Carroll Jarrett, of Andarako, said the two front teeth that Hinojosa had installed fell out when he bit on a piece of chicken . One of the pair’s alleged victims was Carroll Jarrett, of Andarako, who paid Hinojosa $6,000 in hopes of regaining his smile after he had lost his two front teeth in a bicycle accident years earlier. But when Jarrett bit into a piece of fried chicken on the Fourth of July, his two new teeth fell out. ‘It was gross,’ Jarrett told NewsOK. ‘I had two little bitty nubs where my smile was.’ The patient also said that Hinojosa installed braces for his teenage daughter, which came apart a short time later. When the Anadarko man returned to the office where he received treatment to complain, Hinojosa was nowhere to be found, and the dentist who was there had no record of his previous visit. Dr Ramadan, who hired Hinojosa and her daughter, said she was not aware of her employees' alleged crimes until she was contacted by officials. The director of the Oklahoma Dentistry Board said Ramadan is not suspected of any wrongdoing in the case. Dangerous ruse: Hinojosa allegedly performed dental extractions, fillings, bridges, root canals and other procedures on patients, one of who contracted hepatitis C . Rogers said the dentist did not speak any Spanish and relied on Hinojosa and/or her daughter to translate for all patients during procedures and to set appointments. But the two women allegedly went a step further, scheduling appointments after hours and forwarding office calls to their personal numbers. Rogers said she is concerned about the health of the victims. At least one unidentified patient has contracted hepatitis C following a dental procedure performed by Hinojosa.","Elizabeth Hinojosa, 47, worked at two dental offices as a Spanish translator and part-time dental assistant .

The White House released a photo of first daughters Malia and Sasha Obama sitting on a couch with their father as they watched their mother give her moving convention speech last night. While the image of the threesome closely huddled together on the couch is undeniably heart-warming, even more striking is the degree to which the two young girls have grown over the past four years. The two daughters look like true teenagers four years after they were introduced to the world's stage during Mr Obama's first presidential campaign. This official White House photographs shows US President Barack Obama and his daughters, Malia (left) and Sasha watch Michelle Obama on television in the Treaty Room of the White House on Tuesday night . Last night four years ago: The two girls joined their mother on stage at the convention in Denver after her speech in 2008, but they were unable to do the same this year because it was the first day of school . 'Hi daddy!' They all waved to their father who was watching from Kansas City at the time . Back then: Malia (left) and Sasha (center right) were only 10 and 7 years old respectively when they appeared at the Democratic National Convention in Denver in 2008 on the night their father accepted the nomination . During the initial campaign, Malia was only 10 and Sasha, whose real name is Natasha, looks like a baby as she was only seven years old. With two summer birthdays- Sasha's in June and Malia's on the fourth of July- they now have yet another year under their belts, and they are starting to truly look like the young ladies that they are. In last night's photo, both girls were wearing skinny jeans, though they both took different approaches to the popular style. Malia sported a light blue pair with a white and grey blouse while Sasha snuggled up with a faded pair that almost appeared acid washed. She completed her convention night look with a striped tank top and collection of various bracelets. The two girls were unable to join . their mother in Charlotte on the night of her speech- which has received . almost universal praise- because it was their first day of school. Sasha is now in sixth grade at Sidwell . Friends School, which they chose to attend once their father was . elected and they moved to Washington, D.C. Color coordinated: On election night 2008, it was clear that someone else picked out the girl's outfits. More recently, it appears that the girls have had more of a say in their attire as they begin to experiment . Most changed: While both girls have obviously . matured, Sasha, who wore peach at the inauguration (left) and was only 7 . when she moved into the White House, looks much older now (right) Vacation time: This past Christmas, in 2011, the first family traveled to their father's home state of Hawaii . Parental pride: White House photographer Pete Souza captured this moment last night in the Treaty Room . Malia just had her first day of high school on Tuesday, reaching a milestone in her education thus far. President and First Lady Obama sat down with People magazine during a campaign stop towards the end of August and at that time they said how there was a lot to think about in terms of back-to-school preparations and Malia's transition to high school. 'She's going to be great. The truth is my girls, they don't seem to have all the flaws I had when I was their age. They're just good kids- smart, hardworking, kind, and respectful. They'll adjust really well,' Mr Obama said. Michelle then corrected him and said that he shouldn't rush Sasha to grow up quite yet, teasingly saying 'she's the baby'. 'She's going through her own transistion into young ladyhood. We pretend she's a baby. Except she's grown about a foot,' he responded. While it is fair to assume that they would have liked to have their Mom-in-chief home yesterday afternoon for the start of school, the close bond they show with their father in the relaxed photo released after Michelle's speech was not simply made up for the cameras. First Lady Michelle Obama addresses the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., on Tuesday, September 4th . All smiles: U.S. President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama like to stay home with their daughters Malia, pictured left, and Sasha, right, rather than go out .

Loving dad: Obama, pictured with his daughters, Malia, left, and Sasha, far right, helps with homework at the White House . It is well-known that when Mr Obama is in or near Washington, he always tries to be home for dinner with the girls at 6.30pm. In her speech last night, Mrs Obama confirmed that, saying that he enjoys 'strategizing about middle school friendships' with his daughters. His priority last night, however, was keeping a straight face during her emotional and personal speech. 'I'm going to be at home, and I'm going to be watching it with our girls. And I'm going to try not to let them see their daddy cry. Because when Michelle starts talking, I start getting all misty,' he said at a campaign event earlier that morning.","Pictures show how much Sasha, 11, and Malia, 14 have changed since their father took office four years ago .

Parti Quebecois leader Pauline Marois is removed from the stage by police as she declares victory to supporters in Montreal on Tuesday . A suspect thought to be the gunman is arrested by police outside the Parti Quebecois victory rally in Montreal . Parti Quebecois quickly exited the stage after the deadly shooting . Marois, who has just been elected . premier of Quebec, wants the French-speaking province to secede from . Canada - and probably the Commonwealth too. Police have revealed that she was the target but have not disclosed the gunman’ s identity. The shooting has highlighted the . troubled relationship that Quebec has with the rest of the Canada which . has grown rancorous in recent years. Marois inspires particularly strong . feelings as she has vowed to ban government workers from wearing . religious clothing like the hijab and stop French speaking people from . going to English speaking colleges. Some have even been calling for the outgoing Quebec Premier Jean Charest, a federalist, to be murdered and dumped in a car boot. Marois is surrounded by police following a security breach as she returns to the stage to address supporters . Parti Quebecois Leader Pauline Marois declares victory . The attack began on Tuesday night as Marois was speaking at a concert hall in Montreal to celebrate her win in the polls. As the commotion broke out she was . grabbed by plainclothes police with a concerned look on her face as she . said: ‘What’s going on?’ Montreal police Commander Ian . Lafreniere said that the gunman set off a Molotov Cocktail at the rear . door after using it to enter the building. The 48-year-old man who was shot dead . has not been identified and the victim who survived, aged 27, is still . in hospital, but is no longer in a critical condition. A third person, a man in his 30s, had to be taken to hospital suffering from shock. The suspect is from Quebec but police are not sure if he is an anglophone or francophone as he was using both languages. Caught the gunman: The 50-year-old unidentified man was caught by police. His motive was unclear but while police dragged him away he yelled in French: 'The English are waking up!' Police said that the gunman lit a fire behind the Metropolis Theatre before he was arrested . One dead: Police cordon off the rear outside an auditorium where a gunman shot and killed at least one person during the Parti Quebecois victory rally . Detectives have searched his car and . interviewed witnesses but have not yet spoken to the shooter and refused . to speculate as to his motives. The reaction in Canada has been one of . shock and in a statement translated from French Marois said: ‘My . thoughts go out to the family and friends of the deceased. ‘As a result of this tragedy, all Quebecers who are grieving today in the face of such senseless violence’. A statement issued by Canadian Prime . Minister Stephen Harper’s office said: ‘We are disturbed by this . violence and our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.’ Police on the scene: It was not clear whether the gunman intended to shoot Ms Marois whose party favours separation for the French-speaking province from Canada . Quebec first elected a separatist . government in 1976 and has since repeatedly argued with the rest of the . country, which speaks English as its first language. Parti Québécois’s win against the . Liberal incumbents means that a separatist government is back in power . in the province for the first time in a decade. If Quebec seceded from Canada it is . unlikely it would remain in the Commonwealth due to the hardline . attitude of Marois and her colleagues. As a nation however, Canadians think . well of the Royal family and during their visit to the country last year . after their wedding, Prince William and Kate Middleton were given a . very warm reception. The people of Quebec rejected the last separatist referendum in 1995, although by a small margin.

At least 50 million Americans were unable to afford food at some point during last year and almost 17 million repeatedly ran short, forcing them to skip meals and cut back on daily essentials, alarming new figures reveal. Women living alone, single-parent families and Black and Hispanic households were among those hit the worst. Southern states saw the greatest food crises, and residents of inner cities nationwide suffered shortages. The Department of Agriculture said in a report that about 5.5 per cent of American households, or nearly 17 million people, suffered 'very low food security' last year, a rise of 800,000 over the previous year. The food-security report was released one day after the government said that a record 46.7 million Americans were enrolled for food stamps in June, up by 173,000 in May. High unemployment and slow growth since the deep 2008-2009 recession has driven enrollment in food stamps, the major U.S. anti-hunger program, to record levels. The cost of food aid to the poor is an election-year issue, with Republicans calling for large cuts in food stamps and Medicaid to help reduce the deficit. Democrats say the cuts are too deep. This year is likely to be even more problematic for hunger prevention because jobless benefits are running out for tens of thousands of long-term unemployed workers, said Jim Weil, head of the anti-hunger group Food Research and Action Center. The overall food-insecurity rate for individuals was 16.4 percent, almost unchanged since 2008, when it surged to the highest levels since the Agriculture Department began monitoring food security in 1995. 14.9 per cent of households were food insecure. 14.9 per cent of American households were food-insecure in 2011, or 16.4 per cent of individuals . Hungry families: At least 50 million Americans were unable to afford food at some point during last year . Food-security issues were greatest in . the South, in inner cities across the nation, in families with a single . parent, in Black and Hispanic households and in households with . children. Mississippi and Arkansas were the states with the highest rate at 19.2 percent, and North Dakota was lowest at 7.8 per cent. Almost everyone who experienced very low food security said they ran short of food and didn't have the money to buy more. Some 97 per cent said they cut back on the amount they ate or skipped a meal, while 91 per cent said it happened often throughout the year. Nearly half said they lost weight because they did not have enough to eat, according to the report. People who regularly go without food because they can't afford it are considered to suffer 'very low food security'. The highest percentages tend to be in southern states and inner cities. Arkansas was the worst offender with 7.6 per cent of residents on very low food security. In Alabama and Mississippi there were 7.1 per cent on very low food security. 7 per cent of the Oklahoma population fell into the category. Missouri had 6.7 per cent in the very low bracket. In Kentucky it was 6.6 per cent. Maine and Texas were both on 6.5 per cent. In Ohio, Georgia and Tennessee 6.4 per cent of people suffered very low food security. People who on occasion go without food were deemed to suffer 'low or very low food security'. Arkansas and Mississippi had 19.2 per cent on low or very low food security. In Texas there were 18.5 per cent. Georgia had 17.4 per cent. In North Carolina 17.1 per cent of people were on low or very low.","Almost 17 million American citizens repeatedly ran short of food last year .

Claims: Jamie Kuntz says he was kicked of the North Dakota State College of Science football team for being gay . An 18-year-old freshman linesman has claimed he was kicked off a college football team for kissing his boyfriend, 65, in a press box. Jamie Kuntz was told he was dismissed because he lied about his actions, but he believes the real reason was because it was a gay kiss. He has since left North Dakota State College of Sciences in Wahpeton which he attended on a partial football scholarship. North Dakota State College of . Sciences in Wahpeton acknowledges Mr Kuntz was disciplined by the team, but . says it wasn't because he is gay. Football coach Chuck Parsons told Mr . Kuntz in a letter that he was removed from the team for lying about the . kiss. Mr Kuntz said he and his Boyfriend were in the press box at the game against Snow College in . Pueblo, Colo., over Labor Day weekend. Mr Kuntz was videotaping the game for . the team. His Wildcats were down by more than 40 points when 'the kiss . just happened,' he said. The team would eventually lose 63-17. 'People around here aren't exposed to . it,' Mr Kuntz said of homosexuality. 'People expect gays to be flamboyant, . not football players.' A teammate apparently saw the kiss . and told coaches, Mr Kuntz said. When Mr Parsons confronted Mr Kuntz on the bus . ride back to North Dakota, he told him the man he kissed was his . grandfather. 'I lied,' Mr Kuntz said. Later, he felt guilty about lying and came clean to his coach. In . a Sept. 3 dismissal letter Mr Parsons . told Mr Kuntz he was being ousted from the team under the 'conduct deemed . detrimental to the team' category outlined in guidelines in the team's . player's manual. Mr Parsons specifically noted the manual's section on . 'lying to coaches, teachers or other school staff.' Dismissed: Jamie has since left North Dakota State College of Sciences in Wahpeton which he attended on a partial football scholarship . 'This decision was arrived at solely on the basis of your conduct during the football game; and because you chose not to be truthful with me when I confronted you about whom else was in the box with you,' Parsons wrote. 'Any conduct by any member of the program that would cause such a distraction during a game would warrant the same consequences.' Mr Kuntz doesn't believe he was dismissed just for lying. 'I know if it was a girl in the press box, or even an older woman, nothing would have happened,' he said. 'If it was an older woman, I would have probably been congratulated for it from my teammates.' School officials said that they were investigating whether this was the first such instance of someone being kicked off the football team for lying. John Richman, North Dakota State College of Science president, said other players have been kicked off the team for various reasons, though he couldn't say whether any before had been booted specifically for lying. Mr Richman said he believes Mr Kuntz's case was handled 'fairly and consistently' by the athletic department. 'I'm very confident that with the information that's been provided to me by our football coach, Chuck Parsons, by our athletic director, Stu Engen, that the thought process, the facts that were reviewed, have led them to an appropriate and the right decision in this case,' Mr Richman said yesterday in an interview at the college. Mr Kuntz said he told his mother that he was gay at the same time he told her he was kicked off the team. 'I'm struggling with it,' said Rita Kuntz, choking back tears. 'I love Jamie and I'm proud of him, but I know what the school did was wrong.' Mr Kuntz said he met the man online more than a year ago. Kuntz said the man, whom he would not identify, lives in Colorado and the two have met there a few times in recent months. As far as his football career, Mr Kuntz says he's not giving up. He may pursue it as a walk-on at another university outside North Dakota.

A 24-year-old salon manager was shot dead in the parking lot in front of her business, apparently at random, in what police are calling a mystifying murder. Authorizes said that the gunman, identified as Tyrone Leeon Smith, 38, took his two young children from a baby sitter's home at gunpoint Tuesday afternoon, then shot dead Cost Cutters manager Amanda Connors before killing himself inside the hair salon. After a brief standoff, Smith released the children and four employees — one of whom was the children's mother — after entering the Cost Cutters salon that sits in a strip mall along Sioux Falls' busiest street about 1:30 pm, according to authorities. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Amanda Connors, pictured, was found shot dead in her SUV outside of the salon where she worked . Unknown connection: Connors, pictured with an unidentified friend, worked at Cost Cutters salon; authorities are trying to discern how she knew her killer . The employees reported hearing a gunshot as they were leaving the building, Police Sgt Loren McManus told the Associated Press. Sgt McManus said it didn't appear that Smith wanted to hold the employees or the children hostage, but officers already had discovered Cost Cutters’ manager Amanda Connors inside her red sedan, dead from a gunshot wound. McManus said he wasn't sure what Connors' relationship was to Tyrone Smith, other than being a co-worker of his children's mother. Court records show Smith was released from the Minnehaha County Jail on Monday after pleading not guilty to a domestic assault charge against the mother, who was in the salon, the Argus Leader reported. The mother had taken out a protection order against Smith Monday morning, asking that he be barred from coming within 500 feet of her, their children, their shared home or the day care their children attended. Connors, who was in her early 20s, was 'absolutely a sweetheart. She could light up a room,' said friend Jarod Smith. He told The Associated Press that he met Ms Connors about three years ago, when the two worked at a Sioux Falls restaurant. Shot dead: Police in Sioux Falls responding to an accident report found Connors dead in her red sedan in the parking lot of Cost Cutters . 'She was very personable and someone you could talk to about everything and anything,' added Smith, who is not related to the suspect. Tuesday's tragic chain of events began shortly after 1pm, when police said Smith showed up at the home of his children's baby sitter and took the children by gunpoint. About five minutes after the baby sitter called authorities, police received a call about a car accident about two miles away in the salon parking lot. Shortly after that, police got another call, this time about a man holding women and children hostage in the salon. Businesses around the salon were evacuated and a nearby middle- and high-school complex was locked down for hours. The standoff lasted until nearly 4pm, when a SWAT team that entered the building and discovered Smith had died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, McManus said. Hold up: For a brief while, Smith had held hostages at the salon; an officer points directions with the SWAT team visible in the background . Heading out: A SWAT team member walks a police dog out of a Cost Cutters hair salon after officers entered and found Smith dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound . Retiree Ron Goergen, 56, said he was shopping in the plaza's thrift store when a store manager told shoppers to leave immediately. And Gene Luke had just finished lunch at a pizza place and was walking to his car when officers swarmed in, preventing him from leaving the parking lot. 'They just said, 'Keep walking,' ' said Mr Luke, 44. Mr Luke said when he was walking, he saw two kids being carried out of the salon by some women. Police said the children were unharmed, taken into police custody and later released to their mother.","Tyrone Leeon Smith, 38, kidnapped his children from babysitter at gunpoint .

A woman with eyes like 'fireballs' was locked up today after stabbing her boyfriend six times in a drink-fuelled frenzy. Caroline Humphries, 48, from Homerton, East London, was jailed for 16 years after she plunged a knife into Chris O’Connor’s side and back. He desperately tried to protect himself but he was left lying in a pool of blood in the unprovoked attack at her home, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. Humphries, who has been locked up . twice before after attacking her lovers, denied wounding Mr O'Connor . with intent. She claimed she acted in self-defence. Caroline Humphries, 48, pictured, from Homerton, East London, had eyes like 'fireballs' when she stabbed her boyfriend Chris O'Connor . Humphries was convicted by a jury on July 17. But she was cleared of two counts of causing actual bodily harm after two further alleged attacks on Mr O'Connor. Jailing Humphries, Judge Martyn Zeidman QC, said: ‘In drink, you are a very, very dangerous woman and there is absolutely no doubt you need to be put away in prison for a very long time.' ‘That’s to punish you, to protect others and to demonstrate that domestic violence is not acceptable.' ‘There is no distinction between it being a man on a woman or a woman on a man. All domestic violence has to be taken very seriously.' ‘Your wrongdoing falls into the most serious category of offending.' ‘This was a sustained attack upon your boyfriend with a knife in which you stabbed him a number of times.' ‘As he said in his statement, you were out of control and your eyes were like fireballs.' ‘You made such a big error of judgement in pleading not guilty to this offence.' ‘There is no substance whatsoever in your dishonest suggestion of self-defence.' ‘Hurt and injury are not limited to physical matters - just think what you have done to this man.' ‘He says he feels his life has changed for the worse and he has flashbacks. This has also exacerbated his drinking problem very severely.' ‘The most significant aggravating feature is you have previous convictions for violence that are in a worryingly similar context.’ Humphries has been jailed twice before for stabbing lovers, Snaresbrook Crown Court, pictured, heard . In 2004, Humphries was sent to jail for 30 months after stabbing her partner Paul Owen. A year later, she was sentenced to three years after puncturing her former lover Robert Irvin’s chest and slashing his face. Humphries was also charged with attempted murder in 1999 after she allegedly stabbed another lover three times in the neck, the court heard. But the charges were dropped after he claimed he had ‘fallen against a fence’. Judge Zeidman warned Humphries: ‘The risk of you offending is so high in relation to serious offences that you do qualify for an indeterminate sentence.' ‘But I have reached the conclusion that if the sentence is long enough, there will be a long period of licence that will be sufficient to protect the public on your release.' ‘There will be a sentence of 16 years in prison, it means you will serve eight years then be released on licence.' ‘But if you put a foot wrong, you will be straight back inside.’ 'If you ever do this again you are likely to receive a life sentence.’","Caroline Humphries, 48, from Homerton, East London, jailed for 16 years after knifing Chris O'Connor .

Guilty: Azhar Ahmed's facebook comment following the death of six soldiers was found to be 'grossly offensive' A 19-year-old's Facebook status that 'all soldiers should die and go to hell' after six British troops were killed by an explosion in Afghanistan has been found to be 'grossly offensive' by a court. Azhar Ahmed, now 20, admitted posting the status update after reading about the deaths of the soldiers in March. The six soldiers had been killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) two days earlier in the deadliest single attack on British forces in Afghanistan since 2001. Ahmed, who admitted writing the message but denied that it was grossly offensive, was founding guilty of sending a 'grossly offensive communication'. The message read: 'People gassin about the deaths of Soldiers! What about the innocent familys who have been brutally killed. 'The women who have been raped.The children who have been sliced up! 'Your enemy’s were the Taliban not innocent harmful (sic) familys (sic). 'All soldiers should DIE & go to HELL! THE LOWLIFE F****N SCUM! 'gotta problem. go cry at your soldiers grave and wish him hell because thats where he is going.' Huddersfield Magistrates Court heard Ahmed immediately started to receive critical comments on his page and realised the second half of his post was 'unacceptable'. But he denied it was 'grossly offensive' - telling a district judge he thought it would have been 'upsetting' and caused 'distress'. Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, of 1st . Battalion The Duke of Lancaster's Regiment, was killed alongside . Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, Private Anthony Frampton, 20, Private . Christopher Kershaw, 19, Private Daniel Wade, 20, and Private Daniel . Wilford, 21, all of 3rd Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment. Ahmed, from Ravensthorpe, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, told the court he was only trying to make the point that many other deaths in Afghanistan were being ignored. He said he had no idea it would cause so much upset. Killed: The six soldiers (from top left) Sergeant Nigel Coupe, Corporal Jake Hartley Private Anthony Frampton, Private Christopher Kershaw, Private Daniel Wade and Private Daniel Wilford . Tension: Demonstrators stood outside Huddersfield Magistrates Court as Ahmed received his verdict . Ahmed told the court: 'I didn’t intend to insult them at the time. When I read back on it, that’s when I realised I had actually insulted and upset a lot of people.' He said he replied with apologies to many people who commented on his page and when some told him they had lost relatives in Afghanistan he realised how serious it was. He admitted: 'That’s when I realised it was unacceptable for them to see something so upsetting and distressing, to write something like that.' Earlier Niall Carlin, prosecuting, said the parents of one of the six soldiers who died in the incident saw the posting, which was copied around the internet. Mr Carlin also read the statement of one woman, who went to the same school as Ahmed, who had lost two friends on duty in Afghanistan and was extremely distressed by what he wrote. On guard: A strong police presence attended Huddersfield Magistrate Court during the hearing . Mistake: Azhar Ahmed told the court he hadn't menat to insult people and later realised his statement was unacceptable . The prosecutor also said the biscuit firm Fox’s was inundated with complaints after Ahmed said he worked there on his Facebook profile. Mr Carlin said the firm was so concerned about complaints and possible damage to their brand, it was discussed at the top level of it’s parent company. He also explained to the court how another man, with the same surname as Ahmed, was plagued with offensive calls and people waiting outside his home after his address was wrongly linked to the defendant’s posting on the internet. The court heard the man had to be given special police protection. In court, Ahmed was bailed after the district judge told him she wanted a pre-sentence report prepared. He is due back in court for sentence on October 9. After the trial, Ahmed left the court by a side door without saying anything and sped off in a waiting car past a number of police officers. He avoided a demonstration of about 30 people at the front of the court building, some wearing EDL branded clothing and one flying a union flag. The demonstrators were heavily outnumbered by police. Earlier, the district judge heard how Ahmed posted his message two days after the deaths of the soldiers.

A poll for the You-Gov Cambridge conference reveals 58 per cent of voters respect the 48-year-old, the Guardian reported. By comparison just 46 per cent respected Baroness Thatcher, who was Prime Minister for 11 years, winning three general elections. David Cameron – who has been dogged by headlines that Mr Johnson is after his job – is respected by only 37 per cent of voters. George Osborne, the Chancellor of the Exchequer who was booed during the Paralympics, is languishing on just 16 per cent. Critics will point out that Mr Johnson has never held a major, national political job. They have suggested Mr Johnson is not a serious figure, whose appeal is limited to London.

The poll results will heighten speculation that Boris Johnson (left) is positioning to take over from David Cameron as Tory leader . But the poll shows he has appeal everywhere - except for Scotland - with more than half of people in the Midlands and northern England saying he has their respect. In the net score – subtracting the people with no respect for each politician from the proportion who do respect them – Mr Johnson scores +25 points. George Osborne is on -53 per cent, just behind Nick Clegg on -52. Former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown is on -33, two points lower than Tony Blair’s 31.

Twenty years ago, at another private villa in the South of France, Sarah Ferguson found herself in the paparazzi viewfinder. Lying topless on a sun-lounger, she was photographed having her toes sucked by her Texan financial adviser, John Bryan. Royal target: Sarah Ferguson, right, was photographed topless having her toes suck by her Texan financial adviser John Bryan, left, 20 years ago . Publication of the images spelled the end of her marriage to the Duke of York and signalled the start of a frenzied pursuit of the royals by French photographers, which culminated in the death of Diana in Paris. A year after the infamous Fergie snaps, the French magazine Paris Match and a photographer were ordered to pay her and Bryan the relatively trifling sum of £84,000 for taking the poolside photographs of them without their permission. End of marriage: The publication of the infamous photos spelled the end of Fergie's marriage to the Duke of York, right pictured together on their engagement day in 1986 . Snapped naked: A naked photo of Prince Charles at a friend's chateau near Avignon was published in Paris Match and German paper Bild in 1994 . Then, in 1994, it was the turn of the . Prince of Wales. A photograph of him naked on holiday at a friend’s . chateau near Avignon was published in Paris Match and the German paper . Bild. It showed Charles standing at a window of his room after going . swimming with only a white towelling robe thrown over his shoulder. Other pictures in the French magazine showed the Prince on a sun-lounger in swimming trunks and dark glasses. The prince had spent time at the chateau every summer and been pictured through the same window four years earlier by a platoon of paparazzi who had their long lenses trained on him from a nearby olive grove. His detectives had supervised the setting up of a ‘privacy screen’ in the chateau grounds but at least one photographer beat the security. Royal aides yesterday accused Closer magazine of ‘turning the clocks back 15 years’ – a reference to the time when paparazzi chased Diana around the world for pictures. It ended with her death in an underpass in Paris in 1997. The Princess of Wales had been photographed in an amorous clinch with Dodi Fayed in a yacht off the French Riviera days before the couple flew to the French capital. On their arrival, they were pursued by photographers in cars and on motorbikes and ended up at the Ritz hotel. Pictures as they died: Paparazzi were followed Diana and Dodi Fayed when their car crashed, killing them both. Photographers took pictures f her as she lay dying . They left by a back exit, again followed by paparazzi, and Diana, who was 36, and Fayed, 41, died after the Mercedes S280 in which they were travelling ran head-on into the central reservation of the Alma underpass. Photographers took pictures of her as she lay dying. In 2008, after a six month hearing, an inquest jury concluded Diana and Dodi were ‘unlawfully killed’ as a direct result of drunk chauffeur Henri Paul’s driving and the actions of photographers hounding their car. Both Paul, who also died, and the photographers were to blame for the crash because of their ‘gross negligence.’ But the paparazzi – ten of whom were arrested after the crash – did not face fresh legal proceedings in France, as a police investigation cleared them of criminal responsibility.","Sarah Ferguson was photographed lying topless while having her toes sucked by John Bryan 20 years ago .

France lurched closer to recession yesterday as a dramatic slump in output dented President François Hollande’s hopes of reviving the flagging economy. A report showed French businesses have suffered their worst month in nearly three-and-a-half years, plunging the eurozone’s second largest economy into turmoil. The decline in France was echoed across the region and piled pressure on European leaders to get a grip on the single currency debt crisis. Problems: Economists suggested that the downbeat picture from France, showed that unemployment running a 13-year high and a raft of tax rises announced by Socialist President Francois Hollande may be weighing on activity . Ben May, a European economist at the . research group Capital Economics, said: ‘There is little here to alter . the view that the eurozone recession looks set to deepen in the latter . part of the year.’ Mr Hollande, a Socialist, swept to . power in May promising to reverse austerity, but his popularity has . tumbled as  the economy has flatlined. The government is due to outline spending cuts and tax rises worth around £25billion next week. These are likely to include a 75 per . cent rate of tax on those earning more than £800,000 – a move that . threatens to drive many French wealth creators overseas. The measures may not be enough to cut . the deficit from 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year to 3 . per cent next year, forcing Mr Hollande to consider even deeper cuts. The closely watched purchasing . managers’ index of activity in France – where a number below 50 . represents decline – fell from 48 in August to a 41-month low of 44.1 . this month. It was the seventh month in a row . when the number has been below 50 and suggested the French economy could . shrink by 0.6 per cent in the current third quarter of the year. That follows nine months of zero growth. At the same time, the Italian . government said yesterday it expected its economy would shrink by 2.4 . per cent this year, double its earlier projections. Shrinking: The data suggested that France's 2 trillion euro economy, which posted zero growth in the last nine months, could shrink by as much as 0.5-0.6 percent in the third quarter, said Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson . For 2013, Italy now expects its economy to contract by 0.2 per cent, after earlier predictions of 0.5 per cent growth. It came against the backdrop of better-than-expected PMI figures from Germany. During European morning trade, the . EURO STOXX 50 declined 0.53 per cent, France’s CAC 40 slumped 0.51 per . cent, while Germany’s DAX 30 dropped 0.30 per cent. The Markit/CDAF flash composite . purchasing manager's index (PMI), a preliminary estimate of firms' activity that covers both manufacturing and services, slid to 44.1 in . September, its lowest level in 41 months, from 48.0 in August. It . was seventh consecutive month that the composite indicator remained . below the 50-point threshold separating a contraction in activity from . expansion. 'France is really starting to struggle quite substantially,' said Markit Chief Economist Chris Williamson. 'Its . economy is suffering as its neighbours are seeing demand weaken and ... there are few signs of demand to stimulate growth in France.' The . data suggested that France's 2 trillion euro economy, which posted zero . growth in the last nine months, could shrink by as much as 0.5-0.6 . percent in the third quarter, he said. September's . gloomy outlook came despite positive news flow on the euro zone crisis, . including the announcement of the European Central Bank's bond-buying . programme that lifted stock markets. 'It may be too early for the good news to have filtered through,' Williamson said. 'But the fact that businesses grew gloomier is a big concern.' Business orders, which had slowed the pace of their contraction in recent months, fell at the fastest rate in 3-1/2-years as both weak final demand and uncertainty weighed. Hollande has made reviving France's stalled economy a priority since he took office in May but his efforts have been hampered by a wave of layoffs from companies including retailer Carrefour (CARR.PA) and car maker Peugeot (PEUP.PA). After 7.2 billion euros in tax rises this year, Hollande has already indicated he will hike levies on households and businesses by much more in 2013 in an effort to trim France's public deficit to 3 percent of GDP. ""It could be that French-specific factors have played a role, with the upcoming fiscal consolidation of more than 30 billion euros next year likely having made consumers as well as producers reluctant to spend, hitting activity,"" said ABN Amro economist Joost Beaumont. High international energy and commodity costs pushed input prices higher, while weak demand meant that output prices continued to fall, forcing companies to accept smaller profit margins. ""Investment will be hurt, as will unemployment. Companies will be moving further into cost cutting,"" Williamson said. Layoffs accelerated to the fastest rate in 34 months, with manufacturers and service providers both recording steeper falls in payrolls as work backlogs declined. The contraction in activity was most severe in the manufacturing sector, which is more exposed to the weak international outlook. Activity here fell for the seventh consecutive month, sinking to a 41-month low of 42.6. Overall new manufacturing orders fell more sharply than export orders, suggesting that deteriorating domestic demand was mostly to blame. Household consumption, the motor of France's economy, is closely linked to unemployment, which is running at more than 10 percent. Service activity, meanwhile, worsened for a second straight month, sliding to a four-month low of 46.1, from 49.2 in August. Service providers' business expectations, which had improved sharply in August, slid back into negative territory in September for the first time since February 2009. The indices for outstanding business and new business in the services sector were also sharply weaker.","Took a sharp turn for the worse in September, shrinking at its fastest pace since April 2009 .

If you have grown used to doing the weekly shop online you may want to get out of the habit. Delivery charges could rise to £15 a time, according to retail experts. Picking out all your items, bagging them up and delivering each order to your door actually costs supermarkets up to £20 - a far cry from the £5 usually charged for the service. Shopping list: Picking out your items, bagging them up and delivering each order to your door costs supermarkets up to £20 - far above the actual delivery fee . The charge would need to rise to as much as £15 a time to reflect the true costs involved, according to Dr Clive Black, head of research at Shore Capital Stockbrokers, a leading retail analyst. He claimed the relatively low fee means that online shoppers are effectively being subsidised by everyone else. He said poorer families, who tend to shop in stores only, are charged  more for their food in order to offset the cost of providing online shopping to others. Dr Black said only big hikes in delivery charges would make the service economical for the businesses involved. Three of the major supermarkets, Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury’s, currently offer home grocery deliveries, while Waitrose and Ocado have separate home-shopping operations. Demand is growing enormously, with Waitrose recently reporting a 50 per cent increase in home shopping customers. Online orders account for around one in 20 weekly shops, while sales are growing at around 15 per cent a year. Going online: Demand is growing enormously, with Waitrose recently reporting a 50 per cent increase in home shopping customers . Despite this popularity, most supermarkets do not make a profit from their online grocery operations. ‘Supermarket online grocery is more of a service than a profit generator due to the cost of fulfilment,’ said Dr Black. As more customers switch to this option, supermarkets will come under intense pressure to push up delivery charges in order to avoid big losses, he said. 'In the long run, the service cost of home delivery will need to be better covered if this growing channel is not going to deplete returns and penalise the poor' Dr Clive Black, Shore Capital Stockbrokers head of research . ‘Online grocery without proper charging for distribution is not a sustainable model,’ he told The Grocer magazine. ‘In the long run, the service cost of home delivery will need to be better covered if this growing channel is not going to deplete returns and penalise the poor. ‘More grocery orders online may make it more economic to fulfil them, but charges of around £10-15 would be more cost covering than the present system which runs from free delivery to £6.50.’ Dr Black said the high costs have stopped major chains such as Morrisons and Marks & Spencer from launching their own online food stores. Looking ahead, he expects Morrisons to dip a toe in the water with the online sale of wine before developing a more substantial web business. ‘Marks & Spencer is also assessing the market, but we’d be surprised to see anything too major within the next 18 months,’ he said.","Delivery actually costs supermarkets up to £20 a time .
