A Samung advert has gone viral after the actors it features were deemed 'the world's worst' by online critics. The video, which was leaked on to YouTube, has faced criticism with thousands of people claiming the the men and woman featured desperately fail to convince the viewer of their excitement about the promoted piece of computer hardware. The three-minute long film which praises the technology company's 840 EVO Series Solid State drive has been taken down from various user accounts. Scroll down for video . The actress failed to convince viewers of her excitement and was also criticised for delivering lines which promote sexist stereotypes . One of the actors claim the video was never intended to be seen outside South Korea where producers planned to dub over the actor's lines . In the advert actors attempt to give off the impression they are delighted with the new piece of equipment after being quizzed on their computer's pros and cons. Among the wooden performances is a less-than-convincing account of a housewife who uses her computer to 'look at pictures or videos of my children from family trips.' After complaining that her computer takes too long to reboot she is given the new hardware to test. Stick to the day job: This actor failed to deliver a convincing performance looking distinctly less than enthusiastic the whole way through the three minute long video . The actor feigned surprise when the product appeared on screen . 'Aw, I did it, did you see that?' she says after successfully attaching the equipment to her laptop. Two male actors are also featured but deliver equally unconvincing performances. One half-heartedly asks: 'Wow, this is the SSD right?' while the other proclaims: 'It's so thin and light!'. A thread on social news and entertainment website, Reddit, has offered unimpressed viewers a platform to discuss their thoughts on the video, under the title: 'Samsung ad featuring possibly the world's worst actors.' Really?: This actor perhaps went over the top in his portrayal of a businessman who's fed up of his computer slowing down . This actor's flailing attempt to promote the piece of hardware does little to entice viewers . Comments include one from a person who claims to have taken part in the video, acting out the role of one of the businessmen. Under his username, Damienf1, he said the advert was never intended to be released in America, and only be viewed in South Korea. Written by non-native English speakers, he said the technology giant instructed him and the other two actors to speak deliberately slowly so their words could be 'dubbed over in Korean' Insisting he could 'do a better job', the commenter said he was merely following the director's instructions. Samsung has not responded since video emerged. Other critics claim however the video's flaws stem further than poor acting, and that the script used is out-dated and sexist. 'Why did they make the woman so much dumber than the men?' one user commented. 'When I'm not helping my children with homework or looking at pictures of them, I leave the computer on while doing housework! I didn't realize they had computers in 1950,' said another.","Leaked advert criticised for using 'world's worst actors'

A Pennsylvania father and former Little League coach is being hailed a hero for wrestling to the ground a crazed gunman moments after the man allegedly shot dead three people at a city planning meeting on Monday night. Bernie Kozen was pictured today talking to sheriff's deputies as the victims authorities say were killed by scorned resident Rockne Newell, 59, were identified as Chestnuthill Township Supervisor David Fleetwood, Gerard Kozic, 53, of Saylorsburg and James LaGuardia, 64, of Saylorsburg. Newell is accused of shouting 'You took my property, ****suckers!' before opening fire on the monthly Ross Township municipal meeting after feuding with the city over living conditions at his home. He was charged with three counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of aggravated assault on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . Hero: Bernie Kozen, pictured near the shooting scene on Tuesday, August. 6, 2013, wrestled the gunman to the ground . Tragic: The three victims were killed on Monday night at the Ross Township Municipal Building, in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania . Kozen told The Pocono Record he . was helping one of the men injured in the spray of bullets when Newell . 'walked by me into the meeting room, I guess to shoot more people.' He recounted the gunman shouting: 'You took my property, ****suckers!' At . that moment, Kozen courageously pounced on the shooter and tackled him . to the floor before using Newell's own weapon to shoot him twice in the . leg. 'I came up behind him . and wrestled the gun from him,' Kozen told the newspaper, adding that he . had the help of another brave witness. Witness Cleoria Campodonico described the horror inside the usually dry meeting. Victim: Chestnuthill Township Supervisor David Fleetwood, pictured, was among the three men killed . 'I'll never get those images out of my . head. Those poor, innocent people,' she said. 'David Fleetwood pushed me . out of the way and got shot twice in the belly.' Fleetwood was as a man you could count on, his friends said on Tuesday. 'He'd . give you the shirt off his back,' Township Manager Dave Albright told . The Record, choking back tears. 'He'd do anything for you. Just in the . things that he did here at the township but also as a friend.' Gerard Kozic's wife, Linda, and Frank Pirano Jr. were also injured in the shock shooting. Newell had reportedly been in an ongoing dispute with the city about a junkyard on his property. 'I heard more than 10 shots,' said The Pocono Record reporter Chris Reber, who was at the meeting. 'It was automatic, like a string of firecrackers.' State . police said about 15 to 18 residents and town officials were at the . building, a short drive from Newell's property, when the gunfire erupted . at around 7:19 p.m. Two people died at the scene, and a third person died after being flown to a hospital. A woman, presumably Mrs Kozic, was undergoing surgery late Monday. One person was shot . in the leg, two were shot in the stomach and one was shot in the head, . according to the Pocono Record. Investigators said Newell began shooting as he approached the building and continued as he walked into and through it. He . then went back out to his vehicle in the parking lot, retrieved a . handgun and returned to the building, firing more shots, police said. Suspect: Rockne Newell is accused of killing three people dead at a Ross Township board meeting last night . Horrific: Rockne Newell is alleged to have opened fire on the Ross Township board meeting Monday night . From all over: Emergency reponders from multiple agencies poured into the scene after the first 911 call just before 7:30 Monday evening . Reber said the gunman, armed with a long gun with a scope, shot through a wall into the meeting. 'The thing that got my attention: . plaster flying out, blowing out through the walls. Witnesses would later . tell me they saw pictures exploding away from the walls,' Reber said on Monday evening. He said he crawled out to a hallway, exited the building and took cover behind a vehicle. 'The gunman was this guy wearing a . blue Hawaiian shirt,' he said. 'I saw him go back out to his car, a . silver Impala, and get another gun. 'It wasn't real to me until I went back inside and saw people bleeding.' Reber was the first to flag up Kozen's heroics. 'Bernie Kozen was there tending to the man and he . (the shooter) didn't see them,' he explained. 'Bernie bearhugged him . and took him down. He shot him with his own gun.' Rep. Matt Cartwright, who represents the state's 17th District Cartwright called Kozen a 'true hero.' When asked at his arraignment on . Tuesday whether he owns any property, Newell said: 'They stole it from . me. That's what started all this.' Disrepair: Newell's property was compared to a junkyard in local media reports about his feud with officials . Search: The home of alleged shooter 59-year-old Rockne Newell is seen early Tuesday, August 6, 2013 in Saylorsburg, Pennsylvania . Junk collector: Debris litters the yard of alleged shooter and self-confessed junk collector Rockne Newell . He then asked if he'll get any medical attention. 'I . got a .44 slug on my leg. Hospital says its still in there. They gave . me no pain medication and sent me on my way. I'm bleeding all over the . place,' he said. Newell had been in a long-running . dispute with township officials over the dilapidated condition of his . property, state police Capt. Edward Hoke said. The township supervisors voted in . February 2012 to take legal action against Newell for violating zoning . and sewer regulations, according to meeting minutes posted online. Last October, Newell set up a . fundraising page online and was trying to raise $10,000 to pay for legal . fees in his battle with the township. 'Ross township took me to court & . the court ruled I have to vacate my home of 20 years,' he wrote on the . page called saveRockyshome. 'I live on SSI which comes to $600 a month I . have no money to clean it up.' Bearhug: Kozen, West End Open Space Commission executive director, pictured, bear-hugged the gunman and took him down, according to a witness . Hard: Kozen, pictured, tackled Rockne Newell, who was on Tuesday arraigned on homicide charges and other counts . Newell said his two rescue dogs 'will be put to sleep because no one else will take them.' The property includes an old camper in . the front yard filled with wooden pallets, pieces of what appear to be . old railroad ties and trash. A garage leans and appears close to . collapse, and a propane tank sits inside an old dog house. State police, who guarded the property early Tuesday, were awaiting a search warrant so they can enter it. In June, the Pocono Record wrote a . story about what it said was an 18-year fight between the township and . Newell over his property. Monroe . County Court in August 2012 sided with the township and ordered Newell . to vacate and never again occupy or use the property unless he had the . permits to do so. Alleged shooter: Newell, pictured left and right, was angry about a property dispute . Investigation: Pennsylvania State Police are searching Newell's dilapidated home and yard (pictured) Violations: Newell has a longstanding dispute with the township authorities over his home (pictured) The report said Newell had been living out of a car, a 1984 Pontiac Fiero, and in abandoned buildings since being ordered to vacate. Newell told the paper he was unemployed for years after an injury from a crash and had nowhere else to go. 'They have no right to kick me off my property,' he told the newspaper. 'They call my property an eyesore. When I bought it, it was one of only three properties on the entire road that didn't have what they call junk.' Newell was in police custody after being treated at the hospital Monday night. Ross Township has about 5,500 residents . Newell told the Record this past June he couldn’t afford the septic hookup fees, and eerily complained about his perceived treatment. 'If I lose this property, I have nowhere else to go,' said Newell, adding 'what they're doing to me, what they've been doing to me for so long, it's wrong.' Authorities have yet to bring charges against Newell but are holding him while his property is searched. He has been released from hospital where he was treated for gunshot wounds to the leg.","Bernie Kozen wrestled a crazed gunman moments after the man shot dead three people at Ross Township municipal meeting on Monday night .

"By . Harry Mount . PUBLISHED: . 17:47 EST, 3 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:11 EST, 4 September 2013 . Sunny-side up? Harry uses the glare coming off the building to cook an egg . Welcome to the second Great Fire of London. Just around the corner from here, in Pudding Lane, in this very week in 1666, an absent-minded baker, Thomas Farriner, left his buns in the oven for too long — leading to the greatest conflagration the capital has ever seen. This time, it’s absent-minded property developers — Canary Wharf Group and Land Securities — whose 525 ft high, 37-floor building at 20 Fenchurch Street is unintentionally acting as a giant death ray. Indeed, the laser beam that nearly bisected James Bond in Goldfinger has nothing on this. Every day over the past week, for two hours from around midday to 2pm, the bright light reflection of the sun has moved slowly across a stretch of pavement in Eastcheap — just by the Monument, the massive column that marks the spot where the Great Fire of London began. Even on a relatively cloudy day like yesterday, it was possible to fry an egg on the pavement where the glare lands. I know because I tried it. Every day, City hedgefunders race along the pavement to avoid being toasted. The problem is that the whole of the sun-facing side of the curved building — known as the Walkie Talkie Tower because its distinctive shape resembles an old-fashioned mobile phone — acts as a mirror as the concave surface focuses all light on a single spot on the ground. In the neighbouring Viet Cafe, they hardly need bother turning on their cookers to heat up their pho noodles. In Re-Style Gentleman’s Grooming, the glare is so intense that it’s burnt a black disc the size of a saucer into the welcome mat. And anyone unlucky enough to park their car in the bays opposite the building — dubbed the Walkie Scorchie by some wags — is in trouble. Last week, Martin Lindsay, the director of a tiling company, left his Jaguar XJ on Eastcheap for just an hour, only to return to find it melted by the heat. The panels and wing mirror were buckled, and there was a  smell of burning plastic. Eddie Cannon, a heating engineer, suffered a similar  fate with his Vauxhall Vivaro. He said: ‘The van looks a  total mess. Every bit of plastic on the left-hand side and everything on the dashboard has melted, including a bottle of Lucozade.’ The parking bays have now been suspended by the City of London authorities while  the developers try to solve  the problem. Scroll down for video . Getting hot under the collar: Reporter Harry Mount stands underneath the Walkie Talkie Tower . How does it happen? This graphic shows how the concave shape of the skyscraper means a large amount of sunlight is reflected into a small area . Unbelievable: An egg is fried in intense sunlight reflected from the Walkie-Talkie building, in Eastcheap in the City of London, where sun light reflected from the building melted part of a Jaguar car . Standing directly in the line of fire, I feel as if I’m on a Hollywood movie set, drenched in a glare so impossibly intense that it seems artificial. Particularly in London in September, when what you’re expecting is the beginning of soft  autumnal light. Elsewhere in the capital, temperatures are a pleasant enough but unremarkable 25 degrees Centigrade in the shade. But as I move into the focus of the death ray, I instantly start sweating as my thermometer hurtles through 38 degrees Centigrade — hotter than most places on the Med. It is like suddenly being on a massive sunbed. Stay here any longer and I’ll be thoroughly Tangoed. Television reporters have rushed here from the hottest parts of the globe — Singapore, South Africa, Brazil — to cover the phenomenon. London at Copacabana levels of heat? Impossible, surely! When I leave the thermometer on the shopfront of the Viet Cafe for a few seconds, the temperature rockets up to the maximum possible, 42 degrees centigrade. Blinding: The phenomenon takes place in the afternoon on bright days in the City of London . Up close: A camera man films broken slates outside a cafe in London. It was reported the tiles had shattered from sunlight reflected by the Walkie Talkie tower . A block of butter melts in minutes; my notebook is too hot to handle; our photographer’s flash overheats; an egg sizzles away in the frying pan I’ve brought with me. The Walkie Talkie Tower is one of the City’s most prestigious new developments — one in a series of skyscrapers rising up alongside the Gherkin and the Cheesegrater on London’s sprouting skyline.It cost £200 million and is due to be finished next spring. Before then, though, the developers and Uruguayan-born architect Rafael Vinoly will have to decommission the death ray. ‘We are taking the issue of light reflecting seriously and are looking into the matter as a priority,’ said a spokesman for Land Securities and Canary Wharf, who formed a 50:50 joint venture to develop 20 Fenchurch Street. My eyes! City workers out for a cigarette pull amusing expressions as they see the light . Even the fruit suffered: A damaged lemon is seen in the window of a barbers shop in the City of London . ‘The phenomenon is caused by the current elevation of the sun in the sky. It lasts for approximately two hours per day, with initial modelling suggesting that it will be present for approximately two to three weeks. ‘We are consulting with local businesses and the City to address the issue in the short term, while also evaluating longer-term solutions to ensure the issue cannot recur in future.’ The problem is that they have accidentally designed an incredibly effective heat reflector. The building, with its huge bank of windows, doesn’t just act like a solar reflector: because that bank of windows is concave on its south-facing facade, it also gathers together the sun’s rays, bounces them back and concentrates them on a focal point — which  happens to be that stretch of pavement on Eastcheap. Dr Simon Foster, a solar physicist at Imperial College London, says: ‘People have known about the phenomenon for thousands of years. Blinding: Martin Lindsay with his Jaguar XJ, which was damaged by bright light reflected down from the tower . Melted: The wing mirror after it was warped by the extreme heat on a road in the City of London . Damage: The building's unusual shape is reflecting ultra bright light onto Eastcheap in the City of London . ‘In the same way that a satellite dish works, the building is a parabolic reflector, collecting solar energy over a vast area and focusing it on a point — and, as a result, you’re getting massive heat levels.’ Dr Foster has visited the site to assess the issue for himself. ‘Paintwork on the shops is being burnt, and I could feel myself boiling,’ he says. ‘The developers might well have considered it but thought it was unlikely to be this bad.’ He says the same principle is used to light the Olympic flame: you take a curved silver surface and the sun heats up the torch to burning point. Dr Foster has been recording temperatures and has registered a high of 92.6 degrees Centigrade, only a few degrees short of water’s boiling point. ‘Any hotter and things could be set on fire,’ says Dr Foster. ‘There won’t be another Great Fire of London, but you might well get a small one.’ Unusual scene: City workers walking on Eastcheap feel the heat from the Walkie Talkie building . Illuminating: A runner jogs past a patch of intense light on the road in the City of London . As I stand in the direct glare, the heat is agonising. Remember, too, that the building still hasn’t been finished: there’s a big chunk of windows yet to be installed. Stare for a second at the gleaming facade and you risk being blinded. As the sun moves westward, so the hotspot moves along the Eastcheap pavement, scorching a new batch of City bankers on their way to grab their takeaway lunch. How on earth can you stop this mammoth microwave from cooking up more lunchtime workers? ‘It is nothing to do with the summer heat,’ says Dr Foster. ‘You could get the same effect in winter. ‘It’s related to the height of the sun, which varies throughout the year, and the moment the sunlight hits the building at the right point.’ He says that the answer is to paint the windows with a non-reflective matte surface that absorbs the sun’s rays. Or to cover them with slightly speckled material that scatters the solar radiation and doesn’t produce a focus. Alternatively, the whole shape of the building could be redesigned — but that remedy would cost a fortune. Meanwhile, the developers have announced they will be erecting a temporary scaffold screen at street level to block out the sun’s rays while they seek a longer-term solution. Behind the screen, the second Great Fire of London will continue until the sun stops shining or highly-paid architects start to get a bit smarter about learning their solar physics.","Every day City hedgefunders race along the pavement to avoid being toasted .

"By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED: . 11:55 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:57 EST, 6 August 2013 . A mummified head said to be that of a Maori chief will return to its origins after more than 170 years in the UK. The preserved head, known as a Toi moko, was brought to Britain in the 1840s and has been kept in Warrington Museum, in Cheshire, since 1843. But after several lifetimes in the northern hemisphere, the head of the 'South Sea island chief' is to be sent back in response to a call for the repatriation of such rare items, due to their 'great cultural importance'. Janice Hayes, the museum's manager, said: 'We don't know the precise origin of the head. We do know that the Maoris used to preserve severed heads for two reasons - either to venerate a loved one, or to ridicule an enemy defeated in battle. Not showing his age: The Toi Moko was brought to Britain in the 1840s and kept at Warrington Museum. The Maoris considered the head to be the most sacred part of the body and it is regarded as an insult even to show a photograph of one . 'But we also know that some Maoris, when they learned that Europeans would pay gold for the old artifacts, began to manufacture more heads for sale. 'But in any case, Te Papa Tongarewa, one of the national museums of New Zealand has been asking for all such artifacts to be repatriated, at their expense, and Warrington Borough Council, which currently legally owns the head, has decided to return it.' The position of a Maori tribesmen within the tribe was identified by the tattoos on their faces, known as moko. The more painted the face, the higher up they were within the tribe. Each additional motif, or moko, represented a rite of passage or a significant event in their lives. Senior chiefs within a tribe had completely tattooed faces, while lower ranking members had only their chins and lips painted, for example. Women were rarely tattooed, but all men who's faces were stamped with their own special design had their heads preserved out of respect; the preserved heads were known as mokomakai. This tradition reigned until about the mid 19th century when it began to disappear having been corrupt by European influences. European settlers brought with them firearms -  a revolutionary way of fighting as far as the Maori were concerned and something they wanted to get their hands on. And one thing the Europeans were keen to take home were mokomakai. And so a trade was established. The Maori would sell their mokomakai in exchange for Muskets to fight their neighbours. They would steal their neighbours heads to get more guns and even started tattooing slaves with 'fake' symbols and beheading them to sell to the foreigners. The problem became so bad that in 1831 the governor of New South Wales banned the further trade of heads, although some trade continued. Maori warriors, pictured at a tribal gathering in New Zealand (stock image), tattooed their faces until the mid 19th century to show status . Ms Hayes said many Samoans were of Maori origin, adding: 'In Maori culture the head is considered to be the most sacred part of the body and male warriors would have an intricate facial tattoo called a moko applied to give it additional sacred powers. 'After their death their head was smoked and dried in the sun to preserve it and ensure it was still possible to see their unique moko which allowed them to be identified, almost like a finger print. 'Because these Toi moko are so sacred to the Maori it is regarded as an insult even to show a photograph of one and the museum removed the head from public view many years ago.' The council's executive board member for leisure, community and culture, Cllr Kate Hannon, said: 'We're proud to have had this Toi moko in Warrington Museum for all this time, and there's a lot that can be learned from artifacts like this. 'But we think it's right and proper that the head should be returned to New Zealand. 'Human remains like this are of great cultural importance to the Maoris, and we're very happy to see to it that the Toi moko is returned to where it came from a century and a half ago.' The New Zealand Maori rugby team still perform the haka dance before their matches (stock picture - watched by British and Irish Lions players in Hamilton June 11). The rugby players have been offered a last chance to see the preserved head in the UK as part of their World Cup tour . Te Papa Tongarewa has indicated that it will want to conduct a ceremony at Warrington Museum to thank it for its care of the Toi moko before the New Zealand authorities resume custody of it. The artifact is unlikely to be repatriated until the autumn so Warrington Borough Council intends to invite members of the New Zealand and Samoan national rugby league team to pay their respects to the Toi moko during their stay in the UK as part of the World Cup.","Preserved head, known as a Toi moko, has been owned by Warrington Museum, in Cheshire, for 170 years .

Stranded: Footage taken on the train show how passengers were crammed in on the Penzance to London Paddington service for almost six hours . Furious passengers yesterday attacked one of Britain’s leading rail firms over a 12-hour nightmare trip in third world ‘cattle truck’ conditions. Nearly 500 passengers were stranded in the countryside for almost six hours when brakes on their 30-year-old First Great Western train broke down. Customers on the overcrowded service were left thirsty and hungry as water was rationed, refreshments ran out and the lavatories blocked up. Those seeking to quench their thirst were outraged to be charged for hot drinks, said witnesses. The fiasco on Sunday’s 11am service from Penzance to London Paddington has been described as ‘horrific’ and a ‘chaotic disaster’. FGW faces a stream of compensation claims after admitting a catalogue of failures and announced an independent inquiry. The rail company – nicknamed ‘Worst Late Western’ for its bad performance – is already under fire for running the most overcrowded service in Britain, from Henley-on-Thames to Paddington. The firm is part of transport giant First Group whose chief executive Tim O’Toole is on track for a pay-plus-perks deal of £1.25million this year, including a ‘retention bonus’ of more than £220,000. FGW also chairs the Government’s Rail Delivery Group, set up by ministers to improve services. Scroll down for video . Ordeal: Passengers on the 'horrific' 11am First Great Western train from Penzance to London Paddington said they were 'treated like cattle' because there was not enough food, water or seats . Anger: These passengers told how they were trapped on a train which ran out of water 'early on' and how they slowly waited to be rescued because of the rural location the train broke down in . A highly embarrassed senior executive – . travelling on the stricken train and dressed in holiday shorts and . shirt – was filmed giving a grovelling apology to a carriage full of . passengers. He admitted that passengers had been ‘misled’ by staff, that the rail . firm had handled matters appallingly and promised to raise the fiasco . personally with directors, pledging: ‘I will have my say, believe me, . because I am as deeply disgruntled.’ He added: ‘I’m a passenger on this train and I’m as frustrated as you . are.’ The train stalled near Pewsey, Wiltshire, at about 3.45pm after a . fractured air pipe caused the brakes to lock. It took engineers two . hours to reach the train and three and a quarter to fix it. The train began moving again at about 9pm and arrived at Paddington at about 10.15pm – five hours and 40 minutes late. The trains date back to the 1980s, but the firm said age was not the issue as the internal mechanics are about six years old. Toni Heath, 53, a property developer from Clerkenwell, London, returning . from a weekend break in Cornwall claimed that, while passengers were . trapped inside the train, staff stood outside in a field smoking and . stretching their legs. At first, they said someone must have pulled the emergency cord, he said . – and a train sent to shunt them didn’t work because its brakes were . locked. ‘The train was massively overcrowded, families were sitting on the floor . – no seats had been reserved because of a computer error,’ he added. ‘We paid £200 for a ticket and we got that shambles. Children were . crying and vomiting. It was truly horrendous.’ Passengers voiced frustration on Twitter. One, Sarah, said they had been . ‘treated like cattle’ adding: ‘No food, no water, no air con, no . toilets flushing! Management on trains not communicating.’ A male passenger complained: ‘The train was overcrowded before it even . broke down. There was probably 20 or 30 people in each carriage who . couldn’t sit down.’ Company managing director Mark Hopwood said later: ‘Clearly what I need . to do is say sorry. We are sorry. We need to investigate what’s gone on . and we need to learn some lessons quickly from this. It took a lot . longer to find the fault than we wanted.

NHS staff and organisations that ‘wilfully’ or ‘recklessly’ harm patients should face new criminal penalties, a major review said yesterday. It also demanded legal sanctions against leaders in the NHS with a ‘couldn’t care less’ attitude or who deliberately withhold information. The review headed by Professor Don Berwick, a world expert in patient safety, said there have been repeated safety defects in the NHS with too many patients and carers suffering as a result. Facing both ways: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt ruled out minimum staffing levels in the health service but admitted cutbacks can hit safety . It called for a culture of transparency that puts patient safety above targets, especially financial goals. Continually improving patient safety . should ‘permeate every action and level in the NHS’, said the review . commissioned by the Government in the wake of the public inquiry into . the Mid Staffordshire scandal where hundreds of patients were routinely . neglected and died. Managers chasing financial targets were partly . blamed. The Berwick report set out measures . including a review of staffing ratios to ensure that sufficient numbers . are on duty at all times, and simplifying an over-complex regulatory . system run by many different agencies. The National Institute for Health and . Care Excellence (Nice) should come up with a formula to help NHS leaders . check that hospital wards are properly staffed, with research . suggesting one registered nurse per eight patients, but locally . implemented. However, Prof Berwick said changing . the culture of the NHS would ‘trump’ any new rules and strategies, and . he stressed that accidental errors by staff would not be subject to . criminal prosecution under the new system. But organisations that mislead . regulators or hide evidence would face criminal sanctions along with . staff who wilfully mistreat or neglect patients causing serious harm or . death. He said: ‘Where there is wilful or reckless neglect of patients . there needs to be consequences.’ But it would affect ‘a very small . number of cases’. Guru: Prof Don Berwick was a key White House aide and championed President Obama's Medicare scheme . Prof Berwick stopped short of saying a . duty of candour should be enshrined in law requiring NHS staff to . report beliefs about serious incidents, saying it was already included . in professional codes of conduct. He also said it would be a . ‘bureaucratic nightmare’ for staff to be obliged to follow an automatic . duty of candour where patients are told about every error or near miss. Prof Berwick, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, said most staff were trying to do their best. But his report said supervisory . regimes and regulation in the NHS should avoid ‘diffusion of . responsibility’, adding: ‘When so many are in charge, no one is.’ There . should be a review of such organisations including the much-criticised . Care Quality Commission by 2017. Harm: David Cameron asked US President Barack Obama's former health adviser Don Berwick to review how to change the culture of the NHS . Campaigners warned the review was . another in a long line of ‘navel gazing’ reports into NHS shortcomings . with few practical answers. But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said . it was a ‘call to action’ for the NHS although he did not accept that a . national staffing minimum was necessary. He said there was a danger that . hospitals would settle for achieving the minimum even though there would . be times when they would need to go beyond it. Katherine Murphy, chief . executive of the Patients Association, said the report was ‘heavy on . platitudes but light on practical solutions’. Roger Goss, of the group Patient . Concern, added: ‘Unless the Government implements mandatory minimum . nursing staff levels per ward and a duty for all staff to tell patients . when their care goes wrong, staff will carry on as usual.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham . said: ‘All the experts are now telling the Government to get a grip on . staffing levels. Over 800 nursing jobs were lost last month alone – now . totalling almost 5,000 since the election.’ Niall Dickson, chief executive of the . General Medical Council, said: ‘This important report puts safety first . and, if implemented, will improve care and save lives.’","Health Secretary rules out telling hospitals to hire more doctors and nurses .

McDonald's has admitted it employs 90 per cent of its staff in Britain on controversial zero-hours contracts. Zero-hours contracts are often critised because they do not offer guarantee work and a stable income. Under the terms employees agree to be available for work as and when it is required. Contracts: Politicians have called for McDonald's to offer at least minimum guaranteed hours for the 82,800 people (file picture) Politicians have called for the food chain to offer at least minimum guaranteed hours for the 82,800 people. Andy Sawford, a Labour MP who has campaigned to get rid of zero-hours contracts, told The Guardian: 'McDonald's could lead on addressing this issue. 'There will be some employees working 20 to 30 hours a week, week in week out and it is indefensible not to put those people on contracts.' A spokesman said employees are asked during their application process to say which days they can work on and that although all hourly-paid members of staff are on the zero-hours contracts, they are still entitled to benefits. McDonald's employs 92,000 members of staff in the UK and introduced the zero-hours contracts in 1974. Other chains which use zero-hours . contracts include Subway but it said its stores were independently owned . and terms and conditions were set by the franchisees. Involved: A member of staff prepares food at a Subway, which also has franchises which give employees zero-hour contracts . Pret A Manger, on the other hand, said all of its staff are on a minimum of eight hours guaranteed a week. Earlier this week it was claimed one million workers may be on the contracts - four times as many as official estimates. 'There will be some employees working 20 to 30 hours a week, week in week out and it is indefensible not to put those people on contracts' Andy Sawford, Labour MP . The contracts, which are increasingly popular with employers, mean firms do not have to pay staff during quiet periods but keeps them available on short notice for when they are needed. Last week the Office for National Statistics reported that 250,000 people were on this type of contract at the end of 2012, which was a 50,000 rise in a year. But research suggests this is a massive underestimate, and that there is a hidden workforce who, in effect, have no guaranteed shifts or income – making childcare arrangements and planning finances almost impossible. According to a survey of 1,000 companies by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, one in five employed at least one person on a zero-hours contract – or a million workers if the results were applied across the country.","Terns mean employees agree to be available for work when it is required .

A run-down shed filled with builder's junk has sold at auction for a staggering £38,000 - nearly four times its real value. The identity of the buyer has not been made public, but auction house Hollis Morgan, who organised the deal, has admitted the woman who bought the dilapidated building in the St George area of Bristol, probably got swept away with the competitive nature of the bidding process. Spokesman for the firm Oliver Hollis said: 'Literally it's nothing, it should never have sold for that amount. Dilapidated: This garage in Bristol, inherited by a young couple, has just sold at auction for a staggering fee . Junk: It was full to bursting with building materials, including offcuts of wood and old tiles . 'Essentially auctions bring out the competitive nature in everyone. If you can see someone is prepared to pay to pay a certain amount for something, you will as well. 'I think it is the only way we would ever have achieved that sort of money in that it was sold in an auction in a competitive market. 'The majority of interest before had been at about the £10-£15,000 mark. It's real value is about £10,000.' The woman who has just forked out over the odds for the building does not even have any plans to redevelop it and make a profit. Mr Hollis said at the moment she only planned to use it for storage. The dilapidated lean-to in Bristol . was inherited by a young couple, who put the building on the market . hoping it would fetch around £15,000. The . Victorian brick outhouse is sandwiched in next to a terraced house in . Ebenezer Street where the average family home is valued at just under . £100,000. It has no planning permission, but auction experts reckon it would make an ideal small business premises or workshop. Sandwiched: The shed, which is in badly in need of redevelopment, is squashed in next to a terraced house . The auction was staged by Clifton-based Hollis Morgan as part of a sale day which saw a record-breaking £5million worth of property sold in just a few hours. No fewer than 75 separate people had registered an interest in the shed before bidding got under way. Mr Hollis explained up to nine people had combined to bring the value up to the £20,000 mark. Then they gradually started to fall away and in the end three people were left competing head to head for the 20ft by 10ft plot of land, raising the stakes by about £2,000 each time, until it plateaued at the phenomenal £38,000. Mr Hollis added: 'Everyone was looking around in excitement. There was a real buzz in the room.' The couple who sold the property, who have not been named but are both 19, are said to be delighted with the amount of money they made on the deal, reportedly saying they were 'made for life'.

The family of a businessman who died - after suffering a single punch from a racist drunk who is still walking the streets - today called for the case against the attacker to be reopened. Property manager Kamlesh Ruparelia, 55, originally from Uganda, was knocked down ‘like a skittle’ after being punched in the face by 38-year-old Kieran Beresford, who had drunk ten pints of cider. Several witnesses told an inquest at Sheffield Coroner’s Court that the father of one did nothing to provoke his 6ft 4in attacker, who punched him after making racist remarks to two women in a pub. Attack: Property manager Kamlesh Ruparelia (left), 55, originally from Uganda, was knocked down ‘like a skittle’ after being punched in the face by 38-year-old Kieran Beresford (right), who had drunk ten pints of cider . The hearing came after prosecutors dropped a manslaughter charge against Beresford in February 2011 - who claimed self-defence - after deciding there was no realistic prospect of convicting him. Mr Ruparelia, who fled Uganda in the 1970s aged 17 to become a successful businessman, running a takeaway and two supermarkets, died four days after the attack in hospital from a head injury. Delivering his verdict, South Yorkshire Coroner Chris Dorries said the weight of evidence was that Mr Ruparelia was struck while involved in an argument, although he had not assaulted anyone. He said he was in a ‘dilemma’ as law prevented him making findings in contradiction of the earlier proceedings - and he could not necessarily draw conclusions from the evidence ‘as I might like’. But after the inquest, Mr Ruparelia’s family said in a statement: ‘The decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone over Kamlesh’s death and not to let a jury hear the evidence sends out the wrong message. ‘We are shocked by the mismanagement of the case and feel a double loss - the loss of Kamlesh and the loss of justice. 'The failure to prosecute this case to trial represents a serious failure by the CPS to demonstrate its commitment to protect the public.’ Mr Ruparelia was enjoying a game of pool with his cousin Jay Kotecha and the company of four women friends who were celebrating a birthday at the White Rose pub in Handsworth, Sheffield. In hospital: Several witnesses told an inquest at Sheffield Coroner's Court that the father of one did nothing to provoke his 6ft 4in attacker, who punched him after making racist remarks to two women in a pub . Mr Kotecha, 55, told the inquest Mr Beresford approached the women and said in a serious manner: ‘Why are you talking to these two P****?’ Mr Ruparelia, known as Kam, stood up to remonstrate and was floored by pub regular Beresford, known as Bez, with one punch. One of the women, Shelley Brown, said of Beresford: ‘He didn’t seem as if he was on the same planet as me, he was swaying around.’ Another, Jennifer Steeples, said: ‘He . hit Kam and he went down and his glasses went onto the pool table. I . never saw Kam do anything. He just went down like a skittle and his head . hit the floor.’ Craig . Coulson said the businessman told Beresford he had been rude to the . women and was then punched by him. ‘He went down like a sack of spuds,’ he said. ‘He hit him with all his weight.’ Mr Ruparelia, from Dore, Sheffield, was attacked in October 2010. Beresford, . an air conditioning fitter from Darnall, Sheffield was arrested and in . two police interviews admitted he ‘snapped and lashed out’ at Mr . Ruparelia. 'We are shocked by the mismanagement of the case and feel a double loss - the loss of Kamlesh and the loss of justice' Kamlesh Ruparelia's family . He was charged with manslaughter but cleared in February, 2011 after the CPS were ‘unable to disprove the issue of self-defence’. Beresford had only raised the issue of self-defence in his second police interview two days after Mr Ruparelia died. Pathologist Dr Phillip Lumb said it was a ‘heavy punch’ which caused Mr Ruparelia to collapse and he was likely to have been rendered unconscious immediately. Mr Beresford told the inquest Mr . Ruparelia began shouting at him after he made a remark to the women and . his cousin grabbed him by the neck. In . his first police statement read at the inquest, Beresford said: ‘I just . lashed out at him. I connected really well. I just snapped.’ He . could not remember what started the incident but may have made a . comment ‘in jest’ to the women. During his second interview he said he . felt ‘extremely threatened’ and struck Ruparelia to get him away. The coroner said in his findings: ‘It is clear that the initial row developed because of a racist remark by Mr Beresford. ‘It . is also apparent that words (but no blows) had been exchanged between . Mr Ruparelia and Mr Beresford just prior to the punch being thrown. ‘Those who actually saw the punch were virtually unanimous in describing it as a very hard blow.’ Location: Mr Ruparelia was enjoying a game of pool with his cousin Jay Kotecha and the company of four women friends who were celebrating a birthday at the White Rose pub in Handsworth, Sheffield . His . narrative verdict read: ‘Kamlesh Ruparelia died at the Royal . Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, of head injuries received in . consequence of a single punch to the head delivered with great force . during or immediately after an altercation (that was primarily between . others over a racist remark) at the White Rose pub.’ Te . victim’s only son Nikhil, 25, and his sister Viduet Angeli, said they . were devastated at the ‘absolute violation’ of Mr Ruparelia’s human . rights. ‘We believe that a . jury should have had the opportunity to consider and come to a . conclusion on the evidence in this case and we do not understand why . that was not permitted to happen,’ they said. ‘We have now heard the evidence given before the coroner and we understand that decision even less.’ Gerry Wareham, Deputy Chief Crown . Prosecutor for South Yorkshire and Humberside, said: ‘We are aware of . the comments of the Coroner Mr Dorries in relation to the CPS’s decision . not to prosecute Kieran Beresford for allegedly causing the death of Mr . Kamlesh Ruparelia in 2010. 'I just lashed out at him. I connected really well. I just snapped' Kieran Beresford . ‘The burden of proof required for a criminal court is greater than that of a coroner’s court. In a criminal court we must prove ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the person committed all elements of the crime alleged. ‘The prosecution must also disprove any defence that the defendant was acting in self-defence. We worked closely with South Yorkshire Police and, based on the evidence available at the time, the CPS advised that Kieran Beresford should be charged with manslaughter for the killing of Mr Ruparelia. ‘Shortly before trial three new witness accounts were brought to the attention of CPS. Their evidence undermined the prosecution case as it supported the defence case that Kieran Beresford was acting in self-defence. ‘By law we must disclose to the defence any material in the case which could undermine the prosecution or assist the defence.  We cannot simply select the evidence which supports a prosecution. ‘We are also bound by the Code for Crown Prosecutors to consider at all stages of a case whether there remains a realistic prospect of a conviction and only proceed if this test is met. ‘After very careful consideration, taking into account this new evidence, we concluded that this was no longer the case and halted the prosecution. ‘At the earliest possible opportunity we informed Mr Ruparelia’s family and the court that the charge would be dropped. We also met Mr Ruparelia’s family to explain our decision. ‘Mr Beresford was convicted of having an offensive weapon and received a conditional discharge and £775 costs. Our deepest sympathies are with Mr Ruparelia’s family.’","Property manager Kamlesh Ruparelia, 55, knocked down 'like a skittle'

Australian scientists have warned that seaweed could smother small creatures living on the sea floor on the coast of the Arctic and Antarctic if melting ice exposes their environment. Animals including sponges that live in near perpetual darkness, protected by sea ice that blocks the sun's powerful rays in spring and summer but if the sea ice melts as the Earth's temperature warms up, they could be smothered by seaweed. Biologists are worried that if the sea ice melts earlier on in the year, shallow-water ecosystems will soak up more sunlight and algae will spread across the sea floor, changing the habitat of sponges, tunicates and worms that anchor to rocks dramatically. Australian scientists have warned that seaweed could smother little creatures like this tunicate living on the sea floor on the coasts of the Arctic and Antarctic if melting ice exposes their ecosystems . Graeme Clark, a biologist at the University of New South Wales, which conducted the research, told NBC News: 'Some areas where ice breaks out early in summer are already shifting to algal domination.' Scientists believe the early summer ice melt not only increases the time frame that seaweed can thrive under the sun but also intensifies the photosynthesising algae's exposure to the light. Creatures including sponges and worms live in near perpetual darkness, protected by sea ice (pictured) that blocks the sun's powerful rays in spring and summer . The summer solstice, which occurs between 20 and 23 June in the Northern Hemisphere and 20 to 23 December in the Southern Hemisphere is a particularly good time for algae to soak up the sun as rays travel straight to the sea floor.. The biologists said rays reflect off the seas' surface and do not reach the floor during early spring and autumn, while it is dark during the winter, affording the creatures protection. The amount of sunlight hitting seafloor communities would therefore increase exponentially if higher-intensity rays could reach the bottom of the seas for longer periods of time, the scientists said. Mr Clark said that if this happens it could cause a tipping point for ecosystems populated with invertebrates. Scientists believe tipping points can occur with the smallest of environmental changes. A study by marine biologists at the . University of New South Wales suggests more sunlight would upset . seafloor communities along the coast of Antarctica where animals . including tunicates, sponges and worms (similar to these pictured) stick to rocks on the sea floor . If the sea ice melts just a few days earlier than usual it could transform the sea floor and change the habitat from an invertebrate-dominated ecosystem to one overrun with seaweed. In a bid to work out how algae might respond to more intense sunlight, the marine biologists studied the same species of seaweed along the coast of East Antarctica as well as examining years of sunlight data from light monitors situated in the region. They discovered algae routinely pushed into regions with more sunlight and calculated that the light-seeking weed could replace up to one third of invertebrates living on the seafloor if melting sea ice exposed their environment. The survival of the small creatures is important as they filter sea water and provide surfaces for other organisms to grow on. Scientists believe early summer ice melt not only increases the time frame that seaweed thrives under the sun but also intensifies the photosynthesising algae's exposure to the light . So as well as the death of these invertebrates, other species could suffer too. Clark said: 'A lot of fish and other invertebrates . use the benthic [seafloor] invertebrate community as habitat and for food, so they . are going to be affected.' The effect is slightly less critical in deeper waters as the sea floor becomes is too deep for sunlight to reach and could in fact benefit seafloor communities. A recent study found sponges thrived when a giant ice shelf collapsed, possibly because phytoplankton bloomed in waters and gradually sunk down to the sea floor. However closer to shore, the spread of algae is not good news for sponges and worms. Laura Fillinger, a researcher in Germany involved in the recent sponge study concerning the Larsen A collapse, told NBC: It's probable that the light will increase and the macroalgae will explode...If they do, they will out compete the sponges.' Clark said a study in Svalbard, Norway has shown the trend occurring near the coast.","Australian biologists said some areas where ice melts in early summer are already being dominated by algae .

GIVEN the barrage of health warnings about salty, fatty and sugary food, you might think having an all-natural, unadulterated fruit smoothie would earn you some credit with the diet police. But no – now it seems that even pulped fruit is bad for us. Despite being seen as healthy alternatives to fizzy drinks and counting towards your five portions of fruit and vegetables a day, smoothies and fruit juice are actually the ‘new danger’ in the fight against obesity, according to nutritionists. Defence: Innocent, owned by Coca Cola, claims smoothies contain the same amount of sugar as whole fruit . They said smoothies can contain as much sugar as a large Coke. Juicing removes fibre and some of the nutrients that would be found in a fruit or vegetable. The natural fruit sugars in smoothies can also add hundreds of extra calories to your daily intake. Professor Barry Popkin said alerting people to the potential risks of smoothies and fruit juices was the ‘next step in the battle’ against obesity. He added: ‘In every country they’ve been replacing soft drinks with fruit juice and smoothies as the new healthy beverage.’ Danger: Smoothies and juices contain deceptively high amounts of sugar . He said it was far healthier to eat fruit or drink vegetable juice. Most people feel full after eating two oranges. However, smoothies contain the sugar of up to six oranges but are less filling than eating the fruit, making you more likely to want to eat afterwards. This undermines the perceived benefits of having a smoothie, said Professor Popkin, of the University of North Carolina. He added: ‘Pulped-up smoothies do nothing good for us, but give us the same amount of sugar as four to six oranges or a large Coke. It is deceiving.’ Firms such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been buying juice and smoothie rivals to cash in on their healthy reputation. Coca-Cola owns Innocent, which claims to be Europe’s top smoothie brand. A recent study found that people who ate whole fruit were less likely to get obesity-related type 2 diabetes, while those who drank fruit juice were at increased risk. Swapping fruit juice for fruit three times a week cuts the risk of type 2 diabetes by 7 per cent. Britons consume 3,144 calories a week from non-alcoholic drinks, a study by the University of Glasgow found last year. This adds 450 calories a day to our diets. Innocent said people who drank juice drinks were less likely to  be obese. It added: ‘Smoothies are made entirely from fruit and therefore contain the same amount of sugars that you would find in an equivalent amount of fruit.’","Smoothies contain 'same amount of sugar as a large coke,' says duo .

An artwork that has been on display for sixteen years has been draped in black cloth and may be removed after years of complaints from Hawaiian elders. Artist Hans Ladislaus' 'Forgotten Inheritance', which features human bones in sand, has been on display at the Hawaii Convention Center since 1997. However the Hawaii Tourism Authority which runs the center has succumbed to persistent opposition from native Hawaiian descendents who say the use of exposed ancestral bones is disrespectful. Controversy: Native Hawaiians have complained about the 'cultural insensitivity' of artist Hans Ladislaus' work 'Forgotten Inheritance' ever since it was installed at the Hawaii Convention Center in 1997, but only now are their wishes being honored . Removal: The Hawaii Convention Center has covered Hans Ladislaus' controversial artwork with black cloth - and may remove it permanently - after decades of complaints from native Hawaiians . The wall art was controversially covered up on Wednesday night during the 12th annual Native Hawaiian Convention. Native Hawaiian Legal Corporation executive director Moses Haia represents Paulette Ka'anohiokalani Kaleikini, a . recognized cultural descendant of the area, who has complained repeatedly to the . Hawai'i Tourism Authority about the piece. 'I don't know what the motive of the artist was with respect to what was depicted,' Haia told Hawaii News Now. 'I certainly know that in Hawai'i and given our cultural practices – when it comes to malama iwi, which is taking care of our ancestral bones, that it's a significant sign of disrespect. 'Based upon her cultural responsibility to malama iwi, [Kaleikini] met with what I believe was certain individuals with the Hawaii Tourism Authority that runs the Convention Center and requested, based upon her cultural practices, that panel be taken down because of what it stood for.' Opponents: Native Hawaiian descendent Paulette Ka'anohiokalani Kaleikini (left) and her lawyer Moses Haia say the artwork's use of ancestral bones is offensive . It is not clear why the center has now decided to uphold the complaints of elders, particularly as none of the highly respected committee members - including Native Hawaiians - objected to the work when it was selected and commissioned in 1996. State Arts Foundation officials say . they've been trying unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting with Ladislaus – . who now lives on the mainland – and Convention Center officials, Native .

Hawai'i Tourism Authority CEO Mike McCartney said action was being taken to replace the artwork. 'The HTA is working with the State Foundation to replace a piece of artwork in the Hawai'i Convention Center,' he said, according to KITV.com. 'It is important for us to honor and perpetuate our host culture and we are looking to include more pieces by Native Hawaiian artists.' However Rosegg said the piece, which is permanently mounted, could be destroyed if it's removed.

A resident, who did not wish to be named, said: 'It's a miracle she's survived so far, it's a long way down. 'I heard she crawled off the balcony but I'm not sure. From what I've heard, she's fighting for her life now.' Police say the little girl sustained serious internal injuries in the huge fall, and are currently investigating the cause of the incident. The estate contains a number of six-storey blocks of flats, some of which have concrete balconies that jut out of the side of the concrete buildings. A resident who lives in a block . opposite said: 'The poor little girl's mum is extremely upset. Since she . came back from the hospital, she's had people saying all sorts about . what happened. 'I gather she . was in the kitchen at the time, so she wasn't to know how it happened. Unfortunately, kids are kids. The little one is in a bad way, but I . think we're all thankful it hasn't been any worse. 'Her mum is really upset. I'm good friends with her and I've just spoken to her. She doesn't want to speak or see anyone. 'This could have happened to anyone and she was just unlucky it happened to her. The little one apparently took a turn for the worse this morning in hospital so she's not in a good way at all.' Another concerned neighbour said: 'The mum is in pieces about it all. She needs to be left to deal with it by herself, I think.' The block of concrete flats is one of around 14 blocks on a small street in the Barne Barton area of the city. The balcony in which the child fell from was five floors from the ground and appears to have a glass safety barrier. There was no police presence last night, but many residents and children were gathered outside the ground floor flat of the block of flats.","The little girl plunged around 65ft from the window of a flat in Plymouth .

A director whose CV includes racy TV shows such as Hollyoaks and Footballers’ Wives has been appointed editor of The Archers. Sean O’Connor will take over BBC Radio 4’s farming soap opera next month, replacing Vanessa Whitburn who steps down after 22 years in charge. The appointment is likely to raise eyebrows among the show’s notoriously sensitive listeners, who have previously raised concerns that show was being ‘sexed up’. Sean O'Connor will take over BBC Radio 4's . farming soap opera next month, replacing Vanessa Whitburn who steps down . after 22 years in charge . The BBC said it was seeking a ‘resilient’ replacement for Miss Whitburn, someone who knew how to ‘learn from your mistakes and say sorry when you’ve got it wrong’. Miss Whitburn earlier this year was forced to deny she had deliberately sensationalised life in Ambridge to compete with gritty TV soaps such as EastEnders. The show - which was originally billed as ‘an everyday story of country folk’ - is traditionally associated with the quieter aspects of rural life, rather than the sex and violence associated with urban dramas. It was established in May 1950 and is the world’s longest-running radio soap. Miss Whitburn was grilled by fans after a string of dramatic storylines including an arson attack dubbed ‘Farmageddon’ and a torrid extra-marital affair. Popular: The Archers is listened to by an average of 5.1million viewers a week . The death of Nigel Pargetter, who fell off a roof in 2011, caused outrage among some fans, despite resulting in a record audience. Writing in the Radio Times in May, one fan asked: ‘The Archers goes over the top with accidents and violent gangs. Are you trying to compete with soaps like East Enders?’ Miss Whitburn replied: ‘Before my time as editor Grace was burnt to death, Tom Forrest was in court for killing a poacher and there was a diamond smuggler in the village, so we’re possibly less melodramatic than we were then! ‘I don’t think The Archers has to compete with TV soaps. ‘Strong storylines such as Lilian’s affair with Paul should be balanced with gentler stories of community life – the fete and the pantomime, or how they’re going to raise money to repair the church organ.’ Sean O¿Connor also directed dramatic television soap, Hollyoaks . Mr O’Connor will take up his Archers role in mid-September and will be based at BBC Birmingham, where The Archers is recorded. It currently attracts 4.7 million listeners each week. Mr O’Connor, who previously worked on The Archers in the 1990s, has also been involved with EastEnders and Hollyoaks, as well the ITV show Footballers’ Wives and the Channel 5 drama Family Affairs. He said: ‘I’m honoured to take the reins of our national epic drama and to build on the extraordinary achievements of Vanessa Whitburn who dedicated much of her career to this unique cultural institution.’ Gwyneth Williams, controller of Radio 4, said: ‘The Archers is our most loved and longstanding daily drama and the job of editor carries great responsibility and trust. Vanessa Whitburn, pictured, is stepping down as editor of The Archers - the longest-running soap opera in the world . ‘Sean is steeped in storytelling and will be working with the immensely talented Archers team in Birmingham so I am extremely pleased to be welcoming him back to Ambridge.’ An online advertisement for the role specified the new editor would have to be confident, brave and resilient. It said the role required candidates to be good at ‘learning from your mistakes and saying sorry when you got it wrong’. One skill explicitly requested was ‘resilience’, with the ‘ability to maintain personal effectiveness by managing emotions in the face of pressure, setbacks or when dealing with provocative situations’.","Sean O’Connor will take over BBC Radio 4’s farming soap opera .

Instagram has hit 100m users after less than three years in operation - and only a month after it reached 90m. The retro photo sharing website passed the milestone a mere 28 months after it launched in October 2010, its founder revealed today. Analysts said the achievement is all the more impressive as to sign up for the service users have to have an iPhone or Android device. The instagram team posted a picture of themselves all creating an instagram picture to celebrate the achievement . Instagram has 100m users, it was announced today. Here's how it compares: . Facebook: One billion users . Twitter: 500m users . Google+: 135m . Linkedin: 200m. Instagram only recently created a website so that users could look at photos on their desktop computers, reflecting the change in how people use the Internet. Instagram now has one fifth of the number of Twitter users, its closest rival, but reached 100m far more quickly. Twitter launched in 2006 and hit 100m in 2011, meaning it took five years to build the same consumer base. In a blog post Instagram co-founder Kevin Systrom wrote: ‘It’s easy to see this as an accomplishment for a company, but I think the truth is that it’s an accomplishment for our community. ‘Now, more than ever, people are capturing the world in real-time using Instagram - sharing images from the farthest corners of the globe. ‘What we see as a result is a world more connected and understood through photographs.’ Instagram is primarily a mobile service, but recently launched a website so people can see their pictures and those of their friends from a desktop computer as well . Instagram was bought by Facebook last year in a $1bn deal that made Systrom a rich man, but it recently suffered its first major setback in a row over its terms of service. Instagram was forced into a U-turn when users complained that new rules would allow it to sell its images for profit to advertisers. Since then there has been speculation that Instagram may be facing a backlash - but the 100m milestone seems to put that to rest. The 100m mark is in the number of active users, or those who used Instagram at least once in the last month. In just 40 days the figure has shot up 11.1 per cent - growth which has astounded analysts. Facebook itself took just over three years to reach the 100m user milestone and hit it in 2008. The social networking site was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard bedroom in 2004. Twitter currently has 500m users, Google+ has around 135m and Linkedin has more than 200m.

The traditional living room has been turned into a media zone where the household watches television while using tablets and smartphones, according to new research. Ofcom's annual State of the Nation report revealed that households are increasingly reverting to sitting around a TV set and watching shows together again - a habit that harks back to the bygone days of the 1950s. However, around half of viewers now spend this time multi-tasking, streaming videos, sending instant messages, tweeting and posting to Facebook. The bygone days of the 1950s where families watched TV together, pictured, may be making a comeback. Around 91 per cent of adults now sit and watch television in their living room each week . According to research from Leiden University, six out of ten meals in British homes are now eaten while watching TV. Yet researchers found that eating on a sofa while watching your favourite show could be making you fat. In a series of experiments, Dutch researchers made diners carry out complicated memory tests while eating food that was either salty, sweet, or sour. The study found that those who were distracted by the mental task were more likely to perceive the food as bland. Another experiment found they consumed more food in order to obtain  the same taste level and were less aware of how much they ate. This has also lead to the rise in what's been dubbed 'media meshing' where people use these devices to virtually discuss the programme they are watching. Ofcom said a quarter of viewers 'mesh' while watching TV and during . this year's Wimbledon men's tennis final, for example, a total of 1.1 million people . worldwide tweeted 2.6 million times using hashtags relating to the match. Half of telly addicts instead 'media stack', which is when they use their phones or tablets to carry out activities not related in anyway to the show they're watching. This includes liking and commenting on Facebook posts and shopping online. The rise of the 'digital hub' has been caused by an increase in sales of smartphones and tablets. According to the report, the average household now owns more than . three types of internet-enabled device. While one in five families have six or . more gadgets in their home that can be connected to the web. Despite watching TV together, a rise in phone and tablet sales means people are doing so while tweeting, shopping and streaming videos turning living rooms into digital hubs, pictured. Second TVs are also being replaced in favour of 'jumbo' sets around 43 inches big . Half of adults now have a smartphone, and the amount of tablets have more than doubled - last year a total of 11 per cent of homes owned a tablet, this is now around a quarter. During the 1990s and 2000s, second television sets became more popular, especially with children watching TV in their bedrooms. This trend is being replaced with families buying just one bigger, so-called 'jumbo' TV sets measuring 43 inches or more. More than 41 per cent of homes now just have the single set compared to last year with sales of larger screens increasing from 4.3 per cent. The number of five to 15-year-olds with a . television in their bedroom has dropped from 69 per cent in 2007 to 52 . per cent in the first quarter of this year.","Study finds 91% of adults watch TV in their living room each week .

The online retailer now requires customers to spend a minimum of £10 on some items in order to qualify for free delivery, but any order with a book still qualifies for free postage regardless of the price. Consequently, unusual book titles and albums by old X-Factor contestants that cost less than a stamp are proving popular after shoppers discovered they can be used to slash delivery costs. Book titles including 'AQA Anthology Study Guide Poems from Duffy, Armitage, Pre 1914', Blackstone's 'Statutes on Contract, Tort and Restitution 2010-2011' and 'Towards a Post-Fordist Welfare State?' have proved surprisingly popular, after bargain hunters shared their tips on a money saving website. Amazon announced last week that customers must spend a minimum of £10 on certain items to use its 'Free Super Saver Delivery' option. Electronics costing less than £10 incur a delivery charge of £3.99, while products from the retailer's clothes, DIY, groceries, health, sports, home and jewellery ranges will set shoppers back £4.28 for delivery plus a charge of £1.73 per item, equivalent to £6.01.

A mug selected on Amazon.co.uk costs £6.75 but incurs a whopping £6.01 delivery charge following the retailer's shake-up of which items qualify for its 'Super Saver Delivery' package . Savvy shoppers also identified two books - Blackstone's Statutes on Contract, Tort and Restitution 2010-2011 and Towards a Post-Fordist Welfare State at 42p that would reduce the cost of orders substantially. However, there is often a limited supply of such niche titles as shoppers try to take advantage of the delivery charge loophole.

Possible helpful CDS include titles by Air, Phil Collins and old X-Factor contestants. 'Everybody Hertz' by French electronic duo Air costs just 94p and 'The Impossible Dream"" by X-Factor runner-up Andy Abraham was just £1.27 at the time of writing.

A DVD cover for a film about an Aboriginal girl group has been labelled 'racist and sexist' for relegating its female stars to the background to give Irish actor Chris O'Dowd centre stage. The original DVD cover for The Sapphires features the four singers in prominent positions, with O'Dowd - who plays the group's manager - at the back. But on the U.S. version of the DVD, O'Dowd takes centre stage while The Sapphires fade into an entirely blue background. Spot the difference: On the Australian DVD cover, left, the Sapphires take centre stage, but in the U.S. version, seen right, Chris O'Dowd dominates the cover while the Aboriginal singers fade into a blue background . The drastic change saw a petition launched against the 'whitewashed and gender-washed' cover for the film - which is based on a true story - on social media, a report in The Telegraph said. Lucy Manne, who started the online petition, said: 'The Sapphires is a wonderful film about four Aboriginal women battling against racism and sexism in the entertainment industry of the 1960s. 'That's why so many of us were . disappointed to see a whitewashed and gender-washed cover that . reinforces the problems The Sapphires worked so hard to overcome.' Blogger MaryAnn Johanson agreed, writing on flickfilosopher.com: 'The women are Aborigines. They are black black black black blackety-black black. Not blue. 'Oh, and they're women.' More than 10,000 people put their names to the petition, and U.S. distributor Anchor Bay Entertainment has now apologised for the cover. The real-life members of The Sapphires had also written to the U.S. civil rights group the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People to ask it to add its support to the campaign. The letter on behalf of Laurel Robinson, Lois Peeler and their cousins Beverley Briggs and Naomi Mayers said: 'As . I'm sure you can appreciate, the treatment of people of colour in .

"By . Laura Collins In Billings, Montana and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:23 EST, 6 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:28 EST, 6 September 2013 . Montana's highest court ruled today that a state judge does not have the authority to amend a controversial 30-day sentence he handed down to a former teacher convicted of raping a 14-year-old girl. District Judge Todd Baugh last week sentenced ex-Billings high school teacher Stacey Rambold to 30 days in jail for the 2007 rape of Cherice Moralez in his home. He said the girl, who committed suicide before the case went to trial, seemed older than her 14 years and was 'probably as much in control of the situation' as her teacher. Blocked: Montana Supreme Court voted 4-2 barring Judge Todd Baugh (pictured) from holding a hearing to possibly amend rapist's 30-day sentence . The lenient jail term and the judge's provocative argumentation sparked widespread outrage among women's groups and victims’ advocates. Amid public outcry and growing pressure from the persecution, who vowed to appeal the sentence, Judge Baugh apologized for his earlier remarks and called a hearing to re-examine and possibly amend Rambold's sentence - a move the state attorney general challenged as being outside Baugh's legal authority. On Friday, Montana Supreme Court agreed, ruling 4-2 against Baugh's planned unilateral action, and paving the way for prosecutors to file an appeal. ‘We conclude that the stated intent of the District Court (Baugh) to alter the initially imposed oral sentence in today's scheduled hearing is unlawful and that the proceeding should be arrested,’ the court ruled, without commenting on the validity of the sentence itself. The decision came down just hours before the state judge was to convene the hearing to reconsider the sentence. In a bizarre twist, the defense joined the prosecution in opposing the scheduled hearing , saying that it would be 'without legal authority.' The prosecution said the 54-year-old disgraced educator probably should have received a minimum of two years in prison instead of the 15-year-term with all but a month suspended that Baugh had given him. Earlier this week, Judge Baugh caused further outrage by claiming that his paltry sentence ‘actually upped’ the convicted rapist’s ‘debt to society’. In a written addendum to his sentence handed down in Billings District Court Monday the judge stated: ‘Had the defendant pleaded guilty or been convicted by a jury three years ago, he would have had a basis from which to argue for a minimum sentence.’ Victim Cherice Moralez committed suicide on February 6, 2010. She shot herself in her mother’s bed just three weeks before her 17th birthday. Horror: Cherice Moralez, pictured, shot herself dead in her mother's bed after being repeatedly raped by a teacher who will serve just 30 days in jail . Teacher: Rambold, 54, lost his house, his job, his teaching license and his wife as a result of the charges. His lawyer suggested, and the judge seemed to agree on Monday, that he had been 'punished enough' According to her mother, Auliea Hanlon, the pending trial of teacher Stacey Rambold - 49 when the rapes were committed - and trauma of the abuse were ‘major factors’ in her daughter’s death. Speaking to MailOnline Mrs Hanlon said that her daughter had been ‘in hell,’ shunned by classmates and bullied following the revelations of the abuse. Her death complicated the prosecution of former Billings Senior High School teacher Rambold, now 54, who was arrested and charged with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent in 2008. Prosecutors who had sought to put Rambold behind bars instead settled for a three-year deferred prosecution. According to the terms of the agreement the case would be dismissed after this term if Rambold pleaded guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and entered a three-stage sex offender treatment program. But in December 2012 the case was revived when it transpired that Rambold had violated the terms of the program, having contact with minors and engaging in a sexual relationship [not with a minor] without informing his counselor. In his written explanation Judge Baugh maintained that these violations were ‘not significant’. He stated: ‘There were violations of the treatment program, but involved no violence, no inappropriate sexual conduct, and no new criminal activity. ‘Defendant’s old treatment provider recommended that the Defendant still be assessed as a low risk offender and treatable in the community. Critic: Auliea Hanlon, Cherice's . mother criticized the judge's apology as 'meaningless' ‘Knowing that the Defendant had enrolled in another sexual offender treatment program, the Court is faced with deciding if the Defendant should go to prison for relatively minor infractions.’ Judge Baugh went on to state that there was other information that could not be publicly released but had played a part in the court’s decision: a July 2013 pre-sentence report from the Department of Corrections, an August 2009 psychological/psychosocial evaluation of Rambold, and two interviews with the victim in 2009. Judge Baugh was forced to apologize for his comments in court, in which he claimed that the victim was ‘older than her chronological years’ and ‘in control of the situation’ in which she was raped in Rambold’s car, his then marital home and on school premises. Similarly he drew fierce criticism when appearing to diminish the crime as, in defending his sentence, he said: ‘I think people have in mind that this was some violent, forcible, horrible rape ... but it wasn’t this forcible, beat up rape.’ In his addendum he conceded: ‘Rape under any circumstances is a horrible violent offense. Some involved physical beatings, broken bones. Others, as here, involve young victims legally not capable of consenting. All are traumatic and all are crimes.’ Though he stated that he believed a prison sentence to be ‘appropriate’ in this case Judge Baugh   stood by his decision to suspend all but 31 days of Rambold’s 15 years plus one day’s credit for time served. He said: ‘Based on all circumstances, the Court upped Mr Rambold’s debt to society from the almost expired three years Deferred Prosecution Agreement to the 15 years suspended sentence.’ Rambold’s sentence puts him on probation for 15 years and requires him to finish sex-offender treatment and to register as a convicted sex offender. Yellowstone County prosecutor Scott Twito is still reviewing the sentence with a view to finding some legal grounds for appeal, and Judge Baugh’s explanation and defense of his decision will do little to silence the voices of those clamoring for his resignation.

This vintage 1897 Daimler Wagonette is believed to be the world’s first wedding transport after a black and white photograph of the car during a 1903 wedding ceremony has been uncovered. The Haynes Motor Museum in Yeovil, Somerset has swept the cobwebs off this stunning British-built classic and now allows newlyweds to recreate the vintage look by having their wedding photos onboard the historic car. World's first wedding car: This photograph taken of the 1903 wedding of James Andrews and Rosa Gough suggests that this is the first example of cars being used as wedding transport . The 1897 British-built Daimler Wagonette, with a top speed of just 11mph,  dates back to the first days of motoring when cars were better known as ‘horseless carriages’. Its basic two-cylinder petrol engine only generates 6.5 horsepower but in its day it was at the forefront of technology.

Boris Johnson is out in front in the battle to succeed David Cameron, a new poll of Tory members reveals. The London Mayor has the support of almost two in five Conservatives activists to become party leader. While he sought to play down talk of a leadership bid today, Mr Johnson insisted he remains an ‘eternal optimist’ that something will ‘crop up’ after his term in the capital ends. Race: A new survey of Conservative grassroots members reveals who they want to see as leader if David Cameron is ousted . Out in front: The London Mayor, pictured taking part in the RideLondon event on Sunday, is favourite to succeed David Cameron . The survey of Conservative party members found six out of 10 think Mr Cameron should quit if he is ousted from Number 10 at the next election. Mr Johnson is way ahead of all the other challengers, despite maneuvering by the likes of Home Secretary Theresa May and Education Secretary Michael Gove. Mr Johnson receives the support of 38 per cent of grassroots members, double the number backing Mrs May. Mr Gove, who has repeatedly insisted he has no leadership ambitions, is backed by 13 per cent while Chancellor George Osborne, whose stock in the party is rising as the economy recovers, got just three per cent of first preferences. Back at work: David Cameron was seen at the back door of Number 10 this morning, after returning from last week's holiday to Portugal . Professor Bale said: ‘Basically, our survey shows us that Cameron is toast if he can’t deliver the Tory Party a second term, and that Boris is best-placed to replace him, if he can get into the Commons, because he commands support that’s as deep as it is wide. ‘May is running a credible second, but Gove’s support is narrower. Osborne maybe in with a chance but he will have to make up a lot of ground.  No one else looks like a serious prospect.’ While Mr Johnson garners a lot of support in London, he also appeals to younger voters. Professor . Bale added: ‘Theresa May does well among women and appeals reasonably . well to working class as well as middle-class members, which suggests . that a May-led Tory party may attract more support among women and the . fabled C2s. ‘You can’t rule out Gove or even Osborne. But in the end, Boris is the man to beat.’ Iron lady: Home Secretary Theresa May has been likened to Germany's Angela Merkel and has been boosted by cuts in immigration and crime . Out of favour: Education Secretary Michael Gove and Chancellor George Osborne were left trailing in the poll . However Mr Johnson dismissed the poll as ‘all fantasy politics’ as he Johnson was challenged over his ambitions as he took questions on LBC 97.3. He added: ‘It’s not going to happen and what you’ve got is a Prime Minister who I think is increasingly confident and on top of his game.’ He insisted that while the general election is due in 2015, he will have ‘another full year as Mayor of the greatest city on earth’ to last until 2016. And after that he will ‘completely deliquesce, something will crop up, I’m an eternal optimist’. Asked what he would do about Deputy PM Nick Clegg if he ever became Prime Minister, Mr Johnson replied: ‘Well, thankfully that is a completely hypothetically question which I can swerverama. ‘But what I would say is that, and I’m sure this is the view of David Cameron as well who I think will continue to be Prime Minister after 2015.’ He added there is a ‘real, real chance now, a bigger chance than ever there is going to be an absolute Conservative majority at the next election’.","Survey of grassroots shows 38% want Boris Johnson as leader next time .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 05:55 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:27 EST, 5 September 2013 . Sex education lessons should include lessons in the ‘menacing’ impact on young girls, Nick Clegg warned today. But the Deputy Prime Minister revealed his call for guidance given to teachers to be updated for the digital age is being block by Education Secretary Michael Gove. The Cabinet split emerged as Mr Clegg said more needed to be done to teach children about relationships, amid warnings young girls feel under pressure to behave like porn stars. Scroll down for video . Cabinet split: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said he had failed to persuade the Tories to update sex education lessons to cover the dangers of the internet . Officials teaching literature for sex education lessons were last updated in 2000, and contain no mention of the internet. Since then there has been an explosion in the number of children accessing hardcore images online, and the emergence of cyberbullying as a major threat faced by youngsters. But Mr Clegg blamed the Conservatives for refusing to change the guidance to reflect the impact of pornography on young people. ‘I just happen to think in this instance, given how menacing this is particularly for young girls, my own view is this is an area where we need to both update the guidance… and really raise the expectation that all schools do this properly in the classroom.’ Speaking on his radio phone-in the Deputy PM admitted this view was ‘not shared across government’. He told LBC 97.3: ‘I haven’t been able to persuade Michael Gove and the Conservatives to move all the way on this. ‘They’ve moved some of the way, so . that for instance there is going to be guidance in the national . curriculum on IT classes which has some bearing on this. Reforms: Education Secretary Michael Gove has warned against over-burdening teachers with directives from Whitehall . ‘The national curriculum - even though that doesn’t need to be taught by all schools - does at least raise the expectation that schools should teach this. ‘It’s one of the things that in government you debate and what I find, every day of my working life that there are some arguments where you dig your heels in and you absolutely persist until you win and there are others where you basically compromise and we compromised on this.’ He said Mr Gove is a ‘perfectly intelligent bloke’ who has a ‘very well-expressed and articulate view that schools shouldn’t be burdened with too many directives from central government’. The Office of the Children’s Commissioner has warned that easy access to online pornography encourages teenage boys to see girls as sex objects and to engage in risky sexual behaviour. In a major report it lifted the lid on the corrosive effect of hardcore porn on children, concluding that those who access adult images and videos are more likely to lose their virginity at a younger age. There are even indications that boys who look at violent porn are more likely to become sexually aggressive. The study called for urgent action by ministers, schools and parents to ‘develop children’s resilience to pornography’ after finding that a significant number have access to sexually explicit images. Secondary schools were criticised for concentrating on the mechanics of sex during sex education classes rather than the importance of loving relationships and the report called for primary school pupils to be taught about the difference between ‘good’ and ‘bad’ touching. In response, Mr Gove insisted he takes 'whole question of sex education very seriously'. Speaking at a Policy Exchange event, he added: 'We conducted a review recently of personal, social, health and economic education and one of the conclusions we drew from that is that the right thing to do it to trust teachers. 'As soon as you create a new set of guidance to respond to what are new and challenging circumstances there is a risk that a new technology or a changing social more will render it time bound. 'So I think the most important thing to do, as schools are, that they are in touch with organisations who can help provide all the advice that students need in order to be able to grow up healthy and confident people.' But he denied a rift with the Lib Dem leader, insisting: 'I didn’t hear Nick on the radio. I love Nick Clegg.' The Department for Education insists that teachers should turn to expert advice on sex and relationship education, warning official guidance laid down by Whitehall could soon be rendered out of date by developments in technology. A recent review of personal, social, health and economic education lessons found that the existing guidance ‘offers a sound framework for sex and relationship education in school’, a spokesman said. ‘The best people to help schools deal with changing technology are the experts. 'Our SRE guidance directs schools to draw on the up-to-date advice produced by experts to use in sex and relationship education. Bodies including the PSHE Association, the Sex Education Forum and government agency CEOP all produce material and advice for teachers to use. ‘We have also given almost £3million to Beatbullying, the Diana Award, Kidscape and the National Children’s Bureau to provide state-of-the-art materials on cyberbullying. We have told schools to access these to develop their own policies.’","Guidance given to teachers not updated since 2000, Deputy PM says .

Their output of UV rays breach the legal limit by more than three times in the worst cases and put users at increased risk of cancer. The legal limit for sunbed emissions is 0.3 watts per square metre - the equivalent of the midday summer sun in Spain. A woman lies on a sunbed but according to new research at least seven out of ten fail council safety tests . Nearly seven in 10 sunbeds tested by council inspectors in the north of England over the past two years pumped out dangerously high levels of UV rays. But local authority inspection reports reveal some sunbeds gave out rays more than three times that level. Critics last night described the revelations as a 'wake-up call' and demanded tougher regulation of the industry. Fiona Hall, Lib Dem MEP for the North East, said: 'Local authorities must work together to improve the system to make sure sunbeds are safe, whether that be a requirement that tanning salons are licensed, or those operating the salons have a standard of training. 'The Department of Health should also get involved because there are serious health implications.'Of the 448 sunbeds tested by trading standards officers in 2012 and 2013, an astonishing 310 fell short of safety standards. These included all 20 beds tested in Gateshead and 78 out of 103 in Durham. Businesses flouting the regulations were all told to re-tube their sunbeds. Local authorities in York, Northumberland, Cumbria, Hartlepool and North Tyneside admitted they had not carried out any tests on sunbeds while others, including Blackpool and Stockton-on-Tees, said they were planning investigations later in the year. Only in Sunderland did inspectors put sunbeds out of commission after 131 out of 227 failed for blasting out dangerously high levels of radiation. Yinka Ebo, of Cancer Research UK, called on the Government to give local authorities more powers to license the industry. Gina Mucklin was left devastated after being told she had skin cancer aged only 22 . He added: 'Sunbeds that fail to meet the British and European standard are putting users at even greater risk of skin cancer.' Gill Rogers, of the Sunbed Association, which represents about 20 per cent of the industry, warned some salon owners would continue to ignore the regulations because the UV emissions inspection regime was so inconsistent. He said: 'What is happening is not satisfactory, but local authorities need to toughen up. 'They should be shutting sunbeds or salons if they fail, but often they do not go back and re-check after testing. 'Those who are compliant are at a financial disadvantage because customers often want a bed with tubes which emit at higher levels because they get a tan easier, so they will lose business to another salon.' Chris Woods, of law firm Mercury Legal, said soaring numbers of people with 'horrific' burns were seeking compensation. He added: 'The lack of regulation on tanning salons is frightening. 'We're in no doubt that in future we will see a sharp rise in skin cancer linked to sunbed abuse.' A Dundee University study this year found some sunbeds emit UV radiation six times stronger than midday Spanish summer sun. And last year experts at the International Prevention Research Institute and the European Institute of Oncology found that skin cancer - melanoma - can be directly linked to sunbed use. It also revealed sunbeds account for almost 900 deaths every year in Europe. Andy Foster, of the Trading Standards Institute, described our findings as 'alarming'. He said: 'We take matters concerning product safety very seriously but it's unrealistic to expect all sunbeds to be tested by trading standards. 'The UK's consumer protection system is designed to put the obligation of safety on the businesses who supply such services.' AVID sunbed user Gina Mucklin was left devastated after being told she had skin cancer aged only 22. The output of UV rays from sunbeds breach the legal limit by more than three times in the worst cases and put users at increased risk of cancer . The Stockton-on-Tees hairdresser, now 24, began visiting tanning salons when she was just 14. After a visit to the doctor in 2010, she was diagnosed with malignant melanoma, caused by a tiny freckle on her leg. 'I used sunbeds because my friends did and I thought being brown would make me look good,"" said Miss Mucklin (left). 'I would go in school lunch hour a couple of times a week. 'I would always choose the stronger sunbed and stay on it for longer than necessary. 'When I look back now, I can't believe that I did it. I was stupid and will never go near a sunbed again. 'Without a doubt, using sunbeds is what caused my melanoma,' said Miss Mucklin, who burnt her body several times through sunbed use.","Legal limit for sunbed emissions is 0.3 watts per square metre - equivalent of the Spanish midday sun .

Red-coloured sprouts are also being trialled at the company's site in Lincolnshire . The vegetable that most sharply divides opinion around the family dinner table is to get a flavour makeover in an ambitious bid to boost its popularity, according to a new report yesterday. Generations of children have groaned at the appearance of Brussels sprouts on their plate at mealtimes and determinedly pushed the leafy green vegetable to one side. But now a major new campaign is being launched to shake up the healthy sprout market and introduce a variety of different tastes to the leafy green vegetables. Trade magazine The Grocer said yesterday: 'The humble sprout is being given a makeover with new flavour strengths, and even colours, in a bid to encourage more Brits to eat the much maligned vegetable.'da . It reports that Produce World, a major supplier of brassicas and other vegetables to leading high street supermarket chains, is running field trials of mild-tasting and strong-tasting sprouts at its site in Butterwick, Lincolnshire. The new sprouts would be harvested later this year and if they performed well in taste tests, were likely to be grown commercially next year and could be on store shelves by Christmas 2014. Dara O'Doherty, new product development manager at Produce World told the magazine: 'We are just trying to make people aware and increase the marketing around sprouts and increase the fixture in store.' She said that strong-tasting sprouts would appeal to the 'sprout traditionalists.' Red-coloured sprouts are also being trialled and the firm already commercially grows the Flower Sprout - a cross between the Brussels sprout and kale, for a major retailer. Generations of children have groaned at the appearance of Brussels sprouts on their plate at mealtimes and determinedly pushed the leafy green vegetable to one side . The company is also trialling a new type of brassica that can be used both as a lettuce and as a cabbage. It is milder in flavour than cabbage but stronger than a lettuce, as well as red-veined cavolo nero and coloured kales. Sprouts became part of our staple 'meat and two veg' diet during and after the Second World War mainly due to rationing, but in the 80s and 90s their popularity was affected by changes in our eating habits and increasingly exotic diets. They also bore the brunt of schoolboy jokes which helped dampen the enthusiasm of an entire generation that led to general sales, outside of the Christmas market, falling into decline through the 90s. However, sprout popularity rose again during the noughties as a result of them often being used in recipes and TV cookery programmes by celebrity chefs. It is estimated that as much as 80 per cent of total British sprout sales take place in the two week Christmas and New Year period.","Campaign to introduce new tastes to the leafy green vegetable .

'When school students saw the coconut they called the principal, who then contacted the police.' After studying the coconut, the 'ruqyah' deemed it to be nothing more than a hoax.

Stories coming from across the globe include a child peeing in a Chinese store, a woman vomiting and passing out in an IKEA in Israel, New Yorkers using the shop's creche so they can have a break, Germans dropping their kids off so they can play tennis, and people sleeping in China's stores to escape the summer heat. The Swedish furniture company has often taken a tolerant stance on the disrespectful behaviour of its customers, its policy being that if people visit the store for other reasons, they are more likely to return to buy something. Shopping fatigue: Two tired female IKEA fans take a break in one of the beds at the Beijing store . But for shoppers who are genuinely there to shop, such behaviour could be seen as off-putting. Perhaps . the most shocking, and the most recent, of such stories is a . grandmother helping her son drop his pants and pee into a bottle, while . supporting him standing on one of the shop's beds. The . grandmother and her grandson had reportedly both been asleep in the bed. When the boy woke up, his grandmother helped him relieve himself by . holding up an empty water bottle. According to South China Morning Post, urine dripped onto the new showroom mattress he was standing on. The news service said the Beijing flagship store, which spans 42,000 square metres, is also awash with people picnicking at any available table and chairs, setting up their flasks and food and leaving behind the rubbish. Where all the cool kids go: Visiting IKEA with no intention of buying has become a trend in Beijing . Welcome home: It is not unusual to see people napping, meeting up with friends or having a snack in the display 'rooms' in IKEA Beijing . And . it is now renowned for the problem of its sleeping 'customers', . something one worker in the bed section shrugged off, saying: I think . it's just that shopping behaviour in China is very different,' he told . the news service. The . flagship store has to employ extra staff to change the sheets every . other day, but business is now booming in the Chinese market, where its . 12 stores pulled in over $7.5 billion in the 2012 fiscal year. This tolerance towards unruly customers appears to be a global policy. In . Israel staff concerned for the welfare of an apparently drunk woman let . her sleep off her hangover in a bed after she vomited on a showroom . couch. Rather than being . emitted from the shop, she was allowed to sleep it off and was . undisturbed throughout the evening until the store was closing. Swedish hospitality: IKEA has not taken any measures against people making themselves at home, because it sees it as a future investment . Quality time: All that is needed for this to simulate a night in is a television . A statement from the Netanya outlet, quoted in the Times of Israel, . said the woman 'felt unwell when she arrived at the store, and our . people therefore permitted her to rest until she felt better. 'We wish her the best of health.' New . Yorkers and Germans alike have been unashamedly using the furniture . store's free creche to release themselves from the responsibilities of . parenthood and to have some free adult time. In Germany, parents have played tennis or got their hair done while kids were dropped off to play at the creche, according to Der Spiegel Online. Just hanging: Most sofas and beds are occupied as Beijing citizens go for some Scandinavian TLC . Family day out: Beijing citizens make themselves comfortable in IKEA's mattress section . And in New York the service is often openly used by parents so they can go for lunch or shop elsewhere, said the New York Times. Some . people may be abusing the free services of the furniture company, but . while profits are soaring it seems unlikely its customer policy will . change. Gerard Bos, customer relations manager at IKEA UK and Ireland told the Mail Online in a statement: . 'As . part of the IKEA shopping experience, we aim to offer a fun day out for . the whole family and we welcome everybody to be inspired by our range . and to touch and feel our products.

Comedian Jim Davidson has launched an angry tirade against Celebrity MasterChef winner Adrian Edmondson, labelling him an ‘arrogant, self-satisfied lefty’ and ‘the unfunniest man in the world’. The outburst came in response to a newspaper article in which Edmondson criticised Davidson as being  ‘racist’, ‘homophobic’ and ‘dull’. The Young Ones star clearly infuriated the former Big Break host, who was recently cleared of historical sex offence claims. Spat: Ade Edmondson, left, was labelled 'arrogant, self satisfied and lefty' by Jim Davidson, right . Davidson, 59, mocked Edmondson because his wife Jennifer Saunders is ‘more talented’ and ‘more famous’ than him. Davidson posted a message on his website stating that he’d seen Edmondson criticising him, adding: ‘Getting a slagging from the unfunniest man in the world is funny, eh? I’ve never liked that arrogant self-satisfied lefty, and I am so glad I get up his snooty nose. ‘Imagine being a comedian and having a wife that is more talented, famous and funny?  Poor b******. Ade, I doubt you will read this, although your ego won’t allow you not to. Grow up you silly little boy. ‘Look forward to seeing you on celeb chef things again or showing us your country on BBC2, but don’t try and be funny – it’s pathetic!’ Hitting out: Davidson mocked Edmondson for not being as funny as his wife Jennifer Saunders . Edmondson previously complained that Davidson embodied the kind of comedy which he hates, and which inspired his own ‘alternative’ stance in the 1980s. He said: ‘Comedy on TV was mainly men in dickie bows telling racist and homophobic gags – they were all like Jim Davidson. It was kind of dull.’ Reality: Davidson was thrown off Hell's Kitchen for allegedly making homophobic remarks . Edmondson, 56, beat Les Dennis and Janet Street-Porter to the MasterChef title on Friday after cooking a faultless three-course meal of venison and sea bass for judges John Torode and Gregg Wallace. Five-times married Davidson has previously appeared on a TV cookery show himself – Hell’s Kitchen  in 2007 – but was axed after making homophobic comments in which he branded gay men ‘shirtlifters’. The former Generation Game host  found himself in the news this year when he was arrested by officers from Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police investigation into historic sex offence claims. The Crown Prosecution Service said on August 31 that it had considered ten allegations against Mr Davidson but concluded there was ‘insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction in relation to all complaints’. The comic’s solicitor Henri Brandman said: ‘My client Jim Davidson was, of course, arrested a number of months ago in respect of allegations of a historical sexual nature. 'He is pleased to have received news today that there will be no further action relating to the allegations.’ Davidson’s previous controversies include refusing to go on stage at Plymouth Pavilions in 2003, saying that he could not perform his act with wheelchair users watching from the front row.","Davidson was referring to Ade Edmondson's comments in a newspaper interview .

"By . Stuart Woledge . PUBLISHED: . 05:14 EST, 7 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:05 EST, 7 September 2013 . New powers to test doctors' language skills could be introduced after a survey showed that patients' lives were being put at risk. An alarming 66 cases were investigated by senior NHS staff in 2011 . after patients complained that they had received poor treatment from doctors who had a poor grasp of the English language. In an attempt to tackle the problem, the Government has proposed introducing language tests specifically for doctors arriving from EU countries in what would amount to a change to EU law. Powers: The Government is seeking for a change to EU law to allow the GMC to test language skills of doctors . Although the General Medical Council can test the English of doctors from non EU countries, it has been banned from testing the skills of those arriving from member states since 1983. More than 25,000 doctors from the EU are registered to practice in the UK, none of whom have ever been tested for their English skills. Health minister Dr Dan Poulter said: . 'Overseas doctors make a hugely valuable contribution to the NHS but it . is clear that tougher checks are needed. 'We have already strengthened the way doctors' language skills are checked at a local level. Important step: Health minister Dan Poulter said the change would prevent doctors with limited English from practicing in the UK . 'These . new powers are an important step in making the system even stronger by . allowing the GMC to carry out checks on a national level before they . start work in the UK and prevent doctors who do not have the necessary . knowledge of English from treating patients.' Roughly half of the 500 senior doctors . responsible for investigating complaints took part in a poll, which . revealed the scale of the language problem. In 2008 German Dr Daniel Urbani killed Cambridge patient David Gray when he confused two drugs and gave him 10 times the recommended dose of diamorphine. Under the Government's plans, the GMC would not be given the right to automatically test all EU doctors, but it would be able to carry out tests if concerns were raised when they registered to work. Inspectors could be given the right to check competency when looking at qualifications, how long doctors have been registered in other countries and what experience they have. Red flags might include doctors turning up with interpreters, poor English in interviews or poor written English on application forms. Any worries could then prompt full testing of the doctor's language skills. The new plans would also allow the GMC to assess any doctor if language concerns arise during a fitness-to-practise investigation. At present, the GMC has no powers to carry out such checks during its hearings. Lethal dose: Dr Daniel Urbani killed a patient after confusing two different drugs . Chief executive of the GMC Niall Dickson said: 'We are delighted that the Government is consulting on changes to the Medical Act to give us new powers to check the English language skills of all doctors when we have concerns about them. 'This is an important move that will help protect patients and will be welcomed across the country.' A spokesman for the British Medical Association (BMA) said: 'It is vital for clinical safety that doctors working in the UK have the appropriate English language skills to communicate effectively with colleagues and their patients. 'The BMA believes that it is right that we consider enhancing the GMC's powers to ensure doctors working in the UK can speak English well enough before they treat patients.' At a local level, staff called responsible officers - appointed senior doctors - already have a legal duty to make sure doctors can speak English to perform their role. Since April, there has also been one, single national list which every GP has to be on before they can treat NHS patients. The new changes are expected to come into force next year. A 12-week consultation on the proposals will run until December 2 .","Senior doctors investigated 66 complaints from patients of poor language .

Prison officials have been criticised for wasting money and resources on organising a motorised mercy dash in a prison escort vehicle so that a sick guinea pig could get treatment from a vet. The guinea pig, named Reggie Kray, was whisked to the vets after he fell ill with an ear infection. Following treatment he was returned to HMP Eastwood Park, at Wotton-under-Edge, to be reunited with his brother Ronnie, but within two hours he had died. The guinea pigs were kept to help rehabilitate female criminals. Really? Prison officials have been criticised after spending money on a mercy dash - for a guinea pig . An unnamed prison nurse, from Gloucester, has criticised the jail, claiming Reggie was accompanied to the vet by a prison officer in the prison escort vehicle. And she says two vets were subsequently called to the prison to certify Reggie's death, which was later logged on the prison computer as a death in custody. 'I think it is such a joke that a guinea pig was taken to the vets by prison service car. It took an officer off duty and we are already short staffed,' she told the Gloucestershire Echo. 'Then later that day a member of staff logged that there was a death in custody. But unbelievably it was the guinea pig. 'Two vets arrived at 7.45pm to confirm that the guinea pig was dead. In my opinion, this is such a scandalous waste of public funds. 'These guinea pigs have been living it up for sometime. They are even on the roll check along with inmates meaning they get checked on four times a day for their welfare.' Scene: HMP Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire, where staff put maximum effort into saving the life of a guinea pig . Expense: The prison van rushed the guinea pig to the vets, then back again, but it still died . The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed that Reggie the guinea pig was taken to see a vet in a prison vehicle, although he was otherwise unaccompanied. A spokeswoman said that a subsequent visit to the prison by the vet later the same day, when death was certified, was made on his way home, and for no fee. The MoJ also dismissed claims that the animal was officially logged as having died in custody on the prison computer system. She said that the guinea pig was looked after and checked on regularly in the same way as any animal would have to be when kept as a pet. A brief MoJ statement added: 'A small number of donated animals are kept at HMP Eastwood Park to help with the rehabilitation of prisoners.'","Returned after treatment to HMP Eastwood Park, but two hours later died .

Mothers who stay at home with their children have made a ‘lifestyle choice’ and can expect no help with their childcare costs, George Osborne declared yesterday. The Chancellor enraged campaigners by unveiling a plan to hand up to £1,200 a child to families where both parents work – even if they bring home as much as £300,000 between them. The scheme will be available to up to 2.5million families and will allow them to claim back 20 per cent of childcare costs. Chancellor George Osborne left Titas (left) unimpressed during his visit to a nursery in Hammersmith as he unveiled plans for cheaper childcare . With the cost limit set at £6,000 a year per child, the scheme would be worth up to £2,400 for a family of four. The 1.2million parents who stay at home with their children will not get a penny. Mr Osborne said he had ‘huge respect’ for stay-at-home mothers and pointed out that the Government will . ‘help’ them with a married couples tax break in November. But he was accused of being patronising by saying those who put their children first had simply made a ‘lifestyle choice’. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: . ‘It will help those on tight family budgets who have to weigh up the . cost of childcare when they are making difficult lifestyle decisions. ‘This is help for formal childcare. Obviously it’s not for stay-at-home mothers. 'I have huge regard for mothers who want to stay at home and look after their children, that’s their lifestyle choice. ‘I want to help those families too, I’m not trying to be exclusive.’ But Laura Perrins, a mother who left . her job as barrister to raise her two children, said: ‘Saying . stay-at-home mothers have made a lifestyle choice is pejorative and . patronising. ‘They are contributing to the . economy, to society, to everything. Staying at home is not a luxury, . it’s not a hobby. Women who chose to stay at home make huge sacrifices. 'The married tax allowance is . something we have been calling for but their version is pretty pathetic . when compared to the childcare vouchers.’ She accused the Government of ‘social . engineering’ and claimed ministers ‘think that stay at home mothers are . not conforming to what they want’. Eye-popping: Critics have slammed the plans to offer taxpayer help to families earning up to £300,000 a year . Mr Osborne faced criticism from . mothers’ groups because an existing, less generous, system of free . childcare, which is due to be frozen from 2015, helps families with . children as old as 16. Justine Roberts, of parenting website . Mumsnet, said: ‘In an ideal world you’d want help with childcare costs . up until the time you stop needing childcare for your kids – which is . more like 15 than five.’ The Chancellor defended the decision as the least bureaucratic way to implement the policy. He said: ‘The administratively simple . way to do that is to align it to one of the tax bands, one of the tax . thresholds and at £150,000 there’s a 45p tax rate kicks in. ‘We could either have done it at . £150,000 or we could have done it at just over £40,000 which is when the . 40p tax rate kicks in and I took the view that I didn’t want to stop . families earning £42,000 getting the help for tax-free childcare.’ But Lynne Burnham, secretary of . Mothers at Home Matter, pointed out Mr Osborne has removed child benefit . from families where just one parent earns more than £60,000. She said single-earner families have suffered a ‘series of blows’. Tory MP Nick de Bois said: ‘I want to . see more support directed at families where one partner, one spouse, . chooses to stay at home.’ The handouts will be available from September 2015 to parents with children aged five and under. WHAT CHILDCARE PROVISION IS AVAILABLE NOW? Parents can surrender up to £2,915 a year from their gross salary which the employer will pay directly into the voucher account of a recognised childcare provider. If they sacrifice this level of salary, basic rate taxpayers can make tax and national insurance savings of £933. The ESC scheme is not available to the self-employed or to those whose employers have not signed up. Both parents can claim separately, doubling the amount of tax they can save. The voucher scheme closes in September 2015 although those already in it can keep claiming. WHAT’S THE NEW PLAN? Parents will receive a tax break worth 20 per cent of their childcare costs, per child, up to £6,000. That means they will receive £1,200 of free childcare for each of their children. There is no limit on the number of children who can be covered. When the scheme is introduced in September 2015 it will apply to all children under 5. By 2020 it will apply to all children under 12. HOW WILL IT WORK? To receive tax-free childcare, a working family will set up a voucher account with a government-approved provider. The family will pay money into their tax-free childcare voucher account. The Government will top up the family’s payment at a rate of 20p for every 80p the family pays in.  The provider will then issue a voucher equal to the value of both these contributions. The family can then use this voucher to pay a qualifying provider for childcare. WHO WILL QUALIFY? The 2.5million families where both parents are in paid work and where neither is earning more than £150,000 a year. In addition, anyone on carer’s allowance will be included, as well as parents who are on either maternity or paternity pay. The Treasury claims 1.2million families will be better off moving to the new scheme and 1million families who couldn’t get ESC will be able to access the new scheme. WHAT DOES ‘WORKING’ MEAN? The Government has asked for views on who precisely should qualify. It could be someone working a minimum of 16 hours a week, or someone working two days a week. In favour of vouchers: Janet Burton with son Ned, four . Mark and Janet Burton believe the childcare vouchers are ‘very important’. Mr . Burton, 55, a civil engineer, and his wife, 48, a marketing consultant, . from Clapham in South London, have both returned to work since the . birth of their son Ned four years ago. Their . combined income is £150,000 and since Ned turned three they have . received 15 hours of free childcare per week, with £240 in childcare . vouchers each month. The help with childcare costs mean the money the . couple would have spent on childcare can be put aside to pay for private . school fees. Mr Burton said: ‘Both of us really appreciate the childcare help because it pays for nursery and after school clubs for Ned. ‘I think policies like this are very important for parents as working is really worthwhile. It’s an idea I fully support.’ 'Real downer': The Bowers with daughters Emily and Naomi . Simon and Caroline Bower say . the Government’s voucher system is another ‘kick’ for mothers who choose . to look after their children. Mrs . Bower, 40, gave up her job as an assistant head teacher seven years ago . when her daughter Emily was born, and has stayed at home to look after . their two-year-old daughter Naomi. The . family felt penalised when they lost out on £2,000 a year in child . benefit because Mr Bower’s business brought in more than £50,000 a year. They now stand to miss out on a further £1,200 because Mrs Bower no . longer works. Mr . Bower, 43, who runs Pollards coffee roaster in Sheffield, said he did . not understand why the Conservatives were undermining stay-at-home . mothers. He said: ‘This government is using fiscal policy to penalise stay-at-home mothers. It seems to have a real downer on them. ‘It’s just kick after kick for people like my wife who work hard for the good of their family.’","Online voucher system expected to benefit about 2.5m households .

The former Liberal Democrat, who was jailed for eight months in March for perverting the course of justice, claims a ‘new media aggression’ has become ‘a problem for us all’. In an audacious return to the public eye, he accused two newspapers of targetting him, first to expose his affair with an aide and then to reveal he had passed off speeding points to his wife Vicky Pryce. And he appeared to suggest his law-breaking and cheating were only exposed because he spoke out against phone-hacking. The speeding points revelation saw Huhne, 58 and Pryce, 60, appear in court in an acrimonious trial in which intimate details of the breakup of their marriage were aired. Sentencing the couple in March, Mr Justice Sweeney said ‘any element of tragedy is entirely your own fault’. The judge told Huhne: ‘Despite your high office you tried to lie your way out of trouble by claiming you were innocent, by repeating that lie again and again during your extensive interviews by the police.’ The former politician - who one day dreamed of leading the Liberal Democrats - has previously admitted he ‘lied and lied again’ to avoid the truth. But Huhne has now gone on on the offensive, accusing ‘the Murdoch press’ of targetting him because he called for the police to reopen the voicemail hacking inquiry. Giving his account on the scandal for the first time since he was released from prison, he claimed the now-defunct News of the World tailed him to expose his affair with his aide Carina Trimingham, 46. He also accused another of Rupert Murdoch’s papers, the Sunday Times, of having ‘groomed’ his wife to reveal how she had taken three penalty points for him before the breakup of his marriage. And he blamed the wider Press of a ‘new media aggression’ for undermining how voters view politicians. Ex-wife: Huhne convinced Vicky Pryce to accept speeding points on her licence even though he was driving . Writing in the Guardian, he urged politicians to ‘combat concentrations of power’ in the media - including that of Mr Murdoch, who ‘has used his media muscle to bulldoze a way for his business interests’. He said: ‘My own behaviour has not helped, and I am not proud of that. It is an explanation, but not a defence, to point out that the AA’s pollsters say 300,000 people have swapped speeding points and that it seemed like a minor matter back in 2003. ‘I should not have done it. The personal consequences were monstrous for my family and me, including two months in prison.’ But he added: ‘The News of the World sparked the end of my marriage, but another Murdoch title, the Sunday Times, then groomed my ex-wife until she told them about the speeding points. ‘The political editor bought dinners, . sent flowers, offered breaks at smart hotels, and reassured her that she . would not face any unpleasant consequences (such as prison).’ He went on to write: ‘The moral of . this story? First, none of this would have been possible without my own . mistakes. I am no saint (but nor did I claim to be). ‘Second, . politicians now have to live with a 24-hour media, which is more . intrusive and hurtful for the people they love, and this is having a . corrosive effect on how the public view politicians, and politics . itself. ‘Ultimately, . the new media aggression is not just a problem for those individuals . directly affected, it is a problem for us all.’ Couple: Huhne's marriage collapsed when the Press revealed he was having an affair with Carina Trimingham . In a radio interview this morning Huhne went further, claiming he was a victim of a conspiracy by the Murdoch empire to further the media mogul's business interests. He said the News of the World had known about his affair before the 2010 general election but delayed publication until a month after polling day 'when at that time Murdoch was, of course, trying to get approval to buy the rest of BSkyB'. But the story was also exposed on the same day by the Sunday People newspaper, and as Energy Secretary Huhne had no role to play in media regulation. Huhne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'You know, you would have thought if they knew that I was lying before the election then that’s the time when they should have run the story. 'So I think the very clear implication here, just by the coincidence of when the investigation starts, the fact the story is not then run until substantially later suggests that there is another agenda.'I’m saying very clearly I take responsibility for my own mistakes I would not have been vulnerable if I had not things which I regret and were clearly wrong. 'But what I am pointing out, from I suppose a rather unique vantage point, is sometimes newspaper groups and media groups have their own interests as well. 'Murdoch in particular is exceptionally powerful and over many, many years he has played the person rather than the issue and he has also used that political influence to bulldoze a way for his business interests.'","Chris Huhne admitted perverting the course of justice after asking then-wife Vicky Pryce to accept speeding points for him .

The BBC was at the centre of a fresh pay row last night as MPs demanded it name 150 fatcats who pocketed huge payoffs. It has fought to keep the recipients’ identities secret, citing data protection issues. But the influential Public Accounts Committee is to use its powers to force the broadcaster to hand over the list of names. Many of the former staff affected by the move are said to be furious that their payouts could be revealed publicly. The news comes amid speculation that the BBC Trust – its governing body – could be axed. Former director-general Mark Thompson and Trust chairman Lord Patten face a grilling by the committee today, with both men blaming each other over who was responsible for lavishing licence payers’ money on the generous payoffs. The showdown is expected to result in calls for Lord Patten to quit and for the Trust to be reformed or even scrapped. Senior BBC managers received a total of £25milion in severance deals between 2009 and 2012, and nearly £3million was paid over and above what they were entitled to in their contracts in the six years to 2012, a National Audit Office report found. With the corporation in a state of near civil war, the BBC has  written to 150 former managers warning them that their severance arrangements may be  made public. Referring to the NAO report, the BBC’s letter said: ‘PAC has recently confirmed in writing to the BBC that it is applying its Standing Order power to call for the 150 names and details of the 150 recipients of severance payments cited in the report, which includes you.’ Facing off: Former director-general Mark Thompson and Lord Patten blame each other over who was responsible for the generous payoffs . One of the 150 fatcats is thought to be Peter Fincham, the former BBC1 controller who walked away in 2007 with £500,000 after resigning over the so-called Crowngate scandal. Mr Fincham, who is now ITV director of TV, wrongly told the Press at a screening that the Queen walked out of a photoshoot featured in a royal documentary ‘in a huff’. It later emerged that a promotional trailer for the programme had been misleadingly edited and that his account was untrue. However some among the 150 ex-staff believe they are being unfairly targeted. One former senior manager said: ‘The concern I would have is that a senior manager such as myself, whose redundancy settlement was perfectly in order, will be lumped together with the very small number of senior managers whose deals seem to have been rather more generous.’","The 150 former BBC bosses given payoffs have to be named .

David Cameron today fired one of his top policy advisers for failing to vote for the government in last week's vote on military intervention in Syria. Tory MP Jesse Norman has been kicked off the Number 10 policy board after refusing to back the Prime Minister's call for action against the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons. It is the first high profile sacking in the wake of the humiliating defeat, which the government lost by just 13 votes - but more are expected. Fired: Tory MP Jesse Norman (left) has been fired from the Number 10 policy board after failing to vote for David Cameron's call for action in Syria . In an extraordinary assault on Mr . Cameron's authority, 39 coalition MPs joined Labour in voting against a . watered-down Government motion supporting the ‘principle’ of military . action. But a total of 31 - including Mr Norman - did not vote at all. There were shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked House of Commons. Mr Cameron today expressed 'regret' at the Commons defeat as he began the process of punishing Tories who defied him. Mr Norman has become the PM's first scalp, with Downing Street making clear 'there are consequences for not voting with Government'. However, MailOnline understands two Lib Dem ministerial aides who also abstained will not be sacked by Nick Clegg. Lorely Burt, . parliamentary private secretary to Treasury minister Danny Alexander, . and Tessa Munt, aide to Business Secretary Vince Cable, told Lib Dem whips they could not back the government but were not given permission to abstain. However Mr Clegg, who argued passionately in favour of action in Syria, has made clear that both will continue in their jobs. In all 10 members of the government failed to vote at the end of Thursday's eight0hour debate. It included two ministers - Justine Greening and Mark Simmond - who were . chatting in a room near the Commons and claimed not to have heard the . division bell to tell them the crunch vote was under way. A new Ipsos Mori survey found 64 per cent of people were dissatisfied with the Prime Minister's handling of the crisis and 61 per cent with Ed Miliband's response to the events. Just 36 per cent were satisfied with Mr Cameron and 39 per cent were satisfied with Mr Miliband. Row: David Cameron today said expressed 'regret' the way Labour voted against his motion on military action while Labour . leader Ed Miliband accused the Prime Minister of a rush to war . Also absent from Thursday's vote were Tory Treasury . minister David Gauke, Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb and Lib Dem . whips Jenny Willott and Mark Hunter. Mr Gauke, Mr Duncan and Mr Webb were all on holiday and given permission by the whips to miss the crucial vote. Ken Clarke, the minister without portfolio, missed the vote for family reasons. If the missing ministers, whips and aides had all turned . up, Mr Cameron would only have needed to persuade four other no-show MPs . - including Mr Norman - in order to win the vote. Clanger: International Development Secretary . Justine Greening was chatting to foreign office minister Mark Simmonds . (right) in a small room near the Commons as MPs voted on military action . Former Tory cabinet minister Peter Lilley, another member of the Downing Street policy board, insisted that instead of being shocked by the defeat the Prime Minister ‘should have seen it coming’. He added: ‘A government defeat on an issue of war may be unprecedented, but defeat on the Syria vote did not come out of the blue. You can certainly blame poor party management, failure to prepare the ground, underestimating the poisonous legacy of Iraq — but such failings are common enough,’ he writes in this week’s Spectator magazine. ‘The biggest single factor is one that ministers, the media and MPs themselves have failed to understand: Parliament has changed.’ He argues that MPs are now more rebellious because they react to the opinion of their voters not the demands of the whips. During Prime Minister's Questions today Labour leader Mr Miliband accused Mr Cameron of seeking a 'rush to war'. The Prime Minister repeated his . assurance that the UK 'can't be part and won't be part' of any strike on . the Assad regime after his defeat in the Commons last week. But . he accused the Opposition of needlessly blocking even the principle of . an armed response to the use of chemical weapons after it failed to . accept his offer of a second vote to approve direct action. Back again: It was the first session of Prime Minister's Questions since Mr Cameron's damaging defeat during last week's emergency debate on Syria . Measured Commons exchanges between the party leaders at question time turned acrimonious when Mr Miliband said the vote was 'not about Britain shirking its global responsibility, it was about preventing a rush to war'. But Mr Cameron hit back: 'Last week the House of Commons voted clearly and I have said I respect the outcome out of that vote and I won't be bringing back plans for British participation in military action. 'I agree with you that we must use everything we have in our power - our diplomatic networks, our influence with other countries, our membership of all the key bodies, the G8, the G20, the UN, the EU, Nato - we must use all that influence to bring to bear. 'My only regret of last week is that I don't think it was necessary to divide the House on a vote that would have led to a vote but he took the decision that it was.'","Tory MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire missed vote last week .

'Real hatred': French police say Mr Al-Hilli kept detailed recordings of all his telephone conversations leading up to his murder while in a bitter inheritance dispute with his brother . Detectives trying to unlock the Alps murders case believe a deal involving a 'transfer of technologies' could be a key line of inquiry, it has emerged. Investigators remain baffled as to why three members of a British-Iraqi family were shot dead close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France, a year ago. But at a joint Anglo-French press briefing they said 'industrial espionage could also indicate the involvement of secret services'. The officer leading the investigation also said that Saad Al-Hilli, a 50-year-old engineer from Surrey who was among the victims, kept ‘meticulous recordings’ of all of his conversations up until the massacre. Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud, who is leading the inquiry, said a bitter inheritance dispute between Saad and his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, was an important line in the investigation. Mr Maillaud said: ‘The victim recorded all his telephone conversations. We therefore have some very precise details.’ The prosecutor said Saad 'had in his possession a lot more material than his job would justify', The Mirror has reported. Mr Maillaud said: 'The theory that this relates to foreign countries and industrial espionage could also indicate the involvement of secret services. 'This is one aspect of an extremely complex investigation, one which is going to demand a lot more time.' Al-Hilli's brother Zaid was arrested in June under suspicion of conspiracy to murder, and is currently on police bail. He vehemently denies any wrongdoing. Mr Maillaud said that there was a ‘real hatred’ between the two brothers, and that Saad carried all the documents relating to their dispute on holiday with him to France last year. On September 5th 2012, he was killed in the attack by a gunman, along with his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74. French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was also killed in shootings which orphaned Saad’s daughters, Zainab, eight, and Zeena, five. Grim: Yesterday a source says an 'English witness' suggested the entire Al-Hilli family was targeted by a 'mercenary' from the Balkans for just £1680 . A total of 21 bullets were used in . the killing, with none damaging the bodywork of the family BMW in which . the Al-Hillis were sitting. Instead, bullets passed straight through a car window before finding their human targets. At . least five others ended up in the body of the cyclist, Mr Mollier, with . the gunman reloading at least twice, ballistics reports suggest. ‘There was a certain form of obsession’ about the inheritance dispute, said Mr Maillaud, explaining that it concerned money and property left by the brothers’ father, Kadhim, who died in Spain two years ago aged 85. Suspect: Saad's brother Zaad Al-Hilli, 54, pictured, was arrested at his home in Surrey in June on suspicion of conspiracy to murder but has since been bailed . Mr . Maillaud said that the recorded phone conversations, together with . computer records, were being studied at length, and could provide vital . clues before Zaid is re-interviewed by police in October. But British police confirmed that Zaid was in the UK last September, and was not considered ‘the prime suspect’. Detective superintendent Nick May said: ‘The tragic events of a year ago left four people dead in appalling circumstances. ‘We remain committed to finding answers to what happened that day on behalf of their families, particularly for the two young girls who lost their parents. ‘This remains a complex inquiry and we continue to have a team of officers dedicated to supporting the investigation. ‘We have established a good working relationship with our French colleagues and are continuing to pursue a number of lines of inquiry in the UK.’ One . theory put forward by an 'English witness' says an assassin with . military experience may have murdered a British family and a French cyclist in the Alps for just £420 each. The chilling claim was made yesterday on the first anniversary of the massacre. The . source confirmed that a witness had suggested the entire . Al-Hilli family was targeted by a 'mercenary' from the Balkans who was . paid the equivalent of just £1680. British police officers involved in the . Anglo-French investigation have so far refused to comment on the . enquiry, but their counterparts in Annecy confirmed that suspicions . about a contract killing are 'high on the agenda'. ‘The victim recorded all his telephone conversations. We therefore have some very precise details' - Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud . French . detectives are also following up claims that a French convict was . offered '100,000 euros (£84,000 ) 'to eliminate an Iraqi settled in . England', according to claims published in the Le Figaro newspaper . yesterday. This suggests that someone may have explored a number of options before finally ordering a hit. Saad's . brother was arrested at his home in Surrey in June . on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, but has since been bailed. Zaid, . who has proved he was in the UK this time last year, denies any . wrongdoing and there is no concrete proof for any of the claims about . the killings being commissioned. But . the French now routinely leak information allegedly linking Zaid to the . murders, while attempting to close down other lines of enquiry. Annecy . prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the brothers were in dispute over their . father's inheritance, which included the £1 million family home in . Claygate, Surrey. 'Saad was scared of his brother,' said Mr Maillaud. 'It's for this reason that he changed the locks of the house.' Probe: Sources close to the investigation have suggested that the killings could be linked to an inheritance dispute within the Al-Hilli family. But no evidence has been produced to support the suspicions. This is Saad Al Hilli's home . Today . there were also claims from the French sources that the brothers had a . 'visceral hatred' for one another and that Saad's 'paranoid fear' was so . great that he kept an illegal Taser stun gun for personal protection. Saad had also started using satellite technology through his smart phone which enabled friends to track his every move. The brothers' father, Kadhim, died in . Spain two years ago aged 85, leaving several properties and the . equivalent of more than £600,000 in a Geneva account. The French now claim Zaid had attempted to 'siphon' money from the account, and to fabricate his father's will in his favour. However, Mr Maillaud admitted that . there was currently not enough evidence to charge Zaid, and that other . theories could not be discounted. The murder scene - an . isolated mountain layby - reopened a few days after the killings, and . today floral tributes were already beginning to appear where the family . BMW had been parked. Saad's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, was beaten over the head with the butt of the suspected murder weapon - a Luger P06 in 7.65mm Parabellum. Her four-year old sister, Zeena was left deeply traumatised after hiding beneath the skirts of her dead mother in the back of the BMW for eight hours before being discovered by gendarmes. Both girls are now in the care of extended family, following a court battle with Surrey social services who wanted to keep them with foster parents. French police still believe they may still unlock the secrets of what happened through finally remembering what they saw. The horrific killings of the Al-Hilli family in one of the most scenic areas in the French Alps has baffled detectives. Since the murders a year ago, a number of theories have emerged as to why the family were slaughtered. French investigating sources believe an inheritance dispute within the Al-Hilli family could be a motive. Speculation: The killings in the French Alps have left a trail of theories. This image shows French Gendarmes close to the murder scene last year . There have also been revelations of a possible connection to the former regime of Saddam Hussein. It . followed claims that the deposed tyrant may have deposited £840,000 . into a Swiss bank account in the name of victim Said al-Hilli's father. At one stage, detectives believed they had been shot by a serial killer with a hatred of tourists. Police said they had linked the murders of the British family with the mysterious death of another tourist last July. Other . theories have speculated that the French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a . 45-year-old nuclear industry worker, was the primary target. There have also been claims that a mystery motorcyclist seen around the Alpine beauty spot could have carried out the killings.","One year since Saad Al-Hilli, his wife and her mother were all shot dead .

A judge has refused to allow a husband and wife to get back together even though they both want to. Natalie Nash, 23, applied to Gloucester Crown Court today to lift a seven year restraining order on her husband Daniel, 24. The order was imposed in November 2010 after Nash admitted charges of common assault on his wife, harassment, affray, and threatening to damage property. Despite Mrs Nash giving evidence that she wanted her husband back, Judge Jamie Tabor QC declined. Natalie Nash, 23, (left) applied to Gloucester Crown Court to lift a seven year restraining order on her husband Daniel, 24 (right) He told the couple he would relax the order by allowing them to communicate with each other by phone, text or other electronic means but not to meet face-to-face. They could talk to each other that way until April next year when he would reconsider the application, he said. Before making his decision the judge heard Mrs Nash say on oath from the witness box that she believed her husband had ‘learnt his lesson’ and would not hit her any more. The judge said: 'It is a difficult task for a judge to stand between a man and wife. They are joined together in wedlock and they want, apparently, to get back together again. 'For a judge to stand between them is, frankly, uncomfortable. But I have responsibilities towards her to ensure she is protected and not hurt in the future. 'If on April 1st next year their ardour remains and they still wish to resume their relationship it will entertain the application again. 'In short, softly, softly, gently, gently, step by step. If she tells me next year ""I have now talked to him regularly and I am comfortable he understands he has got to behave"" then I will lift the restraining order further.' Despite Mrs Nash giving evidence that she wanted her husband back, Judge Jamie Tabor QC refused the request at Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) When Nash appeared in 2010 the court was told his behaviour towards his wife had deteriorated after about a year of marriage. He became violent, aggressive and there were a number of rows to which the police were called. At around 2.30pm on June 15, 2010 she was on the phone to her sister when Nash lost his temper, grabbed the phone, told her to leave home, pushed her against the sofa and then knelt on her.Nash then pursued her into the street and brandished a piece of wood. In another incident, he went to her workplace and threatened to petrol bomb his mother-in-law’s car during a row. Nash was sentenced to a two-year supervision order, a restraining order for seven years, and ordered to do 100 hours of unpaid work. Today the court was told he had complied fully with all the orders but the probation service felt he was not really committed to changing and did not fully understand the seriousness of his offences.Nash’s solicitor Lloyd Jenkins told the court he made the application for the lifting of the restraining order as a result of receiving a letter from Mrs Nash. 'She says she wants to give the marriage a second chance,' he said. 'He doesn’t want a divorce either. He is lonely and he is willing to give it a second try as well.' In evidence Mrs Nash agreed with the judge that it was a case of ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ and that she had to some extent forgotten about Nash’s violence towards her. 'Do you really think he is not going to whack you any more?' asked the judge. 'I think he has learnt his lesson,' she replied. 'What would you do if he whacked you just once?' the judge asked. 'I don’t know,' she said. 'That’s what worries me,' the judge said. 'None of it is your fault. No man has a right to whack his girlfriend or wife ever, ever, ever. The problem is he will make you think it’s your fault and you won’t do anything about it.'","Natalie Nash, 23, applied to Gloucester Crown Court to lift a seven year restraining order on her husband Daniel, 24 .

A paranoid schizophrenic has been detained indefinitely at a maximum security hospital after he raped three women in less than an hour during a series of violent attacks. Serial rapist Thomas Hall, 33, attacked four sex workers after prowling around Piccadilly train station, in Manchester. Hall, who raped three of the women and sexually assaulted the other, is said to have bragged to a friend on the phone 'I've done three or four now. I've had the best night of my life' after attacking his last victim. Thomas Hall prowled around Piccadilly train station, in Manchester, before attacking four women . At the time of the attacks Hall, who has been a paranoid schizophrenic since he was a teenager, was on police bail for raping another woman a month earlier . Manchester Crown Court heard how Hall had heard voices in his head telling him to 'get everyone'. Two of the women ran half-naked down the street and flagged down passing motorists to raise the alarm following the attacks, the court was told. At the time of the attacks Hall, who has been a paranoid schizophrenic since he was a teenager, was on police bail for raping another woman a month earlier. He will now be detained indefinitely at maximum security Ashworth Hospital under the mental health act. He cannot be released without the agreement of doctors and a mental health tribunal. Judge Richard Mansell QC said: 'You are a very dangerous man. Ordinarily you would receive a lengthy custodial sentence running well into double figures. Manchester Crown Court (pictured) heard how Hall had heard voices in his head telling him to 'get everyone' 'These offences demonstrate serious violence and sexual violence. You pose a risk not just to women, but people generally. 'It is impossible to know how long that risk will remain.' Henry Blackshaw, prosecuting, said Hall, formerly of Audenshaw, Tameside, went out on the evening of Tuesday, March 5, after receiving his benefits payments. 'These offences demonstrate serious violence and sexual violence. You pose a risk not just to women, but people generally' - Judge Richard Mansell QC . He was spotted at the offices of the Manchester Action for Street Health charity making derogatory comments about prostitutes. At about 8.30pm he asked his first victim, who was in her 20s, if she was working before going with her to a nearby industrial estate. He then grabbed her by the throat, put his hand over her mouth and sexually assaulted her. He punched her in the face as she fled after she had refused 'compensation'. He dragged his second victim to a wooded area where he raped her. The woman was said to be so terrified, she said she thought she was going to die. After breaking free the woman ran into the street where a university lecturer let her take refuge in his car. Hall's third victim, a sex worker in her 30s, told him she was pregnant to make him stop as he raped her in a field. She alerted a passing driver after she had managed to escape. Hall raped his last victim at about 9.30pm after taking a sex worker to an alleyway. She heard him bragging to a friend on the phone afterwards. He was arrested after police stopped a bus which was making its way out of the city centre. He is said to have told officers 'how can it be rape if you've paid out?'. Hall, who also suffers from personality disorders, pleaded guilty to four counts of rape, one sexual assault and assault causing actual bodily harm at an earlier hearing. Adrian Farrow, defending, said Hall had had a very troubling experience in childhood which led to him having flashbacks. He said: 'Before these offences he admitted himself to hospital complaining that he was hearing voices and told them they had a responsibility to protect him from others, showing a degree of insight.'","Thomas Hall raped three women and sexually assaulted a fourth .

European Union ministers ended days of division today by agreeing Syrian president Assad's regime was likely to be behind recent chemical attacks outside Damascus that may have killed more than 1,400 people. But the 28 EU nations said any potential military attack against Assad's regime should hold off until the results of a U.N. inspectors' report are released. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry,  who met with EU leaders in Vilnius, Lithuania, said he welcomed this 'strong statement' backing all 'the efforts to hold the Assad regime accountable for what it has done'. Agreement: U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Deborah McCarthy (left), US Secretary of State John Kerry (second left), Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite (second right) and Lithuanian Minister of National Defense Juozas Olekas (right) at the presidential Palace in Vilnius . 'Step up': UK International Development secretary Justine Greening has urged UN nations to send more humanitarian aid . EU ministers said available intelligence 'seems to indicate strong evidence that the Syrian regime is responsible for these attacks' and underlined 'the need to move forward with addressing . the Syrian crisis through the U.N. process' - but did not back any military intervention at present. Earlier today, UK International Development Secretary Justine . Greening said countries should do more to supply humanitarian aid in the absence of any military response. With the United Nations not even half . way to meeting its funding target to deal with the fallout - which has . created two million refugees - the Conservative minister said it was time for states to 'step up' their . contributions. The decision 'does not need to wait' until after any US-led strikes against the regime, she said. Ms . Greening said the UK - already the second most generous donor - had 'always planned' to take a leading role and was not seeking to up its . contribution as a result of the Commons vote against British involvement . in military action . British Prime Minister David . Cameron welcomed offers of new humanitarian assistance for Syria from . Canada, Italy and Qatar at the G20 summit, following his announcement of . an additional £52million in British aid. He . said he wanted to 'set the drumbeat' of momentum towards filling a £1.9billion shortfall in UN funds to assist . millions of people affected by the two-and-a-half year civil war. It is believed that the UN inspectors' interim report to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will contain details on the gas, ammunition and delivery systems used in the attack that killed hundreds of people in a suburb of Damascus. Horrific: A Syrian man mourns over the bodies of victims of the August 21 gas attack on and around the city of Damascus . Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius, who hosted the meeting, spoke of 'more and more evidence that the Assad regime is behind all these crimes', adding: 'We just can't ignore this.' The EU ministers welcomed French President Francois Hollande's statement that leaders should wait for the result of the UN report before launching an attack, even though France had said the report would only show an attack had taken place and not apportion blame. The EU also stressed that perpetrators for such chemical attacks should face possible prosecution by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Germany, the only EU member of the G20 summit not to co-sign a joint statement assigning blame to Assad's regime that was issued in St Petersburg on Friday, joined in blaming the attack on the Syrian government. 'Strong statement': The U.S. Secretary of State welcomed the agreement by the EU that Assad was likely to be behind sarin gas attacks . A senior U.S. State Department official who attended Kerry's meeting with the ministers said Kerry made clear that the U.S. has not made any decision to wait. The U.S. blames Assad's regime for the chemical attack and, citing intelligence reports, says sarin gas was used. The U.S. says 1,429 people died, including 426 children.

A 26 foot long sinkhole appeared on a Montreal street Monday morning and swallowed an entire backhoe. The massive cavern opened up in a commercial strip of the Canadian city around 9am as crews were getting ready to repair a leaky water main. Workers continued to struggle Tuesday to pull the eight ton construction vehicle from the gaping hole. Scroll down for video... Gulp: An 8-ton backhoe was swallowed by a Montreal sinkhole Monday . The backhoe had started to chip at asphalt near the corner of Ste-Catherine and Guy streets when the ground crumbled beneath it and the heavy machine tumbled in. The driver of the backhoe was not injured but was taken to hospital to be checked out as a precaution, city officials said. Emilie Miskdjian, a spokeswoman for the Ville-Marie borough, said the city was alerted to the possible water leak on the weekend. She said preliminary indications were that the leak caused the problem but more inspections needed to be done to find the exact cause. Swallowed: The cave-in occurred in a busy commercial intersection in the Canadian city around 9am as crews started to repair a leaky water main . ‘We think that the water leak was because of the sewer pipe,’ she told reporters. ‘It's a broken sewer pipe. That's what we think but we have to do inspections to see what is really the cause.’ Montreal police quickly blocked off streets around the sinkhole and rerouted traffic away from the stretch of street which is dotted with restaurants and stores. Metal fences were erected around the hole, where the backhoe remained at an angle as crews figured out how to eventually remove it safely. Heavy: Officials struggled into Tuesday to pull the massive machine out of the hole . Dangerous: The hole was likely caused by a leaky water main, which crews were preparing to fix as the sinkhole opened Monday. The area remained unsafe for heavy machinery . Firefighters and gas company workers also milled around the scene, which drew a horde of lunchtime gawkers who snapped pictures of it with their cellphones. Rahman Esmaili, owner of the Sharx pool bar, was instead assessing damage to his basement-level bar where he says water had been leaking in for more than a week. He says the city was warned about the problem but replied there were no reports of low water pressure. ‘The city completely ignored (it),’ he said. ‘This morning, they decided to come and look at it.’ Parallel pothole: Meanwhile, in Miami Beach, Florida, another water main likely caused another vehicle--in this case, a yellow sports car (pictured)--to sink into a city street on Monday . Esmaili said workers hadn't been there long before the street caved in. He wondered aloud what would have happened if heavy traffic had been passing over the spot at the moment it collapsed. ‘It's very disturbing,’ he said. Esmaili said he will have to close his business for several days to replace soaked carpeting. Meanwhile, another leaky water main is to blame for a sinkhole in Miami Beach, Florida. Construction equipment likely damaged a pipe there and as a yellow sports car sat at a light Monday, it suddenly began to sink. Crews were able to remove the car and that driver, too, was uninjured.","Crews struggled to remove the 8 ton construction vehicle into Tuesday .

The lack of stigma attached to divorce and the financial independence of women has fuelled a rise in separations among the over-60s. The growing number of ‘silver separators’ is in stark contrast to the falling divorce rates among younger couples. Official figures show there were 9,439 divorces where the husband was over 60 in 2011, up 73 per cent in two decades. Among women over 60, the increase was 81 per cent. Silver splitters: New figures show how the number of divorces involving men aged over-60 has soared, while the overall number of divorces has fallen . Trend: Despite Britain's rising population, the overall divorce rate has fallen but is on the up among over-60s . The Office for National Statistics, which compiled the report, said older couples no longer feel the pressure from friends and family to stay together. It added: ‘As it becomes more common to be divorced, there are fewer stigmas attached.’ Although the figures are largely driven by men divorcing their wives, the report says the financial security of working women has added to the increase. ‘Women have become more financially independent and are more likely to have built up their own pensions,’ it said. ‘Therefore in general women are now more able to support themselves outside of marriage than in the past.’ Nevertheless, the report said, women tend to have lower pensions than men and this may be a reason why wives are less likely to be the marriage partner who files for divorce among couples over 60. However women are more likely to ask for a divorce among younger couples. Among married men over 60, 2.3 in every 1,000 got divorced in 2011 compared to only 1.6 in every 1,000 in 1991. The rising trend among older people went in the opposite direction to divorce rates for couples of all ages. Laughing matter: The phenomenon of pensioners splitting up is now so widespread it was the basis of ITV's comedy drama Love and Marriage, starring Alison Steadman . These showed the 13.6 divorces for every 1,000 married men in 1991 dropped to 10.8 for every 1,000 in 2011. One reason for the increase in the over-60s splitting up is that there are now many more older people than in past decades. The average time a marriage has lasted when a husband over 60 is divorced is 27.4 years, the ONS said. The average length of a marriage that ends in divorce for couples of all ages is 11.5 years. Blame: Actress Penelope Keith has attacked women who get divorced later in life, saying they are to blame for pushing up house prices . Divorce lawyers suggested that older couples from the ‘baby boom’ generation are coming to share the attitudes of a generation among which many  people prefer informal cohabitation to marriage. Better health is also encouraging older people to behave in the same way as those in their thirties and forties, they added. Sam Hall of JMW Solicitors said: ‘Retirement can be a real crunch point for couples. ‘One spouse often carries on their life as they have done for many years whilst the other retires, not only professionally but socially as well. It is a realisation that they have different interests. ‘I had one client who basically reached a point where he decided he just couldn’t put up with the marriage any more and wanted to enjoy his old age. ‘He actually commented to me during the divorce proceedings that he “wanted to die in peace”. ‘We have recently had a client in his 80s who left his wife of 60 years for his “fancy woman”, aged 62. He felt life was just too short.’ Andrew Newbury of Pannone Solicitors said: ‘Those currently over the age of 60 are the last generation for whom marriage would have represented the norm. ‘It may come as a surprise to find that older men are responsible for breaking up a marriage. ‘However, while it used to be thought that men would have a limited life expectancy beyond retirement, they now live longer. ‘The combination of a longer life and the means to enjoy it makes the prospect of husbands starting a new life in their later years  more likely.’ Time served: Most men who divorce after turning 60 have been married for up to 40 years .

Price tag: Under Owen Patterson's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' proposal, a family of four would pay almost £200 for clean-ups . Hard-pressed families are apparently ready to pay extra taxes of hundreds of pounds a year to have more litter cleared from their streets, ministers were told yesterday. Civil servants based their recommendation on the views of barely more than 500 people who answered a questionnaire. They believe council tax payers will accept hikes of nearly 20 per cent for better litter clearance and more if town halls remove chewing gum from pavements or clean up dog mess. The litter taxes calculated by Owen Paterson’s Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs would cost a family of four almost £200 – and much more for other kinds of clean-up. DEFRA, which tried under Gordon Brown to charge ‘pay-as-you-throw’ taxes to take household refuse away, drew up its scale of possible council tax rises on the basis of research it commissioned. The Institute for Transport Studies, at the University of Leeds, and the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University picked 561 people in London, Manchester and Coventry and set them questionnaires asking how much extra council tax they were prepared to pay. The results were greeted with outrage from campaign groups, saying the litter tax scale amounted to a stealth increase to council tax. DEFRA said that for improved litter clearance people would pay £3.95 a month for each person in a home, which amounts to £189.60 a year for a family of four. In all, a four-person household would be willing to pay more than £900 for noticeable improvements in ten aspects of their local environment, DEFRA said. The sum would mean a rise of almost 90 per cent on the average English council tax bill of £1,045. The document said potential charges would be ‘assessed and reflected in the decision-making process’ and that the numbers could ‘usefully inform national decisions’. A load of rubbish: Campaigners and taxpayers criticised the proposal, saying the survey was too limited and the council should be doing these jobs anyway . But campaigners said taxpayers should refuse to pay any extra charges on their council bills. Christine Melsom, of the Is It Fair? group, said: ‘These are all things the councils should be doing already. ‘I am not willing to pay another penny, and I am puzzled how DEFRA found anybody who said they were. ‘The Government will have a revolt on its hands if it tries to do anything to get this money from people. ‘Thousands and thousands will just refuse to pay.’ Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘DEFRA has absolutely no business spending taxpayers’ money commissioning surveys with the aim of suggesting hikes in council tax.","Proposed litter taxes would cost a family of four almost £200 .

This is the exact quandary Mokhles Raheema faced as he drove his pregnant wife and two young children to hospital along a motorway in Sweden. As Samaher Mezban suddenly began to give birth, Mokhles took his eyes off the road to check she and the baby were OK - only to veer into a ditch and roll the vehicle four times. Miraculously, not only did he, his wife and their two children survive, so too did their newborn daughter who they found lodged under the front passenger seat, her umbilical cord still attached.

Ordeal: Samaher, whose facial bruises are still visible, said she was feeling better, but still hurt all over . Unable to hold the baby in any longer, brave Samaher was forced to deliver the little girl herself as Mokhles tried to keep a steady hand on the wheel. But, worried about his wife and new daughter's safety, he looked over before crashing the car. When the car came to a rest, Mokhles again looked over to find his wife beside him and his first two children conscious in their seats but the baby was nowhere to be seen. After a frantic search, he finally found it tucked under the front seat. 'I fetched her and held her against me,' he said, adding, unsurprisingly that she was crying. An ambulance soon arrived, having been called by a passing motorist and took the family to hospital. Samaher added: 'I feel better. But I still hurt all over.' Mokhles, however, may have some explaining to do, admitting he was sorry that he totalled the car which he had borrowed from a friend.","Mokhles Raheema was driving wife Samaher to hospital in Gavle, Sweden .

Samsung has topped the first ever customer satisfaction index to focus on smartphone brands. Its Galaxy S III, pictured, beat all Apple handsets . Samsung has beaten Apple to take the top spot in a customer satisfaction survey in the U.S. Two of its handsets - the Galaxy S III and the Galaxy Note II - tied in first and second place in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ASCI) ahead of Apple's iPhone 5, iPhone 4S and iPhone 4. The survey scored phones, and ultimately brands, on anticipation of quality compared to the product's actual quality, reliability, as well as price and perceived value. Samsung's Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II both scored 84 out of a possible 100. Apple's iPhone 5 and 4S tied in third and fourth with 82 points, while the iPhone 4 scored 81. Motorola Mobility's Droid Razr Maxx HD handset gave the Google-owned company sixth place with a score of 80 and its Droid Razr was in eighth with 77. Samsung's Galaxy SII scored 78, in seventh place. BlackBerry took ninth and tenth place with the BlackBerry Curve scoring 67 and the BlackBerry Bold on 64. It is the first time the ACSI has compiled a list of the top smartphone brands and their handsets and is planning to release a report annually. The survey did not cover the period since the Samsung Galaxy S4 was released, which explains its absence from the top ten. Other ACSI reports already look at brand satisfaction and handset satisfaction individually. ACSI's index was based on phone and email interviews with 2,500 participants. The survey scored phones, and ultimately brands, based on anticipation of quality compared to the product's actual quality, reliability, and value for money. Samsung's Galaxy S III and Galaxy Note II, pictured, both scored 84 out of a possible 100 . 1. Samsung Galaxy S III - 84 out of 100 . 2. Samsung Galaxy Note II - 84 . 3. Apple iPhone 5 - 82 . 4.

BlackBerry Bold - 64 . They were asked questions about their 'anticipation' of the quality of a company's product, based . on past experiences, the product's actual quality, its reliability, and value for money based on the perceived quality. These answers were used to create the overall score using a complex methodology. The study claims that the presence of Samsung's product at the top of list demonstrates an upward trend. 'If the [Galaxy] S IV performs as well, or even better, in the eyes of customers, Samsung could threaten Apple’s dominance in overall customer satisfaction,' said ACSI Director David VanAmburg. VanAmburg continued that the Samsung phones scored highly for their larger screens, compared to Apple, and their price. The most recent ACSI report for . companies, taken in May, that looked as smartphone and feature phones . gave Apple the top spot with 81 points, down two points from 2012. While Samsung took second place with 76 points but had jumped seven points since 2012. Apple's iPhone 5, right, and iPhone 4S, left, tied in third and fourth place with 82 points, while the iPhone 4 scored 81. It is the first time the ACSI has compiled a list of the top smartphone brands and their handsets and is planning to release a report annually . BlackBerry took ninth and tenth place on the index with its Curve handset scoring 67 points and the BlackBerry Bold, pictured, scoring 64 . John Cox from Network World commented: 'The smartphone survey shows Samsung’s strength with U.S. consumers. Yet it’s also striking that the iPhone 4, announced in June 2010 and the iPhone 4S, announced in October 2011 are rated as highly as the 9-month-old iPhone 5 and nearly as highly as the much more recent Samsung phones.' Samsung launched the Galaxy S III in May 2012 and the Note II five months later. Samsung's success may also be due to the popularity of its Android operating system. A recent study form Kantar Worldpanel ComTech showed . Android with a 51.5 per cent market share, while iOS had 42.5 per cent. However, these figures may be slightly misleading because more phones run Android than iOS across the board. The ACSI figures also contradict a recent study from Quality Insight in Korea. The marketing firm surveyed 44,168 people about their handset and the iPhone was rated the best smartphone. The . participants said that the iPhone rarely failed, with only 17 per cent . complaining about technical issues with their Apple phone.

A police report filed at the time cited the Braveheart star as cursing: 'F****** Jews... The Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.' He allegedly then asked the arresting deputy, 'Are you a Jew?' Gibson's violent rages have been widely reported in the past. His ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva has told how she feared he would kill her in a vicious assault. She had said the actor brandished a gun at her during the violent argument. The . Russian-born musician said the star choked her and insisted: ‘I thought . he would kill me…I was scared for my life and my daughter’s.’ Miss Grigorieva said Gibson often flew into jealous rages and talked about suicide. On another occasion she claims he threw her son onto a table, but the Oscar-winning director has denied the allegations. The pair went through a protracted and bitter custody battle after separating in 2011. Gibson pleaded no-contest to a charge of  battery against Oksana Grigorieva in March, 2011, and has since completed the community service portion of his charge.

Water voles may have declined by as much as a fifth in just a few years, a new study mapping their presence across the UK has suggested. The mammal immortalised as Ratty in the book Wind In The Willows is still thriving in strongholds from the uplands of Snowdonia to the wetland habitats of the eastern England fens and the Somerset levels. But elsewhere, populations are disappearing in the face of habitat loss and weather extremes as well as being eaten by invasive American mink, the Environment Agency and Wildlife Trusts warned. Water voles were once widespread, but numbers crashed by 90 per cent in the 1990s as a result of predation by mink - which have established themselves in the countryside after escaping from fur farms - and loss of riverbank habitat . Water voles were once widespread, but numbers crashed by 90 per cent in the 1990s as a result of predation by mink - which have established themselves in the countryside after escaping from fur farms - and loss of riverbank habitat. Data published in 2010 indicated populations in some parts of the country were making a comeback, but new information from the national water vole database and mapping project paints a more gloomy picture. The mapping shows the number and extent of key areas for water voles has shrunk and across large parts of the country populations appear to be small, isolated and vulnerable, conservationists said. In such areas, water vole populations are at risk from the arrival of American mink and the impacts of drought, when falling water levels expose underwater burrow entrances to other predators or flooding. The latest data, which collates and maps figures from surveys conducted around the UK, suggests the presence of water voles is down by 22 per cent for the period 2007 to 2011 compared to 2004 to 2008. The mammal immortalised as Ratty in Wind In The Willows is still thriving in strongholds from the uplands of Snowdonia to the wetland habitats of the eastern England fens and the Somerset Levels. But elsewhere, populations are disappearing in the face of habitat loss, weather extremes and ferocious American Mink . Between 2004 and 2008 they were recorded in 874 squares of 10 kilometres, but for the period 2007 to 2011 they were present in 683 such areas. Some of the fall is down to a reduction in surveying in recent years as the recession has reduced conservation funding and experts said it was hard to assess what was happening to the UK-wide water vole population as there had not been a national survey since 1998. But Paul Wilkinson of the Wildlife Trusts said the latest data was a real cause for concern, and warned: 'Not enough is being done to secure this charismatic species’ future.' There was clear evidence from some areas such as the south of England that water voles were disappearing fast, he said. 'Strongholds do remain, and these are often located in areas which support more extensive wetland habitats, such as the fens, or head streams in upland areas. 'We must ensure these strongholds persist and renew efforts to save this much-loved species, through targeted conservation action and sustained monitoring programmes,' he urged. The number of areas for water voles have shrunk and populations appear to be small, isolated and vulnerable, conservationists said. In such areas, water vole populations are at risk from the arrival of American mink (pictured) and the impacts of drought . Conservationists called for more resources to support water vole surveying and conservation projects, saying a clear benefit could be seen from efforts to create and protect suitable habitat and control mink numbers. Alastair Driver, Environment Agency national conservation manager and chairman of the UK water vole steering group, which produced the analysis, said: 'Creating new habitat helps protect our native species, like water voles and otters, and helps tackle climate change. 'The Environment Agency has created nearly 12,400 acres of wetland and river habitats in the last 10 years and we hope to double this in the next 10. 'Added to this, our rivers are at their healthiest for over 20 years, but control of the American mink is essential if water voles are to benefit from these healthier rivers and new habitats.' Successful reintroductions of water voles, along with controlling mink, have resulted in new populations in places such as the River Axe in Devon and London Wetland Centre, the experts said.

A mother-of-three who survived breast cancer has had to have all of her toes amputated after developing a ‘preventable’ infection following reconstructive surgery. Leanne Parker, 41, is also facing the possibility that her legs might now have to be amputated below the knees. The community support worker from High Peaks, Derbyshire, would not have developed the infection had she been given the antibiotics she should have had after surgery. Scroll down for video . Leanne Parker had to have her toes amputated after she developed an infection following breast reconstruction surgery. She would not have developed the infection if the doctor had given her antibiotics . Ms Parker was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 37. She went on a healthy-eating diet and lost two bra sizes as a result of which she was able to feel the lump in her breast. She visited her GP who quickly referred her to hospital where the cancer was diagnosed. She told ITV’s This Morning: ‘It [was] a surreal moment. It’s one of those that… it’s almost like it will never happen to you. ‘You just can’t start to begin…where do you go from there? ‘There are so many questions, so many feelings, emotions running through you. You don’t know where to begin.’ Ms Parker developed organ failure and nearly died after the operation. As her body fought for life, her blood was channeled towards her vital organs so her extremities were deprived of oxygen meaning they died . Ms Parker, who has a 22-year-old son and two teenage daugthers, had a single mastectomy and four months of chemotherapy. During her treatment, she learned that her grandmother had died of ovarian cancer – until that point Ms Parker believed she had died of colon cancer. This raised alarm bells with Ms Parker who feared that this family history meant that she was more likely to see her cancer return in the future. Therefore, she decided to have her other breast, her ovaries and her fallopian tubes removed as well. Once she had recovered from these operations, she started to think about reconstructive breast surgery. Ms Parker says that without her toes she struggles to balance and that she often falls over. She says that it has changed the way she walks meaning that her knees, hips and back are being damaged as well . In February 2011 she was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester where she had surgery to reconstruct her breasts. When she woke after the surgery, she was horrified to discover that the surgery had not gone as she expected. She told This Morning: ‘The first thing you do is to have a look as this is the final stage. This is the end of the road. ‘You have gone through everything and this is the final bit to become normal again, as such. ‘When I looked down I realised that everything was wrong, it was misshaped. ‘It just didn’t look right in any way. I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was horrible.’ She added: ‘I was devastated. I can’t tell you – it was heart-breaking. It really was. ‘I . had stayed so strong and positive all the way through. I was really . trying to keep as strong as possible to prove to my daughters that there . is no fear – because, obviously, their future is now in question as . well [because of the family history of cancer].’ She told This Morning: 'It's very difficult. Your balance is always affected. You are never stable, never ever stable. There are many times you just go down' This was far from the end of Ms Parker’s suffering. The week after her surgery, she became so ill and delirious that she lost control of all of her bodily functions. Her friends were so concerned that they called an ambulance and she was rushed to hospital. Here, it was discovered that she had developed an infection that was causing her organs to fail. She was put in a medically induced coma and given life-saving drugs. However, the drugs caused more . complications – Ms Parker explained that because her body was fighting . to survive, her blood was all being channelled into her brain and torso . meaning that her fingers and toes were deprived of oxygen. As a result, they started to turn black. Ms Parker said: ‘I had never seen anything like it. I was devastated.’ She was told to go home and that the toes would die and fall of naturally. Ms Parker had one of her breasts removed during her cancer treatment. She then discovered that she had a family history of cancer so decided to have her other breast and her reproductive organs removed as well . However, she developed gangrene and had to return to hospital to have her toes amputated. She told This Morning: ‘It’s very difficult. Your balance is always affected. You are never stable, never ever stable. There are many times you just go down. ‘The foot also suffers with lots of problems, the knees suffer, the hips suffer, the back suffers. ‘It just goes on and on. The foot starts to collapse slowly. Then you face more amputations. ‘The question is where they have to amputate next. They are questioning having to amputate just below the knee now.’ She added: ‘You’ve got to keep going, if you don’t keep going then you are going to just sit down. It’s a sink or swim question. If you don’t, what will the children do without you?’ Ms Parker’s solicitor, Iona Meeres-Young from Slater and Gordon, said: ‘This is a very straightforward error that could have been prevented. ‘The reason Leanne is faced with the difficulties she now has is because the hospital failed to prescribe antibiotics after the surgery.’ Ms Parker's solicitor, Iona Meeres-Young (pictured) from Slater and Gordon, said: 'This is a very straightforward error that could have been prevented' She added: ‘All of the consequences that Leanne is now faced with would have been prevented.’ She went on to explain that Ms Parker should have been given antibiotics after the reconstructive surgery to prevent infection but that the hospital trust has admitted that the doctor failed to prescribe them. Ms Parker is now agreeing a settlement with University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust. A spokesperson for the trust said: 'We are very sorry that Ms Parker didn’t receive the level of care she expected at our hospital in February 2011. 'Following an investigation, we identified that our processes fell below the standards we would expect and we could have done more. 'We wrote a letter of apology to Mrs Parker on 28 October 2011, and this case is now with our legal department to agree a settlement. 'This was an extremely rare case, and we have reviewed and improved our processes around patient communication and discharge protocol as a direct result of the investigation into Ms Parker's care.'","Leanne Parker developed breast cancer four years ago .

A 'smart lookup' feature integrates a dictionary with Wikipedia to allow users to search for definitions and information without losing the place in their book and  a 'vocabulary builder' compiles a list of words users look up. Just like its predecessors, the eReader has a no-glare display, eight weeks of battery life, built-in Wi-Fi as standard and can download a book in under 60 seconds. Despite tablet computers falling in price, eReaders are still in demand and  have carved a niche in the market because of the no-glare technology they use for screens. The new built-in light guides light to the surface of the eReader in a way designed not to strain readers' eyes, while the eReader promises to be 25 per cent faster than its predecessor so that pages turn faster .

He could have faced far worse as a judge threw out in August 2011 much of the case prosecutors initially lodged against him. Over objections from authorities, the judge at that time dismissed 23 of the 35 felony counts filed by authorities. The judge did so after the Martinez's initial accuser testified in court that he made up the allegations. He was portrayed by authorities as an abusive man who intimidated witnesses and gamely played the system of which he was once a part.

'Loveable rogue': Thomas McAnea pictured leaving the the High Court in Edinburgh in 2007, when he was jailed for six years . On the face of it, he ran a tiny printer’s shop, apparently producing nothing more exciting than menus for Chinese restaurants. Behind the scenes, however, Thomas McAnea was a master forger at the centre of a major counterfeiting operation with the power to threaten Britain’s economic stability. Nicknamed ‘Hologram Tam’, McAnea relied on just a few simple tools – a pair of spectacles, a magnifying glass and an engraving pen – to produce the detailing on fake banknotes so authentic that by the time he was caught nearly £700,000 worth were in circulation. Yet, despite his fabled ability to conjure up dodgy currency, McAnea, whose death from lung cancer at the age of 63 was reported yesterday, could scarcely be said to have cashed in on his dubious talents. Police sources say he appeared to have barely two pennies to rub together at his death and, in the greatest of ironies, the illness which killed him is believed to have been caused by a lifetime spent inhaling toxic printing fumes. A family friend said: ‘Tam was a lovable rogue but one of the biggest names in crime. ‘It’s a bit ironic he got lung cancer from printing – the job where he made his name as the forgery master. There will be a big turnout at his funeral.’ McAnea, who died at his home in Glasgow on Friday, was jailed for six years and four months in 2007 after he was unmasked as the ringleader of a professional gang which had the capacity to pump out  £2million worth of fake notes a day. His tiny shop, Print Link (Scotland), at St George’s Cross, Glasgow, appeared to offer small-scale printing, mainly menus for Chinese restaurants. But its proximity to the M8 allied to the forger’s peerless skills with holograms made it attractive to criminals from all over the UK. Handiwork: Thomas McAnea's dubious services were much sought after the length and breadth of the UK . Rich pickings: At his height Thomas McAnea was churning out up to £2million in forged notes a day . Police became interested in the shop after a tip-off from the Metropolitan Police that an unusually large number of fake Bank of Scotland £20 notes were in circulation in London. McAnea, who became the number one target of Operation Fender launched in October 2005, was already on the police’s radar. Convicted: This picture, taken in 1998 when McAnea was aged 48, was at his trial for forgery which landed him a 10-year stretch, although this was later overturned . In 1998, he and sidekick John McGregor were sentenced to ten years in prison for an earlier plot to flood the market with £1.6million of fake notes via unwitting Scottish fans attending the Euro 96 football championships in England. In 2000, however, both were freed on appeal and had their convictions quashed on a technicality – ironically related to a misprint on a warrant. In 2007, they were not so lucky. When detectives from the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA) raided Print Link, McGregor was caught red-handed printing £500,000 in Bank of Scotland £20 notes. The gang also had in their possession  €500,000 (£350,000) in forged notes. Following the raid, another £672,880 worth of counterfeit notes was recovered from the banking system, although one police source said at the time: ‘Some of Hologram Tam’s money is still out there. If I gave you one of his notes, you wouldn’t know it.’ Detectives also found templates for other forgeries including passports, driving licences, ID cards, bank statements, utility bills, MoT certificates, postage and saving stamps and TV licences. A photograph of judge Lord Cameron, who had freed McAnea and McGregor on appeal seven years earlier, adorned the wall of the print room, below which was scrawled: ‘Go on yersel big man’. At the High Court in Edinburgh, McAnea admitted delivering, selling and disposing of fake money between October 2006 and January 2007. Five other gang members were also jailed for a total of 16 years. McAnea’s defence counsel said that he turned to drink after losing two sons, one aged two, and the other aged 22 after a drugs overdose. He had also run up debts and a previous business collapsed owing £15,000. To make ends meet, he offered to help organised gangs. Gangs: The proximity of McAnea's dodgy business near the M8 made it an attractive proposition with criminal gangs all over the country . Yet, as the gangs profited, McAnea had no assets worth seizing at the time of his arrest. All officers could find was a battered old BMW, while his flat in Glasgow’s Yorkhill area was mortgaged to the hilt. One SCDEA source said: ‘We expected to see him drinking champagne or going to lap dancing bars. But the only place he went was the pub or to buy messages.’ Scottish Labour Justice Spokesman Graeme Pearson, who was director of the SCDEA when McAnea was caught, said the former print union official ‘had the touch of the geek about him’, but added: ‘People think it’s a bit of a wheeze, a  B movie, producing banknotes in your kitchen, but in actual fact what we have is something that enables criminal gangs to profit. ‘This counterfeiting gang had the ability to destabilise the British economy.’ McAnea’s funeral is due to take place tomorrow at Anniesland, Glasgow. Last night, his partner Lesley-Anne McKinnon was too upset to comment.

Sky scrapers: Lasers could be used to divert weather away from events - or trigger rainfall far out to see . We may have all dreamt of zapping away the rainclouds when it’s damp and miserable outside. But it seems that one day, the dream could actually come true. Scientists are hopeful that lasers could be used to guarantee a cloudless sky – and will gather next month to discuss the possibility of shooting pulses of light into the heavens to control the weather. In laboratory tests Swiss researchers have succeeded in using the technology to promote cloud formation. In theory, it could be used to trigger rainfall far out at sea or over uninhabited land – and keep it away from a major event. The technique has also been used to control lightning, with the long-term aim of diverting it away from built-up areas. Controlling the weather has been attempted before, most famously during the 2008 Beijing Olympics when scientists apparently fired chemicals into the sky to disperse cloud for the opening ceremony. Known as cloud ‘seeding’, it was pioneered in the US in the 1940s and involves inducing rain by firing silver iodide or dry ice into a cloud, simulating the natural salt, dust and other tiny particles in the atmosphere that help water droplets form. It has produced mixed results, but at a conference of the World Meteorological Organisation entitled Laser, Weather and Climate, a team from the University of Geneva will report on experiments in which they used lasers to cause water to condense or ice to form, crucial in accelerating rainfall. In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, they reported: ‘Under conditions typical for thin cirrus ice clouds, the plasma channels [laser] induced a surprisingly strong effect of ice multiplication. Within a few minutes, the laser action led to a strong enhancement of the total ice particle number density in the chamber by up to a factor of 100. Rain stop play? British music festivals - notoriously damp - might benefit from the new technology, though these Reading veterans don't seem to mind . ‘The newly formed ice particles quickly reduced the water vapour pressure to  ice saturation, thereby increasing the  cloud optical thickness by up to three orders of magnitude.’ They said the results ‘open the possibility for laser modification of natural cirrus clouds or the artificial seeding of cirrus clouds’.","Swiss scientists to publish paper on potential uses of cloud 'seeding'

It's war: The new Sony Playstation 4 will be released in November . A fierce battle to attract the nation’s gamers has been triggered with news that the Xbox One is to be launched on November 22. Microsoft’s new games and entertainment console, which will cost £429, will go head to head with Sony’s PlayStation 4 during the crucial pre-Christmas period. The PS4 will also launch in November at a cheaper price of £349 in what is likely to be a close competition for sales. Xbox One players will be able to create personalised avatars of themselves, which are created using a 3D scan of their face taken by cameras built into the console. In a world first, these avatars will be able to take part in physical games, where the movement, power and balance of the player will be acted out on screen. Microsoft defended the £429 price tag, pointing out that it includes the high-tech box, the Kinect system of cameras, a headset and one controller. As an extra sweetener, families who pre-order the device will get a free FIFA 14 game, which is the biggest computer game in the world. Microsoft has also signed a deal with EA, the maker of FIFA 14, so that Xbox users will be able to download  exclusive game content. The company is launching a football Legends feature which allows users to add some of the best players of previous generations to their teams - the first three being Ruud Gullit, Lothar Matthäus and Freddie Ljungberg . Microsoft is under pressure to demonstrate to the 8.5million British families who currently have an Xbox 360 why they should upgrade to the new console. Users of the Kinect system on the Xbox 360 had to stand at least six feet from the screen, but this has been reduced to just four feet. The Kinect’s camera system has also been upgraded to track users’ movements in dim light. Another new feature, Project Spark, will allow users to create their own computer games – building landscapes and creating characters, stories and quests. The competition: The Microsoft XBox One with advanced Kinect and controller . Users will be able to create and share their games with others around the world via a web link to the console. UK marketing director, Harvey Eagle, said the ability to stand closer to the screen when playing physical games was a major advantage. ‘That is one of the big improvements we have made. The feedback we got back from our community was that the play space required was not right for every home,’ he said. ‘The team worked on that tirelessly and you can now stand a lot closer and do not need to move the furniture around. We are saying it works from a distance of about four feet.’ The box also works as a home entertainment hub linked to the television and internet, allowing access to TV programmes and premium film services such as Netflix. The Kinect includes cameras and microphones which combine with a web connection so the system can also be used to hold face-to-face conversations on a large high-definition screen with people across the globe. Vice president of Marketing, Strategy and Business for Xbox, Yusuf Mehdi, said production of the new consoles has now started, and should meet the launch date of November 22. Consoles will be available from then in the UK, USA, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, and Spain. Mr Mehdi said: ‘We sold out of our pre-order supply faster than at any other time in our history and we are on path to have the biggest launch of an Xbox ever.’ He also announced that the processing power of the new console will be upgraded from 1.6GHZ to 1.75GHZ, which will improve the speed and performance of games.","Microsoft Xbox One to cost £429; Sony Playstation 4 will cost £349 .

'Rather by mating with multiple males, they allow their internal choice mechanism to favour the most genetically different sperm. 'This could be the case in other animals - including humans, however the practicality of testing this in mammals would be very difficult, and obviously impossible in humans for ethical reasons.'

They claim the effect is down to 'cryptic female choice' where an internal mechanism in the reproductive tract favours the sperm from males that are most genetically different to them. By increasing the diversity of particular genes, which help detect and fight infections, female birds can provide their offspring with better disease resistance. Researchers also claim that signals given off by the male, such as odour, could help the female subconsciously choose the best father. The findings could be important for animal breeders and conservation projects because they show that allowing multiple matings will produce the most disease resistant and genetically healthy offspring.

'Many breeding programmes for livestock and conservation use artificial insemination. But our research suggests that this may not produce the best quality offspring. 'This is because the effect appears to require the subconscious female assessment of the male by some cue during actual mating. 'So having correct cues during mating, perhaps the smell of the male, can affect a females’ chances of being fertilised. And the cues from different males may not work equally well on different females. This is something that needs to be explored further in various animals including humans.'","Experts from four universities studied an ancestor of the chicken to find mating with different males helped females produce healthier offspring .

Across the fields and hedgerows around my Somerset home, bees are buzzing, crickets are chirping, and gathering swallows are twittering in the skies. John Keats’s season of mists and mellow fruitfulness — autumn — is with us once again. After last year’s washout summer, followed by a chilly winter and one of the coolest and latest springs on record, our wildlife is bouncing back. Pick your own: Three young blackberry pickers in Kent, who have evidently sampled some of the fruit . In my own garden, in the lee of the Mendip Hills, nature is thriving. The trees and bushes are dripping with fruit: green cider apples, ripening blackberries, and deep purple clumps of elderberries contrast with the gaudy crimson of the hawthorn. This free food supply attracts a constant stream of birds: from clumsy wood pigeons and perky blackbirds, to delicate little warblers such as the blackcap and lesser whitethroat, all gorging themselves on nature’s bounty from dawn to dusk. In the old barn next door, the swallows are raising their second brood of young — in a race against time before the chill winds of October begin to blow, reducing the supply of flying insects they need to feed their hungry chicks. Meanwhile, in the clear blue skies overhead, the youngsters from the swallows’ previous brood are testing out their flying skills. This is vital, as very soon they will be heading south on the 5,000-mile journey to their winter home, near the southern tip of Africa. For month after month at the start of the year we waited in vain for spring to arrive . Then, just as we were beginning to think the weather would never change, summer arrived with a bang . And for the first time in years, there are clouds of butterflies: the common or garden whites alongside small tortoiseshells, peacocks and red admirals. Many are feasting on fallen fruit, and becoming tipsy as they drink the fermenting juices of our apples, pears and plums. All these wild creatures are benefiting from one of the most bizarre years on record, weather-wise. For month after month at the start of the year we waited in vain for spring to arrive. A cold February was followed by an even colder March, with bitter north-easterly winds blowing straight from Siberia. April showers failed to materialise, as winter seemed to go on for ever, in the coldest and latest spring for more than 50 years. After last year's disastrous wet summer, there were fears that some grassland butterflies such as the Adonis (pictured) and chalkhill blues would be in big trouble this year . Then, just as we were beginning to think the weather would never change, summer arrived with a bang. The first ten days of June were glorious, and the fine, sunny weather continued — especially in Southern Britain — throughout July and August. So how has nature responded to this unusual weather? Classic signs of spring were long delayed: hawthorn blossom, bumblebees, and early butterflies such as the orange-tip all emerged weeks later than usual, while garden songsters such as the song thrush stayed silent well into the new year. After last year’s disastrous wet summer, there were fears that some grassland butterflies such as the Adonis and chalkhill blues would be in big trouble this year. Yet a one-hour count of chalkhill blues near Dorking in Surrey produced an incredible 3,200 butterflies — smashing the previous record of 825 from 2006. This is because of the prolonged spell of fine, warm weather we enjoyed during the key time for these beautiful insects to emerge, in July and August. Richard Fox, of Butterfly Conservation, points out that the current spell of fine weather is good news for butterflies that spend the winter as hibernating adults, such as the comma, peacock and small tortoiseshell. And in Northern England, the Durham Wildlife Trust has enjoyed a bonanza of meadow brown and ringlet butterflies, both of which suffered badly from last year’s summer holiday washout. They believe that this year’s late spring snowfalls meant that these butterflies hatched far later than usual, again coinciding with the long period of warm, settled weather in late May and June. The copious crop of berries this autumn is also down to the cold, late spring. Plants such as hawthorn, crab apple and rowan delayed flowering for weeks because of the chilly weather; so when warm, sunny conditions finally arrived they were able to take advantage. The copious crop of berries this autumn is also down to the cold, late spring . Oaks also flowered late, ensuring a bumper yield of acorns across much of Britain. Blackberries are several weeks behind schedule, but unless we get a spell of very wet weather we are due a huge crop. But bear in mind the old country saying that the devil ‘spits on blackberries’ on Michaelmas Day at the end of this month (September 29), rendering them inedible. Naturalists are talking of a ‘mast year’ — one in which trees produce lots of ‘mast’ (the fruit of beech, oak, chestnut, and other woodland trees). This is very good news for those creatures that rely on fruits, nuts and berries to get them through the autumn and winter. Red squirrels and jays don’t just feast on acorns, but also bury them in special hiding places to provide food in the lean times ahead. Later on in the autumn, birds such as the fieldfare and redwing — thrushes that breed in Iceland, Scandinavia and Siberia — will arrive here in their millions. If the berry crop is as good as has been predicted, they will enjoy the benefits of this long, hot summer well into the winter ahead. But as with any period of unusual weather, 2013 hasn’t been a vintage year for all wildlife. National Trust nature guru Matthew Oates has noticed precious few hazelnuts, which is very bad news for dormice, and beechnuts are also at a low ebb. Other gardeners are reporting a remarkable lack of aphids — good news for rose-growers, but very bad news for one of our favourite insects, the ladybird. So does the proliferation of fruits and berries foretell a hard winter, as many people believe? Despite a wealth of ancient folklore and proverbs linking a good year for berries with a hard winter ahead, there is no evidence the two are connected. As Matthew points out, the big harvest reflects what has gone, not what’s to come. What we can be sure of is that 2014 is likely to produce even more weather surprises for both us and for Britain’s wildlife.","After last year’s washout summer, followed by a chilly winter and late spring, our wildlife is bouncing back .

Crumpets and bubbly chocolate bars might fill some people with joy, but scientists claim that most humans have a primordial fear of clusters of holes. Everyday objects with many closely-packed holes can be a trigger for people who report suffering from trypophobia, or the fear of holes, which can lead to intensely unpleasant visceral reactions, psychologists claim. A study suggests the widespread, predominantly latent . phobia is associated with ancient threats such as beehives, . poisonous flowers and venomous creatures. Everyday objects like crumpets with many closely-packed holes can be a trigger for people who report suffering from trypophobia, or the fear of holes, which can lead to intensely unpleasant visceral reactions, scientists claim . ‘Tryophobia is the most common phobia you’ve never heard of,’ said Geoff Cole, a psychologist at the University of Essex, who is a self-diagnosed trypophobic. In a bid to unravel his own problem, Dr Cole recently led an investigation into the fear’s evolutionary underpinnings . Together with his colleague Arnold Wilkins, he believes trypophobia may occur as a result of a specific visual feature also found among various poisonous animals. The findings, published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, suggest 'there may be an ancient evolutionary part of the brain telling people that they are looking at a poisonous animal'. Trypophobia is widely documented by sufferers on the Internet and, in one study, Cole and Wilkins found that about 16 per cent of participants reported trypophobic reactions. One trypophobia sufferer told Dr Cole that an animal - a blue-ringed octopus (pictured) which is one of the most poisonous animals in the world - had caused him to experience a trypophobic reaction, which informed the direction of the study . Despite this, there has been little scientific investigation of the phenomenon. Dr Cole and Dr Wilkins, both vision scientists, wondered whether there might be a specific visual feature common to trypophobic objects. They compared 76 images of trypophobic objects along with 76 images of holes not associated with the phobia. After standardising various features of the images, the researchers found that the trypophobic objects had relatively high contrast energy at midrange spatial frequencies in comparison to the control images, which is to say they have a unique visual quality to them. One trypophobia sufferer told Dr Cole that an animal - a blue-ringed octopus, which is one of the most poisonous animals in the world - had caused him to experience a trypophobic reaction, which informed the direction of the study. Based on their observations, the researchers believe the phobia could have an evolutionary basis and humans have learned to fear dangerous animals with these special markings - and even perhaps honeycomb which can lead to painful bee stings - to survive . The researchers analysed images of numerous poisonous animals, including the octopus, deathstalker scorpion and king cobra snake to discover that they tend to have 'high contrast at midrange spacial frequencies - the distribution of circles that triggers the trypophobic reaction. Based on their observations, the researchers believe the phobia could have an evolutionary basis and humans have learned to fear dangerous animals with these special markings - and even perhaps honeycomb which can lead to painful bee stings - to survive. Dr Cole said: 'We think that everyone has trypophobic tendencies even though they may not be aware of it. 'We found that people who don't have the phobia still rate trypophobic images as less comfortable to look at than other images.' The pair are now investigating whether manipulating the spectral characteristics of images of everyday objects, like watches, leads people to prefer one object over another. They believe these experiments will shed light on just how ingrained trypophobic tendencies might be.

Richard III not only had a hunchback but he also suffered from roundworm infection, research has revealed. Scientists found roundworm eggs in a soil sample taken from the pelvis of the skeleton of the king, which was discovered last year by archaeologists at the University of Leicester. Since the body of King Richard III was found, scientists have been undertaking careful analysis of the remains, in an attempt to shed further light on the attributes and history of the controversial king. A team of researchers led by Dr Piers Mitchell, of the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of Cambridge, used a powerful microscope to examine soil samples taken from the skeleton’s pelvis and skull, as well as from the soil surrounding the grave. The microscope revealed multiple roundworm eggs in the soil sample taken from the pelvis, where the intestines would have been situated in life. However, there was no sign of eggs in soil from the skull and very few eggs in the soil that surrounded the grave, suggesting that the eggs found in the pelvis area resulted from a genuine roundworm infection during his life, rather than from external contamination by the later dumping of human waste in the area. Roundworms are parasitic nematodes which infect humans when people ingest their eggs via contaminated food, water, or soil.

It has been over four decades since NASA left the moon, but now the space agency is at it again. NASA is launching a small rocket to investigate an unusual discovery made by the crew on Apollo 17 – moon dust. Crews reported seeing an odd glow on the lunar horizon just before sunrise, an unexpected sight as the airless moon lacked atmosphere for reflecting sunlight. Sky high: An artist's concept showing the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer - LADEE - which will take off from a NASA base on Friday . Scientists began to suspect that dust . from the lunar surface was being electrically charged and somehow lofted . off the ground, a theory that will be tested by the NASA’s upcoming . Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Experiment – LADEE. The . spacecraft is scheduled for lift off late Friday night local time, from . NASA's Wallops Flight Facility on Wallops Island, Virginia. ‘Terrestrial . dust is like talcum powder. On the moon, it's very rough. It's kind of . evil. It follows electric field lines, it works its way in equipment. ‘It's . a very difficult environment to deal with,’ said LADEE project manager . Butler Hine of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. Mystery light: These photographs from the moon's surface just before sunrise are the origin of the moon dust mystery . The LADEE craft will circulate the moon 20-50 kilometres above its surface and analyse the lunar dust . The origins of the lunar glow, comes from a NASA report from 1974 entitled 'Evidence for a high . altitude distribution of lunar dust' which exhibits Apollo 17 Commander Eugene . Cernan's sketches as he describes a unusual 'glow' as Apollo 17 approached the . orbital sunrise. During the 1972 mission, astronaut Cernan drew what he saw . on a note pad, describing the event in words as a light that ‘came from non . existense [sic] to subtle in nature then just . before sunrise quickly sharp’ Apollo 17, launched in December 1972, was final moon landing carried out by NASA under the Apollo programme. Austronaut Cernan and his two crew members spent three days on the lunar surface, before returning to earth. At last year’s 40th anniversary of their trip to the moon, Cernan – to this day the last human to walk the moon – admitted he left his camera on its surface. ‘I left my camera there with the lens pointing up at the zenith, the idea being someday someone would come back and find out how much deterioration solar cosmic radiation had on the glass,’ he said at the time of the anniversary. Cernan, now 79, did not think his would be the last footprints on the moon, but due to NASA cutbacks, the Apollo programme was closed before another manned mission was made. However, as there is no wind on the moon to lift the dust, . scientists believe solar radiation could leave the particles electronically . charged during the day, and once colliding with negative particles, the dust . particles repel each other, ‘like strands of hair rubbed by a balloon,’ Scientific American reported. In . addition to studying fly-away lunar dust, LADEE will probe the tenuous . envelope of gases that surrounds the moon, a veneer so thin it stretches . the meaning of the word ‘atmosphere.’ Instead, . scientists refer to these environments as exospheres and hope that . understanding the moon's gaseous shell will shed light on similar . pockets around Mercury, asteroids and other airless bodies. ‘LADEE . is part of a much broader scientific exploration of the solar system,’ said John Grunsfeld, NASA's associate administrator for science. The . $280 million mission also includes an experimental laser optical . communications system that NASA hopes to incorporate into future . planetary probes, including a Mars rover scheduled for launch in 2020. The . prototype is based on technology used in terrestrial fiber-optic . communications systems, such as Verizon's FiOS. NASA says the system . should be at least six times faster than conventional radio . communications. Also, its transmitters and receivers weigh half as much . as similar radio communications equipment and use 25 per cent less . power. Ready for take off: A Minotaur V launch vehicle is erected on the pad at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia during a pathfinder exercise ahead of tomorrow's launch . Lads and LADEE: Engineers at NASA's Ames Research Center prepare LADEE ahead of its journey to analyse the possible 'moon dust' mystery from 40 years ago . Inspector gadget: The spacecraft has been designed to study the moon's exosphere and lunar dust environment and hopefully solve the mystery of the sunrise 'glow' Wizz-ard: The final preparations and close-outs are underway for Friday's launch, including testing all the equipment . ‘On the Earth, we've . been using laser communication and fiber optics to power our Internet . and everything else for the last couple of decades,’ Grunsfeld said. ‘NASA has really been wanting to make that same technological leap and put it into space. This is our chance to do that.’ LADEE's . optical communications system, which includes three ground stations in . addition to LADEE, will be tested before the probe drops into a low . lunar orbit to begin its science mission about 60 days after launch. Just . getting to the moon will take LADEE 30 days - 10 times longer than the . Apollo missions due to the probe's relatively low-powered Minotaur 5 . launcher. The rocket is . comprised of three refurbished intercontinental ballistic missile motors . and two commercially provided boosters.

James Hyett, 33, carried the bloodied animal remains into the 24-hour store in Saffron Walden, Essex in the early hours of the morning hidden inside a black bin bag. He spoke to his former colleagues before dumping the decapitated deer head by the tills. Disgruntled former worker: James Hyett, 33, dumped the deer's head on a self-service till in the Tesco supermarket in Saffron Walden, Essex, a court heard . The Tesco store worker, who was employed by a cleaning contractor, was arrested shortly afterwards. He admitted causing criminal damage when he appeared before Colchester Magistrates' Court today. Denise Holland, prosecuting, said: 'He was seen to go to the self-serve check-outs and was talking to a member of staff there. 'A short time later, he stopped briefly before leaving an item on the check-out before walking off. It was found to be a severed deer head.' A bloodied black bin bag was later found in the store's toilet. Mrs Holland added: 'At the same time a staff member in the bread aisle noticed a foul smell and found that animal intestines had been strewn across one of the shelves.' Hyett, who was spotted on CCTV with a bottle containing yellow liquid, also poured sunflower oil into specialist in-store cleaning equipment. Damage: James Hyett dumped the deer's head at the checkout in the store in Saffron Walden, Essex, which is next to this petrol station . The machine had to be professionally repaired, which cost Tesco hundreds of pounds. He was later questioned by police but only gave partial responses to officers' questions. It was confirmed in court that Hyett, of Saffron Walden, was a former employee but no reason was given for his outrageous behaviour. Elizabeth Bradshaw, mitigating, said her client was 'very remorseful' for the incident which happened in the early hours of June 4. She said: 'It is clear that he has pleaded guilty at the first opportunity. He is very remorseful in relation to this incident and it was very much out of character. 'It was a difficult time for him - that is not an excuse - but it is clear that there were many factors at work which are being dealt with now.' Magistrates have ordered a pre-sentence report and Hyett will return to the court later this month August to discover his fate. He was granted unconditional bail and refused to comment as he left the court.","James Hyett, 33, carried the bloodied remains into the store in a black bag .

NASA's newest robotic explorer rocketed into space late Friday in an unprecedented moonshot from Virginia. The rocket was visible across the eastern seaboard as it streaked toward the moon - including from New York and Washington DC. The LADEE spacecraft, which is charged with studying the lunar atmosphere and dust, soared aboard an unmanned Minotaur rocket a little before midnight, dazzling spectators along the East Coast. 'Godspeed on your journey to the moon, LADEE,' Launch Control said. Scroll down for video . Fly me to the moon: The rocket was visible from Maine to eastern North Carolina, and as far west as Wheeling, West Virginia . Streaking: An unmanned Minotaur rocket carries NASA's newest robotic explorer, the LADEE spacecraft, which is charged with studying the lunar atmosphere and dust, after launching to the moon last night . Go for launch: An unmanned Minotaur 5 rocket blasted off from the Virginia coast on Friday to send a small NASA science satellite on its way to the moon . Flight controllers applauded and exchanged high-fives following the successful launch. 'We are headed to the moon!' NASA said in a tweet. It was a change of venue for NASA, which normally launches moon missions from Cape Canaveral, Fla. But it provided a rare light show along the East Coast for those blessed with clear skies. NASA expected the launch from Virginia's Eastern Shore to be visible, weather permitting, as far south as South Carolina, as far north as Maine and as far west as Pittsburgh. The space agency urged sky watchers to share their launch pictures through the website Flickr, and the photos quickly poured in from New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, New Jersey, Rhode Island, eastern Pennsylvania and Virginia, among other places. 30 day trip: LADEE (Lunar Atmospheric Dust and Environment Explorer) launched aboard a Minotaur V rocket from Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport last night . The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer or LADEE, pronounced 'LA'-dee,' is taking a roundabout path to the moon, making three huge laps around Earth before getting close enough to pop into lunar orbit. Unlike the quick three-day Apollo flights to the moon, LADEE will need a full month to reach Earth's closest neighbor. An Air Force Minotaur V rocket, built by Orbital Sciences Corp., provided the ride from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility. LADEE, which is the size of a small car, is expected to reach the moon on Oct. 6. Scientists want to learn the composition of the moon's ever-so-delicate atmosphere and how it might change over time. Another puzzle, dating back decades, is whether dust actually levitates from the lunar surface. The $280 million moon-orbiting mission will last six months and end with a suicide plunge into the moon for LADEE. View from NYC: The launch was visible to millions of observers along much of the Eastern Seaboard, stretching from South Carolina to Maine. It was the first-ever lunar mission launched from Virginia . The 844-pound spacecraft has three science instruments as well as laser communication test equipment that could revolutionize data relay. NASA hopes to eventually replace its traditional radio systems with laser communications, which would mean faster bandwidth using significantly less power and smaller devices. 'There's no question that as we send humans farther out into the solar system, certainly to Mars,' that laser communications will be needed to send high-definition and 3-D video, said NASA's science mission chief, John Grunsfeld, a former astronaut who worked on the Hubble Space Telescope. It was a momentous night for Wallops, which was making its first deep-space liftoff. All of its previous launches were confined to Earth orbit. NASA chose Wallops for LADEE because of the Minotaur V rocket, comprised of converted intercontinental ballistic missile motors belonging to the Air Force. A U.S.-Russian treaty limits the number of launch sites because of the missile parts. All but one of NASA's previous moon missions since 1959, including the manned Apollo flights of the late 1960s and early 1970s, originated from Cape Canaveral. The most recent were the twin Grail spacecraft launched almost exactly two years ago. The military-NASA Clementine rocketed away from Southern California in 1994. Wallops will be back in the spotlight in less than two weeks. The Virginia-based Orbital Sciences will make its first delivery to the International Space Station, using its own Antares rocket and Cygnus capsule. That commercial launch is scheduled for Sept. 17.","Rocket launched at 11:27 p.m. ET from Virginia .

The iPhone 5s could have a slow-motion camera, according to even more rumours about Apple's upcoming handset. Code hidden inside Apple’s iOS 7 software suggests that the next iPhone could offer video recording at a rate of 120 frames-per-second (FPS) rather than around 30 frames per second. This is fast enough to allow iPhone users to create slow-motion films. Code hidden inside Apple's iOS 7 software suggests that the next generation iPhone could offer video recording at a rate of 120 frames-per-second, enabling users to capture slow-motion video . According to testing undertaken by 9to5Mac the feature named ‘Mogul’ allows iPhone to capture video at an 'exceptionally precise rate.' The resolution at which the 120FPS video could be recorded at is currently unclear. They did, however, find out that Mogul would not activate on an iPhone 5, which suggests that it is intended for a future iPhone. Other action cameras, such as Samsung’s flagship Galaxy S4, already include a slow-motion mode. If the rumours are true, the addition . could be a move by Apple to close the already narrowing gap between . smartphones and cameras. VIDEO: An example of slow-motion video from a Galaxy S4 . Based on the code, 9to5Mac believes the feature would be an option - like Panorama, Square, Video, Standard, and Filters- in the iOS 7 software. Recent speculation has also been mounting about a fingerprint sensor following a string of code discovered in the same beta release. The code describes a user touching the . Home button with their thumb. Frame rate is also known as frame frequency. It is the rate at which a video camera can record consecutive images - called frames. It also applies to computer graphics and motion capture devices. Frame rate is most often listed in frames per second (FPS) but can also be as expressed  as hertz (Hz). The human eye processes around 10 to 12 separate images, or frames, per second and is able to distinguish each frame individually. Early silent films had a frame rate from 14 to 24 FPS which recorded motion, but was jerky. Nowadays, motion pictures use 24 frames per second. Shooting at a slower frame rate increases how fast the motion is when projected because the eye sees it moving quicker than in real life, and quicker than it can make out the individual frames. Anything filmed at a higher rate of 24 FPS appears slowed down because more frames are captured per second than the eye sees so it takes longer for the images to appear in full. A fingerprint then appears on the screen . that changes colour. The . feature could be for security reasons to unlock the phone, or to . authorise payments in the App Store and prevent people from stealing . your phone and obtaining personal data. The current trend in the rise of video sharing has been boosted by apps such as Vine, and features such as Video on Instagram.

The . service added a video icon to the existing Instagram app and users can . record 15-second video clips and edit them together for longer videos.

The giant panda cub born two weeks ago at Smithsonian's National zoo in Washington is a female, who was fathered by the zoo's own panda Tian Tian. DNA samples were taken from the tiny cub, and her fraternal twin which was born dead, to determine the sex and paternity. The panda's mother, Mei Xiang had been artifically inseminated with sperm from Tian Tian and a second panda, Gao Gao, from San Diego Zoo. Healthy: Mei Xiang with her two-week-old female cub at the National Zoo . Who's the daddy? A paternity test proved the zoo's Tian Tian fathered the newborn cub . A den check on Thursday morning showed the mother and cub continue to be healthy, senior curator Brandie Smith said. The cub is starting to develop dark markings in her fur, around the eyes, ears and back. 'It's got a fat little belly,. It's very active, very vocal,' Ms Smith said. The ten-day mark is critical for the cub's survival. After that point, keepers start to gain more confidence about its health. 'We're finally starting to really celebrate,' she said. Since the cub was born Mei Xiang has turned down all offers of food, and has been drinking only a little diluted apple juice, which is normal behavior for the species. A 'panda cam' has been set up in her den so keepers - and the public - can watch the cub's progress. China owns the pandas, an endangered species, at the Smithsonian's National Zoo. The cub is expected to stay with her mother for a little over two years until she is weaned, and will stay at the zoo for about four years. Scroll down for video . Developing: The two-week-old cub's distinctive black and white markings are starting to appear on her coat . Newborn: Zookeepers say the cub is full of life and seems healthy in every way . Paternity test: A vet takes a DNA sample from the new cub which proved Tian Tian had fathered it . New arrival: Mei Xiang gave birth to the cub at the National Zoo in Washington two weeks ago . Mei Xiang's only other surviving cub, a male named Tai Shan, was born in 2005 and was returned to China in 2010. The . 15-year-old gave birth to a cub last year after several years of failed . breeding, but the cub died after six days. Its lungs hadn't fully . developed and likely weren't sending enough oxygen to its liver. The stillborn cub born, a day after its healthy twin, had abnormalities and 'had never been alive,'  zoo spokesman Pamela Baker-Masson said in a statement. 'It lay motionless and made no sound. Throughout, staff could see it visually and hear the first cub squealing, and Mei never set it down.' Zookeepers were able to remove the lifeless cub and saw that the cub suffered abnormalities. The zoo began performing a necropsy on the stillborn cub which they hope will tell them why the cub stopped developing and died, she said. When her cub was first born the protective mother only allowed zoo staff close enough to examine it two days later. Ms Smith compared the . planned examination to a race car pit stop, a fast and highly choreographed . checkup before reuniting mother and cub. The cub's first neonatal exam showed vets it was 'robust, fully formed, . and is a bright, healthy shade of pink,' tweeted the zoo.

Simon Wright, 37, outside Hammersmith Magistrates' Court today, where his claims he was not well enough to do community service were rebuffed . A man who makes £50,000 a year on the streets told a court his ill health would not permit him to do community service today as he was spared jail for repeatedly breaching an Asbo. Simon Wright, 37, a 'workshy' serial beggar who lives in a £300,000 council flat in Fulham, south west London, told magistrates that his epilepsy and asthma meant he couldn't do the community work he was ordered to do instead of a jail term. But the court today ordered him to carry out 40 hours of community work, as magistrate Jacqueline Jenkins said: 'Begging is a form of working - it strikes us that Mr Wright should try to do something more constructive'. Wright, who claims he begs because his benefits are not sufficient, was spotted pleading for cash in London's Leicester Square just weeks after magistrates ordered him to stop operating in the capital. He was arrested and bailed, only to start begging again in nearby Oxford Circus. Sentencing Wright to a 12-month community and supervision order and 40 hours' unpaid work today , chairwoman of the bench Mrs Jenkins told Wright he was lucky to escape prison. She said: 'You have got an Asbo: you know what that is, yet you seem to disregard it. That is going to remain in place. 'We are going to treat you fairly leniently today but if you keep breaching it can be a custodial sentence and that would be a shame, if only because of your dog. 'What would happen to it if you were in custody? 'We are sentencing you to a community order for 12 months with supervision for 12 months; we hope you get something out of this in terms of your addiction of begging. 'We are also giving you 40 hours' unpaid work. We hope that you enter into the spirit of that.' Wright banged on the the dock at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court and shouted out, interrupting the hearing to say he is too sick to do unpaid work because he suffers from asthma and epilepsy. A JP at Hammersmith Magistrates' Court dismissed Wright's health fears, saying 'We are not asking the impossible.' The magistrate told Wright, seen above, going to prison 'would be a shame, if only because of your dog' But magistrates said there was nothing stopping him carrying out the work unless he was 'work-shy'. Mrs Jenkins said: 'Begging is a form of working, he can be outside during daylight hours and he can stand and sit and talk to people. 'We are not asking the impossible. Rather than working as a beggar it strikes us that Mr Wright should try to do something more constructive.' Wright has regularly been seen in ragged clothes sitting on the pavement of Putney High Street in South London, with a handwritten sign claiming he was 'Homeless and hungry'. But in fact he was pocketing as much as £300 a day and returning home each night to his Fulham flat. In May magistrates handed him an Asbo which banned him from begging anywhere in London for two years and from having a dog unmuzzled. Wright lived in this modern flat while spending each day begging with a sign reading 'homeless and hungry' But the serial beggar was spotted by Westminster Council street wardens asking for money in Leicester Square on 9 July. Just a week later he flouted the order again, and was seen begging and with an unmuzzled dog in Oxford Street, central London. At the May hearing, magistrates were told Wright regularly went into betting shops and amusement arcades to change his coins for notes which totted up as much as £300 a day. But despite receiving state hand-outs and living in a taxpayer-funded housing association flat, he pleaded poverty and said he begged for cash because he couldn't afford to live on his benefits. 'He suffers from asthma and epilepsy and he says that is going to be an issue with unpaid work.' - Wright's lawyer Edgar Fernando . Edgar Fernando, defending, told the court: 'Mr Wright is begging because the benefits he relies on don't work out for him to live on. 'He is receiving state benefits and after paying for food and bills he is left with £35 a fortnight; ultimately this is the reason he begs. 'He suffers from asthma and epilepsy and he says that is going to be an issue with unpaid work. He says that if you hand him that you will be setting him up to fail.' But Mrs Jenkins rebuffed this claim and said:  'Having asthma and epilepsy doesn't stop you from doing that work'. At a previous hearing the 37 year-old was handed a conditional discharge for two breaches of his Asbo after he was seen begging in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham on 4 June and on Gloucester Road in west London on 12 June. But the sentence has been found to be improper and he was resentenced to another 12-month community order with supervision to run concurrently. Wright had pleaded guilty to all four charges of breaching an Asbo and did not reply when asked if he would stop begging for good as he left court today.","Simon Wright, 37, given 40 hours' community service instead of prison .

There are only 1,000 grey long-eared bats left in the UK and their numbers are declining as a result of habitat loss, the Bat Conservation Trust has warned. Researcher Dr Orly Razgour said the future survival of the species in Britain remains ‘questionable’, with small pockets remaining in the sought coast of England and the Channel Islands. Researchers have warned that the future survival of grey long-eared bats in the UK is under threat due to the decline in lowland meadows and marshlands. There are only 1,000 of the mammals left in the UK in small pockets along the coast and on the Channel Islands . Head and body length: 41mm - 58mmForearm length: 37mm - 45mmWingspan: 255mm - 300mmWeight: 7g - 12gThumb: 5mm - 6.5mmTragus: 5.2mm - 6.6mm . The grey long-eared bat is also known as the Plecotus austriacus. It is a large European bat with long ears that have a distinctive fold. Grey long-eared bats hunt above woodland, usually by day, and they mostly eat moths. They are often confused with the common brown long-eared bat, and as a species was only distinguished in the 1960s. Grey long-eared bats can be distinguished because they have a paler belly. The frequencies used by this bat species for echolocation lie between 18-45 kHz, have most energy at 28 kHz and have an average duration of 5.8 ms. Source: Bat Conservation Trust . She said the decline in the population of the long-eared bat is likely to have occurred as a result of a reduction in the bats' main foraging habitats - lowland meadows and marshlands – and has called for greater conservation efforts to protect the elusive mammal. But changes in land use and farming practices means many of their feeding grounds have ‘all but disappeared in the UK’. As the species prey on agricultural pests, an increase in numbers would benefit the farming community. ‘The UK's grey long-eared bats need greater conservation efforts before we lose them,’ said Dr Razgour. ‘Despite being one the rarest UK mammals, up until recently there was very little known about the grey long-eared bat and what it needs to survive. ‘Studying the grey long-eared bat, I realised that the plight of this bat demonstrates many of the threats and conservation challenges facing wildlife, from the effects of habitat loss and climate change to the problem of small isolated populations. ‘The UK grey long-eared bat population has been declining and has become fragmented in the past century. This decline and fragmentation is likely to be in response to the dramatic decline of lowland meadows and marshlands, the bat's main foraging habitats. Bats in the UK are protected by law - it is illegal to harm a bat, or to destroy or interfere with a bat roost. But the Channel Islands, one of the remaining strongholds for grey long-eared bats, do not have the same strict laws in place, and the BCT are calling for greater protection . ‘The long-term survival of the grey long-eared bat UK population is closely linked to the conservation of these lowland meadows and marshland habitats.’ Traditionally a cave-dwelling species, they have become dependent on buildings such as lofts or barns for the large open spaces they use for roost sites. More work needs to be done to protect maternity roost sites, where female bats raise their young, and spend the winter, said Dr Razgour, particularly because many are under threat from building development. Grey long-eared bats, pictured, are often confused with the common brown long-eared bat. They were only distinguished as a species in the 1960s . In total, there are 18 species of bats in Britain – making up almost a quarter of our native mammal species. Colin and Jenny Currie have bats in the roof of their home on the Isle of Wight, including pipistrelles, Brandt’s bats and seven rare grey long-eared bats. ‘We moved here in 1983 and were told when we bought the place we had bats! We respect the fact they’re protected and like seeing what’s happening with the bats. When the scientists come to tag them we get to see them up close. They’re brilliant furry creatures. Beautiful,’ said the couple. ‘We feel it’s a privilege – particularly since they’re so rare. It’s great. The first time I saw them I’d gone into the attic. ‘We’re hosts for them really, they’ll be here when we go. It’s lovely that they’re still there! They stayed despite us having our roof re-slated after the storm in 1988. 'We had special wood put in that is kind to bats and the roofers knew how important the bats were left various crevices so the bats can get in and out – the wood was treated with the correct stuff so the bats didn’t disappear.’ Bats in the UK are protected by law – it is illegal to harm a bat, or to destroy or interfere with a bat roost. But the Channel Islands, one of the remaining strongholds for grey long-eared bats, do not have the same strict laws in place, and the BCT are calling for greater protection. Nicky Brown of the Jersey Bat Group said: ‘The Channel Islands are independent jurisdictions. 'Jersey is the only island with legislation to protect its bats. 'Even with legislation, the cumulative impact through development and habitat loss may be critical to the local survival of the species unless strategies for effective protection and enhancement can be implemented.’","Destruction of meadows causing numbers of grey long-eared bats to drop .

"By . Graham Smith . PUBLISHED: . 05:49 EST, 18 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 07:02 EST, 18 October 2012 . The leader of an Islamist group has been named as a commander in last month's attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed three Americans including ambassador Christopher Stevens. Ahmed Abu Khattala, who heads the Benghazi-based Ansar al-Sharia group, was closely involved in the September 11 assault, according to Libyan authorities. Witnesses said they saw Abu Khattala lead the fatal assault, although his exact role has not been made clear. Suspect: Ahmed Abu Khattala, who heads the Ansar al-Sharia group, was closely involved in the September 11 assault on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, according to Libyan authorities . Ablaze: The fighters who attacked the U.S. consulate came armed with machine guns, rocket-propelled grenades and mortars . Rage: A protester hols his rifle during the assault on the Benghazi consulate . The claims further link Ansar al-Sharia to the attack, the aftermath of which has triggered a diplomatic war of words between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in the final run-up to next month's presidential election. Khattala remains at large and has yet to be questioned in relation to the consulate blaze. A U.S. official last week said the Obama administration is tracking Khattala, but added that the assault was likely to have been an organised group effort and not the brainchild of one man. The official told the New York Times: 'Ansar al-Sharia is not only a shadowy group, it’s also quite factionalised. There isn’t necessarily one overall military commander of the group.' Khattala was a member of the Islamist opposition when Muammar Gaddaffi was alive and was imprisoned in the notorious Abu Salim jail. He was released last year and helped the rebels topple Gaddafi from power. He then formed Ansar al-Sharia - which means 'supporters of Islamic law' - with other like-minded former political prisoners. The group now numbers between 100 and 200 fighters. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a desperate battle to save hi, . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . Family: Mr Stevens' brother Tom, and sisters Anne Stevens Sullivan and Hillary Stevens Koziol, speak at his memorial service in San Francisco City Hall yesterday . At loggerheads: The Obama administration's handling of the aftermath of the Benghazi attack came to the fore during Tuesday's second presidential campaign debate . The State Department’s decision to hire Blue Mountain Group to guard the diplomatic mission in Benghazi entrusted security tasks to a little-known British company instead of the large firms it usually uses in overseas danger zones. The contract was largely based on expediency, U.S. officials said, since no one knew how long the temporary mission would remain in the Libyan city. The cradle of last year’s uprising that ended Muammar Gaddafi’s 42-year rule, Benghazi has been plagued by rising violence in recent months. Security practices at the diplomatic compound, where Blue Mountain guards patrolled with flashlights and batons instead of guns, have come under U.S. government scrutiny in the wake of the September 11 attack that killed U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. Federal contract data shows that the Benghazi security contract, worth up to $783,284, was listed as a 'miscellaneous' award, not as part of the large master State Department contract that covers protection for overseas embassies. 'Blue Mountain was virtually unknown to the circles that studied private security contractors working for the United States, before the events in Benghazi,' said Charles Tiefer, a commissioner at the Commission on Wartime Contracting, which studied U.S. contracting in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Several British government sources said that they were unfamiliar with Blue Mountain, which is based in Wales. They said British authorities used a different contractor for security protection in Libya. Fred Burton, vice president of intelligence at the Stratfor consulting firm and a former U.S. diplomatic security agent, said he did not know Blue Mountain, but it likely got State Department work because it was already working in Libya. Blue Mountain was able to work in Libya because it forged a business alliance with a local security firm, as required by Libyan regulations. The firm hired about 20 Libyan men - including some who say they had minimal training - to screen visitors and help patrol the mission at Benghazi, according to Reuters interviews. Some of the guards, who said they had been hired by Blue Mountain after a casual recruiting and screening process, sustained injuries and said they were ill-prepared to protect themselves or others when heavily armed militants last month stormed the rented villa that was serving as the mission. Last week, the State Department said . that it never believed the September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate was . the result of a protest over an anti-Islam movie, contradicting . previous statements. A . dramatic new account revealed that Mr Stevens was locked inside a 'safe . room' and choked to death from diesel-heavy smoke as the building around . him burned to the ground. Alongside him was a security guard, . tasked with the impossible choice between staying in the deadly room, or . facing the rocket-propelled grenades and machine-guns outside. Eventually the guard slipped through the window - and was cut down by . the grenades. No-one saw the ambassador alive again - another agent tried desperately to enter the safe-room, but could not find him anywhere. The . State Department's insistence that it never bought the story - as . initially told by the White House and Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the . UN - that a crude anti-Islam film made in California triggered the . attack gave ammunition against Obama to the Romney campaign. That came to the fore during Tuesday's second presidential campaign debate in Hartley, New York. Mr . Obama said he accepted responsibility for the consulate attack but . angrily denied there had been any sort of cover-up over the tragedy. He said: 'The suggestion that anyone on my team would play politics when we lost four of our own is offensive.' But Mr Romney was dumfounded when Mr . Obama said that the day after the attack he had described it as an 'act . of terror'. The transcript, however, made it unclear whether the . President was speaking generally or more specifically about Benghazi. During . his Rose Garden address on September 12, the day following the attack . in Benghazi, Mr Obama said: 'No acts of terror will ever shake the . resolve of this great nation, alter that character or eclipse the light . of the values that we stand for.' While . he did therefore establish a link between the raid and 'terror' as a . whole, he did not explicitly say that he believed it to have been . conducted by terrorists. And . over the next few days, the President repeatedly linked the attack to . protests against a U.S.-made YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad . which were sweeping the Muslim world at the time. The . surviving members of the compound have described the overnight attack, . which saw agents trapped in the burning compound before finally speeding . away. As they drove . through the crowd, attackers threw grenades and sprayed their armoured . vehicle with gunfire from AK-47 assault rifles from a distance of two . feet. Meanwhile, the ambassador was locked in a safe-room as the compound filled with flames. When the decision was made to escape the diesel-heavy smoke, it was too late, and Stevens never made it out. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours .

A source told The Sun: 'People are quite embarrassed to ask but it seems they want to get their picture taken as the spot where it all happened.' Scott's were unavailable to comment when the Mail Online contacted them. After the row in June, Miss Lawson ended her ten-year marriage to the art mogul this week on the grounds of his ‘unreasonable behaviour’ – in a hearing which lasted for just 70 seconds. The couple were granted a decree nisi at the High Court in London on the grounds that the marriage had ‘irretrievably broken down’, less than eight weeks after they had a heated row which saw Mr Saatchi grabbing Miss Lawson's throat. Mr Saatchi – who initially described the incident as a ‘playful tiff’ – has now accepted a police caution for assault.

However papers lodged at the High Court revealed it was Miss Lawson who petitioned for the divorce. She also answered ‘yes’ when asked if Mr Saatchi’s behaviour had continued. Lawson, who was the applicant in the case, also confirmed in the document that they were living apart. The document was signed by the popular cook and broadcaster on July 9. The pair now have to wait for a decree absolute, which is usually issued six weeks and a day later, ending their marriage. Neither the couple or their legal representatives attended the hearing. A decree nisi is a statement saying the court sees no reason why a divorce cannot be granted. It is thought the divorce will be rubber-stamped some time in September. The pair, who are said to be worth an estimated £150million and shared a £12million home in Chelsea, are believed to have agreed never to publicly disclose the terms of the divorce or financial settlements.

A quarter of parents have at least one grown-up child living with them at home, a study reveals today. The stark figure illustrates the impact of high property prices and the prohibitive fees and deposits demanded by landlords. The average cost of homes in some parts of London is more than £1million while the cost of renting nationally has reached £740 a month. The report, from the National Housing Federation, warns that ‘empty nest syndrome’ – the moment when parents are left alone in the family home – is 'becoming a thing of the past'. Most of the parents said their offspring 'simply could not afford to move out'. The Office for National Statistics says around three million adults between the ages of 20 and 34 do not have a place of their own – 20 per cent more than in 1997 when the UK house price boom began. It said the increase was remarkable because the number of people in this age bracket has remained largely the same. Men are more likely than women to live with their parents – 1.8million compared with 1.1 million. David Orr, chief executive of the federation, said: ‘Empty nest syndrome is becoming a thing of  the past. Moving out and setting up a family home of your own is a normal rite of passage. Yet as rents, mortgages and deposits continue to soar out of reach, it is no longer an option for many. ‘We’re delaying adulthood for grown-up kids who are left stuck in their childhood bedrooms.’ The report, based on a poll of 1,176 parents with children aged 21 to 40, found that 27 per cent lived with their offspring. And it said having an adult child at home could have an adverse effect on parents, with 23 per cent saying it has ‘caused them stress’, 18 per cent that it has triggered family arguments and eight per cent that it has caused them to fall into debt. Craig Berry, 27, and his two grown-up sisters, still share a bedroom and live with their 60-year-old father in the family home in Bradford. All three children have jobs and are desperately trying to save enough money to buy places of their own. Big kids: Many adult children now have no option but to live at home . He said: ‘I get on well with my dad but I know he finds it stressful still having us living at home, especially when arguments kick off. ‘He raised us all on his own and I’m sure he imagined we’d all have left home by the time we were 18. I think he’d like to downsize if he could. He deserves the break. The Government’s latest English Housing Survey highlighted how home ownership has dropped to its lowest level since the 1980s. At its peak in 2003, 71 per cent of householders were ‘owner occupiers’. Today this is just 65.3 per cent. Of the 14.4million homeowners in England, the largest number by a considerable margin are people aged 65 and over, equal to a record 30 per cent of the total. There are 4.3million homeowners in this age group, which is more than a million higher than the total number for any other age group.","ONS says three million 20- to 34-year-olds have no home of their own .

"Police in Manchester investigating whether sinister symbols are used to identify the addresses of elderly people . Code can also indicate whether the house is wealthy, has already been burgled or has something worth stealing . By . Wills Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 04:57 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:11 EST, 5 September 2013 . Burglars are using coded chalk symbols to let other criminals know whether a property is worth targeting. The marks, dubbed the Da Pinci Code, are made by would-be thieves to indicate if the house is vulnerable, revealing who is living in the house and whether there is anything worth stealing. Chillingly one sign, in the shape of an open book, says a . vulnerable female resident is the occupant and another symbol indicates a homeowner who is ‘nervous and afraid’. Code: Would-be criminals scrawl the markings on properties to indicate whether the house is worth targeting . The chalk markings were spotted on the side of a pensioner’s home in Walkden, Greater Manchester. Police are now investigating the shapes after speaking to other residents in the area and have distributed leaflets in the area warning of the symbols. The code has been previously been spotted in other parts of the country. Targeted: The chalk marks were seen on the side of an elderly person's home in Walkden, Greater Manchester . Resembling washing instructions with a series of crosses, circles and boxes, they have been found on walls and surfaces of homes as well as pavements and kerbs. A simple 'X' means the home is a good target, while the same symbol outlined with a circle means there is nothing worth stealing in the property. A capital D with a dash drawn in it indicates that burgling the house is too risky, while five circles in the shape of a star shows that a property is wealthy. Other marks reveal if a house is alarmed or has already been burgled. Salford police are now urging people who have noticed these symbols to take a picture and then wash them off the property as soon as possible. Police launched their investigation after receiving a report from an elderly woman on Sunday, August 25. Chief inspector Sue Downey said: 'Police in Salford received a call from a woman in Walkden, who was concerned that a symbol had been marked on her house in chalk. 'Enquiries have been carried out and residents in the surrounding area have been spoken to, and we have received no further reports of any such activity. 'We always ask the public to remain vigilant and to report any suspicious activity to the police, which we will investigate. 'On this occasion we can find no link between the chalk symbol at this address and any criminality.' In January, police in Torbay, Devon, posted the symbols on Twitter in a bid to warn homeowners that they may be a target for thieves. In 2009, the affluent suburb of Tandridge in Surrey was also targeted by similar markings.","Police in Manchester investigating whether sinister symbols are used to identify the addresses of elderly people .

Students are hardly known for their desire to keep their accommodation spick and span, with mould often left growing in the fridge and bins overflowing with half eaten kebabs and empty cans of cider. So perhaps it is only fitting that this year's ugliest building award has gone to the new University College London digs at 465 Caledonian Road, which judges 'struggled to see as fit for human occupation'. Described as a 'Frankenstein concoction', it saw off stiff competition from runner-up Castle Mill - also built as student accommodation -  which has infuriated residents for blotting out postcard views of the dreaming spires of Oxford. Grim: The UCL student accommodation at 465 Caledonian Road refused planning permission, but a planning inspector overruled the decision . Room with a view: The windows of the new property are at a different level to the original facade, pictured here, meaning students stare straight at a brick wall . Such is public anger with that building, calls have been made for a judicial review into how it came to be approved in the first place. But it was 465 Caledonian Road in the London Borough of Islington that stole Building Design magazine's Carbuncle Cup for the worst new building of 2013. Described as an 'outrageous housing scheme', 465 Caledonian Road offered 'deep grounds for offence in it's cavalier attitude to a historic asset,' according to the jury. Mind the gap: The developer retained the original frontage, but destroyed the rest of the Victorian building to make way for the new building . The magazine accused the architect . Stephen George & Partners of knowing 'a thing or two about grotesque . overdevelopment', adding: The practice’s . solution in Islington has to rank as the mother of all facadectomies.' Stephen George has declined to comment. The . new development was built on a site previously occupied by a listed . warehouse dating back to 1874. All but the front facade was pulled down . to make way for the new building. The bit that was left was stripped of its windows and propped 2m in front of the historic building's replacement. But the retained openings do not align with the new windows leaving students nothing better than a brick wall as a view for the unlucky occupants. According to Building Design: 'Of the . 44 student rooms addressing Caledonian Road, more than half have no . eye-level outlook.' To compensate for the fact the new building was two storeys higher than the original, the builder removed the top of the old facade and added a new floor, before sticking the original top back on again. Building Design said: 'One might hope that these . compromised rooms represent the worst the development has to offer, but . many of those facing away from the street promise to be grimmer still.' When Islington council refused planning permission in 2009, it identified 151 of the units as 'suffering from poor outlook', 179 as not receiving 'good daylighting', and 60 as not having 'adequate privacy'. Controversial: Oxford University's Castle Mill student accommodation was pipped to the post by Caledonian Road . Some of the rooms overlook each other from windows just 5m apart. Building Design pointed out residents of Pentonville Prison just down the road are treated to a better view. Overturning the council's decision, the Planning Inspectorate wrote: 'There is agreement that the nature . of the accommodation warrants some departure from the amenity standards . that would be applied to residential accommodation intended for normal . domestic occupation. 'Relevant . factors in this are that individual students would occupy the . accommodation for less than a year, and that its main function would be . for sleeping due to intensive daytime activities taking place at the . university campus.'

A family has been made homeless after a neighbour apparently tried to smoke out a wasps nest while they were on holiday. Lyndsey Brealey, 27, and her two daughters returned from a break to find her end of terrace house had been gutted in a fierce blaze. Ten firefighters tackled the inferno which was started when a neighbour allegedly attacked a wasp nest inside a cavity wall with a burning rag on the end of a pole. Homeless: Lyndsey Brealey, 27, pictured at her home in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, which was gutted in a blaze started by her neighbour when he tried to 'smoke out' a wasps' nest . In tatters: Ms Brealey and her two daughters are having to stay with a relative while an insurance company looks into the blaze which destroyed much of the family home . The man doused the rag in flammable white spirit before setting it alight and putting it in the gap between the two houses in Sherwood, Nottinghamshire, on Bank Holiday Monday. But a sudden gust of wind stoked the flames which quickly engulfed the entire top floor of Ms Brealey's home and he dialled 999. Ms Brealey and her daughters Ellie, seven, and Nicole, 11, are now staying with relatives while insurance companies investigate the blaze. The mother-of-two said she had no idea what had happened to her home until she returned from holiday last Friday. She said: 'The first thing I noticed was the curtains - I remember drawing them before we left and there was nothing in the window. Fire starter: The fire at the property apparently started when Ms Brealey's neighbour stuck a burning rag into a cavity wall between their homes . In need of repair: Ms Brealey's bathroom covered in soot after the fire ripped through her home . 'Then I just saw what had happened and rushed in to see everything smoke damaged and burnt - the smell was horrible. 'Ellie ran up to her room and was so upset - her toys and clothes were all damaged. We had a really good holiday and then everything just turned really bad, really quickly. 'If Ellie was in her bedroom, it could have all been so much worse. I just don’t want to think about what could have happened.' Her daughter Ellie lost dozens of prized possessions and a beloved hamster in the blaze. She said: 'All my stuff was ruined and it made me pretty sad when I first saw it all.' Dangerous: Ten firefighters battled the blaze which covered the top floor of the family home . The majority of Ms Brealey and her children's clothes and possessions were destroyed in the house fire . Yesterday the man who started the fire said: 'It was just a big accident. There had been a wasps’ nest in the wall cavity for some time and I . decided to try to smoke them out. 'I got a rag and put some spirit on it, then put that on the end of a pole to try to get rid of the wasps. 'A bit of wind came and the fire just got out of control very quickly. I was surprised by how quickly it all happened.' Ms Brealey and her daughters have been living with her aunt Angela Brealey, 44, in nearby Old Basford, Nottinghamshire, since the blaze. Her aunt criticised Ms Brealey's neighbour for trying to get rid of the wasps himself. She said: 'They’ve got nowhere else to go and I wouldn’t have them going to a hostel or anything like that. 'It’s just so daft setting fire to a house when you’re trying to get rid of wasps - why wouldn’t you call the council or something to get it sorted?'

But now Calvin Klein appears to be having second thoughts about privacy at his $75m Hamptons mansion - and is taking steps to keep the public away. The designer has put up signs warning about poison ivy and ticks around the property, which has taken three years to build and is finally nearly completion. People in glass mansions: Calvin Klein has nearly finished his $75M glass-walled Hamptons mansion but may be second-guessing his revealing choices . Southern exposure: The 'minimalist' Hamptons beachfront home has elicited gawkin geven from billionaire neighbors and Klein has put up a modest screen in front of his shower that was once exposed to the street . He has also employed security guards to patrol the area and installed cameras to keep watch on the throngs who have been coming to gawk at the home. The reason is supposedly that Klein appears to be having a rethink about how much of his private life he wants to show off. He built the stunning minimalist mansion with floor to ceiling glass so that even the shower was visible to the public until he put up a modesty screen. According to a recent piece in the New York Times, even from the road the ‘figure of a wiry man with spiky hair and a white T-shirt’ - Klein - could easily be seen going about his business inside. See-through: Klein has posted Do Not Enter signs that warn of poison ivy and ticks as well as guards to shoo away nosy billionaire neighbors eager to peak at the transparent spectacle . The original idea was that the mansion would be ‘naturalistic’ and blend in with the surroundings which, in this case, is the beach and the dunes on an exclusive part of Southampton, New York. Now, however, the New York Post reported that signs around the property have been put up which read: ‘Caution, Poison Ivy and Ticks present: Do Not Enter.’ The security guards have been fitted with white shirts and black trousers and patrol all over the property. Decadent: Calvin Klein has a history of real estate indulgence. He once bought an unfinished Manhattan penthouse then flew a helicopter to where his windows would be to assess his future view . Some also stand at the end of the driveway to stop curious passers-by from peeking in. Part of the reason for the increased security measures is that Klein’s house is finally nearing completion and has become the talk of The Hamptons, no mean feat when other residents include Paul McCartney and Alec Baldwin. On the same stretch of sand the neighbors include David and Julia Koch and hotelier Ian Schrager. This summer Bill and Hillary Clinton also moved into a $200,000 a week rental home in Sagaponack, a short drive further East. Klein spends six days a week in the property and has supposedly personally vetted every single object inside. Every room has sliding doors so that the space can be reorganized at his whim. There are white sofas in every room, Danish-made chairs by Poul Kjaerholm, vintage furniture by Le Corbusier, an infinity pool and a neighboring building he plans to use as a screening room - it is joined to the main house by an underground passageway. During the construction process Klein . built a life-size mock up of the property made of plywood which needed . its own building permits and cost some $350,000 all on its own. The . castle that once stood on the property has an extremely colorful . history - it used to be owned by the tycoon Henry du Pont but after his . death it was bought by Leonard Holzer and his wife Jane, who became . famous for partying with Andy Warhol in the 1970s. In . the 1980s the house was owned by financier Barry Trupin who enraged the . locals when he taped a 24-karat gold mezuzah to the front door. Once upon a time: A castle once stood on the property, but Klein tore it down to build his glass house. The extravagant mansion featured an indoor shark tank and waterfall . Residents branded it ‘a Disney castle on LSD’, not least because of the indoor shark tank and the 20ft waterfall out the back. Klein bought it in 2003 for $30m and later had it all knocked down. According to the New York Times, his obsession with perfection fits with a pattern of taking real estate extremely seriously. When Klein bought a triplex penthouse in the South Tower of the Richard Meier building in Manhattan in 2000, one of the first things he did was fly in a helicopter to where his windows were going to be to get a look at what his view would be like. A spokesman for Klein said he ‘always has had security at his houses over the years.’ The spokesman said: ‘Yes, there are signs warning of ticks because the deer are rampant out here and people are warning of late of the grave danger Lyme disease presents to anyone exposed’.","The wealthy designer has put up Keep Out signs and others that warn of ticks and poison ivy .

A luxury apartment that was being renovated by Alexander McQueen has finally gone on sale three years after the flamboyant fashion designer tragically took his own life. It is unlikely that the luxury Mayfair property in the heart of the capital has been decorated to the eccentric style that the former chief designer for Givenchy would have chosen himself. But the 2,500sqft three-bedroom pad - two of which have their own private courtyards plus en suite bathrooms - is a home for the truly well-heeled nevertheless. For sale: The home that was being renovated by Alexander McQueen has finally gone on the market three years after the designer's death . Modern: The living room has been decorated in cream with a dark wooden floor, perhaps a more conservative tone than McQueen would have chosen himself . Life of luxury: The courtyards, which can be accessed through two of the bedrooms, have been lined with shrubs . Once home to the author PG Wodehouse as well as a grandson of Queen Victoria, the property in Dunraven Street is about to go on the market through estate agent Knight Frank for £7.25 million. A blue plaque on the exterior of the building pays tribute to Wodehouse, the author behind the Jeeves and Wooster novels. The year after McQueen was found hanged after committing suicide in 2010, the property was snapped up by property development company Aspire, funded by a specialist loan from Dragonfly Property Finance. Chief executive Gary Brine set about finishing the work started by McQueen, according to an article in The Times yesterday. Easy living: Two of the bedrooms have their own private courtyards as well as en suite bathrooms . Fish soup: McQueen was looking forward to his new kitchen, where he would have prepared the perfect bouillabaisse . And while the interior's neutral colours may be a little on the conservative, the designer has retained the wine store, a feature McQueen spoke enthusiastically in his last interview before he died. Each year the Pinault family, the French . majority shareholders of the McQueen fashion house and owners of a . Bordeaux vineyard, sent the 40-year-old a case of their finest wine. Dream home: Alexander McQueen was found dead at another of his properties before he got the chance to move into his new home . Speaking to Harper's Bazaar, he had said: 'My cave should be full of Latour - I've still got 28 bottles left. 'Francois-Henri Pinault sends me a case each year with a note asking that we leave them for at least six years. 'But I drank a whole case at Christmas - loved it.' McQueen spoke enthusiastically to the magazine's Godfrey Deeny, who wrote: 'One can tell he's desperately keen to move into his new home, anxious to get the art he's bought installed, keen to walk is dogs in Hyde Park and determined to do lots of cooking. 'McQueen gets very excited explaining how to make a good bouillabaisse.' But he never did get to rustle up his favourite fish soup in his dream home. He was found hanged by his housekeeper at another of his properties in Green Street, London in February, 2010, shortly after the interview. McQueen was born in Lewisham south . London in 1969 and was the youngest of six children. His father was a . taxi driver and his mother, a social sciences teacher. Shortly after he was born the family moved to a small terraced council house in Stratford, east London. Openly . gay, he left school at 16 with just one O'Level in art, and was offered an apprenticeship at . traditional Savile Row tailor Anderson and Shephard. He later went to . work at neighbouring Gieves and Hawkes. It was while here that he developed . his deftly cut tailored look and in less than 10 years he was to become . one of the most respected fashion designers in the world. Following . stints working for Koji Tatsuno, then Romeo Gigli in Milan, he returned . to London where he completed a masters degree in Fashion Design at . Central St Martins. Talent: McQueen took the fashion world by storm when he got his big break in 1996. Pictured here with Naomi Campbell (left) Kate Moss (on his right) and Annabel Nielson (far right) When he displayed his portfolio in 1992, it was snapped up in its entirety by Isabella Blow, fashion editor of Tatler magazine. But it was in 1996 that McQueen got . arguably the biggest break he would ever have when he was appointed . chief designer at the French fashion house Givenchy. One . of his career highlights came in 1996 when he was asked by pop legend . David Bowie to design his wardrobe for his forthcoming tours. He also designed the Union Jack jacket worn by Bowie on the cover of his drum and bass album, Earthling. In 1997 McQueen collaborated with . Icelandic popstar Bjork, design the cover for her Homogenic album and . directing the video for the single Alarm Call. In . 2009 - the year before he died - he ventured back into the world of pop . music again when he was asked by Lady Gaga to design some of the . clothes for her Bad Romance video.

Diva: The year before he died, McQueen designed some of the costumes for Lady Gaga's video Bad Romance . In an illustrious career during which he was labelled a 'l'enfant terrible' and 'the hooligan of English fashion', McQueen was to be named British Designer of the year four times between 1996 and 2003, and International Designer of the Year by the Council of Fashion Designer's of America in 2003. He was also made a CBE in 2003. But despite his fame and riches, he was having troubles in his personal life. David LaChappelle, a friend of the designer, said in the lead up to his death he was 'doing a lot of drugs and was very unhappy'. He took his own life just nine days after he lost his mother to cancer, and just days before the start of London Fashion Week.

A fiery explosion sparked by a possible gas leak has leveled a home in California and damaged two others, shaking a neighborhood awake before dawn. Astonishingly, no one was hurt when the home in Riverside, about 50 miles east of downtown Los Angeles, exploded and remained alight at 4am on Friday. Authorities found the house 'completely blown up', fire Capt. Bruce Vanderhorst said. Eight fire engines were called in to deal with a blaze coming from a gas meter. The home on Cochise Drive was reduced to nothing but twisted metal and blackened wreckage, with a tongue of fire flaring in the middle of it. Wiped out: A Riverside firefighter wraps up fire hose after working to put out a massive fire at the remains of a home that exploded early on Friday morning after a possible gas leak . Devastating: An aerial image shows how it was entirely wiped out and how neighbors also suffered damage . The home had been undergoing renovation for about a month and was vacant, Vanderhorst said. He added the explosion might have been caused by a gas leak. A home next door was on fire, and another had lesser damage, Vanderhorst said. Wayne Keller and his wife, holding their dog, stood outside their badly damaged home, near the house that was leveled. 'We heard an explosion, and we got out of our bed, and when I came into the front room, both windows on that side of the house, the far side of the house, nothing but fire and flames,' he told KABC-TV.

Plans by the University of London to sell four of Shakespeare's folios at auction, including a rare first edition, have been described by an expert as 'stupidity of the highest order'. Academics fear if the sale goes ahead, the manuscripts, all of which were printed in the 17th century, will be snapped up by a private collector and will be moved overseas. Only 232 of the first press, which dates back to 1623, are believed to have survived intact. It contains the famous engraving of the Bard by Martin Droeshout. Rare: An example of the First Folio, printed in 1623. This edition contained the famous picture of the Bard, by Martin Droeshout . Auction: The University of London's Senate House Library (left) is about to put the rare works up for sale. American philanthropist Sir Louis Sterling (right) bequeathed the library books when he died in 1958 . The university hopes to raise about £5million when the folios go up for sale at auction house Bonhams, in November. The books were bequeathed to the university's Senate House Library by American philanthropist, Sir Louis Sterling, when he died in 1958, on the condition they were not sold later. Because the library holds two copies of the first folio, which is regarded as being the most reliable, director Christopher Pressler told The Times one could be sold because they are 'essentially duplicaties'. The claims drew derision from Shakespeare expert and visiting professor at University College London, Sir Brian Vickers. He described it as 'rubbish', and pointed out no two books were the same because printing practices in the 17th century meant that every time a page was printed, the press would be stopped and corrections made. Strong words: A detail of Hamlet's famous soliloquy from the 1623 First Folio edition of Shakespeare's plays. The book contains 36 plays, 18 of which had not been seen before . Historic: Shakespeare's were not printed in their entirety until 1623. Before then they had not been considered worthy enough . He added: 'One of these copies may contain a correction that has puzzled people for many years and has never been solved. 'So to sell them is an act of stupidity of the highest order.' The majority of the first folios have already moved overseas and in a letter to Mr Pressler, Professor Henry Woudhuysen, rector of Lincoln College at the University of Oxford, warned Senate House would harm its reputation if it went ahead with the sale. He wrote: 'It will, I fear, make many . who are supporters of the library and possible donors to it turn their . charitable interests elsewhere. 'The rationale for the sale is muddled and prompts questions about the current management of the collections.' The Bard: An early portrait of the English poet and playright, whose works are being put up for sale by the University of London to the horror of experts . Lecturer in Shakespeare at the University of Nottingham and trustee of the British Shakespeare Association, Dr Peter Kirwin, said: 'It's deeply surprising that the library would sell books of this nature when they have been bequeathed as a permanent gift. 'My view is that the key issue here is these books were intended as a permanent gift to the university's library, and any sale could move the books to a private collection. 'Not being made available to the public is a really serious matter.' Senate House plans to use the money raised through the sale to add to its collection by buying manuscripts from the 20th and 21st century, a plan described by Prof Woudhuysen as a 'gamble'. He said: 'The sale would leave the library as Hamlet without the prince.' In his view the most likely fate for the rare editions would a 'very rich, private individual' would make a move for them. A consultation on the plan began last week and the manuscripts are set to leave the country this month for a tour of cities in the US.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 04:34 EST, 31 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:10 EST, 31 August 2013 . House prices have leapt almost £500 a month this summer as the market continues to recover and government attempts to kickstart mortgage lending enabled more first-time buyers to get a foot on the property ladder. The average price for a UK home now stands at £170,514, a rise of 3.5 per cent from last August, according to Nationwide building society. In addition, mortage lending is at its highest for more than five years, according to Bank of England figures. Experts say a 'rising tide' of lending is boosting the property market. Rising higher: House prices continued to rise on a quarterly basis, suggesting a continuing strengthening in the market . Government schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy have boosted the market by helping first-time buyers, in particular, on to the property ladder, enabling the market to avoid the traditional summer lull. The £80bn Funding for Lending Scheme . launched in August 2012 offers banks and building societies discounted . loans in return for pledges to lend to businesses and households. Initiative: Chancellor George Osborne's Funding for Lending and Help to Buy schemes have been credited with keeping the housing market lively during the normally sleepier summer months . It has been credited with improving the availability of mortgages and reducing interest rates. Chancellor George Osborne also launched Help to Buy in April, which allows people to buy a property with a 5 per cent deposit. The state lends buyers 20 per cent of the value of a new home worth up to £600,000, interest-free for five years. Figures from the Bank of England showed that mortgage approvals climbed to 60,624 last month, up from 58,238 in June. This marks the highest level since March 2008. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders recently showed that first-time buyers accounted for 45 per cent of house purchase loans between April and June - the highest since records began in 2005. Nationwide said house prices rises had shot up 1.4 per cent in the three months to August - the strongest pace of increase since mid-2010. The building society said this rise was evidence of the growing robustness of the property market. Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of Dragonfly Property Finance, said: ‘While the Nationwide's figures are stronger than the Land Registry's, also published this week, what's not in doubt is that prices, overall, are rising.' Richard Sexton, director of e.surv chartered surveyors, told the Daily Express: 'The housing market is being lifted by a rising tide of mortgage lending. House purchase lending is 30 per cent higher than last July, which reflects the drastic improvement in the availability of high loan-to-value mortgages.' On the up: House prices have been rising steadily this year with the average UK house price at a three-year high . Mr Sexton said the mortgage market was now much more accessible to first-time buyers, which had triggered 'a ripple of activity all the way up the ladder'. He added that the choice of mortgages available to borrowers was at its highest since the financial crisis, which had opened up the market to a much wider spectrum of people. Some property experts suggested that the surge in house purchases in what is traditionally a quieter month for the market could be partly down to buyers rushing to get on to the property ladder before prices rise any further. Haste: buyers may be rushing to buy a property before prices rise any further . Boost: The number of first-time buyers entering the property market has leapt to levels not seen in nearly ten years since the launch of the Help to Buy scheme . But there are concerns that these schemes will push up house prices and borrowing levels, rather than spurring on more new home construction. Bank of England governor Mark Carney warned earlier this week over the risks of another housing bubble. He said the Bank is ‘acutely aware’ of the potential threats and said action will be taken to clamp down on mortgage lending if needed. The Bank could step in and ask lenders to restrict borrowing terms or even force banks to hold more cash on their balance sheets to slow down price rises. Warning: Bank of England governor Mark Carney said he is 'acutely aware' of the risks of another housing bubble . Steep gains: The percentage rise in the average house price since last summer has been steep, illustrating the effect of government efforts to unblock mortgage lending . Earlier this week mortgage industry professionals joined mounting criticism of George Osborne's subsidies aimed first-time buyers, as a survey found most of them expected property values to surge by 11 per cent by 2016. The Intermediary Mortgage Lenders Association found 60 per cent of lenders and mortgage advisers feared a house price bubble. Lenders are already forecasting the average house price will rise by 2.7 per cent by the end of this year, based on Land Registry data of sales in the first half of 2013. Peter Williams, executive director of IMLA, warned the Government might end up giving with one hand and taking away with the other. He warned the Government’s exit from the scheme would also need to be managed very carefully on order to avoid doing serious harm to levels of mortgage lending and said more needed to be done to build more homes in order to meet demand and prevent another bubble. ‘If people are struggling to raise deposits in the current climate, then a further 11 per cent increase in house prices will lift the property ladder even further out of reach for some. Affordability fear: But house the average house price to earnings ratio has also been creeping up in recent months, meaning the property ladder will remain out of reach for many . Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, said: ‘While there have been encouraging signs that house building is starting to recover, construction is still running well below what is likely to be required to keep up with demand.' He added: ‘The risk is that if demand continues to run ahead of supply, affordability may become stretched.’ Property experts said the growth in house prices was expected but also warned the figures masked contrasting regional variations. Mr Samuels said that while demand was rising steadily, buyers were becoming much more wary about paying over the odds for a property, and that the recovery of the housing market was patchy across the country. ‘As ever, it's important to remember that the average house price figure glosses over areas of the country where the market is less robust,' he added. ‘London and the South East may be steaming ahead but other areas, especially in the North, are still spluttering their way to recovery.’ House prices have risen by 6.3 per cent in London over the past year, figures revealed yesterday. But they were falling or stalling in the rest of the country, according to data released by the Land Registry – highlighting the gulf in Britain’s property market. While the cost of the average home in London has reached an all-time high of £385,800, in other parts of the country house prices are £30,000 below their peak. Wales experienced the biggest fall, with prices down 2.2 per cent in the past year to an average of £115,149. In the North East, the average house price is only £99,718. Even in the regions where they are rising, the increases were only modest – 0.5 per cent in the East Midlands, 1.3 per cent in the East and 1 per cent in the South West. The average price of a home in England and Wales is £164,098, up only 0.8 per cent in the past year. The Land Registry said the number of homes sold for £1million or more has risen by 28 per cent in the past year, to 24 a day. The total in May was 740 – 508 of which were in London.","Average UK house price is £170,514 - up 3.5 per cent from last August .

Controversy: Lord Howell of Guildford said fracking could go ahead in the North East because it was inhabitable . A Tory peer provoked a storm of criticism yesterday by suggesting fracking should be concentrated in the North East of England because it is ‘desolate’. Lord Howell, the father-in-law of Chancellor George Osborne, said ‘beautiful rural areas’ further south should be spared the disruption caused by the controversial method of shale gas extraction. The peer, who as David Howell was Energy Secretary under Margaret Thatcher and long-serving MP for Guildford in Surrey, claimed that the North East was so sparsely populated that fracking could take place without any impact on the environment or local people. His comments in the House of Lords drew gasps of astonishment – and immediate condemnation. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted: ‘North east England very beautiful, rugged, welcoming, inspiring, historic, advancing, not “desolate” as was said in House of Lords today.’ Labour accused Lord Howell, 77, whose daughter Frances is married to the Chancellor, of wishing to protect Tory heartlands in the South East while condemning the North to shale gas drilling. The peer later apologised for ‘any offence caused’ but his comments are embarrassing for the Conservatives, who must gain seats in the North to have any hope of winning the 2015 election. Last night Tories distanced themselves from Lord Howell, pointing out that he was no longer connected to the Government after stepping down in April as  William Hague’s adviser on energy. His intervention came as villagers entered the sixth day of protests against fracking in the West Sussex countryside. Some 23 people have so far been arrested in Balcombe, which has been earmarked for exploratory drilling by fracking company Cuadrilla. Stand-off: There is a heavy police presence today escorting vehicles past protestors at a proposed fracking site in Balcombe, West Sussex . Police lines: Officers have been forced to escort lorries on to the fracking site at Balcombe . Protest: Opponents of fracking claim it can trigger earthquakes and risks polluting waterways . Forcibly removed: Former Page 3 model Marina Pepper was carried away from the scene where protestors were blocking a lorry at a proposed fracking site near Balcombe, West Sussex . Police outnumbered the campaigners . yesterday morning, with officers forming a human shield to enable . delivery lorries to enter the site unhindered by a group of 50 . protesters who included Mick Jagger’s ex-wife Bianca Jagger. Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel. Lord Howell told the Lords that it . would be a ‘mistake to think of and discuss fracking in terms of the . whole of the United Kingdom in one go’. ‘There obviously are, in beautiful . rural areas, worries about not just the drilling and the fracking, which . I think are exaggerated, but about the trucks, and the delivery, and . the roads, and the disturbance,’ he said. ‘And those are quite justified . worries. ‘But there are large and uninhabited . and desolate areas. Certainly in part of the North East where there’s . plenty of room for fracking, well away from anybody’s residence, where . we could conduct without any kind of threat to the rural environment.’ Despite stunned exclamations from . peers, Lord Howell continued unperturbed, saying that a distinction . ‘should be made between one area and another, rather than lump them all . together’. Labour’s Lord Beecham, former leader . of Newcastle City Council, said: ‘Neville Chamberlain spoke of pre-war . Czechoslovakia as “a far away country of which we know nothing”. Lord . Howell clearly has a similar view on the North East and his comments . once again highlight the Tories’ problem with the North.’ While Northumberland is England’s . least densely populated county, the North East, far from being desolate, . contains a wealth of spectacular scenery including the north Pennines, . the Cheviots and a national park, as well as two World Heritage sites: . Hadrian’s Wall and Durham Cathedral. David Skelton, director of Renewal, . which campaigns to broaden the appeal of the Conservative Party, said: . ‘The North East boasts some of the finest landscapes in the country. I’d . be delighted to give Lord Howell a tour. ‘The choice over where fracking should take place should be taken by local communities.’ Jude Leitch, of Northumberland . Tourism, said: ‘He’s probably never been up here in his life.’ Last . night Lord Howell was forced into a humiliating climbdown. In a statement he said: ‘I apologise . for any offence caused. I certainly did not intend to suggest that the . North East is desolate. ‘There are parts of the country that . are less densely inhabited than others. That includes parts of the North . East but also other areas in the South of England as well.’ Lord Howell (pictured right) was born in 1936 and educated at Eton. From 1954 to 1956 he was in the Armed Forces in the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards. He studied Economics at King’s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1959. His first job was with HM Treasury from 1959-60 as part of the Treasury Economic Section. He then spent four years as a leader writer for the Daily Telegraph until 1964. Lord Howell has written a number of books, including The Edge of Now, about the challenges of democracy in the digital age, published in 2000. After an unsuccessful bid for Dudley at the 1964 General Election, he became director of the Conservative Political Centre. Two years later, he eventually won the seat of Guildford, representing the Surrey county town until 1997, when he was made a life peer. Lord Howell is the former Secretary of State for Energy, and later for Transport in Margaret Thatcher’s first Cabinet (1979-83). He was Minister of State in Northern Ireland (1972-74) and has held several other government posts. He was chairman of the International Energy Agency ministerial meeting in May 1979. From 1987-97, he was chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. From May 2010 to Sept 2012, Lord Howell was appointed Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with responsibility for international energy policy. After stepping down from the post in September 2012, he was appointed as personal adviser to Foreign Secretary William Hague on energy and resource security. According to the Conservative Party website, Lord Howell is credited by several authorities with having invented the idea of privatisation in the late 1960s. He is also Chairman of the British Institute of Energy Economics, which counts Shell and BP among its members. Lord Howell is married with two daughters and one son. One of his daughters, Frances, is married to George Osborne, the Chancellor.","Lord Howell branded 'foolish and ill-informed' for attack on the North East .

Curiosity landed in the Gale crater on Mars on 6 August 2012 after being guided some 450 million kilometres away, to within 80m of the planet's atmosphere. Speaking at the Royal Academy of Engineering last year, Dr Charles Elachi, director of Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), said: 'The accuracy with which we have to point, to be at the right angle and the right location, is equivalent to me being in LA and hitting a golf ball to St Andrews here in the UK - and the ball landing in a cup that is moving at around 60,000mph, because Mars is moving.' Curiosity has traveled around one mile in the past year. This map shows where the rover has been between landing at 'Bradbury Landing' on 6 August last year and the position reached during the mission's 351st Martian day on 1 August 2013 . 'Landing on another planet is not a walk in the park...we have about 3 tonnes of mass coming in at a speed of almost 12,000mph and we have to land softly within six minutes.' Scientists at Nasa used a ground-breaking 'sky crane' carrier to lower the rover to the Martian surface.

This scene of 7 photos taken in march shows Twin Cairns Island - the two central rocks . The rover has travelled almost 700 metres in the past month since leaving an area of Mars where it has been analysing rocks for around six months. It is now trundling along to its final destination - Mount Sharp - where it will look at the lower layers of the mountain that towers over the centre of Gale Crater by almost three and a half miles. Mount Sharp is of interest to scientists because its layers of rock can reveal information about the planet's changing environment over time. So far, Curiosity has provided more than 190 gigabits of data, returned more than 36,700 full images and 35,000 thumbnail images, fired more than 75,000 laser shots to investigate the composition of targets, collected and analyzed sample material from two rocks and driven more than one mile . Certain layers have been identified by Mars orbiters as originating in a wet environment. The rover first examined ground nearer the crater where it quickly found signs of 'vigorous ancient stream flow' - the first streambed pebble deposits ever examined up-close on Mars. Evidence of a past environment well suited to support microbial life . came within the first eight months of the 23-month primary mission from . analysis of the first sample material ever collected by drilling into a . rock on Mars. NASA's Mars rover Curiosity used the Navigation Camera to take this photo in July.

A British holidaymaker has died in Ibiza - the second casualty of partying on the Balearic Islands in less than a week. Christopher Briggs, 25, was found dead by a friend after an alcohol-fuelled night out in the notorious party resort of San Antonio. He is believed to have fallen and hit his head after returning to his hotel room alone. Tragedy: A British man has died after a night out in the Ibiza resort of San Antonio, pictured . Mr Briggs was staying with a group of friends in two rooms at the two-star Apolo Hotel. Police were called to the hotel on Sunday morning when one of his roommates returned from a night out and found him lying on the floor next to his bed. A post-mortem was due to take place this morning. One friend told local Civil Guard officers that he became separated from Mr Briggs while partying - he admitted they were drinking heavily but insisted they did not take drugs. Casualty: Last week Thomas Ousby died on Majorca after falling from the ninth floor of a hotel . A source close to the investigation said: 'There were no signs of violence on his body apart from a head injury which it is thought he suffered during a fall. 'The post-mortem will obviously determine the cause of death but everything at this stage is pointing to it being the result of a tragic accident.' Last Thursday aspiring model and musician Thomas Ousby, 19, plunged to his death from the ninth-floor of a hotel in Magaluf on the neighbouring island of Majorca. Mr Ousby, from Uxbridge in West London, had jetted out to the resort in early June and was selling tickets for bar crawls and boat parties. His last tweet on the day he died read: 'Magas all good. Coming home sometime this week though, me thinks.' He is said to have ignored a maintenance man who spotted him climbing an external fire escape and told him to get down. Last month father-of-three Craig Knapp, 31, from Dundee, killed himself by jumping to his death from a 10th balcony in Magaluf after leaving a suicide note on Facebook.

Projects being supported include stimulating private investment, providing solar panels, irrigation schemes and building water pipelines . By . Daniel Martin and James Chapman . UPDATED: . 12:33 EST, 7 December 2011 . The UK Energy and Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne said the cash pledge will 'improve access to low carbon energy' in developing countries . The Government today said it had allocated more than £1 billion in initial funding to help poor countries cope with climate change. Speaking at the latest round of climate talks in Durban, South Africa, Climate Change Secretary Chris Huhne said the 'fast start' funding included money to help the most vulnerable people in Africa. The announcement comes as countries attempt to establish a 'green climate fund' at the Durban talks, to channel billions of pounds to poor countries as part of a pledge to provide £64 billion a year in climate finance by 2020. At the chaotic climate talks in Copenhagen two years ago countries including Britain committed to an initial £6.4 billion a year for three years to support efforts by developing countries to cope with climate change, with a long-term plan to scale up to £64 billion by the end of the decade. In total, Britain has pledged £3.4 billion in climate finance, with £2.9 billion announced by the coalition Government for this spending review period. Projects being supported by Britain include stimulating private investment to provide low-cost, green technology such as solar panels and irrigation schemes in East Africa and building water pipelines in Namibia. Mr Huhne said: 'We are looking for practical outcomes on the ground that help build the resilience of some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world.' Negotiators at the climate talks are under pressure to make progress on establishing the green climate fund, and to agree sources of cash for the scheme. Mr Huhne said the UK was 'fully committed to the green fund', and supported the proposals the committee set up to design the scheme. The climate fund is one of a number of issues being debated at the negotiations, where the central focus is the EU's bid to get a roadmap towards a global legally binding climate deal that covers all major polluters in return for signing up to a second set of emissions cuts under the existing Kyoto climate treaty. Heat is on: Solar panels are powering homes in southern Sudan . Asked if he had concerns that the establishment of the fund could be held hostage by the rest of the negotiations, Mr Huhne said many countries were arguing for the need to make progress in a range of areas including a new climate deal and the green fund. 'We have to proceed in parallel, but while it's early stages, I'm hopeful we will get a deal that satisfies everyone,' he said. He also said that levies on emissions from aviation and shipping were the most likely areas to provide early finance for the green fund. The plans have fueled criticism from Tory backbenchers over David Cameron’s promise to increase UK spending on aid at a time when public services in Britain are facing swingeing cuts. Philip Davies, Tory MP for Shipley, said: ‘It is completely unjustifiable to spend so much money at a time when we’re reducing the number of police officers in this country.’ Fellow Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘What makes it worse is that much of the aid budget is spent on things that are not really benefiting developing countries. The answer is trade, not aid.’ In a sign that the Government is pulling in different directions on environmental policy, George Osborne will announce tomorrow that the Treasury will offer £250million in tax breaks to firms hit by Mr Huhne’s climate change policies. He will use his Autumn Statement – effectively a mini-Budget – to help companies that use large amounts of energy after being warned that Britain’s plans to cut carbon emissions faster than our competitors was driving business abroad. Energy-intensive firms such as cement, aluminium and steel makers will get 95 per cent relief from the climate change levy as well as tens of millions of pounds to offset new carbon levies. Mr Osborne insists Britain should not seek to lead the world in cutting emissions and that he is not prepared to bankrupt British businesses by putting them at a competitive disadvantage. But Mr Huhne is pressing ahead with spending taxpayers’ money promoting green policies in the rest of the world. In the second week of the UN climate change conference in the South African city of Durban, he is expected to say the aid will go towards a variety of anti-climate change schemes, such as helping African farmers protect their crops against flooding and drought, installing solar panels in villages, and building slurry pits to produce gas for generators. Projects to target illegal logging in tropical forests will also get cash. Ethiopia and Rwanda are expected to benefit, as well as South Africa - the most developed country on the continent with an economy which grew far faster than Britain’s last year. It is not known whether the money will go straight to governments or whether it will be channelled via charities and companies. Some £282.5million has already been allocated towards aid for foreign climate-change projects. But next week’s announcement will see hundreds of millions more allocated to African climate-change projects by 2015. Last night critics questioned whether so much money should continue to be ploughed into Africa, where aid money has a history of disappearing as a result of corruption. Just last week, an independent watchdog found that the rapid expansion of Britain’s international aid programme has left it increasingly exposed to fraud. Julian Morris, president of the London-based think tank International Policy Network, said Mr Huhne’s announcement would be seen as a ‘bribe’. A NASA thermal satellite image shows the world's arctic surface temperature trends. Experts have warned that levels of the greenhouse gases that drive climate change have reached a record high . ‘The timing seems to be a cynical move by the British Government,’ he said. ‘It suggests this is an attempt to bribe African governments to sign up to whatever deals the British Government wants them to sign up to in Durban. 'The money will almost certainly go to foreign governments and do little to improve the lot of the poor.’ Robert Oxley of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘The Government should be freezing international aid, not increasing it. ‘Rather than throwing money away on corruption and programmes that deliver little of real substance, aid should be targeted at the world’s poorest who really need help.’ A spokesman for Mr Huhne’s Department for Energy and Climate Change would not confirm the total amount, and said it was not new money as it will be drawn from the Coalition’s fully- funded £2.9billion International Climate Fund. Last night Business Department sources said Vince Cable had been instrumental in raising his concern about the cost of energy and climate change policies on manufacturing businesses, writing to the Prime Minister and George Osborne on the issue in April. ‘They have made considerable capital investment in their British plants to make sure they are energy efficient. This investment shows their commitment to the UK,’ said one. ‘That’s why it’s so vital we don’t repay their faith in Britain with the introduction of a hefty tax, which could see them relocate and result in the loss of British jobs and do nothing about reducing global carbon emissions.’","Britain has pledged £3.4 billion in .

The son of a Florida fertility doctor has pleaded guilty to tricking his pregnant ex-girlfriend into taking a pill that caused her to suffer a miscarriage. John Welden, 29, faced a judge in Tampa on Monday on charges of tampering with a consumer product and conspiracy to commit mail fraud after tricking his ex, Remee Jo Lee. Welden, who faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and three years of supervised release, will be sentenced on December 5. Lee, her attorney and federal prosecutors have claimed Welden forged his father's signature on a prescription for Cytotec - which is used to induce labor - and relabeled a pill bottle as 'amoxicillin'. In court: Remee Jo Lee, left, suffered a miscarriage after her ex-boyfriend Andrew Welden, right, gave her an abortion-inducing pill. On Monday he pleaded guilty to tampering with a consumer product . She lost her seven-week-old fetus after taking the pill. After the charges against Welden emerged, it was claimed that he gave her the pills so that his other girlfriend, a woman named Tara Fillinger, would not find out about their relationship. According to evidence filed in federal court, Welden had been dating Fillinger for seven years and had been seeing Lee for about seven months when she fell pregnant. Fillinger had . become suspicious about their relationship after she found Lee's positive pregnancy test . and prenatal vitamins in his car. Welden lied and told her that both items . belonged to his sister. Happier time: Andrew Welden, pictured with his ex-girlfriend Remee Lee, allegedly gave her pills and claimed they were antibiotics. But hours later, she was rushed to hospital and lost the baby . After the charges against him were filed, Fillinger asked a judge to grant him bail so he could be released. She said they had spoken about getting married and were looking to buy a house together. Other woman: He was reportedly worried his other girlfriend, Tara Fillinger, would learn of the pregnancy . When Welden was arrested in May, it emerged that Miss Lee had had an ultrasound at the office of his father, Dr Stephen Welden, which . confirmed she was pregnant. John . Welden told her his father had prescribed her antibiotics and gave her a . bottle of the abortion drugs. Miss Lee told authorities she never . called the doctor's office to confirm the prescription because she . trusted Welden. She took a pill on the way to work and immediately began to bleed and suffer from pain. She lost the baby at the hospital. It was there, that a doctor saw the . pills Miss Lee took and told her they were meant for inducing pregnancy - . or abortion. Federal . prosecutors said Welden never wanted Miss Lee to have his baby - even . though she was determined to keep the pregnancy and raise the child. Authorities released a transcript of a conversation Miss Lee had with . Welden. After she lost the fetus in the hospital, she went to police and . agreed have her conversations with Welden recorded. Welden told Miss Lee that Miss Fillinger, his other girlfriend, had found out about their relationship and was 'furious.' Lost: This is an ultrasound showing Miss Lee's fetus after six weeks. She lost the baby after being tricked into taking an abortion pill . Miss Lee says: 'If you wanted to go be with Tara, that's fine. Go be with Tara.

'I . woulda had my kid and I woulda been fine with that... woulda told my . parents it was someone else's. I wouldn't have bothered you for money. I . wouldn't have bothered you at all.' 'I didn't want to be that guy,' Welden replies. 'So you're going to be the guy that goes and just kills the baby without even letting me know?' Miss Lee says. 'To save your own precious hide? Right?' Welden responds: 'I guess. If I saved anything, I didn't really save anything.' Welden also takes time during his conversation with Miss Hill to pity himself. 'My life is over,' he whines. 'I just wanna kill myself.' After . he admits to giving Miss Lee the abortion drug he says: 'I'm just a . horrible person, Remee. I'm sorry I ruined everything.'

Three out of four people whose parents go into a care home lose all or most of their inheritance, a report claims. Hundreds of thousands have seen the savings and property value amassed by their parents rapidly drain away due to the high cost of care home bills. Care costs mean large numbers of families will never benefit from the longstanding Tory promise that those who save will see wealth ‘cascade down the generations’. Hundreds of thousands have seen the savings and property value amassed by their parents rapidly drain away due to the high cost of care home bills . The study, carried out for the NFU Mutual insurance group, found as many as two million elderly have had to use their savings to pay for care over the past five years. It estimated that over the same period a million homes have been sold to cover bills under the system by which anyone with property or savings worth more than £23,250 has to pay for their own care. The figures follow the Government’s promise earlier this year to bring in a £75,000 cap on the amount needed to pay for care bills. However the cap will not be introduced until 2016 and will not include £12,000 a year calculated to be spent on accommodation and food costs. Sean McCann, of NFU Mutual, said: ‘Younger generations could be in for a long wait if they are banking on  an inheritance to fund their own retirement. ‘People should be making their own retirement plans rather than factoring in property and wealth that could be whittled away by the cost of care.’ The study found as many as two million elderly have had to use their savings to pay for care over the past five years . The report reveals nearly one in five of those surveyed said a parent or in-law had needed residential care. Of these, 77 per cent said the parent’s wealth had been eaten up by the expenses involved. Nearly half said their parent’s care had been paid for from savings and 28 per cent said the family had to sell their parent’s home to meet bills. The estimate that a million homes have been sold to meet care costs over five years is higher than usually accepted. All estimates are guesses as no official figures are kept, but charities, pressure groups and Whitehall work on the basis that between 40,000 and 70,000 people a year sell homes to meet care costs. Elderly and vulnerable people with no property of their own and assets of under £23,250 get state help to pay their care costs. The bills are paid by local councils. The Tory promise to let wealth  ‘cascade down the generations’ was made by John Major in 1991. Around the same time the benefit system was altered to compel savers to use assets and homeowners to sell houses to meet residential care costs. ÷ We have become a ‘neglectful’  society where many pensioners live lonely lives, a minister has warned. Care minister Norman Lamb said the increasingly dispersed lives of families meant many of the elderly had little human contact at all. ‘There are so many living sad and lonely lives, with no one even seeing them,’ Mr Lamb said. ‘We have ended up rather a neglectful society as far as these individuals are concerned.’","Large numbers of families will never benefit from the Tory promise that those who save will see wealth ‘cascade down the generations’

A small Kentucky liberal arts college said Monday a $250 million donation that was among the largest gifts to higher education in U.S. history has been withdrawn. Centre College announced that the widely reported gift, from the A. Eugene Brockman Charitable Trust, was linked to a 'significant capital market event', and revealed to MailOnline the gift was tied to an expected corporate reorganization that fell through. Broken down across the school's enrollment, the gift worked out to about $208,000 per student. It was to be used to fund scholarships and other learning initiatives. 'This is a deep disappointment, let’s be clear... this is a disappointing day,' Centre College President John Roush told MailOnline. One of the largest-ever: The $250million, all-stock gift would have ranked in the top 20 ever given to higher education in the US . Though the Brockman Trust has not publicly disclosed the reason for going back on its eye-popping pledge, Richard Trollinger, the school's chief fundraiser, told MailOnline that Reynolds and Reynolds and United Computer Systems, from which the all-stock grant was going to be made, are currently in the midst of a reorganization. 'The company was going through a corporate reorganization and recapitalization… a multi-billion dollar transaction,' said Mr Trollinger. That transaction was to close last Wednesday, which did not happen, Mr Trollinger noted. 'We learned a week ago that it did not look promising for the closing to happen on schedule,' Mr Trollinger said, adding that once finding out Wednesday that the refinancing offer was withdrawn, the writing was on the wall. 'We learned Friday the grant was withdrawn,' said Mr Trollinger. The money for the grant, according to Mr Trollinger, was to come from the capital injection received while refinancing debt and other obligations. 'Typically in those situations, it allows you to take some money,' Mr Trollinger added. No discussions took place to perhaps work out a smaller grant. After going public with the planned donation, the Centre College was all dressed up with nowhere to go. 'It was withdrawn completely... there will be no further discussions regarding the grant or the scholarship program,' said Mr Trollinger. The school decided to go forward with announcing the abrupt cancellation of the Brockman Scholars program because it had planned on beginning recruiting for the first class of beneficiaries to join the school this August, Mr Trollinger noted. The donation was the college's idea, Mr Roush said, explaining that he approached the trust. Centre College will continue its pursuit of creating the type of scholarship program envisioned by the gift, but is now exploring different avenues to fund such a program he added. Despite there being no other donors readily available to fill the massive void left by the donation claw-back, 'we certainly have other people who care about the welfare of our students,' Mr Roush added. Better days: Centre College President John A. Roush announcing the donation earlier this year . 'We will continue to pursue the goal . of such a program designed to prepare students as leaders and . entrepreneurs,' Mr Roush said. 'A task force of trustees, faculty, staff . and students will be assembled to continue this conversation.' At $250million, the all-stock donation would have more than doubled the school's current $230million endowment, according to Bloomberg. It was slated . to fund 160 scholarships as part of the Brockman Scholars program, with . 40 awarded each year for the next four years, Bloomberg noted. Reynolds and Reynolds, a Dayton, Ohio-based supplier of car dealer support services, was publicly traded prior to the merger and has been on a recent acquisition spree, according to announcements on the company's site. When reached by MailOnline for comment, a Reynolds and Reynolds spokesperson said the company is not affiliated with the Brockman Trust and declined further comment. The trust is named for the deceased father of current company president and CEO Robert T. ""Bob"" Brockman, who once attended Centre College. Well-known: The 2012 vice presidential debate, between Joe Biden (D-DE) and Paul Ryan (R-WI) was held at Centre College . The trust has donated to Centre College before, in 2011 with a $19.5million gift that was used to build new student residences, according to the school's website. Named Brockman Commons, the apartment-style dorm houses 124 upper-class student, according to the university. Eugene Brockman formed the charitable trust in 1981, a few years before his death. His son, Robert Brockman, attended Centre for a couple of years before getting his degree elsewhere and is a former chairman of the school's board of trustees. Bob Brockman, who lives in Houston, left the Kentucky school because he wanted a degree in business administration, which isn't offered as a major at Centre. Generous alum: Robert Brockman, son the the Brockman Trust's namesake and former Centre College student, may be the reason behind at least the trust's previous donation of $19.5million . Richard Trollinger, Centre's vice president of college relations, said the Brockman Trust has been ""a longtime friend and important partner."" He said the trust has made a number of generous gifts over the years to help transform the campus and improve its facilities. 'Our collaboration with the Brockman Trust has made us better in many ways and will continue to do so,' he said. Both Mr Trollinger and Mr Roush were quick to point out the past generosity of Mr Brockman and the trust. Mr Brockman remains on the school's board of trustees, they noted. The all-stock donation had ranked among . the 20 biggest gifts ever to a U.S. college or university, according to a . list maintained by the Chronicle of Higher Education. It had been the . second-largest such gift to a U.S. school since 2011, according to the . Chronicle of Philanthropy, surpassed only by New York Mayor Michael . Bloomberg's $350 million donation to Johns Hopkins University announced . earlier this year. Despite today's bad news, Mr Roush sounded a positive note for the small school's future. 'Centre College was an outstanding national liberal arts college before the gift was committed, and Centre's future remains exceedingly bright,' Mr Roush said.","The donation, to be made by the A.

More than a thousand former members and officials of Boy Scouts of America gathered this weekend to create a Christian-based alternative to the BSA. Its goal is to counter what the new groups says is the 'moral free-fall' of the nation, and 'raise a generation of faithful husbands, fathers, citizens and leaders,' organizers told the national inaugural convention in Nashville, Tennessee. The move comes in response to the Boy Scouts of America’s recent repeal of a restriction that denied membership to youth based on sexual orientation, which will take effect at the start of next year. New group: Over 1,200 disgruntled former Boy Scouts of America officials descended on Nashville, Tennessee this weekend, in order to launch a new, 'Christian-based' alternative to the BSA, as it voted earlier this year to lift its ban on gay members . Christian centered: Trail Life USA is the culmination of months of planning and prayer following the Scouts¿ decision this summer to permit openly homosexual members, turning its back on more than 100 years of being biblically straight . 1,200 people from across the United States met for a two-day conference to select the name, logo and uniforms of the new organization, now called Trail Life USA. The group has captured widespread attention because of its other mission — to provide a robust alternative to the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Cofounder John Stemberg says the organization will have a 'prominent faith component' and become a 'masculine outdoor program to raise young men.' 'Most of us are coming from a highly-structured environment that has 103 years of culture and language and program and symbols… and we are starting from scratch,' he told NBC. Decisions: This weekend members decided on a name and a logo for the new activity group . At the opening session, John Stemberger, chairman of the board of Trail Life USA, teased the crowd saying he would not be surprised if there were 'spies' from Grapevine, Texas — BSA’s home base — in the audience. Trail Life USA’s name, drawn from more than 300 options, was carefully vetted and is intended not to be political or controversial, organizers said. 'Trail' refers to a pathway and being outdoors, but also symbolizes the passage of life, where there are moral choices, and right and wrong paths, said Mr. Stemberger. 'Our whole life is about the trail, both in the outdoors and in the journey of life as believers,' he said. 'So Trail Life is a way of life that is centered on following Christ in the outdoors.' Founder: John-Stemberger began Trail Life USA in response to the Boy Scouts of America's decision to allow gay youths to remain in the scout movement . Organizers also unveiled the new Trail Life USA logo: It features a circle with a sun, mountaintops with a path, and a male figure with a hand extended over his head, beckoning others to follow. Mr Stemberger, who founded OnMyHonor.net in response to BSA’s vote in May that reversed the organization's long-standing ban on openly gay youth among its ranks, says the organization will become 'a program that we believe will be stronger, safer and more principled in every way.' He told NBC in July that, while the new organization would allow gay members, it would not permit them to 'flaunt' their sexual orientation. 'There is not going to be any kind of a witch hunt in our organization for people and what their sexual orientations are,' he clarified. We’re going to focus on sexual purity not sexual orientation.' Zach Wahls, an LGBT activist, Eagle Scout, and founder of Scouts for Equality, was saddened by the departure of so many families from the BSA. He also questioned Trail Life USA’s intentions of allowing gay members. Changes: Boy Scouts of America announced earlier this year that it is lifting the ban . on gay members and thus allowing anyone regardless of their sexual . orientation to enjoy the benefits of the youth programme . Angry: The decision, which still denies adults from serving as Scout . leaders, has upset conservative groups who believe that . gays should not be allowed in the BSA at all . 'You still cannot discuss sexuality . within the BSA,' Mr Wahls told NBC. 'That hasn't changed and that will . not change, and so, it's really a distinction without a difference that . they're trying to make here.' 'Scouting is for all young men,' Mr Wahls said. Trail . Life USA will be inclusive of boys, regardless of religion, race, . national origin or socioeconomic status, and accept boys who are . experiencing same-sex attractions or gender confusion. However, . it will not admit youth who are open or avowed about their . homosexuality, and it will also not admit boys who are not 'biologically . male' or boys who wish to dress and act like girls. The . new organization is modeled after the American Heritage Girls, an . 18-year-old organization that is 'Christ-centered' and is 'seen as an . alternative to Girl Scouts,' according to the group's website. Adult . leaders of Trail Life USA will be Christians who sign a statement of . faith and submit to background checks. Both boys and adults will be . required to adhere to a code of conduct. The . goal is to 'become the premier organization that honors God and builds . some great young men,' Mark Hancock, one of the board members told The Washington Times.","1,200 gathered this weekend to choose the name and logo of the new organization .

Discovery: Christine Rideout found documents which had been signed by William Franklin . When veteran bargain hunter Christine Ridout noticed some tattered pieces of parchment at a garage sale, curiosity got the better of her. She bought the documents for a measly $3, but later discovered they date back to the Revolutionary War and that state officials from New Jersey had spent decades searching for them. The 52-year-old from Toronto found the 250-year-old long-lost papers at the sale in Buffalo, New York, but was unaware of their significance. She then discovered one document was written in 1710 and had the royal seal of the British court of St. James on it, while the other was signed by William Franklin, the illegitimate son of Benjamin Franklin in 1771. Ridout thought she had 'hit the jackpot' but now has to return the documents because they have been reported missing to a number of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI. The garage sale had been one of several the veteran bargain hunter had visited that day. She asked how much the documents were and immediately purchased them, despite having no idea about their historical value. 'I thought I hit the jackpot; I was all excited, like I had a winning lottery ticket,' Ridout told The Philadelphia Inquirer. 'Never in my lifetime would I have expected to come across anything like this. 'Then, I looked at the State of New Jersey website and felt like I was holding a lottery ticket that had expired. It has been suggested at least five of the six documents were reported stolen by the state of New Jersey to the FBI and other law-enforcement agencies. Ridout added: 'That's my kind of luck. 'I thought (the discovery of the 18th-century materials) really knocked it out of the park. 'But the State of New Jersey says, 'It belongs to us"".' Officials have since requested for the materials to be returned and have asked Ridout to post the documents so they can be authenticated. She has already emailed images of the papers and was told by officials . 'they appear to be the real McCoy'. History: The documents found dated back to the Revolutionary War which with the Battle of Lexington in 1775 (illustrated) where the first skirmish between the United States and Britain took place . 'I want to do the right thing,' she said. 'But I don't want to mail the documents. I don't trust the mail.' Ridout . hopes to be compensated in some way for recovering the historic papers. Nathan Raab, vice president of the Raab . Collection, a firm that specializes in American and . presidential historical documents, said: 'These pieces give a glimpse into the relationship between England and her colonies, in this case specifically New Jersey. 'If they are original, they are significant documents for this reason. 'However, compared with the number of people who collect Revolutionary War material, for example, the market for colonial New Jersey material is not as broad. 'Moreover, since these were acts passed annually, they would not be unique. 'Setting these documents aside, pieces signed by William Franklin are generally not particularly valuable, ranging from a few hundred to a couple thousand dollars . 'This is primarily because to the general public William is famous only for being Benjamin Franklin's son.' One of Ridout's documents, marked with the royal seal, gave the British Crown's approval of 'An Act for ascertaining the Place of the Sitting of the Representatives to meet in General Assembly.' Other pages approved funds for 'Doctor Benjamin Franklin, Agent of this Colony at the Rate of One Hundred pounds per anum,' and for his 'Excellency William Franklin Esquire at the rate of Sixty pounds per Annum Money aforesaid for House Rent during the Continuance of this Act, provided he makes Perth Amboy or Burlington the Place of his Residence.' Ridout said the sellers of the papers were going to . give any leftover documents to a good will store, so she believed she saved the historic papers.","Christine Ridout, 52, was browsing a garage sale in Buffalo, New York .

First lady Michelle Obama opposes military action in Syria, President Barack Obama revealed in a series of interviews on Monday. 'You know, if you talk to my own family members, or Michelle's, you know, they're very wary and suspicious of any action,' Obama told PBS. In a separate interview with NBC he added, 'If you ask Michelle, ""Do we want to be involved in another war?"" The answer is no.' President Obama said Monday that he would prefer to find a diplomatic solution to the Syrian chemical weapons crisis . First lady Michelle Obama speaks during a visit to Orr Elementary in Washington, Friday, Sept. 6, 2013 . Obama made the remarks in interviews with six major television networks in which he acknowledged the lack of public support for a missile strike against Syrian President Bashar Assad as punishment for Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons. The first lady has not spoken out publicly on the situation in Syria. After noting her opposition to military intervention in the NBC interview, Obama continued: 'And so I recognize how important that debate is and it’s my belief that for me, the president, to act without consensus in a situation where there’s not a direct, imminent threat to the homeland or our interests around the world, that that’s not the kind of precedent I want to set.' Obama was expected to make the the case for military intervention in Syria during the interviews, but instead he revealed that he's considering a softer approach to the conflict. 'It's fair to say I haven't decided' whether to bomb Syria if Congress doesn't vote to authorize it, Obama told NBC's Savannah Guthrie when her turn came in the White House's Blue Room . Assad insists that the White House doesn't have ironclad evidence that his government used chemical weapons, and said Obama is leading a 'social media administration' After his administration had spent several days trying to drum up support for strikes, Obama disclosed that he has been secretly discussing a non-military resolution with Russian President Vladimir Putin 'for quite some time.' 'We will pursue this diplomatic track,' Obama told Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, referring to Putin's call for Assad to surrender his chemical weapons stockpile to international control.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg has tried to clarify his remarks in an interview where he alleged that one of the Democrats trying to replace him is running a 'racist' campaign. Bloomberg said that former public advocate Bill de Blasio was running a campaign that was based around 'class warfare and racist'. 'Well no, no, I mean, he’s making an appeal using his family to gain support. I think it’s pretty obvious to anyone watching what he’s been doing,' Bloomberg said in an interview with New York Magazine. Modern family: Bloomberg blasted Bill de Blasio's decision to regularly feature his wife Chirlane McCray (left) and their daughter Chiara (center) during the campaign . De Blasio, who is leading in the polls going into Tuesday's Democratic primary, is white and his wife Chirlane McCray is African American. They have two children and their son Dante- who has a very prominent afro- has been featured in a number of his father's ads. Altering the words: Outgoing Mayor Bloomberg had an injection added to the quote so that it is clear he said 'Well, no, no, I mean' before saying that he thought de Blasio's campaign was racist . 'I do not think he himself is racist,' Bloomberg said. 'It’s comparable to me pointing out I’m Jewish in attracting the Jewish vote. You tailor messages to your audiences and address issues you think your audience cares about.' Bloomberg's aides contacted New York Magazine shortly after the article was first published on Friday saying that the quote was missing an interjection. Originally the quote did not have 'Well, no, no, I mean' and the New York Magazine editors said that it was 'inaudible in our audiotape of the interview, which was conducted over speakerphone'. De Blasio's daughter Chiara came to his . defense at a rally on Saturday, saying: 'I would say that 20 years ago, my . dad did not know he was running for mayor, and he did not seek to marry a . black woman to put her on display'. According to Salon, De Blasio responded at the same campaign event: 'All I can say is, I hope the mayor will reconsider what he said. I hope he’ll realize that it was inappropriate, and I think the people of this city are ready for us to move forward together.' That togetherness is a point of contention- at least for Bloomberg- as he said that de Blasio based much of his platform around the idea that New York is a 'tale of two cities', turning the famous title into a slogan. 'I’ve never liked that kind of division,' Bloomberg said during the interview. 'Tearing people apart with this “two cities” thing doesn’t make any sense to me. It’s a destructive strategy for those you want to help the most. He’s a very populist, very left-wing guy, but this city is not two groups, and if to some extent it is, it’s one group paying for services for the other. Making a statement: De Blasio's son Dante has been featured prominently in the campaign and has spoken in a number of his father's commercials . 'It’s a shame, because I’ve always thought he was a very smart guy.' His criticism of de Blasio did not stop there. 'And he doesn’t have any ideas. “I’m gonna raise the taxes.” You know that Albany, under no circumstances, nor the governor, under any circumstances, is going to allow that! So come up with some real ideas, Bill!' Bloomberg said. Bloomberg has been careful not to give an official endorsement to any of the candidates running to replace him, though he has worked very closely with City Council Speaker Christine Quinn for the past seven years. Down to the wire: De Blasio (right) is leading the Democratic race, and Christine Quinn (left) is now in third place after leading for much of the beginning months . The closest he came to giving her an endorsement came earlier in the New York Magazine interview when he said he supported the New York Times' decision to endorse Quinn as the Democratic candidate. It could not be considered a full show of support, however, as he also said they were right to choose Joe Lhota as their pick for the Republican candidate. At the beginning of this year's long mayoral campaign, Quinn was very much seen as the person to beat, leading the five-person Democratic race the longest. Now, de Blasio has 39 per cent of the Democratic vote heading into tomorrow's primary. Former comptroller Bill Thompson follows him with 25 per cent of the vote, and Quinn is in third place with 18 per cent.","Former Public Advocate Bill de Blasio is running for New York City mayor .

Shot dead: Monroe Isadore, age 107, of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, was killed in a standoff with a police SWAT team on Saturday . The 80-year-old Arkansas woman who called police on her 107-year-old roommate on Saturday said today that the SWAT officers who got into a standoff with the man had no choice but to shoot him. But his friends don't agree. Pauline Lewis, of Pine Bluff, said centenarian Monroe Isadore barricaded himself in his bedroom with a pistol and threatened to fire at anyone who came near the door. 'He was very angry. He got hostile. He was gonna kill somebody,' Lewis said of the man who then died after entering into a gun fight with authorities. The woman said that Isadore had lived . with her for a month but that he got violent when she asked him to find . another apartment. Lewis told THV that he shut himself in: 'Monroe was in the room and he had the gun and he said 'If you wanna live you better get away from this door.' She called the police and when the SWAT team arrived the 107-year-old suspect had his gun trained at two people in the room. Officers had the pair leave the home for their own safety and approached a bedroom looking for Isadore. When the officers announced who they were, Isadore shot through the door at them but missed hitting them, said Pine Bluff Lt. David Price in a news release. Standoff: Isadore barricaded himself in his bedroom with a pistol at this residence in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. According to his roommate he threatened to shoot anyone who came near the door . The officers retreated to a safer area, and supervisors and additional help were called, Price said. Supervisors started negotiating with Isadore and continued after SWAT officers arrived at the home about 45 miles southeast of Little Rock. The SWAT team inserted a camera into the room and confirmed Isadore was armed with a handgun, Price said. When it was clear the negotiations weren't working, SWAT officers released gas into the room from outside a bedroom window. SWAT officers entered the home, made their way to the bedroom and threw a 'distraction device' into the room, Price said. He said Isadore began to fire at the officers and they fired back, killing him.

The 28ft structure in place in Battersea Park, London, which was put on display for less than a month . It was intended as a lasting memorial to the Britons killed in the September 11 attacks on New York’s World Trade Center. But the sculpture, named ‘After 9/11’ and made of a twisted girder pulled from Ground Zero itself, was left to rust in a farmyard for nearly two years because bureaucrats refused to find it a permanent site. London received the relic of the Twin Towers after Britain declared it would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with America in its hour of need. Sixty-seven Britons were among the 3,000 killed on 9/11. London mayor Boris Johnson, who originally unveiled the piece in Battersea Park in 2011, has now been forced to act and yesterday announced that he had found a permanent home for it in the Olympic Park. The 28ft sculpture, designed by Asian-American artist Miya Ando, was put on display for just 28 days before being pulled down and left under a tarpaulin on the farm in Duxford, Cambridgeshire. Planning permission had been granted for it be installed in Potters Field Park, by City Hall. But the park’s private owners refused to accept it, saying the size was ‘inappropriate’ and citing ‘local opposition’. And when applications to all of London’s boroughs for a site were refused or ignored, the sculpture was sent to the farm for storage. It has recently been moved to a storage depot in Ruislip, north west London. Former New York City fire commissioner Thomas von Essen, who led the 9/11 rescue effort, said: ‘Those responsible for deciding who they gave this steel to would be very upset. ‘It is confusing and very disappointing to think of it being kept in storage somewhere.’ Scroll down for video . Boris Johnson pictured (left) at the unveiling of the memorial in Battersea Park where it stayed for 28 just days . The three girders were shipped over to the UK and crafted into a sculpture costing £250,000 . At the ceremony, Mr Johnson called for . an end to 9/11 conspiracy theories, saying that he wanted a 'controlled . demolition' of wacky alternative explanations for the disaster. Miss . Ando said she wanted to 'give light back into the community' with her . work, which will be moved from Battersea Park to a permanent home as . soon as a suitable location is found. 'I thought it was a poetic way to express transformation,' she said. 'Not only are we having the piece stand upright in a gesture of resilience, but to create something serene and light.' Permission was given to put the structure up permanently at Potters Field Park near Boris Johnson's Office, but then the land's management trust blocked it, according to The Sun. Patricia Bingley, mother of Kevin who died in the disaster, said: 'It's sad no one seems to want it anywhere. It should be put up in central London where everyone can see it.' The Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'We backed the 9/11 project when the sculpture first came to Battersea, but finding a permanent home for it has proved incredibly difficult, whether it be opposition from Boroughs or bureaucrats. 'Clearly this can’t continue. As a result I've asked my team to find a permanent home for the sculpture on the Olympic Park. 'The park was home to a Games based on tolerance, harmony and respect, and will soon be home to a massive multi-dimensional and vibrant community - the perfect riposte to those who sought to divide the world on 9/11.' There has also been anger from Mr von Essen who described the situation as 'confusing and disappointing... to think of it still being in storage.' He added: 'Those responsible for deciding who they gave this steel to would be very upset.' A memorial museum has been set up at Ground Zero near the site of the new World Trade Center in New York .

Matt Stapleton had reported his wife and their oldest daughter missing last Tuesday afternoon after receiving a phone message from Kelli and discovering the van was gone from their home in Elberta, a small community along Lake Michigan and about 30 miles west of Traverse City. 'He took that as a disconcerting message... despondent,' Belcher said. After police found the van, mother and daughter were rushed to a hospital in Traverse and later moved to Grand Rapids for specialized care. Looking out for her: Isabelle's father Matt Stapleton was the one to report his daughter and wife missing and now he has made a statement saying that Isabelle is currently using a respirator and breathing tube . Kelli Stapleton was taken Thursday to the Benzie County Jail while her daughter is still in doctors care. ‘(Isabelle) received help from a respirator and breathing tube, and her blood pressure is stable,' Matt Stapleton wrote about his daughter in his email to media after the incident.

'She is a great kid with a lot of potential,' Kelli Stapleton told the newspaper. 'She's so smart. She started reading when she was two. She's got so much to offer, but her aggression is going to limit her life as much as anything.' Isabelle's outbursts primarily were targeted at her mother and younger sister. An older brother and her father missed most of it. 'When I was home ... I'd be with her most of the time because of the aggressive nature,' Matt Stapleton told the newspaper. 'By the end, I was as much of a target as anybody. Of course, I can defend myself a little differently. 'She's gotten to that point where she can't help herself. She's hurting herself and she's hurting others. She'll always be autistic and she'll always be with us, but unless we're able to get some help for some of these behaviors she has, I don't even know how to predict how the next 20 years will look like.'

Taking on the challenge of playing Princess Diana in a film released this month was not a role Naomi Watts took lightly. Her personal trainer has revealed how the actress, 44, undertook on a gruelling workout regime in order to transform herself into the late princess. New York-based fitness guru Simone De La Rue told Health & Fitness magazine how she got the mother-of-two into shape using her tried and tested methods of resistance training combined with danced-based cardio. New body: Naomi Watts has been working out with her trainer Simone De La Rue, who uses an intense dancer-like workout regime to get her clients in shape . The trainer, who also counts Sandra Bullock, Matt Damon and Anne Hathaway as her clients, is famed for her tough yet effective dance work-outs. She explained how she works with clients like Naomi for three months to achieve the best results. The ex-professional dancer said: 'When working towards a specific goal with a client, I encourage them to train five or more times a week, for one hour a day.' Dancer body: Simone, a former  professional dancer, said that Naomi did a great deal of cardio work for her role as Diana . 'I set a programme that constantly challenges my clients and, during the last three weeks, we really increase the intensity.' Simone added that for her role as Diana, Naomi carried out a great deal of cardio work but the dance element makes it 'a fun way to get your sweat on and burn calories.' Simone, 38, who is originally from Australia, says her core-strengthening sessions, which incorporate pilates, yoga . and dance, have become a favourite with celebrities because they deliver 'long and lean' results. Speaking to MailOnline last year, she explained how the technique, originally developed to keep her dancer's body fit and free from injury, is successful because it varies different kinds of exercise. And even though she works with many VIPs, Ms De La Rue encourages her celebrity clients 'to leave their egos at the door'. Big role: Naomi's starring role as Diana in the new movie is her biggest to date, so it is no wonder she wanted to look her best . A-list clientele: The trainer also counts Anne Hathaway and Sandra Bullock as her clients and is famed for her gruelling yet effective dance work-out regimes . She said: 'I think actors also connect with what I do because I encourage them to be creative. It’s a release.' One of her most famous clients is Sandra .

Somewhere on the bottom of Italy's largest lake lie the remains of two dozen American soldiers who died when their amphibious vehicle sank in 1945 in the waning days of the fighting in Europe during World War II. A volunteer group's discovery of what could be the wreckage 900 feet down in Lake Garda has given aging veterans hope that, after nearly seven decades, the remains of their comrades can finally come home. 'If you talk to the World War II guys, they're looking for closure and they haven't got it,' said retired Army Col Michael Plummer, president of the National Association of the 10th Mountain Division, the Army unit that battled the Germans in northern Italy until the last week of the war. Scroll down for video . Discovery: An Italian volunteer group says they have located the remains of an amphibious vehicle that sank in Lake Garda in 1945 and killed all but one of the U.S. soldiers on board . Tragedy at the end of the war: 24 soldiers died when an amphibious vehicle started to take on water. Only one soldier survived - a former lifeguard . Of the association's nearly 1,200 members, about a third served during World War II. 'We seem to save any single soldier or find anybody in the wilds of Borneo or the mountains, and we thought it was very bad that the United States wasn't doing anything for these guys,' said 89-year-old Jerry Nash, of Hudson, New Hampshire . Nash was laying communication wire as the 10th Mountain pursued German forces into northern Italy's rugged alpine region, home to the 50-mile-long Lake Garda. Location: Lake Garda is a popular holiday destination in the north of Italy, located between Venice and Milan . When the enemy blew up tunnels through the mountains ringing the lake's northern end, the division's commanders sent soldiers across the lake in amphibious six-wheeled trucks, known by their military designation DUKW and known to GIs as ducks. On the night of April 30, 1945, three DUKWs left the lake's east side carrying members of the division's 605th Field Artillery. One of the vehicles, jammed with 25 soldiers and a 75 mm cannon, stalled during the journey and soon began taking on water. Today: The Glacier-formed Lake Garda is the largest lake in Italy. It is 50 miles long and reaches depths of over a thousand feet . Returning the dead: For years, veterans and family members of those lost in the lake have been calling for a recovery mission . Proof: But the military authority which deals with recovering the bodies of American solders said it will only investigate if there's firm evidence that the remains have been located in the lake . According to Cpl Thomas Hough, the lone survivor, the soldiers desperately tossed their equipment and ammunition overboard in an attempt to keep the vessel from sinking. But the DUKW went down anyway, plunging the men into the frigid waters of the glacier-fed lake. Soon all had drowned but Hough, a former lifeguard from Dayton, Ohio, who was rescued by two 10th Mountain soldiers on shore who heard the cries for help. Hough died in 2005. First try: A researcher in Chester, Connecticut traveled to the lake 10 years ago hoping to find the amphibious vehicle but was hampered by equipment issues and was ultimately unsuccessful . Brett Phaneuf, a researcher from the . Chester, Connecticut-based nonprofit underwater archaeology organization . ProMare, led an effort 10 years ago to find the sunken DUKW. Hampered by equipment issues, Phaneuf found no sign of the vehicle. But in late 2011, a local Italian group of volunteer divers started their own search. Using . sonar and a remotely operated vehicle equipped with a video camera, . they announced last December the discovery of a WWII DUKW sitting . upright on the lake bottom. Take two: In late 2011, a volunteer diver group in Italy started a search of their own . Gruppo Volontari del Garda said it . hasn't been able to positively confirm that it's the same DUKW that . sank, killing the 24 soldiers, or one of the other two known to have . sunk in the same area of the lake. The group said it plans to resume efforts to locate remains and recover the DUKW, possibly later this year or in early 2014. 'Seems . to us only right to do everything possible in order to restore at least . someone to their land,' the group's spokesman, Luca Turrini, said in an . email to The Associated Press. Recovery: The volunteer group announced last December that they had located the vehicle and hope to go on more recovery missions this year or early next year . Officials at the Joint POW-MIA Accounting Command, the Hawaii-based unit that searches for remains of Americans from foreign battlefields, said they're aware of the group's claims but don't plan to investigate unless there's firm evidence that remains have been located. 'If JPAC were to be provided with additional information, we would gladly look into it more,' Lee Tucker, a spokesman at JPAC's Pearl Harbor headquarters, said in an email to the AP. The family of Pvt James Hilley would like to see his remains recovered and returned to his hometown of Calhoun Falls, South Carolina. When his great-nephew, Matthew Hilley, learned of the Italian group's discovery in December, he showed his aging relatives the video of the DUKW on his smartphone. It was a particularly emotional moment for 86-year-old Jewell Scott, James Hilley's sister. 'She said, ""I prayed over and over and over again that we would find James before I passed away,""' Matthew Hilley said. For Nash and the division's dwindling number of World War II veterans, the determination to recover the lost soldiers' remains hasn't diminished with the passage of time. 'It's the old story,' he said. 'You never leave any man behind.'","Twenty four American soldiers drowned in 1945 when their amphibious vehicle took on water in the middle of Italy's largest lake - Lake Garda .

It might make you feel cleaner than plain old toilet paper, but think twice before you flush that wet wipe. While many celebrities are busily endorsing the daily use of the pre-moisturised paper, sewer utilities are struggling to cope with their clogged-up pipes and pumps. This growing menace to society has cost the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission more than $1 million to install machinery that can shred the wipes before they reach the pumps on the way to the treatment plants. Officials in the area blame wipes on a . 35 per cent increase in broken pumps and clogged sewer pipe lines over . the past few years, according to the Washington Post. Scooping up the poop: Utility workers try to catch the wet wipes before they reach the pumps to stop them from clogging the system . The . wet wipes – mostly used for babies and people seeking a thorough . cleanse – are also said to contribute to blockages that cause sewage to . overflow into streams and back up into basements. According to officials in Washington, the issue is that wet wipe products are being marketed as flushable. ‘Just . because you can flush it doesn’t mean you should,’ said I.J. Hudson, a . spokesman for the WSSC, which handles sewage for 1.8 million residents . of Montgomery and Prince George’s counties. More . than 500 man hours have been devoted over the past 12 months to . removing stuck wipes and repairing broken equipment, say officials with . DC Water, the District’s water and sewer agency. Menace to society: Wet wipes are clogging up the sewer pipes causing millions in damages . Utility workers are fighting to keep the pipes clean from wet wipes before the damage is too great . In July, British sewerage workers discovered a 15-tonne ball of congealed fat and wet wipes the size of a bus. Nicknamed . Fatberg, the toxic lump was clogging up 95 per cent of a 2.4-metre . diameter London sewer pipe and took sewer workers three weeks to defeat. Just one week ago, giant lumps of lard and baby wipes were discovered clogging Denver's sewers, including one giant grease ball in pipes underneath the home of one resident who complained his drains were backing up. Workers discovered the Warren Ave, Denver, resident had been regularly pouring grease down his sink, causing it to harden in a lump in the sewer and block the line. So much grease had oozed into the main pipe, workers had to clean it several times. Fatberg 2: A giant blob of lard is found in the sewer pipe under a house in Denver . According to the Post, wipe manufacturers say they are trying to reduce wear and tear on sewer systems and septic tanks. A trade group, the Association of the Nonwoven Fabrics Industry, is forming a technical work group with utility officials to sort through differences over how wipes should be tested for flushability. This summer the trade association released a list of updated guidelines for wipes manufacturers, which spell out seven tests that a product should pass before being marketed as flushable. To flush or not to flush: Officials say the problem is that the wipes are not flushable . They also suggest making Do Not Flush logos more prominent on those that do not pass but are commonly used in bathrooms. Dave Rousse, president of the fabrics group, said consumers want baby wipes to be durable enough to withstand finger ‘poke-through’. ‘We all agree the solution to the problem is to reduce the burden on wastewater treatment systems,’ Rousse said. ‘We agree we need to label products . appropriately and educate the public to flush responsibly — to look for . and obey disposal instructions.’ However, the industry is booming and consumer wipes sales are predicted to grow by about 6 per cent annually for the next five years, according to Rousse. Even celebrities are busy endorsing the daily use of the wet wipe, including actor Terrence Howard, who said in an interview with Elle Magazine that women who do not use wipes are ‘not completely clean’. Actor Terrence Howard says women who don't use wet wipes are 'unclean' Singer Bruno Mars says he always brings wet wipes with him on tour . ‘If they’re using dry paper, they aren’t washing all of themselves. It’s just unclean. So if I go in a woman’s house and see the toilet paper there, I’ll explain this.’ Hip hop singer and producer Will.i.am has also echoed this sentiment to Elle Magazine. ‘Here's proof on why people should have baby wipes. Get some chocolate, wipe it on a wooden floor, and then try to get it up with some dry towels. You're going to get chocolate in the cracks. That's why you gotta get them baby wipes.’ The most recent celebrity to pipe up about the importance of wipes is singer Bruno Mars, who told TMZ.com that he always brings wipes and wine when he’s on tour. Even Hollywood actor and director Will Smith has joined the baby wipes campaign. ‘I'm the type of person that it's important for me to share. When I experience something that's special and incredible, I like to share it with people. Anyone who's using dry toilet paper, you're really not doing yourself the true service,’ he told BBC’s Radio 1.","Will Smith and Will.i.am say wet wipes are a must for everyone .

The team of swimmer Diana Nyad today angrily hit back at claims she rigged her 110-mile record-breaking Cuba to Florida race. John Bartlett, the navigator who was with her the whole way during her epic feat told MailOnline he dares any skeptics to challenge the data he will soon release publicly. ‘Before anyone gets involved in discrediting the event or the information come talk to me,' he said. 'Let’s see if you really know what you’re talking about.’ 'Never give up': Diana Nyad emerges from the Atlantic Ocean after completing a 110-mile swim from Cuba to Key West, Florida . Challenge: John Barlett, right, Nyad's navigator said doubters of her feat are using wrong information and he will prove them wrong . The 66-year-old retired boat builder said he was furious about the mounting backlash over Nyad’s swim from Havana to Key West by other marathon swimmers who are trying to sink her historic swim dubbed ‘Diana’s Extreme Dream’. Andrew Malinak, a Seattle long-distance swimmer who crunched data available from the GPS positions tracked on Nyad's website said at the weekend that he didn't trust the disproportionate speeds and long lapses. More... Diana Nyad to meet with skeptical marathon swimming community who doubt her swim from Cuba to Florida . Could a teenager save the world's oceans? Student, 19, claims his invention could clean up the seas in just five years . 'When you know how hard it is, you kind of want those details,' he had said. Malinak said a seven hours-long spike in Nyad's speed after 27 hours of swimming is particularly questionable - she went from her normal pace of roughly 1.5 mph to more than 3 mph, then slowed down again as she approached Key West. Doubters said Nyad apparently didn't stop to eat or drink during that time and pointed put a 2012 attempt when she got onto the boat for hours during rough weather. GPS: Nyad's navigator said the above 'spot trackers' used by her critics to claim she cheated are not accurate . A helping push: Nyad's claim that she was helped by a particularly swift current towards Key West has been backed up by independent ocean expert Dr Mitchell Roffer . Nyad eventually got back into the water to try finishing, but her team was criticized for delaying the release of that information to the public. ‘Having a good current and being able to utilize that to get those speeds is just working to use the currents to our advantage.’ And Bartlett said Nyad’s speed and location can’t be measured by ‘spot trackers’ - that were quoted by the doubters - were simply estimating Niyad’s location for public viewing and nothing more. ‘Those spot trackers are for the public to watch Diana swim along. The positions that I have on my GPS are the real positions.’ The data collected by Bartlett and two observers will be submitted to three open-water swimming associations and the Guinness World Records for verification, he said. Secret weapon: This is Nyad's first attempt using the prosthetic face mask custom-made to shield her from the paralyzing stings of the box jellyfish, which some fellow swimmers consider to be cheating . Bartlett, who says he’s been on the boat as a navigator and roles when Nyad races, affirms that the athlete never touched the boat and kept everything above board. ‘She wasn’t on the boat and nobody held her up or supported her. When she came to the side of the boat to eat she would tread water and people would feed her to her mouth. Nobody held onto her at all.’ Some also question whether Nyad violated the traditions of her sport - many follow strict guidelines known as the English Channel rules - by using a specialized mask and wetsuit to protect herself from jellyfish. Neither Nyad nor her team ever said she would follow English Channel rules, developed for swimming the waters between England and France. Those rules outlaw neoprene wetsuits and contact with a support boat. Close to shore: Diana Nyad pictured about two miles out from shore in the Florida Keys. Her critics feel that there is a chance she got out of the water and went on board the accompanying boat . More than just encouraging words? Some other swimmers say that an uptick in her speed mid race implies that she may have gotten a boost of oxygen from her team . Nyad wore a full non-neoprene bodysuit, gloves, booties and a silicone mask at night, when jellyfish are a particular problem, and removed the suit once she got over the reef on her approach to Key West. According to Nyad's team, she finished the swim Monday afternoon after roughly 53 hours in the water, becoming the first to do so without a shark cage. It was her fifth try, an endeavor apparently free from the boat troubles, bad weather, illnesses and jellyfish encounters that have bedeviled Nyad and other swimmers in recent years. An oceanographer not affiliated with Nyad's team said the swimmer couldn't have picked a more perfect current to get from Havana to Key West. Dr. Mitch Roffer of Roffer's Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service Inc. based in Melbourne, Fl. said he got an email questioning whether Nyad's swim was a hoax, so he decided to look at the charts for himself. What he saw convinced him that she could do it. ‘It was like a walking sidewalk heading to Key West and then got off it ,’ Roffer told MailOnline. ‘I looked at the GPS locations and they all seem to be correct. She got great benefit from the current.’ Janet Hinkle, a Key West boat captain and acquaintance of Nyad's, was called to be an observer for the swim when Steve Munatones, a former U.S. national open-water coach, was unable to make it. 'I can say unequivocally she swam every stroke without question,' Hinkle said. Exhausted: The grandmother appeared to he covered in salt after the length of time she spent in the water . Critics have said Hinkle was too close to Nyad to be an independent observer of her swim. Hinkle has in the past helped Nyad by providing housing for her when the swimmer stayed in the Florida Keys, but she said she remained on the periphery of Nyad's team. 'I think anyone who knows me knows me as a person of high integrity. I believe that's why Diana asked me, and I took my job very seriously,' Hinkle said. 'She was giving her all and I would give her my best.' Since none of the various open-water swimming associations dictate how someone should swim from Cuba to Florida - officially accomplished only by Nyad and Susie Maroney, who used a shark cage - Nyad just had to follow generally accepted rules about not getting out of the water or using equipment such as fins.","Diana Nyad completed the swim in 52 hours, 54 minutes and 18 seconds .

Top of the list is implementing his promise to get tough on immigration by ‘turning back’ the asylum boats bringing refugees to the country, while pledging to slash Australia’s foreign aid budget. After winning, British-born Tony Abbott got straight down to business.... The 55-year-old Oxford graduate also said one of his first moves would be to reverse the climate change consensus by scrapping taxes on carbon emissions. The resounding victory for the conservative Liberal leader was applauded by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, who controls up to 70 per cent of the newspaper market in Australia. He tweeted: ‘Aust election public sick of public sector workers and phony welfare scroungers sucking life out of economy.’ Scroll down for video .

The two men spoke for several minutes, agreeing to talk later in more detail about policy issues. Dressed in stunning white gowns, it was Tony Abbott’s three daughters who stole the limelight following his election victory. But it was no surprise to their father, who is  accused of using their looks to win votes. In one TV appearance last week, he was accused of sexism and misogyny when he said: ‘If you want to know who to vote for, I’m the guy with the not bad-looking daughters.’ However, the trio have been keen to support their father in his election campaign. In the final days, UN worker Louise, 24, returned from Geneva to join Frances, 22, who worked with underprivileged groups, and 20-year-old university student Bridget. A Roman Catholic, in 2010 he was asked for his views on the idea of preserving virginity until marriage. He replied: ‘I think I would say to my daughters … it is the greatest gift that you can give someone, the ultimate gift of giving, and don’t give it to someone lightly.’ Winners: Tony Abbott waves to the crowd as he stands on stage after victory in the Australian election .

The navy will be ordered to stop craft as soon as they enter Australian waters and promptly turn them round. The strategist who ensured Tony Abbott was elected on a right-wing ticket has links to David Cameron, it emerged last night. Mark Textor is the business partner of Lynton Crosby – the Prime Minister’s controversial campaign guru and the man the Tories hope will secure the general election in 2015. The Australian pair set up consultancy Crosby Textor in 2002 and expert pollster Mr Textor has been a close adviser to Mr Abbott for several years. His strategies ensured Mr Abbott’s Liberal party made major gains in 2010 and he wrote the ‘We will stop the boats’ mantra for the current election campaign. Mr Crosby, known as the ‘Wizard of Oz’, masterminded successive election triumphs for former Australian PM John Howard and is known for using controversial social issues such as immigration to connect with the unspoken concerns of voters. The . policy has been described as ‘crazy’ by opponents, but to many in . Australia Mr Abbott is a refreshing ‘Action Man’ compared to the ‘nerdy’ Mr Rudd. Born in London, he moved Down Under with his Australian parents when he was almost three. A . graduate in economics and law at the University of Sydney, he returned . to Britain to study politics and philosophy at Oxford as a Rhodes . Scholar. There, he earned a ‘blue’ in boxing and was also a keen champion of Margaret Thatcher. On . his return to Australia, he trained briefly as a Catholic priest, . earning the nickname ‘the Mad Monk’, before becoming a key figure in the . Liberal Party. He served as employment minister in John Howard’s government between 1998 and 2003. Many accused him of being gaffe-prone and mocked his tendency to punctuate sentences with drawn-out ‘ehs’. But as opposition leader, he watched Labor implode before successfully staking his claim to Australia’s highest office. 'Clear win': Tony Abbott,  Australia's next Prime .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 15:18 EST, 6 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:19 EST, 6 August 2013 . In 18 states, there were at least slight declines in obesity for low-income preschoolers (library image) Childhood obesity rates in 18 U.S. states have declined for the first time in decades, according to a new government report released today. It's the first evidence of a national decline in childhood obesity, in a report that targeted low-income preschoolers across 40 states. Previous national statistics show obesity rates have been rising for decades and recently were essentially flat, although some places have reported improvements, like Philadelphia and New York City and the state of Mississippi. But the report from the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention shows signs of a wider-ranging improvement. 'Now, for the first time, we're seeing a significant decrease in childhood obesity' nationally, said Dr. Thomas Frieden, CDC director. Still, one in eight preschoolers are obese in the United States, and it's even more common in black and Hispanic kids. Preschoolers who are overweight or obese are five times more likely than other children to be heavy as adults, which means greater risks of high cholesterol, high blood sugar, asthma and even mental health problems. The new study's data comes from measurements of the height and weight of nearly 12 million low-income children in 40 states. The children were ages two, three and four. Most were enrolled in the federal Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program which provides food vouchers and other services. It's harder to get national data on preschoolers of more affluent families, so it's not clear if the trend applies to all young children. But experts note that low-income kids tend to be heavier. 'If you're going to look at the problem of obesity early in childhood, the group at highest risk are low-income kids. 'That's what makes this data so valuable for understanding trends in this major public health problem,' said Dr. Matthew Davis, a University of Michigan researcher who tracks health policy and children's health issues. SOURCE: Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System, 2008-2011. *Represents statistically significant annual decrease or increase in obesity . The biggest declines were in Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey and South Dakota. Each saw their obesity numbers fall at least 1 percentage point. Despite the improvements, the numbers are still disappointing. Hawaii was the best, with about 9 percent of low-income preschoolers estimated to be obese in 2011. California was worst, at nearly 17 percent. Ten states were not included; some had changed how they track height and weight. One of the missing states is Texas, which has one of the largest populations of low-income children and is known to have a significant problem with childhood obesity. Of the remaining 40 states, 18 showed at least slight improvement and 19 had no significant change. Three – Colorado, Pennsylvania and Tennessee – increased. The last CDC study to look at childhood obesity data this way found very different results. From 2003 to 2008, significant declines in preschooler obesity were seen in only nine states and increases were seen in 24 states. 'We're seeing great progress,; said the CDC's Ashleigh May, lead author of the new study. The report didn't answer why some states improved while most others held steady, and Davis said there's a pressing need to do more research and understand how some states achieved success. CDC officials said a change in WIC policies probably played a major role. The changes – instituted in 2009 – eliminated juice from infant food packages, provided less saturated fat, and made it easier to buy fruits and vegetables. Breast-feeding rates have been increasing, and kid's raised on mother's milk tend to have lower obesity rates, experts said.","The biggest declines were in Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Jersey and South Dakota .

When Karen Boniface started coughing and wheezing one summer, she immediately recognised the symptoms. Like an estimated ten million Britons, she suffers from seasonal hay fever and this time felt no different. 'Usually I cough up phlegm, my nose runs and I tend to get chesty and wheezy - typical hay fever symptoms,' says Karen, 53, from Studland, Dorset. 'I had these symptoms for a few months, but I thought nothing of it: it seemed the same as the previous three years I'd had hay fever.'  Yet unbeknown to Karen, she was actually displaying early signs of lung cancer. 'I thought nothing of it': Like ten million Britons, Karen Boniface suffers from seasonal hay fever, so when she started coughing and wheezing, she assumed that was the cause of her symptoms . Although it is the second most common cancer in the UK, with 35,000 cases a year, many people are unaware of the symptoms so it is caught too late, says Dr Rohit Lal, a consultant oncologist from Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust. As a result, just 9 per cent of patients survive for five or more years after diagnosis, making it the most common cause of cancer death for men and women in the UK. But it can be a hard disease to spot, adds Dr Lal, who also works at the BMI Blackheath Hospital. The early signs can be subtle or attributed to other conditions, leading many people to assume they are down to allergies, colds and flu. This point is echoed by Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England. 'A number of people are generally unaware of the potential symptoms of lung cancer, or associate a persistent cough with the seasons - hay fever, allergies or winter coughs and colds. This can often result in people delaying a visit to their GP, which could be the difference between receiving an early or late diagnosis.' But it's the duration of symptoms that sets colds and hay fever apart from lung cancer, explains Dr Lal. 'Hay fever happens in bouts, can vary from day to day and should be eased with antihistamines. But lung cancer symptoms don't disappear after a few weeks, and progressively get worse.' Mistaken illness: The symptoms of lung cancer can be tricky to spot - many assume they are a result of allergies, cold and flu . Lung cancer is most common among the over-50s, but the biggest increase in the past four years is in the over-75s due to the ageing population, says Mr Duffy. There are also around 10  per cent more cases in the under-40s compared with ten years ago.  Dr Lal says the youngest case he has seen has been in a 23-year-old. It is thought it is becoming more obvious in women because rates of men smoking are declining faster. In 1948, 65 per cent of men smoked, compared with 41 per cent of women. Now, 20 per cent of women smoke, compared with 21 per cent of men. Evidence has also shown that women are more prone to a particular type of lung cancer, driven by a genetic defect. This type of cancer is called an adenocarcinoma, and scientists are unsure why women are more at risk, although it may be linked to hormones. Scientists from the University of Turin, Italy, found there was a slightly increased risk (less than 5 per cent) of lung cancer for women on HRT, so it's thought the female sex hormone oestrogen may play a role, but more research is needed. The most common symptoms of lung cancer are a cough lasting three weeks or more, loss of appetite and weight loss, tiredness, breathlessness and chest pain. Yet people are often reluctant to bother their doctor with these symptoms, says Mr Duffy, which could be contributing to the high death rates from  the disease. 'Compared with other European countries' survival rates, England significantly lags behind because over two thirds of patients are diagnosed at a late stage,' says Mr Duffy. 'By this point, curative treatment is often no longer viable. Some people might not want to bother their doctor, but please do - it's always best to be sure.' But there are other, more surprising, symptoms of lung cancer that patients often miss, says Dr Lal. One of these is rounded 'clubbed' fingernails, which occur in one case in ten. No one knows exactly why, but this symptom can be seen in conditions where there is a lack of oxygen getting into the body, such as congenital heart defects. More often, though, it is a sign of lung problems. Typically, nails feel spongy and look curved. The ends of the fingertips appear swollen and are often slightly blue in colour. 'They look a bit like matchsticks,' says Dr Lal. 'Compared with other European countries' survival rates, England significantly lags behind because over two . thirds of patients are diagnosed at a late stage.' 'For some patients, lung cancer is diagnosed only after a doctor notices their nails and sends them for an X-ray, although it's usually one of many symptoms. However, not all doctors are aware it's a sign.' Karen developed clubbed fingertips and nails around five months after first getting her 'hay fever' symptoms, but she noticed them only when a chiropractor, whom she had visited for an unconnected  back complaint, remarked on them and advised her to see  her doctor. She had seen her GP previously, as she had started to feel incredibly tired. She was diagnosed with borderline anaemia and given iron pills, but these didn't ease her exhaustion. On seeing her fingernails, however, her doctor sent her for a chest X-ray because he knew they could be linked to lung problems. Karen was horrified when this showed a tumour on her right lung, and further tests confirmed cancer. The tumour was removed and fortunately the cancer hadn't spread. Karen had a short course of chemotherapy and was given the all-clear five years later. Karen was lucky, but Dr Lal says that in other patients the symptoms are missed. Apart from clubbed fingernails, other surprising symptoms include pain in the shoulder and weakness or numbness in the hand. This occurs in around 10  per cent of lung cancer cases, when the tumour grows at the top of the lung. When it expands, it presses on the nerves running through the shoulder. 'People go to their doctor with shoulder, wrist and arm problems that they've tried a few things for but the pain hasn't gone after a couple of weeks,' says Dr Lal. 'The GP sends them for a chest X-ray and finds something at the top of the lung.' However, he stresses that pains such as these are usually due to arthritis or muscle strain. Dr Lal adds it's also important to take note when a chest infection does not clear up after a course of antibiotics, as many GPs prescribe three of four courses before sending a patient for a chest X-ray. Surprise symptom: Rounded 'clubbed' fingernails are a sign of lung problems; this patient's nicotine-stained finger exhibits the condition . 'GPs can be hesitant to send people for X-rays, for example someone who is coughing up blood but is young and seems otherwise fit. But they don't cost much - about £40. 'It can also be due to lack of awareness. Symptoms are often put down to hay fever, chest infections and bronchitis before lung cancer is considered.' Non-smokers should not assume they are not at risk, he adds. Although smoking is the biggest risk factor (Karen had smoked for 26 years, but gave up when her cancer was diagnosed), one case in five occurs in non-smokers. This is thought to be largely due to other environmental factors. These include second-hand smoke, air pollution and exposure to asbestos. For smokers, the risk of lung cancer drops significantly five to ten years after quitting, although it stays higher than in a non-smoker. Karen is glad she saw her doctor when she did. 'Since my diagnosis at 44, I've looked at life differently,' she says. 'I try to be less stressed, have more fun and be positive. When you go through cancer, you realise what's important.' roycastle.org .","Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the UK .

A compound found in tea brewed from tree bark could lead the way in the fight to eradicate AIDS, researchers claim. Scientists have found a way to isolate the chemical, prostratin and synthesise it so it is 100 times as potent, the meeting of the American Chemical Society was told. The bark of the mamala tree, which contains prostratin, has been used by tribal healers in Samoa to treat patients with hepatitis. A compound found in tea brewed from tree bark of the mamala tree, pictured, could lead the way in the fight to eradicate AIDS, researchers claim . The same technique could be used on . naturally occurring drug candidates, some found in sea creatures, . leading to new treatments for cancer and Alzheimer’s, said Dr Paul . Wender, of Stanford University. Dr Wender said his research represents a ‘fundamentally new approach to some of the most serious unmet health challenges of our time'. He led a team which developed a process to distill prostratin from the bark of the Samoan mamala tree and was praised by native healers as remedy for hepatitis. Scientists isolated prostratin as the active ingredient and realised its potential as an anti-viral drug. Dr Wender said: 'We now have made synthetic variants of prostratin, called analogs, that are 100 times more potent than the natural product. 'That’s part of the basis for our approach to advancing potentially transformative treatments for AIDS, Alzheimer’s disease and resistant cancer. The new compounds have shown promise for both preventing the HIV virus (pictured) from infecting human cells and awakening dormant HIV viruses that are hiding inside human latently infected cells . 'The mamala tree did not start making prostratin millions of years ago to treat a disease that appeared in the 20th century. 'The same is true for other substances that occur naturally in plants and animals. But we now have the tools to read nature’s library and use the lessons learned there to design, make and study new molecules that address unmet medical needs. 'This ‘function-oriented’ approach seeks to identify useful parts of molecules and then, based on this knowledge, to design new and more readily synthesised molecules that work better or work in totally new ways. 'This is a well-validated strategy, perhaps best exemplified by the emergence of modern aviation from knowledge of how birds fly.' The new compounds have shown promise for both preventing HIV from infecting human cells and awakening dormant HIV viruses that are hiding inside human latently infected cells. The Stanford research team have used the same approach to synthesis bryostatin, a substance that occurs naturally in sea creatures called bryozoans (pictured) Latent HIV cell reservoirs are untouchable by today’s antiviral medicines which reduce active virus levels in patients’ blood and keep them healthy. But when patients stop the medication, the hibernating HIV in reservoirs awakens to resupply active virus. Prostratin flushes out dormant HIV cells so that antiviral drugs can attack and hopefully eradicate the HIV from the body. In essence, said Dr Wender, if one wants to eliminate a weed, one needs to get rid of its roots. His team used the same approach to synthesis bryostatin, a substance that occurs naturally in sea creatures called bryozoans. 'Bryostatin has shown great promise in laboratory experiments as the basis for development of potentially transformative medicines for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and the eradication of HIV/AIDS,' he said. The research team is currently also focusing on bryostatin and designed analogs for their potential use in boosting memory in Alzheimer's patients . 'However, its limited supply from natural sources has slowed research, and as with prostratin, it was not evolved in nature for modern therapeutic use. 'We have overcome both the supply and performance barriers by designing simpler and thus more readily synthesised analogs of bryostatin - over 100 of them so far. 'When tested in various assays related to HIV/AIDS eradication, these analogs are up to 1,000-fold more potent in flushing HIV out of its hiding places than prostratin. 'Much needs to be done, but we are on a promising trajectory.' The research team is currently also focusing on bryostatin and designed analogs for their potential use in boosting memory in Alzheimer’s patients. The compound is known to improve learning and memory in laboratory rats and appears to cause formation of new connections in the brain that are associated with learning and memory.","Compound in prostratin has been isolated making it 100 more more potent .

In touch: She still sees the children she has carried but is under no illusion about who their parents are . Mr Miller called her a 'real star' for giving them baby Addie, who is now two years old. In Oklahoma, surrogates cannot accept money for carrying another person's child and can only accept travel and healthcare expenses. Woodmansee said she was never in it for the money. 'I think a lot of people think a surrogate must be in a financial bind and that's why she's going to do this to her body and go through nine months of hell. And that's not the case at all,' she said. She added that it has never been complicated after giving birth to another couple's child and she is under no illusion about who the parents are. Devoted: LaDonna has three children and two stepchildren. She decided to become a surrogate after she was unable to get pregnant with her new husband and did not want others to never have children . She maintains contact with the families. The parents regularly update her with photographs and she attends the children's birthday parties. She said that she might consider one more surrogacy, and that if the Millers want a brother or sister for Addie - which they have said they do - she would hope to carry the child. 'Besides having my own kids, surrogacy is the best thing I've ever done,' she said. See below for video .","LaDonna Woodmansee has given birth to four children for three couples .

The mother of a 6-year-old victim of December’s unthinkable massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in wished the country's teachers ‘courage, faith and love’ Friday as they start a new school year. Nelba Marquez-Green's daughter Ana Grace was one of 26 killed by Adam Lanza during his Dec. 14, 2012, shooting spree. She also has a son who was at the school at the time of the shooting and was uninjured. In her letter published on the Education Week website, Marquez-Green praised educators as heroes and described how impressed she was by the teachers at Sandy Hook who came back to work after the tragedy. Promise: Greene and Marquez-Greene hold a photo of Ana at an emotional January press conference. Marquez-Greene has written an emotional letter lauding America's teachers . ‘It takes guts to be a teacher,’ she wrote. ‘Six brave women gave their lives trying to protect their students at Sandy Hook. Other teachers were forced to run from the building, stepping over the bodies of their friends and colleagues, and they came right back to work. ‘While I pray you will never find yourself in the position of the teachers at Sandy Hook, your courage will support students like my son, who have lived through traumas no child should have to,’ she wrote. Marquez-Greene is herself marriage and family therapist and the mental health director for a nonprofit organization that supports those affected by the mass shooting, called Sandy Hook Promise.

She said teachers are the key to having an impact on students who are ‘left out and overlooked, like the isolated young man who killed my daughter.’ ‘At some point he was a young, impressionable student, often sitting all alone at school,’ she wrote. ‘You will have kids facing long odds for whom your smile, your encouraging word, and your willingness to go the extra mile will provide the comfort and security they need to try again tomorrow.’ Marquez-Greene said the only letter of the 15,000 she received after the shooting that she keeps at her bedside is one from her own high school English teacher. ‘Real heroes don't wear capes,’ she wrote. ‘They work in America's schools.’","Nelba Marquez-Greene lost her 6-year-old girl Ana in the December massacre .

After the heartbreak of seven miscarriages, Jenny Cash was overjoyed when she finally gave birth to a healthy girl. She and her husband Nathan could at last could dare to dream of the  large family they’d always wanted. But they had not banked on seeing their wish come true quite so quickly – after a second successful pregnancy produced triplets, with no IVF. Nathan and Jenny Cash with 2-year-old daughter Alessia and the new triplets Ben, Jayden and Taylor who were born on August 6 . Mr Cash, 35, an aircraft engineer, told of the moment the couple, who married in 2009, learned they would be having three more children. He said: ‘Looking at the scan monitor in hospital we couldn’t believe our eyes. ‘There, plain to see, were three pairs of arms and legs, and three tiny heads. So we both sat there with our mouths open.’ Mrs Cash said: ‘It’s a bit ironic, really, after all the miscarriages, then to be having triplets. It seemed like someone was having a laugh upstairs.’ She added: ‘Nathan was like “I can’t afford four kids”, and I was like “How did this happen? How am I going to carry three?!”.’ Despite their repeated failure to have a child, the couple, from Bar Hill near Cambridge, never tried IVF as doctors could not find a medical reason for the miscarriages. Triplets Taylor, Ben and Jayden were born at 33 weeks on August 6, and were taken home just 10 days later . Mrs Cash said: ‘We had tests, but they just said, “It’s just one of those things and if you can bear it just keep trying”. ‘We went to two different hospitals, but they couldn’t find anything, They said it was just bad luck, really.’ But she refused to give up. ‘I just thought, “Well, we’ll keep trying”.’ Then two years ago Mrs Cash’s eighth pregnancy gave the couple their first child, Alessia. And earlier this year the couple were astounded to learn that she was pregnant again – and carrying triplets. Bursting with pride: Jenny Cash said on the day of the triplets' birth she was ready to 'get them out'. They arrived by caesarean section a minute apart from one another . On August 6, Mrs Cash, 35, gave birth to identical boys Ben and Jayden, and a girl, Taylor. Delivered by Caesarean section at 33-and-a-half weeks – as is the norm for triplets – they weighed just over four-and-a-half pounds each. Mrs Cash said: ‘On the day itself I was like, “Get them out! I’ve had enough now!”’ The babies each arrived a minute apart – first the boys, both at 4lbs 9oz, followed by Taylor at 4lbs 8oz. Mrs Cash said: ‘They all came out crying; they were like a litter of kittens, with little tiny cries.’ The delivery at the Rosie Maternity Hospital in Cambridge was straightforward and despite being premature, the triplets were home in ten days. The babies are thriving – but telling the boys apart is a challenge, so the proud parents have left Ben’s hospital tag on for now. Mr Cash said: ‘We always wanted a big family. But just having two kids was proving difficult. But now we’ve got an instant larger brood.’ The couple have new challenges – they cannot fit four baby seats into their car and have to rely on the grandparents for a lift. But Mrs Cash is relishing her new family. ‘It’s really nice. And I don’t ever need to be pregnant ever again. Imagine if it was another three? Blimey!’","Jenny and Nathan Cash suffered years of failed pregnancies .

Sarah told ABC: 'We looked around the house and realized Braxton was missing and we still didn't comprehend it because Braxton hasn't had driver's training. He is a young 14, so no drivers' experience whatsoever.' She said she became concerned when the two of them started alienating friends so they could spend all their time together. 'They didn't want to hang out with friends. Their focus was each other and that's pretty intense for 14-year-olds,' Kiley said, adding that her son did not take the news they were going to different high schools very well.

"By . Joanna Moorhead . PUBLISHED: . 16:33 EST, 8 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:49 EST, 8 September 2013 . An idyllic Mediterranean morning and I'm sitting in a cafe overlooking a harbour full of boats bobbing on the azure water. But it's not the boats I'm watching, nor the gulls gliding and dipping across the cloudless sky: it's the young couple on the adjacent table. They're in their 20s, fresh-faced, happy. Obviously newlyweds, the bands on their left hands are shop-window shiny. She taps hers self-consciously against her coffee cup. He leans forward to dust a croissant crumb from her lips. They're fun-looking, perhaps a touch naive. Their optimism shines as brightly as the gold on their fingers. Wedded bliss: Joanna Moorhead with her husband Gary on their wedding day in 1988 . They have no idea of what lies ahead and perhaps that's just as well- because if they did, they'd be looking far less relaxed and a great deal more scared. The people I'm staring at are strangers but they remind me very much of another couple who, 25 years ago, sat there, fingers intertwined, staring soppily into each others eyes. The woman was me, aged 25, and the man was Gary, 27, my new husband. Together we'd travelled to Menorca on honeymoon. We were on the threshold of everything: our careers, our lives, and most of all - our relationship. We'd never been back since, but a quarter of a century on, to celebrate our silver wedding anniversary, here we are again. We look older, a few pounds heavier and sometimes we're downright grumpy, but I'd like to think the sparkle is just about still there in our eyes, if you look hard enough. As hard-up honeymooners we rented a pied-a-terre; this time around we've got a huge villa with its own pool. It may sound as if we're better off but in truth we're not, for four very good reasons. We've brought along our daughters: Rosie, 21, Elinor, 19, Miranda, 14, and 11-year-old Catriona. Newlywed: Joanna on her honeymoon in Menorca with her husband . And although a big family doesn't come cheap, it has been worth any hardship because two-and-a-half decades ago we never would have dreamed we would produce such wonderful, beautiful children. I don't say that to be boastful, but before we had the girls, we had no idea of the true miracle children represent in a marriage, for those couples lucky enough to have them. When two people become three, four or even six, everything changes. Back in 1988, the last time I was in this harbour, I thought marriage was about me and Gary. Today I can see that was simply the starting-point: the whole axis of our relationship altered irrevocably once children came along. A baby parachutes into your life, into the heart of your coupledom, and overnight everything changes. Suddenly someone else is more important than anything else there is or ever has been. It's awesome - as my girls would put it. Looking at my daughters over dinner one night I couldn't help but well up with tears. 'What's wrong with Mum?' one of them would ask from time to time. 'Oh, you know how she is,' another replied. 'She's being all sentimental again.' Happy holiday: Gary pictured while on their honeymoon . I caught Gary's eye and I knew what he was thinking: how lucky are we? Having four children, I have to admit, was my idea - I come from a large Catholic family, Gary is from a tiny Presbyterian one. He had one brother, six years older; his parents were only children, so he had no cousins. But I wanted the kind of larger-than-life, eventful family I came from. Gary took me on trust, and I'm profoundly grateful. I know that if he had married anybody else he would have settled for just a couple of children, but he's been entirely won round to my big-family ethos. I've earned the right to be sentimental. A quarter of a century is a long haul for any couple and there were times I didn't think we'd make it. While we have enjoyed a great many highs together, we've also endured our share of lows, from ill health to money woes and career disappointments. Ten years in, Gary's devotion to his work, a trait I once so admired, became a source of huge resentment. His workaholism meant many nights I was left alone to cope with sick and fractious children. My enthusiasm for 'attachment parenting' - having our babies always with us, even in our bed at night - was tricky for him to negotiate. 'I caught Gary's eye and I knew what he was thinking: how lucky are we?' All of this is the fabric of marriage until, finally, you fall into one camp: you become one of the four out of ten who throw in the towel or one of the six who hang on in there. I feel proud that we're the latter - not that there weren't dark days in between. The scariest moment in a marriage, I once read, is not the moment you realise you don't love your partner any more: it's the moment it hits you that you no longer like them. A few years ago I did a series of interviews with couples who'd been married 60-plus years. They were candid about how they'd stayed  the course. One thing I discovered was that, whenever the couples had come up against big problems, simply hanging on and waiting for the storm to pass had led to better times - not just once, but in every single case. Another thing the interviews taught me was this: what sometimes passes for 'perfection' in a marriage could very well be - whisper it - a touch boring. Some of the 'happy' marriages I heard about were rather uneventful. And whatever else has happened in our long years together, one thing I'm grateful for is that we've always had plenty to say to one another. Young love: Joanna, pictured 25 years ago whilst on her honeymoon, on the threshold of life . It might not have been smoochie stuff, but as far as I'm concerned my husband is the most interesting man I've ever had dinner with. He listens, he's well-read, he's fair, and he invariably has a take on an issue that I haven't considered. No matter what lies ahead we will never falter for conversation. Marriages rarely fail over just one issue - and sometimes, it seems to me, the problems lie not in the relationship, but in one partner's dissatisfaction with his or her own life. Often, I've realised the root cause of my fed-upness at any point wasn't Gary, but something else I could tackle: my job, friends, appearance. A marriage is the bedrock of a life - but it's not the entirety. Other things conspire to make a person unhappy - and marriage is too easy a thing to blame. There's always fault if you look for it. When my father died 48 years after my parents' got married, my mother wrote this tribute with her flowers on the coffin: 'So many happy memories.' That is what it's about. Gary and I have memories of babies being born; of small children playing on the beach; of older ones, in their too-big, pristine uniforms, setting off for their first day at school. 'So many happy memories': Joanna and Gary feel very lucky to have a family like theirs . From this summer we have a new memory: Rosie, our eldest, graduated from university. It was a hot July day, we sat side by side in a big hall with bright lights, and watched as our lovely daughter, in her gown and mortar board, stepped up onto the stage to collect her degree. There was no one I'd rather have been sitting beside than my husband, the only other person in the world who could feel exactly as I did. And I'm certain he'd say the same. I hope that in another 25 years we can return to Menorca to celebrate our golden wedding anniversary. How wonderful if, by then, our brood has grown even more. If our daughters desire the big family we craved, we could be paddling in the sea with 16 grandchildren in tow. But now, I look again at the couple at the next table. I'm in awe of them; their chutzpah, their cheek. There they are, with laughter in their eyes, believing that whatever life throws at them, they can deal with it together. I raise my glass to them, and I hope with all my heart they are one of the couples who make it.","As newly wed twenty-somethings, we went to Menorca for our honeymoon .

This is the vision of Ecovative, a U.S. company, which has embarked on a radical experiment to grow a miniature house from fungus. Founded in 2007 by classmates Gavin McIntyre and Eben Bayer from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Ecovative makes use of a part of the mushroom known as ‘mycelium’ to grow sustainable products.

Ecologically, mycelium's function is to break down waste. As it does this it secrets various products including enzymes, lipids, proteins, which act as glue and hold things together . Mycelium is the unseen part of a mushroom which consists of millions of tiny fibres. ‘Eben made the observation while he was taking a stroll in the woods, that fungal mycelium was growing on the wood chips and holding them together,’ McIntyre told Foxnews.com. ‘The thought process was — can we use mycelium as growing glue?’ Ecologically, mycelium’s function is to break down waste.

With a vast selection of clipper gradings, combs, scissors and mirrors and television screens from wall to wall, these images are not too far removed from the scene at scores of barbershops on High Streets all over the UK. But while some of the paraphernalia and equipment adorning the walls and worktops might seem familiar, the culture that accompanies them might not. Much more than being somewhere frequented out of vanity and a far cry from some of the more glamorous salons we might be used to in the UK, this fascinating collection of photographs show how barbershops in west Africa are a place to relax, socialise and meet up with friends. Life style: One of Andrew Esiebo's photographs taken of a barber shop named after the U.S President in Mali. The photographer has travelled across west Africa capturing the culture surrounding African barbershops . Diversity: Some of the barbershops captured by Esiebo would look at home in the western world, while some, including this one in Liberia are little more than makeshift huts . Tools of the trade: As well as taking pictures of the barbers and their customers, Esiebo also took pictures of some of the equipment they use . Seats one: This barbershop in Senegal, which is sandwiched between a clothes store and a vacant unit, is only big enough for one customer at a time . Hair idols: Much like anywhere else, many of the hairstyles requested in Africa are influenced by musicians and sports stars. This is apparent from the giant picture of Tupak Shakur in this Ivory Coast barbers . Nigerian photographer Andrew Esiebo . has explored the barbershop culture in an attempt to show how, like the .

The . 34-year-old told the New York Times: 'The barbershop is an intimate . space where people come to discuss what they cannot speak about in their . homes or in public, including politics and even their lovers. 'It’s one of the few spaces where people from different walks of life, from different classes, mix.' His photographs were taken in seven west African countries - Liberia, Mali, Ghana, Senegal, Benin, Mauritania and Ivory Coast - and feature high end barbers all the way down to establishments that are no more than one man with a pair of scissors and a chair. Sense of community: Barbershops like this one in the Ivory Coast are not just somewhere to go and get a haircut, but also a good place to socialise or just relax . No nonsense: Some of the tools used to cut hair in this Ivory Coast shop look archaic compared to what we're used to at UK salons . Quiet time: These two barbers sit and wait patiently for a customer in their shop in Ivory Coast . Upmarket: This barbershop is perhaps one of the swankiest among Esiebo's pictures. Football seems to have an influence on many of the shops . But according to Esiebo, many of the . styles and what they tell us about the individual choosing to have their . hair cut that way transcends nations, cultures and political division. While some of the barbers were . relatively plush and some as basic as you can get, most seem to be . adorned with pictures of icons of black culture, sport and music - the . inspiration for many of the haircuts requested. Esiebo found that often the . hairstyles reflect the way that the customer wants to be perceived - in . some parts dreadlocks are the sign of a 'ruffian' while in others a . style with a fancy pattern is a clear show of the wearer's artistic . prowess.

Coca-cola hopes to profit from the popularity of spicy autumn beverages with its new hot ginger ale in a can. Canada Dry Hot Ginger Ale will be dispensed pre-heated from from high-tech Japanese vending machines starting October 21. The ginger, apple, and cinnamon concoction is the product of years of research into finding a way to keep the drink carbonated while it warms. It’s also one of a spattering of warmed-in-the-can food and drinks now hitting the market in the U.S. and abroad. Would you drink it? Coca-Cola has announced its first ever carbonated hot beverage, a fall-themed Canada Dry brand ginger ale that will be dispensed hot from Japanese vending machines starting October 21 . According to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Japan is as obsessed with fall-themed beverages as Americans. Like the U.S. with its pumpkin-flavored hot beverages that are offered seasonally at countless coffee and food sellers like Starbuck’s, spicy beverages are a hit in Japan during the colder months. The orange, red, and yellow design of the can betrays its harvest-themed contents. The can will be dispensed pre-heated, but somehow still bubbling. The Coca-cola Company has worked for the last three years to maintain the drink’s carbonation during the heating process and their success has allowed them to introduce this, their first hot and fizzy beverage. What's your pleasure? Coca-Cola already offers hot beverages in cans. Pictured is a Japanese vending machine that offers Coca-Cola's Georgia brand hot coffee and teas in a can . The company already offers warmed drinks of the non-fizzy variety. Its Georgia Coffee brand vending machines dispense canned hot tea and coffee. While the 120 Yen ($1.20) ginger ale won’t be available stateside in the foreseeable future. Japan doesn’t have the patent on warmed-in-the-can beverages. In the United States, companies like Hot Can Inc. are selling soups and beverages that are actually warmed by the can. According to the Hot Can website, the company has created ‘a revolutionary self-heating smart packaging for the global beverage market.’ They offer tea, coffee, hot chocolate and soups that are heated internally via a chemical reaction. Though Hot Ginger Ale in a can won't be offered in the U.S., a company called Hot Can is among several that offer self-heating beverages and soups that utilize an internal chemical reaction to warm the can .","The company spent four years figuring out how to keep the drink fizzy during the warming process .

Researchers found that when gefitinib is combined with medicine used to treat ectopic pregnancy the time needed to cure the condition can reduce by a third . Women who suffer an ectopic pregnancy could have their fertility saved by a lung cancer drug. The treatment should reduce the number who need surgery for the agonising condition, which can threaten their chances of having a baby in future. Researchers found that when gefitinib – a drug commonly given to lung cancer patients – is combined with a medicine already used to treat ectopic pregnancy, the time needed  to cure the problem is cut  by one-third. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilised egg implants before reaching the womb and starts to grow in one of the two fallopian tubes. It is often not diagnosed for several weeks, until symptoms develop into a medical emergency that can be life-threatening. Some 12,000 women suffer an ectopic pregnancy each year in the UK. In the most serious cases, surgery is required, sometimes meaning the removal of a fallopian tube, making it more difficult for the woman to get pregnant again. On average, five women die each year as a result of an ectopic pregnancy – usually from massive loss of blood.In 90 per cent of cases, the drug methotrexate can be used successfully to remove the implanted egg. But research led by Dr Andrew Horne at the University of Edinburgh and Dr Stephen Tong at the University of Melbourne shows the combination therapy using two drugs is much more effective. Dr Horne said: ‘We’re very excited by the findings because it’s a problem affecting thousands of women. ‘An ectopic pregnancy can be extremely stressful for the woman involved. ‘If we can reduce the need for surgery, and thereby help fertility levels, then that would be an enormous benefit.‘Reducing the treatment time for women who do not need surgery would also have a significant impact.’ In a study involving 12 women given conventional treatment for an ectopic, half had an additional seven-day course of gefitinib injections. Gefitinib works by blocking a protein known to encourage cell growth which is found in high levels in ectopic tissue. The average time for the tissue to disintegrate was 21 days using the combination therapy compared with 32 days for the conventional drug alone. None of the women needed surgery, says the report published in the journal Obstetrics and Gynaecology. Dr Horne, who will now expand the study, said the main side-effect was a rash which disappeared when treatment ended. Women said this would not deter them having treatment if it meant their fertility was less likely to be damaged, he said. A short course of gefitinib costs £490 but surgery costs  at least £1,500, with some women needing fertility treatment afterwards. Chairman of The Ectopic Pregnancy Trust Alex Peace-Gadsby, who had emergency  surgery for a misdiagnosed ectopic pregnancy, said: ‘This is wonderful news. ‘Ectopic pregnancy is both physically and emotionally traumatic, and women and their families have to come to terms with the loss of a baby, invasive surgery … and the loss of part of their fertility, all in a single experience. ‘If this can provide women with more treatment options and reduce their physical trauma, which in turn will lessen the emotional impact, then further study is applauded.’","Combination of medicines could reduce time it takes to cure ectopic pregnancy by a third .

She was the 60's beauty famous for her epoch-defining music, wild ways and a passionate love affair with Mick Jagger but Marianne Faithfull has revealed that she didn't actually like men - or enjoy sex - at all. Faithfull, now 66, is to appear on BBC1's Who Do You Think You Are and in the show explains that the rape of her mother and grandmother at the end of World War II left her with a horror of men that lasted more than 30 years. Her mother, Eva von Sacher-Masoch, Baroness Erisso, who hailed from Austria, was attacked by Red Army soldiers as they liberated Vienna in 1945. Beauty: Marianne Faithfull was famous for her good looks, wild ways - and her stellar musical career . Tragic: The rape of Marianne's mother left her unable to enjoy sex without drugs for  three decades . 'My mother particularly, and my grandmother, naturally enough, really hated men,' the singer said, according to a Sunday Times report. 'It twisted them both. My grandmother turned away from my grandfather, who adored her. And Eva never got over that and always hated men. 'She then passed that on to me, actually. It took me years, until the time I got to 50 or so, before I could be in a relationship and love; and not have to take drink or drugs to have sex.' After ending her relationship with Jagger in 1970, Faithfull struggled with drug abuse for much of the following decade. At one point, her heroin addiction became so acute, she spent two years living on the streets of Soho, battling with her drug dependency and anorexia. 'I think my mother, and her unconscious and unspoken loathing of men, had a huge effect on me,' she added. 'It was a big problem for me in the Sixties, especially as I had to pretend that everything was wonderful, wild and sexual. But it really wasn't.' She also talks of her relationship with Jagger, which began while she was still married to first husband John Dunbar, during the programme, saying: . 'He loved me and I loved him. 'I just walked away. I don't really know why. I had to move on. 'Of course it was very painful, and very very hard because I loved him.' The documentary, which is to be broadcast on the 18th September, also delves further into the story of Faithfull's mother and her Jewish grandmother, Flora. Happier times: Faithfull with then boyfriend Mick Jagger at a court appearance in May 1969 . 'I loved him': Faithfull with Jagger in August 1969, months before they split and her downward spiral began . Although the Nazis insisted Flora change her name to Sara in order to make her more easily identifiable as Jewish, both Flora and her daughter escaped deportation to concentration camps. Others were not so lucky: more than 60,0000 Viennese Jews died in Nazi camps during the war. After the defeat of the Nazis, the women remained in Vienna before Eva met and married Major Robert Glynn Faithfull. Marianne was born in 1946 but the marriage was short-lived, ending in divorce in 1952.

For Downton Abbey has been accused of basic etiquette errors – by the lady of the house. The Countess of Carnarvon, the mistress of Highclere Castle where the series is filmed, has criticised the ITV1 drama’s repeated faux pas. Among them, says Lady Carnarvon – who writes a blog in which she reveals how a stately home should really be run – are the incorrect setting of the table for dinner and the lack of servants. Scroll down for video . All wrong: The set-up for the dinners on the popular ITV show are incorrect according to Lady Carnarvon of Highclere . ‘It’s the little details,’ she says. ‘Glasses are back to front and things are set wrong. ‘Setting up the table is an art. Knives, forks and spoons are set from the outside in, beginning with the bread knife and working through each course to cheese. ‘A pat of butter is impressed with the intertwined Cs and coronet and placed in front of each guest. ‘The wine glasses and water tumbler are arranged to the top right of each setting. Downton prefer a different arrangement. ‘I don’t want to step on people’s toes so I’ve tried a few times to  say, “Do you know you’re setting the table wrong?” I do feel, after  all, that it’s my dining table and obviously we wouldn’t set it like that. Lady of the manor: Fiona, 8th Countess of Carnarvon, writes a blog about her life running Highclere Castle . ‘They look at me blankly and I sort of try once more and then I give up… and now I try not to look because it’s easier.’ Other tips from Lady Carnarvon, whose husband the 8th Earl of Carnarvon owns Highclere, near Newbury in Berkshire, include butlers wearing white gloves to keep fingerprints off the glasses. She has previously said a stately home of Downton Abbey’s size would, in the early 20th century when the programme is set, have had up to 60 domestic staff. At the end of the third series, the fictional Crawley family had only about a dozen servants. Her observations will delight  the small group of Downton  fans that takes to the internet  after each episode to point out anachronisms. But Lady Carnarvon perhaps cannot afford to be too critical of the show – one of the most popular period dramas ever – the fourth series of which begins on ITV1 this month. For its success has had a dramatic impact on the lives of those living inside the ‘real’ Downton. The fictional Earl of Grantham has struggled to keep hold of  his ancestral home and, before Downton hit our screens, the  Earl and Countess of Carnarvon admitted their estate needed £11.75million repairs, including £1.8million of urgent work on the main house. Ravaged by damp and rot, at least 50 rooms were uninhabitable and stone turrets were in disrepair. But after their friend, the show’s writer and producer Julian Fellowes, asked if he could film at Highclere, it has become one of the UK’s best-known stately homes. Up to 1,200 visitors a day descend in the summer, enabling the owners to begin major repairs.

Troubled retailer Abercrombie & Fitch is in the headlines for all the wrong reasons again after a federal judge ruled that the trendy clothing retailer wrongly fired a Muslim worker who insisted on wearing a head scarf. U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers ruled in San Fransisco on Monday that the company had violated anti-discrimination laws when it fired Hani Khan, then 20, from its Hollister store in San Mateo, California, in 2010. Already this year CEO Mike Jeffries has had to apologize for remarks he made in 2006 that the company did not market to ‘unattractive individuals,’ while last month A&F lost another legal dispute over claims that the design of its stores discriminated against disabled customers. Troubled retailer Abercrombie & Fitch is in the headlines for all the wrong reasons again after a federal judge ruled that the trendy clothing retailer wrongly fired a Muslim worker who insisted on wearing a head scarf . Hani Khan, right, has won her discrimination lawsuit against Abercrombie & Fitch, while CEO Mike Jeffries, left, has already had to apologize this year for his remarks that the company did not market to ‘unattractive individuals’ The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit on Khan's behalf in 2011. The company had claimed the head scarf violated its policy governing the look of its employees, which it said was part of its marketing strategy. The store argued that deviating from its look policy would affect sales. Khan was employed for several months, in 2009 and 2010. She said that when she was hired, a manager at the store, in San Mateo's Hillsdale Mall, said it was OK for her to wear the hijab as long as it was in company colours. But four months later she claims a district manager and human resources manager asked if she could remove the hijab while working. When she refused, she was suspended and then fired. Problematic: In August Hollister was found guilty of disability discrimination with its stepped store entrances, modeled after California beach shacks (a store front in Park Meadows Mall, Lone Tree, Colorado) The case wasn't the first time the company has been charged with discriminating against Muslim women over the wearing of a hijab. In 2009, Samantha Elauf, who was 17 at the time, filed a federal lawsuit in Tulsa, Oklahoma, alleging the company rejected her for a job because she was wearing a hijab. Also in 2009 a London employment tribunal awarded 22-year-old Riam Dean £8,000 after she claimed the firm banished her to the stockroom because she had a prosthetic arm. Abercrombie & Fitch has become well-known for its controversial 'look policy', which provides strict guidelines governing how employees dress. It stipulates staff must represent 'a natural classic American style'. The company instructs employees on everything from how to wear their hair (clean and natural) to how long they should wear their nails (a quarter of an inch past the end of the finger). But the policy has got them into trouble this year after a 2006 Salon Magazine interview with CEO, Mike Jeffries went viral and caused widespread outcry. Image conscious: Hollister, like all of the Abercrombie & Fitch brands, markets its clothing as a lifestyle, its main inspiration being Southern California's beach and surf scene . The article highlighted Jeffries' statements that Abercrombie did not produce clothing for women larger than size 10 and purposefully did not market to 'unattractive' individuals. 'That's why we hire good-looking people in our stores. Because good-looking people attract other good-looking people, and we want to market to cool, good-looking people. We don't market to anyone other than that,' Jeffries had said in the 2006 interview. 'In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids. Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don't belong [in our clothes], and they can't belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.' As the article gained momentum via . Social Media, the company's official Facebook site was bombarded by . comments and posts against the strategy. Jeffries was forced to issued an official statement in May, 2013, denying that the company discriminated against people. 'I sincerely regret that my choice of words was interpreted in a manner that has caused offense,' he said. 'We are completely opposed to any discrimination, bullying, derogatory characterizations or other anti-social behavior based on race, gender, body type or other individual characteristics.’ Last month a federal judge ruled that A&F¿s surf-inspired clothing label Hollister has until January 1, 2017, to redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair-friendly . Then last month a federal judge ruled that A&F’s surf-inspired clothing label Hollister has until January 1, 2017, to redesign hundreds of its storefronts to ensure that they are wheelchair-friendly. Many of Hollister's stores have entrances that resemble a stepped front porch and a lawsuit launched in 2009 accused the company of discriminating against disabled customers. The long-running case originally grew from complaints filed against two Hollister stores in Colorado by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition. Julie Farrar, 45, one of the plaintiffs in the four-year dispute, said she visited the Orchard Town Center store, which has since closed, to buy items for her 12-year-old daughter but her wheelchair couldn’t make it up the steps. Lawyers for the Equal Rights Center, a national civil-rights organization, found similar access problems at Abercrombie & Fitch and Hollister stores in nine States and filed a similar lawsuit in November 2009 in Maryland. In 2012 the Colorado-focused case grew into a class-action suit targeting the 248 Hollister stores across the U.S. that feature imitation porch steps as a main entrance. Despite the uproar, Hollister vigorously defended the use of stairs in its stores. Widespread: 248 Hollister stores across the U.S. currently feature faux porch steps as their main entrance . A company spokesman said that the raised entrances were designed to create 'an entry to a house in Southern California that you would walk up onto the porch or walk down into the porch, to enter, like you would do at a beach house.' The firm argued that it complies with the law because the stores include side doors disguised as shuttered windows that are wheelchair accessible. However plaintiffs said these doors are often are blocked with tables stacked with merchandise and they should not be made to enter through an 'inferior' entrance. Ms Farrar, who was born without a sacrum - the triangular bone at the bottom of the spine - told The Colorado Independent: 'I would never go through a side door. It’s not something I would do. I’m philosophically opposed to that. 'These stores are designed to look shuttered and hidden, as if to keep out the riffraff. I want people to know that, as a society, we have evolved over the past 25 years. 'Despite the fact that [Hollister] market[s] beauty and athleticism as a stereotype, the reality is they still need the rest of us people who are short, chubby and maybe with acne and wheelchairs.' In March U.S. District Judge Wiley Daniel agreed that Hollister’s inaccessible porches violate the American with Disabilities Act, also known as the ADA. The 23-year-old law prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities in employment, transportation, public accommodation, communications, and governmental activities. A federal judge has ruled that Hani Khan she was sacked from her job at the Hollister in this California shopping center for wearing a hijab in 2010 . Judge Daniel ruled that customers who use wheelchairs must be entitled to the same experience as all other customers. He suggested that Hollister could flatten out its entrance ways and remove the steps or install wheelchair-accessible ramps. Commenting on the ruling, a spokesman for Hollister told MailOnline  'We are surprised by the Judge’s decision that the Hollister entrances are not compliant with the ADA. 'We’ve maintained throughout the litigation, and continue to maintain, that the stores comply with the ADA and allow access to all patrons. 'Beyond that, we want all of our customers to have a positive experience when shopping in our stores. While we reserve the right to appeal the underlying legal issue, we are currently working with the court and the plaintiffs to reach a mutually agreeable resolution.' Hollister, like all of the Abercrombie brands, markets its clothing as a lifestyle, its main inspiration being Southern California's beach and surf scene. The website explains that it is the 'coolest destination for genuine SoCal style clothes for guys and girls.' And a 2013 report to shareholders reads: 'It’s all about hot lifeguards and beautiful beaches… Young and fun, with a sense of humor, Hollister never takes itself too seriously. Hollister’s laid-back lifestyle and All-American image is timeless and effortlessly cool.' The U.S. Justice Department has also weighed in on the discrimination case. It highlighted that the Hollister stores were built long after the ADA came into play and therefore the entrances violate both the 'spirit and letter of the law.'","A federal judge has found in favor of Hani Khan who claimed she was fired for wearing a head scarf .

James Packer, Australia's wealthiest man and one of the richest people on earth, has split from his former model wife Erica Baxter in a shock announcement issued today on the eve of his 46th birthday. The billionaire son of the late media mogul Kerry Packer - a fierce opponent of Rupert Murdoch - is rated 198th on the Forbes magazine list of the world's richest people following his investments in casinos in Asia and Australia. Miss Baxter, 36, mother of Mr Packer's three children, has moved out of their £30million home - completed just eight weeks ago - on the shores of Sydney harbour and has travelled to Los Angeles with children Indigo, five, Jackson, three and Emmanuelle, who will be one later this month. Happier times: James Packer and Erica Baxter are pictured together at the Melbourne Carnival Cup in 2006 (left) and at the Australian Grand Prix in 2004 . A statement issued to Sydney's Daily Telegraph said simply: 'It is with great sadness that Erica and James Packer announce their separation. 'We remain deeply close friends and incredibly proud parents and our children are our priority going forward.' James married Erica in a multi-million pound ceremony in the South of France in 2007 . A source told Fairfax Media that there were no third parties involved. The source said: 'Erica and the kids are in LA and James is planning to spend a lot of his time there over the next few months. 'They're friends and they want to make sure they will stay friends. The kids are their priority. It's that simple. 'Any separation is traumatic but because this will attract so much publicity, they're determined to do their best to shield the kids and look after them, first and foremost.' While Sydney's Daily Telegraph referred to the couple as having already divorced, Fairfax said they had separated. But friends agreed that the split was permanent, even though the couple say they will remain friends. The announcement comes two months after Mr Packer, who has an estimated personal fortune of £4billion, won a government licence to build a £1billion casino-resort beside Sydney harbour. Celebrity-watchers had first spotted Miss Baxter in Los Angeles without Mr Packer in July and a few days later she flew alone to Paris. The couple married in a multi-million pound ceremony in the South of France in 2007, with Tom Cruise and his then-wife Katie Holmes in attendance along with a number of high profile people, including Rupert Murdoch. Miss Baxter had once had a relationship with Mr Packer's friend, British casino heir Damian Aspinall.

Scroll down for video . Sexist: Tech Crunch apologises for sexist 'titstare' app developed at its conference by Sydney boys David Boulton, left, and Jethro Batts, right . The company initially tweeted: 'We apologize for two inappropriate hackathon presentations earlier today. We will more carefully screen from now on.' And later it sent out a more thought-out response on its website, saying the 'spirit of the event was marred by two misogynistic presentations'. The organisers said that 'sexism is a major problem in the tech industry and we've worked hard to counteract it in our coverage and in our own hiring.' It blamed a failure to properly screen the presentations and a lack of clear guidelines for participants for the sexist content. Video courtesy of Abby Ohlheiser . The two tech boys developed their app in 24-hours then presented it to an audience at the Tech Crunch conference in San Francisco . They tried to claim that women shouldn't be offended since it was good for men's health . 'You expect more from us and we expect more from ourselves. We are sorry,' it said. David Boulton and Jethro Batts claimed afterwards on Twitter that their 'T*tstare' app was just a 'joke'. The Sydey duo were the first to present their work from the last 24-hours to the conference on Sunday. They tried to justify their misogynistic app by falsely claiming that staring at women's breasts helps men maintain a healthy heart. Mr Boulton, who runs a business which sends anonymous 'hateful' postcards to people anywhere in the world, used pictures or women's chests to demonstrate his way through the presentation with his accomplice. A Tweet after the conference read: 'Titsare guys here, sorry if we offended some of you, very unintentional. Just fun Aussie hack.' AOL-owned Tech Crunch apologised for two sexist apps presented during its conference on Sunday .

He encouraged people to download his app to see who could shake their phone the most in 10 seconds. The second inappropriate app was presented on stage, where a man simulated masturbation - to get as many shakes as possible within 10 seconds .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . UPDATED: . 12:19 EST, 13 December 2011 . Less than two weeks after the U.S. let a top secret spy drone slip through its fingers in Iran, Washington appears to have lost another. Officials say an unmanned military drone crashed this morning at an airport on the island nation of Seychelles. The U.S. Embassy in Mauritius said the U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone was not armed and that the crash caused no injuries. Crashed: A U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drone like the one seen here - which are most often used to monitor Al Qaeda-linked militants, crashed in Seychelles this morning . Lina Laurence of Seychelles' civilian aviation authority said the drone developed engine problems minutes into its flight and needed to land as soon as possible Tuesday morning. 'But due to its accelerated landing speed, the aircraft was unable to stop before the runway's end,' Laurence said. The embassy's statement said the cause of the crash is being investigated. 'It has been confirmed that this drone was unarmed and its failure was due to mechanical reasons,' Laurence said. The affected runway was closed for about 10 minutes as a 'precautionary measure,' but was later reopened with no disruption to airport operations, Laurence said. The U.S. military and the civilian aviation authority of Seychelles have coordinated to remove the debris, officials said. The MQ-9 Reaper is a medium-to-high altitude unmanned aircraft system with sensors that can provide real-time data. The Seychelles-based MQ-9s, which are used to monitor piracy activities in and around the Indian Ocean, don't carry weapons, though they have the capability to do so. Tuesday's crash follows last week's claim by Iran that it seized a drone identified as the RQ-170 Sentinel. Tehran said it was captured over the country's east. The nearly intact drone was displayed on state TV and flaunted as a victory for Iran in a complicated intelligence and technological battle with the U.S. U.S. officials said the unmanned aircraft malfunctioned and was not brought down by Iran. President Barack Obama said Monday the U.S. wants the top-secret aircraft back and has delivered a formal request for the return of the surveillance drone, though it isn't hopeful that Iran will comply. The U.S. has used drones to hunt down Al Qaeda-linked militants in Somalia and Yemen, among other countries. Their humming is a constant feature in the sky in many of the major towns in southern Somalia, especially the capital city and the militant-controlled southern port of Kismayo. It was not clear if drones operated out of the Seychelles are used for that purpose. Paraded for the cameras: Iranian Revolutionary Guard's General Amir-Ali Hajizadeh (left) inspects the U.S. RQ-170 drone . Defiant: During an interview on Venezuelan television last night, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad claimed his scientists can already control the spy plane . Speaking through an interpreter, Mr . Ahmadinejad said: 'There are people here who have been able to control . this spy plane, who can surely analyse this plane's system also. 'In . any case, now we have this spy plane.' President Obama yesterday confirmed that the U.S. wants the top secret aircraft back. During a White House news conference with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malik, Mr Obama said: 'We have asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond.' The president refused to comment on what the Iranians might learn from studying the downed aircraft.

The boat is approximately 35m long . and 23m wide, depending on whether the solar panels are closed - when it . is docked or experiencing very rough conditions at sea - or open, in . most instances at sea. The boat travels at an average speed of five knots and uses a staggering 512 square metres of photovoltaic panels to power six blocks of lithium-ion batteries. Despite this it is is light, durable and completely silent. Here, the boat has 'closed' its solar panels allowing it to dock more easily. It also pulls them in when sea conditions are very rough .

A stork detained by Egyptian authorities on suspicion of being an under cover agent, has been found dead. Local residents discovered the bird on an island in the Nile, south of the ancient city of Aswan on Saturday. Its death was confirmed by Mahmoud Hassib, the head of Egypt's southern protected areas. A migrating stork is held in a police station after a citizen suspected it of being a spy and brought it to the authorities . An Egyptian wildlife organization claimed on its Facebook page the bird was 'eaten by local villagers'. But Hassib denied the bird had been consumed and said he could not confirm the cause. Last month a man took the bird to a police station in the Qena governorate, some 280 miles southeast of Cairo, on Friday. He suspected the bird was an undercover agent because it carried an electronic device. The head of security in Qena confirmed that officials examined the bird and the device. Mohammed Kamal said the device was neither an explosive nor a spying device. It is thought to have probably been a wildlife tracker. Earlier this year, a security guard filed a police report after capturing a pigeon he said carried microfilm. Officials say the man suspected the bird was an undercover agent because it carried an electronic device . With turmoil gripping Egypt, authorities and citizens remain suspicious of anything foreign. The country has been in turmoil following the July 3 coup that toppled President Mohammad Morsi. Clashes between Egyptian security forces and Morsi's supporters have killed hundreds of people. 'We do believe that the recent operations of the security forces have been disproportionate and we're worried about the resulting alarming number of people that have been killed,' said the EU's foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Clashes between supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood and Egypt's ousted president Mohamed Morsi continue . Political turbulence has kept Egypt on edge for months. At least 900 people, including 100 soldiers and police, have been killed in a crackdown on Morsi supporters, making it the country's bloodiest internal episode in decades. The United States and the European Union have both been reviewing aid to Cairo in light of the bloodshed, but Saudi Arabia, a foe of the Brotherhood, has promised to make up any shortfall.","Bird's remains were on an island in the Nile near the city of Aswan .

Motor insurance firms are to face a full-scale investigation by competition watchdogs over a rip-off racket costing motorists £225million a year and adding £10 to every policy. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) today referred the industry to the Competition Commission after discovering that drivers had little control over the way in which repairs were carried out and replacement vehicles provided. Such practices were ramping up premiums. British drivers paying record premiums averaging more than £1,000 a year are victims of a ‘dysfunctional‘ motor insurance market worth nearly £10billion a year. Counting the cost: Motor insurance firms are to be investigated over a rip-off racket which is leaving British drivers out of pocket . Costs are being artificially inflated by a ‘merry go round' of controversial ‘referral payments’, excessively expensive repair bills, and unnecessarily high replacement car-hire car charges. MPs have even described some of the practices complained of as bordering on ‘bribery.' The OFT says there is clear evidence of the industry - worth an estimated £9.4billion in the UK - rigging the market to prevent proper competition to the detriment of UK motorists. It has found evidence of premiums paid by drivers being ramped up outrageously through spiralling referral fees. Money: Insurance costs for British drivers have risen steeply in recent years . It added that insurers whose driver . customers are to blame for a crash have little control over the way in . which repairs are carried out. As . a result it has decided to refer the issue upwards for investigation by . the Competition Commission which has powers to take enforcement action . and levy hefty fines. The OFT said there was ‘no quick fix’ to the problems identified and that further investigation was needed. The commission now has up to two years to report its findings. The . OFT had decided provisionally in May to refer the industry to the . Competition Commission pending further evidence after concluding: ’On . the basis of the evidence collects, the OFT has reasonable grounds to . suspect there are features of the private motor insurance market that . prevent, restrict, or distort competition.’ Clive . Maxwell, chief executive of the OFT, said: ‘Competition appears not to . be working effectively in the private motor insurance market. ‘The insurers of at-fault drivers appear to have little control over the bills they must pay, and this may be leading to higher costs for them and ultimately higher premiums for motorists.’ In May, the OFT said the motor insurance market was ‘dysfunctional’, with signs that insurers of drivers who are ‘at fault’ are being taken advantage of by insurers of drivers who are not at fault and by others involved in providing repairs and courtesy cars. Watchdogs took evidence suggesting that this is inflating the cost of providing replacement vehicles by an average of £560 a time, while the cost of repairs was £155 more. The OFT said after crashes, many . insurers of not-at-fault drivers, brokers and repairers, refer the . drivers to organisations that tend to charge higher rates in exchange . for ‘referral fees’ of around £250 to £400 per hire car. Bills paid by the insurers of the . ‘at-fault’ drivers can be inflated further because the other drivers . are given replacement vehicles for longer than necessary. Repair bills paid by the insurers of . at-fault drivers then pushed up because some insurers receive referral . fees and rebates from repairers and suppliers. Some insurers even have agreements . with repairers to charge higher labour rates when repairing the vehicle . of the not-at-fault driver. Such practices boost the revenues of . the insurer of the not-at-fault driver as well as pushing up the costs . for the insurers of the at-fault driver. Investigation: The OFT will investigate claims the insurance industry is ripping off British motorists . The higher costs are eventually passed on to drivers through higher premiums. Last year former Home Secretary Jack Straw told MP watchdogs that motorists were being fleeced by £2billion a year in unnecessary insurance costs caused by money-grabbing ‘parasites’ and ‘dodgy solicitors’ engaged in a controversial cash-for-contacts referral-fee ‘racket’ which in any other walk of life would be condemned as ‘bribery.’ Donna Scully, chairman of the Motor Accident Solicitors Society (MASS) said: 'We welcome the OFT’s decision to refer the private motor insurance market to the Competition Commission. ‘It’s an important and vital step in addressing a complicated sector that isn’t working efficiently or effectively. ‘ . Claims: Clive Maxwell (pictured) Chief Executive of the OFT said competition does not appear to be working properly in the British car insurance market . She added:’There is still much that needs to be done and it is essential that the whole industry continues to work together and with the government to clean up the system. The best interest of accident victims must be at the heart of every assessment and change in the industry.’ News of the referral comes as Royal Bank of Scotland puts the finishing touches to the stock market flotation of its Direct Line Group insurance arm. But the investigation is not expected to throw the plans off track. Today’s report says :‘The OFT remains of the view that the potential consumer detriment is significant, taking into account there are approximately 23 million policy holders and that the impact of the features has been, and in the absence of a market investigation could continue to be, felt over a number of years.’ It says ‘features it has identified are likely to be leading to higher costs which are passed on to consumers in higher insurance premiums’. The cost of repairs and replacement vehicles to not-at-fault drivers alone is worth about £1.4billion a year. On the evidence it concludes: ‘The OFT has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a feature or a combination of features of the market or markets for the supply or acquisition of private motor insurance and related goods or services in the UK prevents, restricts or distorts competition in connection with their supply or acquisition.’ A referral upwards to the Competition Commission  for a full market investigation is therefore ‘an appropriate response to the scale of the problem.’ The Association of British Insurers (ABI) welcomed the referral to the Commission to ‘tackle excessive costs’ and help bring down premiums for drivers. Nick Starling, director of general insurance at the ABI, said: ‘The OFT found what insurers have known for years - that when a customer has a crash that is their fault, the insurer has little control over the cost of the subsequent claim.’ But Martin Andrews, Director General of the Credit Hire Organisation (CHO) which provides replacement cars for insured drivers said: ’We continue to have serious concerns as to the long-term impact it may have on the motoring consumer and their right to mobility after an accident that was not their fault.’ He said:’We could see premiums soar as insurers try to make up losses as they are forced to pay out for replacement vehicles; or insurers will find ways not to provide replacement vehicles and not-at fault drivers will be forced to ‘make do’ and catch the bus. ‘ . He insisted:’The consumer will lose out, and hundreds of years of case law, establishing the consumer’s rights in the event of an accident, will be over-turned.‘ . Critics and MPs have blamed ‘ambulance chasing lawyers’ and claims companies for the rise in so-called ‘cash for crash’ claims. The influential Commons’ Transport Select committee has already criticised a 'dysfunctional' system which runs on a 'merry go round' of so-called 'referral payments'. It also highlighted 'aggressive' marketing techniques by the no-win-no fee firms, concluding that soaring car insurance premiums were being fuelled by a boom in 'abhorrent ambulance chasing' by no-win-no-fee personal injury claim firms. And it criticised a scandalous cash-for-contacts culture that means within  days or even hours of an accident, motorists' personal details are being  sold and re-sold on for under the counter 'fees' of up to £1,000 a time - to lawyers, medical experts and accident management companies. Motorists are then bombarded with hard-sell calls from 'no-win, no-fee firms' and other offering to act on their behalf. In July the AA revealed that car insurance had burst through the £1,000 barrier for the first time after an ‘epidemic’ of bogus whiplash and ‘cash for cash’ claims. The booming claims culture is adding to the rises as ‘ambulance-chasing lawyers’ push up the cost of premiums. The average fully comprehensive car insurance now costs £1,034 – up 8.5 per cent on a year ago when it was £955. But it more than doubled in just four years from July 2008 when the average fully comprehensive policy cost just £509, according to the benchmark AA British Insurance Premium Index. The Daily Mail has revealed how insurance companies are selling details of their clients to 'no-win, no-fee lawyers' for up to £1,000 per person and in some cases up to £10,000. Some 80 per cent of claims are for 'whiplash' which is conveniently undetectable by scans or X-rays. Liverpool is the  whiplash capital of Britain with one in every 50 residents making compensation claims. MPs on the all-party Commons Select committee have also warned of a £2billion a year ‘whiplash epidemic’. They say soaring whiplash claims are the main cause of the ‘runaway cost’ of motor insurance adding up to £90 to every policy.","British drivers paying record premiums .

Daniel Krupa, UK Games Editor for IGN.com, said: ‘This new console from Nintendo comes completely out of the blue - but once you realise they designed it to be used by children, it begins to make more sense. ‘This is perfect for parents who want their children to enjoy video games, but don't want to invest in an expensive next-generation console, or hand over their precious smartphone or tablet. ‘Given Nintendo's growing catalogue of handheld games, this could be a huge seller this Christmas season.’ The 2DS is a lower cost version of the 3DS, a larger, clamshell design with a 3D screen - which the 2DS doesn’t have.

The firm also announced a $50 price cut for its 32 GB Wii U console in North America and Europe from $349 to $299 - around £193 - following disappointing sales of the console. Nintendo sold just 3.6 million Wii U units sold since launch to June 30 compared to 9.3 million units of its predecessor, the Wii. However, the eight month-old Wii U faces stiff competition from Sony Corp's PlayStation 4, priced at £257 ($399) and Microsoft Corp's Xbox One, priced at £322 ($499) which will hit store shelves in November.","The 2DS will cost £109 when it goes on sale on 12 October and has a wedge-like design and two screens .

Those who like an early tipple can now indulge - with an ale you can spread on your toast. Yum. Omid dark ale spreadable beer has just launched in Selfridges and also promises to provide a unique accompaniment for hors . d'oeuvres and cheeses - and, say its makers, can even be used as a garnish for tarts and cakes. The beer spread contains a whopping 40 per cent actual beer and is suitable for spreading on toast . Beer lovers can now enjoy their favourite tipple in new and exciting ways thanks to the ingenious collaboration between an Italian chocolate maker and an Italian beer brewer. The result is a sweet and beer-perfumed jelly with an intense scent and a full-bodied taste. Nicola Waller, Selfridges Director of Food comments 'Spreadable beer was chosen due to its quirky properties, but also because it tastes delicious! 'It has the perfect composition using high quality ingredients, it might be an acquired taste, but for beer lovers out there it is perfect. 'There are two varieties,  one is more delicate like an IPA and the other is similar to an ale with  an intense scent and a full-bodied taste.' Omid dark ale spreadable beer is made of 40 per cent and comes in a 280g jar for £7.99. The omens weren’t good. As I twisted open the jar, I caught . a whiff of post-midnight pub: stale, yeasty and a bit dirty. It looked pretty . innocuous though – gravy-hued jelly with one or two tiny bubbles marring the . smooth surface. But if it looked OK, it certainly didn’t taste it. I was . expecting Marmite. Instead, I got a pint of real ale with half a bag of sugar . stirred in – a sort of beery jam, if you will. Those who love beer and those . who love sugary spreads but find Nutella a bit much will enjoy it. It . definitely has a future as a Secret Santa stand-by at the very least. But if . you’re working out what to buy for me, please step away from the ale spread. Sweet it might be. Nice it certainly isn’t.

Strictly was the sequin spotted winner as the biggest ratings battle in British TV got under way at the weekend. The BBC dance show beat ITV’s X Factor by raking in 300,000 more viewers. While the corporation’s debut show for the 11th series unveiled a line-up of fresh faces, its X Factor rival featured several acts seen by viewers before. Scroll down for video . Winner: The opening weekend of Strictly Come Dancing gained more viewers than the X Factor . Not having the last laugh: The X factor's Gary Barlow and Sharon Osbourne might have been having fun, but more viewers were tuned into the BBC . What did you watch this weekend? Yesterday critics suggested Strictly may be on top because the public have grown bored with watching ‘vulnerable people being exploited’ on Simon Cowell’s ITV show. Viewers were left with a feeling of deja vu watching the X Factor as acts that have previously auditioned for the programme re-appeared once more. Pippa Smith, of the Safer Media campaign group, said playing with people’s emotions was the ‘driving force’ of X Factor and said she was unsurprised that this turned viewers off. Strictly averaged 8.4million viewers on Saturday with 9.4million tuning in for its peak ratings. Star: It would have been yet another flawless performance for host Sir Bruce Forsyth had it not been for the difficult pronunciation of the new foreign dancers' names . However, the X Factor – which last week saw a boost in viewing figures following the return of Sharon Osbourne – peaked at 9.1million and averaged 8.3million viewers. In contrast to the X Factor ‘repeats’, Strictly Come Dancing saw its celebrity contestants paired up with their professional dance partners, as well as musical entertainment from stars including Rod Stewart and  Jessie J. It would have been yet another flawless performance for host Sir Bruce Forsyth – had it not been for the difficult pronunciation of the new foreign dancers’ names. The 85-year-old – who has presented the series alongside Tess Daly for the past 11 years – worked through cue cards and appeared to wrestle over a few of the particularly long new names. Under the disco ball, he read: ‘Now let’s get to know them all a little bit better. Please welcome from Lithuania Iveta Luk..o…siute…’ He then paused and jokingly told the audience to ‘Shut up’ as they laughed at the mispronunciation. Unfazed, he carried on with the list before finishing: ‘And thank goodness an easy one – all the way from Grimsby Kevin Clifton.’ Some fans on Twitter questioned where all the British dancers were. Kirsty Joyce said: ‘Lots of new sexy boys and girls from Eastern Europe on Strictly and who does the UK bring to the party? Kevin from Grimsby. Nice one!’ Of the 15 professional dancers competing in this year’s Strictly competition just four are from the UK, with none of professional females coming from British soil. Re-run: Viewers might be bored of the same acts appearing year after year on the ITV talent show including Amy Mottram, pictured, who has previously made it to judges' houses . History repeating: Girl band Dolly Rockers had also previously appeared on the X Factor and appeared again during the 'double auditions' on Saturday and Sunday . All change: Strictly had a new batch of celebrities ready to take to the floor for its latest series, including former rugby ace Ben Cohen, as well as some new professional dancers . Four of the dancers are from Russia with the rest of the quota being made up of dancers from Kazakhstan, Poland and Venezuela. Last year Cowell endured a tough few . months as ratings for his UK X Factor show slumped to their lowest ever . levels since 2008. In 2010 X Factor typically attracted 14.13m.

A pair of ramblers spent nearly an hour trapped on top of a flimsy wooden stile after being cornered by two angry bulls. Jennifer O’Malley and her partner Dave Alden were walking in Altarnun, Cornwall, when the aggressive animals blocked their path. The couple sat on top of the stile for almost an hour before having to drag themselves through a hedge to safety. Scroll down for video . Jenny O'Malley and her partner, Dave Alden, were walking in Altarnun in Cornwall when they were cornered by two angry bulls . The couple climbed onto a flimsy wooden stile to stay out of the animals' reach where they were trapped for almost an hour . Mr Alden tried to run to safety in a nearby field but was butted back into the fence, suffering a painful cut to his wrist. The pair then decided to wait in the hope the menacing bulls would grow tired and wander off. But neither showed any sign of backing down, leaving the couple stuck for 45 minutes. They eventually escaped by crawling sideways through a thick hedge between the fields, scratching themselves in the process. Mr Alden filmed their ordeal on his mobile phone to warn others about the aggressive animals. The video shows the two bulls snorting and scraping the earth with their hooves, as if poised to charge. He says: 'So here we are on a public footpath. This is the stile in the middle. We’ve got this bull on this side and this bull on this side.' Mr Alden's wrist was injured when the bull butted him into a fence after he tried to run away . Terrified: Jennifer O'Malley said she'd never encountered anything like it and has now been put off walking . 'We’ve got this bull on this side and this bull on this side': The animals surrounded the couple on a public footpath . He then points the camera at his wrist to reveal a bloody gash, adding: 'I tried going on this side - this is what the bull gave me when he pushed me into the fence.' Ms O'Malley said afterwards that the couple had no choice but to claw their way through thick brambles to escape. She said: 'It was nearly impenetrable and we got scratched to bits but it was the only option we had. 'I’ve never encountered anything like it. 'We think the bulls were trying to get to each other, but they were snorting, bellowing and pawing the ground and we were stuck in the middle with nowhere to go. 'It really was quite awful and so terrifying it’s put me off walking.' The couple have complained to the police and local council about the animals. Experts said the bulls were likely squaring up to fight one another - and the two ramblers were simply caught in the middle. The National Farmers’ Union said the incident was 'mercifully very, very, rare'. Spokesman Ian Johnson said while most farmers take their responsibilities and obligations very seriously, things can very occasionally go wrong. He said: 'We don’t know the exact circumstances about how the bulls ended up in the fields, but what happened sounds pretty traumatic. 'I’ve seen and heard bulls bellowing at each other and I wouldn’t want to be anywhere near that.'","Jennifer O'Malley and Dave Alden were cornered on a footpath by the aggressive animals .

This is the grandiose estate at the heart of a battle this week between a society dynasty and the local townspeople. The Ardrossan Estate in Pennsylvania - and its former inhabitants - inspired the 1940 film The Philadelphia Story starring Katharine Hepburn, James Stewart and Cary Grant. The mansion was home to the Montgomery-Scott-Wheeler family for generations before being put up for sale six years ago after the death of Robert Montgomery Scott.

Movie legend: The vast estate inspired the 1940 film The Philadelphia Story starring Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant . He was the son of Hope Montgomery . Scott - the WASPish socialite who inspired the character Tracy Samantha Lord Haven, played by Hepburn in the film. The original property -  a 50-room Georgian revival mansion named Ardrossan after the family's ancestral Scottish home - once boasted 800 acres. Most of the land has been sold off or donated but current family representative and realtor Edgar Scott III, the society queen's grandson, has plans to divide up the remaining 360 acres for property development. He revealed plans to build 87 new homes at a meeting with officials from Radnor Township on Monday - much to their dismay.

The property is held by two trusts for the Montgomery-Scott-Wheeler family, according to MainLineToday. The mansion will remain owned by the family's trust. A previous plan to build 80 homes on 38 acres failed in 2007 after locals in Radnor Township complained.

Disputes: People living in the town of Radnor are unhappy that the land surrounding the property is being divided up and sold off in portions .

She was an avid fundraiser and a glamorous member of the upper echelons of society, mingling with aristocrats and royalty. She held lavish parties at Ardrossan which were attended by celebrities including Cole Porter and Katharine Hepburn - who later paid tribute to her on screen after buying the film rights to play The Philadelphia Story. The classic comedy starred Hepburn along with Cary Grant and James Stewart. It tells the story of Lord (Hepburn), a glittering socialite whose plans to marry her second husband become entangled when her first husband (Grant) and a tabloid journalist (Stewart) arrive on the scene. It won two Oscars and was later remade into the 1956 musical High Society starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Louis Armstrong.

America was just narrowly shut out of the top five places, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's Better Life Index, which ranked the U.S. in sixth place. Sweden, Canada, Norway and Switzerland all beat out the U.S., as Denmark, the Netherlands, Iceland and the U.K. filled out the rest of the top ten. Winner: Australia is the best place in the world to live and work, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . The survey featured 11 different criteria for each country, including income, jobs, housing and health. Overall, Americans rank in the middle of most of the surveyed countries on issues like safety, civic engagement, the environment and the all-encompassing life satisfaction. 1.

One of the categories where the U.S. ranked among the worst countries was work-life balance, as average Americans work 1,787 hours per year as opposed to the OECD average of 1,776 hours per year. That said, the hard work seems to be paying off on the whole as the household net-adjusted income for Americans is $38,001, which is significantly higher than the overall survey average of $23,047 per year. Other criteria found that Americans are more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average, with 83 per cent of people saying they have more positive experiences in an average day. The vast majority- 90 per cent of Americans- believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need, in line with the OECD average.

The two areas where Americans beat Austrialians was in income and surprisingly they even managed to get a lower score when it came to the work-life balance. In general, Australians are more satisfied with their lives than the OECD average, with 84 per cent of people saying they have more positive experiences in an average day. Positive feelings were qualified as feelings of rest, pride in accomplishment, and general enjoyment. On the opposite end of the spectrum, negative feelings included ones of pain, worry, sadness, and boredom.

And 94 per cent of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need, higher than the OECD average of 90 per cent. The life expectancy is an additional two years in Australia, at 82 years. Despite the satisfaction rating, almost 14 per cent of employees work very long hours, much higher than the OECD average of 9 per cent, with 21 of men working very long hours compared with just 6 per cent for women. Number 10: In Britain, 95 per cent of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in time of need . In Britain, the survey shows the average household net-adjusted disposable income is higher than the OECD average, but there is a considerable gap between the richest and poorest – the top 20 per cent of the population earn nearly six times as much as the bottom 20 per cent. In terms of employment, about 12 per cent of employees work very long hours, more than the OECD average of 9 per cent - 18 per cent of men work very long hours compared with just 6 per cent for women. Three quarters of adults aged 25-64 have earned the equivalent of a secondary school degree, close to the OECD average of 74 per cent.

The operator of a fireworks business in Washington state is accused of strapping an explosive to his dog and blowing up the animal because an ex-girlfriend had ‘put the devil in it,’ according to police. Christopher Dillingham, 45, of Stevenson, ranted at deputies responding to reports of a blast that he was preparing for ‘the Rapture’ as he tossed a couch and other household items onto his lawn early Sunday morning, Deputy Jordan Ejde wrote in an affidavit. Dillingham was held on $500,000 bail after he appeared in court Monday to face two counts of reckless endangerment and one count of possessing an explosive device for an unlawful purpose. Gristly: Christopher Dillingham (left), 45, is accused of detonating an explosive attached to the collar of his pet Labrador, Cabela (right) Skamania County Prosecutor Adam Kick said . his office has yet to charges the suspect with animal cruelty because . there is no evidence that the dog suffered before death. Dillingham's next court appearance is scheduled for August 15. Deputies responded to reports from . neighbors of a loud explosion at 3.45am Sunday and found the decapitated . yellow Labrador on the man's property in a semi-rural area on the . outskirts of Stevenson, Undersheriff Dave Cox said. Dillingham's son and his friend were at home during the gruesome incident, but were not hurt in the exposition. They later fled to an uncle’s home nearby, OregonLive reported. Explosion: Dillingham set off the blast that killed his dog in the yard of his Stevenson, Washington, home . Ravings: Dillingham was ranting about the end of the world as he was tossing furniture and other items out the window . When they arrived on the scene in the 2000 block of Loop road, officials discovered the remains of the pooch named Cabela scattered about Dillingham's yard. According to Ejde's affidavit, Dillingham, who owns a fireworks business called Thundershack, told deputies he made the device from black powder taken from firecrackers. Dillingham reportedly said he distracted Cabela with treats as he put the device on the pet, which had been given to him by an ex-girlfriend. Cox said investigators believe the device was attached to the large dog's collar. The undersheriff said the dog died instantly. During questioning, the man reportedly told investigators that the 'world is going to end' because of a nuclear strike he had been preparing. When asked why he was tossing household items and coins out the window, the 45-year-old said he believed the 'souls of demons' were trapped inside metal objects in his home. In court: The man is facing charges of reckless endangerment and possessing an explosive device, but not animal cruelty because it appears that the dog did not suffer since she was killed on the spot . The Metro bomb squad from Vancouver and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives assisted deputies in the investigation. There have been conflicting reports in local news media regarding the history of the slain dog. According to KOIN News, a man by the name Sam Mims gave the pooch to his cousin, Dillingham’s girlfriend, because his landlord did not allow to keep pets. However, in an emotional interview with the station KOMO News, a man by the name Ty Freemantle claimed that he had owned Cabela ever since she was six weeks old when he bought her off Craigslist. Freemantle tearfully recalled how six . months ago, he handed over his beloved pet to Dillingham before moving . to another city after a mutual friend had reassured him that the pet . will be in good hands. Tragic tale: Dillingham reportedly got the dog just six months ago, when her previous owner moved to another city . Legal woes: Dillingham's history of arrests stretches back to 1993 involving drunken driving charges . In a phone interview with MailOnline Tuesday, Undersheriff Cox was unable to clarify who had been Cabela’s owner prior to Dillingham. A prosecutor is in the process of reviewing the case to determine whether to charge Dillingham with animal cruelty charges. Dillingham has had numerous run-ins with the law, beginning in 1993 when he was picked up on a charge of unauthorized use of a vehicle. According to reports, the 45-year-old father also has a history of domestic violence.","Christopher Dillingham, 45, not charged with animal cruelty because officials say the dog, Cabela, died at once and didn't suffer .

A former amateur racing driver yesterday claimed that he was ‘hypnotised’ into falling in love with a petite blonde psychic who read his palm - after spending £12,000 on her during a ten-month affair. Father-of-two Jim Gotobed, 50, of Romford, Essex, divorced his wife following the affair - and told a court that he came out of each Tarot session ‘more deeply in love’ with psychic Tracie Long, 48. The story unravelled at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court as Mr Gotobed - who had divorced Josie, his wife of 25 years - was cleared of criminal activity after being accused of harassing the psychic. Court hearing: Jim Gotobed (right), 50, of Romford, Essex, divorced his wife following the affair - and told a court that he came out of each Tarot session 'more deeply in love' with psychic Tracie Long (left), 48 . Happier times: Miss Long (left) and Mr Gotobed are pictured (right) last October at a farmhouse at Brentwood, Essex, which Mr Gotobed rented for them to live in . Ms Long, of Chelmsford, had accused . him of repeatedly texting her, writing to her parents, speaking to a . local newspaper, reporting her to the Spiritual Workers Association and . threatening to kill her. But . the magistrates said they believed Mr Gotobed's version of events, . saying Ms Long had been ‘evasive’ in her testimony, whereas Mr Gotobed . had been ‘honest, straightforward and convincing’. After the day-long trial at the . magistrates' court, Mr Gotobed admitted he had been ‘gullible’, saying: . ‘I realise now she was after my money and am over her because of what . she has done.’ He had known . the psychic 30 years earlier and their friendship was rekindled through . Facebook. Mr Gotobed said that Ms Long began doing Tarot readings for . him - although she denied that in court. On the first reading of the cards she . spoke of a ‘dark force about him’, he told the court, adding that she . had said it related to his marriage and that he should ‘get a quick . divorce’. Unhappy: Ms Long (right) had accused Mr Gotobed (left) of repeatedly texting her, writing to her parents, speaking to a local newspaper, reporting her to the Spiritual Workers Association and threatening to kill her . Motor: The MG Midget which Mr Gotobed used to race all over the country. It was his pride and joy and he sold it on the advice of his Ms Long, a court heard . He told the court his readings ‘showed a need for money.’ As a result he sold his prized racing car, other cars, his guns and guitars. He said he did this because she said he should ‘unburden himself’. Mr Gotobed also arranged for his wages to be paid into her account and then handed in his notice at an insulation firm in Barking, east London, after she told him he wasn't earning enough. Asked if his decisions were of his own free will, Mr Gotobed told magistrates: ‘There were things I did which people know I would never have done. I would never have got divorced. I got divorced.’ He said she had told him their future . was predicted in the cards and that he would marry her by Christmas last . year.

In her evidence, Ms Long, who also does readings by email and phone, claimed Mr Gotobed had thrown her out of his home last October. She said she then made it clear she was no longer interested and told him to stop contacting her, but he carried on trying to win her back. She described his love as ‘obsessed’. Ms Long said she felt anxious as he seemed erratic. She added that she was embarrassed he had complained to the spiritualist association and the local paper had run an article about her.

Consumers might need to buy bigger and faster mobile price plans in order to feed data-hungry devices like Google Glass, according to experts. American technology guru Brian Fung predicts wearable devices like Google Glass will be expensive for consumers as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by wireless carriers and users will have to upgrade their data plans. It is believed the device will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity. American technology guru Brian Fung predicts wearable devices like Google Glass (pictured) will be expensive as the hardware will probably not be subsidised by wireless carriers and consumers will have to upgrade their data plans . But it could also spark an increase in . the cost of data plans - possibly for all consumers even if they are not . taking advantage of the new technology. Google glass connects to the internet by . linking to the web via a mobile phone or tablet's data plan - otherwise . known as tethering - to create a mobile hotspot, The Washington Post reported. Different networks have various rules and price plans for tethering, with many offering 'bolt-on' packages, such as Orange's £3 bolt-no for 30MB of data. Some all-inclusive mobile contracts include tethering in the UK, such as Three's One Plan, while others offer the service in specific bundles. Mr Fung believes that just as the way we used to pay for access to the internet changed about a decade ago, the introduction of wearable technology - with its huge demand for data - will shake up the current way tethering is used and paid for. In the way that Wi-Fi made it possible to tether a number of computers to the same internet account, mobile phone providers will sell tetherable mobile broadband, he predicted. However, no-one is sure how much mobile tethering goes on today. Google glass connects to the internet by linking to the web via a mobile phone or tablet's data plan - otherwise known as tethering. Different networks have various charges for using tethering. But a tech expert believes the introduction of wearable technology will shake up the current way tethering is used and paid for . Source: Google . If 10 per cent of Americans buy into . Google Glass when it launches to the public, as they have hinted they . might, tethering could be changed forever and go from a handy extra . feature to an essential requirement in order to get Google Glass to work . as advertised, Mr Fung said. It is thought that this tethering service could be a massive source of income for mobile companies in the future. Gregory Rosston, a Stanford researcher and the former deputy chief economist of the FCC, told The Washington Post that if 35 million Americans did go out and buy Google Glass, it would put a huge strain on the country's mobile infrastructure. He said that the iPhone was a game-changer as it forced mobile carriers to build more data capacity and pushed people to pay for the data they used. 'I think if Google Glass takes off, two similar things will happen,' he said. Mr Fung believes it is hard to predict whether Google Glass will use up more data than an average smartphone. However he calculates a five minute video clip recorded on the new device could need anywhere between  2.6 MB and 40.6 MB to download the clip to YouTube or stream the video depending on the quality of the film. It is believed Google Glass will put a huge burden on internet infrastructure and force companies to increase capacity but it could also spark an increase in the cost of data plans - possibly for all consumers even if they are not taking advantage of the new technology . The way people use the device to tell . stories and watch other people's content may differ from what we expect, . but their creative output will require an internet connection. Mr Rosston told The Washington Post other wearable devices like Apple's watch could become the ultimate tethered device, but if a number of options take off at once, it could have a compound effect on a country's internet infrastructure. One strategy could be to siphon mobile data traffic off to Wi-Fi. One study suggests that 46 per cent of data will be shunted over to Wi-Fi instead of using 3G and 4G networks by 2017, but this percentage might have to increase if tethered devices like Google Glass take off. He told the American newspaper: 'We don’t know if it’s Google Glass that’s going to be the one to take off, or Apple’s iGlass, if you’ll excuse the expression. 'But whatever it is . . . they either try to increase capacity or they try and take advantage of [the lack of supply] and raise prices. I think they’ll do both.'","Google glass connects to the internet by .

The mightiest warship of her day has lain for 269 years on the seabed of the Western English Channel, a site too deep and dangerous for all but specialist divers with the most sophisticated technology. Now the historic HMS Victory can be seen for the first time in unprecedented detail with the launch of the first ever 'virtual dive', MailOnline can reveal. Unique film footage on www.victory1744.org shows the wreck of the most important UK vessel after the Mary Rose, the 16th-century English warship. Scroll down for video . Unique view: Visitors to the site are able to watch a video tour of the historic ship's remains, including these two bronze cannons . World first: Viewers may marvel at several of the heavy bronze cannons that contributed to the sinking of the HMS Victory . The . deep-sea site is almost inaccessible at 75 metres down, well beyond . safe diving depths, and made all the more hazardous by changing tides . and strong currents.

Built with three decks, she carried up to 110 bronze cannon. Returning . home from a successful mission against the French in Lisbon and .

Remains: One of 110 cannons thought to be aboard the HMS Victory lies in the seabed, 75 meters below the surface of the English channel . Break through: Until now, the site had only been explored by divers with specialist technology . Remains washed up on the Channel Isles had long ago led to the assumption that this English flagship had been lost somewhere on the Casquets, off Alderney. But this great maritime mystery was solved when Odyssey Marine Exploration – leading specialists in deep-sea archaeological research – discovered that she actually lay 80 kilometres southeast of Plymouth. Odyssey’s previous discoveries include an American Civil War shipwreck, from which it recovered over 50,000 coins and 14,000 artifacts. It located the Victory wreck while . conducting an extensive archaeological survey across 4,700 square . nautical miles in the Western English Channel using side-scan sonar and . magnetometry. Its subsequent . study of the wreck revealed that Victory’s demise was not caused by . dangerous rocks or the failure of the Alderney lighthouse keeper to keep . the fire burning, as believed at the time. Instead, the ship’s top-heavy weight and . instability caused by heavy guns and possibly rotting timbers, made it . all the more vulnerable in a storm. Storm: The loss of the HMS Victory, dramatically painted by 18th Century artist Peter Monamy . Unseen: The HMS Victory 1744 website, left, hosts the tour of the HMS Victory, illustrated right . Odyssey says that footage of the entire shipwreck site has never been seen before. Taken with a ROV - Remotely Operated Vehicle robot - driven from a research ship anchored on the surface, the footage shows a site scattered with dozens of bronze cannon, hull remains, wood and bronze rigging, anchors and the ship’s rudder. The HMS Victory was the . world’s most powerful ships when she disappeared beneath the waves in 1744. Crewed by over a thousand men including noted Navy Admiral Sir John Balchen, the Victory was returning home from a successful mission against the French in Lisbon and . Gibraltar when, on October 5, she hit a ferocious storm. It is thought that the heaviness of the ship, which had three decks and carried up to 110 bronze cannon, contributed to the sinking of the vessel. Along with the cannon collection, . some believe the ship was carrying a large quantity of gold coins, which would now be worth a reported £500 million. The ship's location remained a mystery for hundreds of years, despite numerous searches. But in 2008, an American crew discovered the ship nearly 65 miles from where the ship was historically believed to have . been wrecked. A battered copper kettle used to cook fish and meat lies partly submerged in the sand, while an intact glass bottle can be seen alongside a resting monk fish. But Odyssey also warns that the site is at risk as the area is heavily trafficked by fishing trawlers, lobster-crab potters and scallop dredges, dragging heavy gear across the seabed. One three-ton bronze cannon was dragged 233metres away from the wreck mound. Dr Sean Kingsley, director of Wreck Watch International, a London-based consultancy specialising in global maritime heritage, said: 'The wreck site is more dangerous now than the day a storm swallowed Victory. 'Distance from shore, shipping traffic, fishing trawlers raking the seabed and ever-changing currents make access perilous. 'Because people can’t appreciate the Victory by scuba diving, the virtual trail safely brings the site to the people. 'Now everyone can share the warship’s deep-sea wonders.' The Victory site is owned by the Maritime Heritage Foundation after its remains were gifted to it by the Ministry of Defence. Odyssey has submitted detailed plans to the Government for the recording and recovery of artifacts at risk. The Victory Shipwreck Project would be the first deep-sea wreck excavation conducted entirely by remote technology off the British Isles.","HMS Victory, .

Yellowstone National Park's Steamboat Geyser went off for the first time in eight years on Wednesday evening, drenching delighted visitors with its unexpected display. The eruption went on for nine minutes from 7:30pm and blasted water and steam up to 300 feet in the air. The geyser continued to emit plumes of steam high into the sky throughout the night. Steamboat is the most fickle of the Wyoming park's roughly 500 geysers, and no one knows when it's going to erupt next. Holy grail: Among the park's rangers, Steamboat is the holy grail of geysers, its unpredictability making its eruptions highly anticipated . The park's most famous geyser, Old Faithful, is the antithesis of Steamboat, which is at once the world's tallest and least reliable geyser. In 1969, Steamboat went off 29 times. Once, it stood quiet and silent for 50 years, lying dormant between 1911 and 1961. It can be months or years between blasts, making its eruptions highly anticipated. Old Faithful, on the other hand, . erupts predictably, 91 minutes after a blast longer than two-and-a-half . minute blast, or 65 minutes after a blast shorter than two-and-a-half . minutes, and has been called the most predictable geographical feature . on Earth. So why are the two geysers in the same park so different? Lucky: Only around 30 to 40 visitors to the park were around to witness Steamboat shooting 300-foot columns of water and steam into the air . Like clockwork: Old Faithful erupting in 1912 as onlookers sit down for the show . Scientists conducting studies with remote-sensing instruments that monitor underground activity still aren't sure what motivates Steamboat's eruptions. 'Most geysers are non-predictable,' Shaul Hurwitz told LiveScience. 'Those that are predictable, like Old Faithful, are quite rare.' Geologists believe that geysers like Old Faithful have a narrow conduit that leads from an underground cavern. Before it erupts, water and steam gather in the cavern and when the pressure becomes too great, steam shoots water through the conduit and out into the air. Geysers are hot springs that are characterized by their intermittent eruptions of water and steam. They are among the most rare natural phenomena on Earth. Geologic conditions, such as hot springs and volcanoes, must be present for geysers to exist. Most of the world's geysers are spread among five countries: . Park geologist Hank Heasler said that Yellowstone's geysers are fed by an underground plumbing network where the park's volcano heats the water and forces it to the surface. So far, however, the force that decides that it's showtime for Steamboat has eluded geologists. They've tried to link Steamboat's eruptions to external forces, such as earthquakes, but no link has been evident. 'We are still searching for clues for what would make it behave as it [does],' Hurwitz said. 'As of now, we don't know.' Steamboat's last blast was in 2005. Park officials said only about 30 to 40 people saw Wednesday's eruption, who reported hearing a roar and feeling the ground shake before the eruption.

Venting: The Steamboat Geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, erupting on June 7, 2003 .

'Everybody was frantic, taking pictures. People were running down there trying to get to it before it went away, and park rangers were running around trying to gather up people so they didn't get too close.'","Steamboat Geyser erupted on Wednesday for the first time since 2005 .

American plans for military strikes on Syria were in disarray last night after Russia seized on a blunder from US Secretary of State John Kerry. Mr Kerry suggested the Syrian tyrant could prevent international military action against his country by giving up his chemical weapons arsenal. He caused further confusion in Washington by promising any missile strikes that may take place would be ‘unbelievably small’. Scroll down for video .

Mr Kerry’s intervention as a device to delay. Talks: Russia offered to start work 'immediately' to put Assad's poison gas stocks under 'international control' after Kerry's comments .

The White House refused to say whether they agreed the line with . the secretary of state but one administration official told CNN it was . ‘a major goof’. Asked what . President Assad could do to avoid military action, Mr Kerry said: ‘He . can turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the . international community in the next week.’ He hastily added: ‘He isn’t about to do it and it can’t be done, obviously.’ Seeking . to assuage critics of military intervention, the US Secretary of State . insisted: ‘We are not talking about war.

'We . will be able to hold Bashar Assad accountable without engaging in troops . on the ground or any prolonged kind of effort in a very limited, very . targeted, very short-term effort.’ Confusing: Kerry, right, also said any missile strike by the U.S. would be 'unbelievably small' Allies: Tyrant Bashar al-Assad, left, passed his . thanks on to Russian President Vladimir Putin for his ongoing support . in the G20 against a US led bid to launch military action against Syria . Within . hours, Russia seized on the idea. The country’s foreign minister Sergei . Lavrov, following talks in Moscow with his Syrian counterpart Walid . al-Moallem, said: ‘If the establishment of international control over . chemical weapons in that country would allow avoiding strikes, we will . immediately start working with Damascus. ‘We . are calling on the Syrian leadership to not only agree on placing . chemical weapons storage sites under international control, but also on . its subsequent destruction and fully joining the treaty on prohibition . of chemical weapons.’ Mr . al-Moallem said that Syria ‘welcomes Russia’s initiative, based on the .

Speaking to CBS, . Assad warned that if Mr Obama decides to launch military strikes, the . US and its allies that, in retaliation: ‘You should expect everything.

He replied: 'He can turn over every single bit of his chemical weapons to the international community in the next week.' He added: 'He isn't about to do it and it can't be done, obviously.' Mr Kerry used the opportunity to redouble his attacks on Assad, saying that the Syrian president's credibility was in question.

Sue Cull was bitten while police were hunting for the snake after it went missing near her house in South Wales. 'It is incredible - who would think you would get attacked by a python in Swansea,' she said. Putting on a brave face: Sue Cull of Swansea in hospital after she was bitten on the legs by a python on her way home from the pub . The 47-year-old took a short cut across the grass near to where she lived when she suddenly felt pain in her shins, and thought she'd walked through stinging nettles. Bite: Sue shows the puncture wounds she received on her shin, which measure 3ins across . But when she arrived home, she noticed blood streaming from both legs - and after desperately trying to stop the flow from 3ins-wide puncture wounds, called an ambulance. 'At first I thought the pain was just stinging nettles. But looked down to see blood streaming onto my shoes. 'I had no idea it was a snake because it was dark. I would have been scared out of my life if I had seen it. 'When I came back home my partner asked: ""Have you fallen over and why are you bleeding?"". 'I grabbed the first aid kit but the bandage didn't stop the blood at all - the left leg was worst than the right.' Sue called an ambulance and paramedics told her she had been bitten by a snake, which had escaped from a nearby house in the Dyfatty suburb of Swansea. She said: 'They said it was a snake bite. I couldn't believe my ears.' She treated at nearby Morriston Hospital, Swansea, where doctors examined her bites. They phoned the Medical Reptile Unit in London which told them to measure the bite -and they then confirmed it was a python. The victim said: 'I couldn't get warm and I was shaking. My face started to swell up. 'I was put on a drip and I stayed overnight in hospital - thankfully, I've made a full recovery.' Recovering: Ms Cull admits that getting bitten by a giant snake is the last thing you'd expect to happen in Swansea . Police confirmed they received a report of pet python going missing from a home in Swansea. But a spokesman said the reptile was discovered in a pipe at the owner's property - and was safely back in its box. Pythons' bites are not poisonous but kill their prey by constricting them. A spokesman for the Reptile Centre in Cardiff said: 'It is possible that she had an allergic reaction to the bite. Any snake may well bite if it is frightened - but the bite alone with not kill you.'

Elmore Leonard, the beloved crime novelist whose acclaimed best-sellers and the movies made from them chronicled the violent deaths of many a thug and con man, has died. Leonard, winner of an honorary National Book Award in 2012, died Tuesday morning at his home in Bloomfield Township, a suburb of Detroit, from complications of a stroke. His researcher Gregg Sutter announced the 87-year-old’s death and said that he was surrounded by family when he died. His millions of fans, from bellhops to Saul Bellow, made all his books since 'Glitz' (1985) best-sellers. When they flocked to watch John Travolta in the movie version of 'Get Shorty' in 1995, its author became the darling of Hollywood's hippest directors. And book critics and literary lions, prone to dismiss crime novels as mere entertainments, competed for adjectives to praise him. Scroll down for video . Passed on: Elmore Leonard, pictured here in September 2012, died on Tuesday due to complications from a stroke . His more than 40 novels were populated by pathetic schemers, clever conmen and casual killers. Each was characterized by moral . ambivalence about crime, black humor and wickedly acute depictions of . human nature: the greedy dreams of Armand Degas in 'Killshot,' the . wisecracking cool of Chili Palmer in 'Get Shorty,' Jack Belmont's lust . for notoriety in 'The Hot Kid.' 3:10 to Yuma                     Get ShortyThe Big Bounce               TouchStick                                       Jackie Brown52 Pickup                            Out of Sight . 'When something sounds like writing, I rewrite it,' Leonard often said; and critics adored the flawlessly unadorned, colloquial style. As author Ann Arensberg put it in a New York Times book review, 'I didn't know it was possible to be as good as Elmore Leonard.' Leonard spent much of his childhood in Detroit and set many of his novels in the city. Others were set in Miami near his North Palm Beach, Florida, vacation home. One remarkable thing about Leonard's talent is how long it took the world to notice. He didn't have a best-seller until his 60th year, and few critics took him seriously before the 1990s. He had some minor successes in the 1950s and '60s in writing Western stories and novels, a couple of which were made into movies. But when interest in the Western dried up, he turned to writing scripts for educational and industrial films while trying his hand at another genre: crime novels. Old school: Leonard became best known for his crime novels that were adapted for films, like Get Shorty, £:10 to Yuma, and Out of Sight . The first, 'The Big Bounce,' was rejected 84 times before it was published as a paperback in 1969. Hollywood came calling again, paying $50,000 for the rights and turning it into a movie starring Ryan O'Neal, that even Leonard called 'terrible.' He followed up with several more well-written, fast-paced crime novels, including 'Swag' (1976). Leonard was already following the advice he would later give to young writers: 'Try to leave out the parts that people skip.' In 1978, he was commissioned to write an article about the Detroit Police Department. He shadowed the cops for nearly three months. Starting with 'City Primeval' in 1980, his crime novels gained a new authenticity, with quirky but believable characters and crisp, slangy dialogue. But sales remained light. Donald I. Fine, an editor at Arbor House, thought they deserved better and promised to put the muscle of his publicity department behind them. He delivered; and in 1985, 'Glitz,' a stylish novel of vengeance set in Atlantic City, became Leonard's first best-seller. Leonard never looked back. Hollywood rediscovered him, churning out a succession of bad movies including the humorless '51 Pick-up' starring Roy Scheider. Its director, John Frankenheimer, failed to capture the sensibilities of Leonard's work, and his ear missed the clever dialogue. It took Barry Sonnenfeld to finally show Hollywood how to turn a Leonard novel into a really good movie. 'Get Shorty' was the first to feel and sound like an Elmore Leonard novel. Back in the day: Leonard started his career in advertising but then turned to crime writing, and while he was not initially met with much success, his later work became fodder for Hollywood (pictured in 1983) Then Quentin Tarantino took a turn with 'Rum Punch,' turning it into 'Jackie Brown,' a campy, Blaxploitation-style film starring Pam Grier. But Steven Soderbergh stayed faithful to Leonard's story and dialogue with 'Out of Sight.' Writing well into his 80s, Leonard's writing process remained the same. He settled in at his home office in Bloomfield Township, Michigan, around 10 a.m. behind a desk covered with stacks of paper and books. He lit a cigarette, took a drag and set about to writing — longhand, of course — on the 63-page unlined yellow pads that were custom-made for him. When he finished a page, Leonard transferred the words onto a separate piece of paper using an electric typewriter. He tried to complete between three and five pages by the time his workday ended at 6 p.m. 'Well, you've got to put in the time if you want to write a book,' Leonard told The Associated Press in 2010 of the shift work that was befitting of his hometown's standing as the nation's automotive capital. Leonard had sold his first story, 'Trail of the Apache,' in 1951 and followed with 30 more for such magazines as 'Dime Western,' earning 2 or 3 cents a word. At the time, he was working in advertising, but rose early to work on his fiction before trudging off to write Chevrolet ads. One story, '3:10 to Yuma,' became a noted 1956 movie starring Glenn Ford, and 'The Captives' was made into a film the same year called 'The Tall T.' But the small windfall wasn't enough for Leonard to quit his day job. ('3:10 to Yuma' was remade in 2007, starring Russell Crowe.) His first novel, 'The Bounty Hunters,' was published in 1953, and he wrote four more in the next eight years. One of them, 'Hombre,' about a white man raised by Apaches, was a breakthrough for the struggling young writer. When 20th Century Fox bought the rights for $10,000 in 1967, he quit the ad business to write full time. Working til the end: Leonard (left) worked on the television show 'Justified' starring Timothy Olyphant (center) 'Hombre' became a pretty good movie starring Paul Newman, and the book was named one of the greatest Westerns of all time by the Western Writers of America. Soon, another Leonard Western, 'Valdez Is Coming,' became a star vehicle for Burt Lancaster. But as the 1960s ended, the market for Westerns fizzled. Leonard wrote five more, but they sold poorly, and Hollywood had lost interest. Leonard was born in New Orleans on October 11, 1925, the son of General Motors executive Elmore John Leonard and his wife, Flora. The family settled near Detroit when young Elmore was 10. The tough, undersized young man played quarterback in high school and earned the nickname 'Dutch,' after Emil 'Dutch' Leonard, a knuckleball pitcher of the day. The ballplayer's card sat for years in the writer's study on one of the shelves lined with copies of his books. After serving in the Navy during World War II, he majored in English at the University of Detroit. He started writing copy for an advertising agency before his graduation in 1950. He married three times: to the late Beverly Cline in 1949, the late Joan Shepard in 1979 and, at the age of 68, to Christine Kent in 1993. He had five children, all from his first marriage. His son, Peter, followed in his father's path, going into advertising for years before achieving his own success as a novelist with his 2008 debut, 'Quiver.' In 2012, after learning he was to become a National Book Award lifetime achievement recipient, Leonard said he had no intention of ending his life's work. 'I probably won't quit until I just quit everything — quit my life — because it's all I know how to do,' he told the AP at the time. 'And it's fun. I do have fun writing, and a long time ago, I told myself, 'You got to have fun at this, or it'll drive you nuts.''","Author Elmore Leonard made his name writing books that became blockbusters like Out of Sight, Jackie Brown and Get Shorty .

A teenager sent a boastful text message to a girlfriend moments after stabbing a former friend to death. Moments after killing Michael Graham, 19, Macauley Jenkinson, 16, sent a text message that said 'Stabbed Angel [Michael's nickname] 12 times. Love you loads. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss'. Jenkinson had previously told the girlfriend, who was 14, that he and Mr Graham were heading for a showdown after falling out because Mr Graham had mocked him about her age. Teesside Crown Court was told that the attack was carried out with such stealth that people nearby did not initially realise that Mr Graham had been stabbed. Jenkinson was today sentenced to life in prison with a minimum term of 16 years following the fight outside an arcade in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. Details of the tragedy emerged as an order on identifying Jenkinson was lifted after he was convicted of murder and wounding following a trial. Frenzied attack: Macauley Jenkinson, now 17, (right) stabbed Michael Graham (left) in the back before he sent text message, 'Stabbed Angel 12 times. Love you loads,' to a girlfriend . Mr Graham was targeted in the street by a 'hate club' of youngsters who had a mutual dislike of him. Mr Graham had previously been friends with Jenkinson, but when Jenkinson started a relationship with a 14-year-old girl, they fell out. Sentencing him, Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC described Jenkinson as a 'coward'. Mr Graham began mocking Jenkinson about the age gap and the younger man was so enraged by the taunts he bought a flick knife and warned a girlfriend he was ‘heading for a showdown with him’. Tim Roberts QC, prosecuting said: ‘He said he was prepared to stab him and that Michael Graham deserved to die.’ The violence erupted outside Olympia arcade in Scarborough at around 11.30pm on April 13 this year after Mr Graham and another teenager, aged 17, were surrounded by Jenkinson and seven of his friends. 'Defenceless': A memorial for Mr Graham who died at the scene of the attack after he was targeted by Jenkinson and seven of his friends outside a seaside arcade . One of the group began to attack him but as the victim fought back, Jenkinson intervened and stabbed him in the back. Mr Graham tried to place his attacker in a head lock then collapsed as the gang fled. It emerged the attack was so ferocious, Jenkinson accidentally cut himself as he pushed the handle so hard into the victim’s body that his hand slipped onto the blade. Mr Roberts added: ‘The blows were inflicted with such rapidity and stealth that it was not obvious to onlookers that a weapon was being used at all. ‘It is a measure of the calculation with which this crime was committed that the defendant seems actually to have counted in his head each thrust of the knife at the time because afterwards he was to text several friends with the information that he had stabbed Angel 12 times.’ Judge Simon Bourne-Arton QC told him: ‘Michael Graham described you as a coward and a coward is what you are in fact. Cowardly attack: The court heard how Jenkinson inflicted the wounds on Mr Graham's back with such speed and stealth that many onlookers did not see the weapon used at all . ‘You waited until he was defenceless before carrying out that attack on him. You stabbed him with ferocity. ‘You were glad when you announced to your friends that he deserved to die. You showed not one jot of sadness or regret. You are a dangerous young man.’ Detective Chief Inspector Maria Taylor, of North Yorkshire Police said after the case: ‘This is an extremely tragic case which has left a young man dead and another young man facing up to a considerable length of time in prison. ‘Michael had his whole life in front of him and to be murdered in this brutal and senseless manner has left his family and friends devastated. ‘Macauley Jenkinson attacked Michael in such and aggressive and violent manner that there is little doubt that he intended to do him serious harm on the night that he killed him. ‘Stabbing him in the back gave Michael no chance of defending himself and Jenkinson has to live with the fact that his cowardly attack has robbed a family of one of their loved ones.’ In a statement Mr Graham’s family said: ‘Our lives have been shattered. Not only have we lost a son, grandson, brother, nephew and a dad, we have also lost a friend who loved his family and was always there for us when we needed him, no matter what. ‘He was a good friend to many and we would especially like to thank one of his best friends who was with him at the end. It is a great comfort for us to know that Mickey was with such a close friend.’","Macauley Jenkinson was sentenced to life imprisonment for the attack .

Experts have for the first time shown that ‘active and engaged television viewing’ does help to speed up a change in language. The study looked at how watching the television soap EastEnders is altering certain features of the Scottish accent. Experts have for the first time shown that 'active and engaged television viewing' does help to speed up a change in language. Language experts at the University of Glasgow found two particular features of pronunciation typically associated with London English that were becoming increasingly apparent in the Glaswegian dialect among people who regularly watched the television soap opera. 'Our study shows that the programmes that we watch on television can help to accelerate changes in aspects of language which are also well below the level of conscious awareness,' said study leader Jane Stuart-Smith, professor of phonetics at the University of Glasgow, . In particular, this study was investigating why certain linguistic factors that are normally found within the Cockney dialect in London were gradually entering into Glaswegian.

The study warned that Scottish viewers accents and dialect can be altered by watching Eastenders, but what words are particularly affected. Scots would imitate the likes of hard man Phil Mitchell by saying ‘f’ instead of ‘th’, while ‘l-vocalisation’ has also been adopted, in which the ‘l’ sound in certain words is dropped. For instance: . THING becomes 'FING' THINK becomes 'FINK' THANK becomes 'FANK' PEOPLE becomes 'PEOPOW' WALFORD becomes 'WOOWFORD' For instance, people would replace the letters TH with an F in words such as think and tooth. The . results show significant correlations between using these features with . strong emotional and psychological engagement by the viewers of this . programme. However, the . study also concluded that simply being exposed to television is not . sufficient to cause accent change; for someone’s speech to alter, they . need to regularly watch the show and become emotionally engaged with the . characters. The authors caution that television and other forms of popular media constitute only one of many factors that help accelerate language change and other, more powerful factors, such as social interaction between peers has a much stronger effect on language change in this study. Professor Stuart-Smith added: 'We don’t properly understand the mechanisms behind these changes, but we do see that the impact of the media is weaker than that of actual social interaction. 'We need many more studies of this kind in order to appreciate properly the influence of television and other popular media on language change.' The study, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, was published in the science journal Language.","Glaswegian viewers of Eastenders have picked features of a London accent .

Ed Miliband will today try to repair his battered relationship with union barons by insisting they are not ‘the enemy within’. The Labour leader, who owes his job to union voting power, will laud their 6.5million members as ‘the people who make Britain what it is’. But he will acknowledge that his party reforms could mean as few as one in ten union members who currently contribute to Labour coffers will do so in future. The changes will ensure members have to specifically opt in for their fees to go to the party. Friends: Ed Miliband's TUC speech on Tuesday will be centered around defending the British workers unions . Union leaders lambasted the plans at the weekend, saying Mr Miliband was a ‘schoolboy’ who lives in ‘cloud cuckoo land’. Addressing the TUC conference in Bournemouth today, Mr Miliband will launch a trenchant defence of trade unionism, rejecting Margaret Thatcher’s famous description of parts of the movement as enemies. He will accuse David Cameron of devaluing millions of ordinary workers through his attacks on the unions. ‘We have a Prime Minister who writes you and your members off,’ he is expected to say. ‘Who doesn’t just write you off, but oozes contempt for you from every pore. What does he say about you? He says your members are a threat to our economy. Back to the enemy within. ‘Six and a half million people in . Britain. Who teach our children, who look after the sick, who care for . the elderly, who build our homes, who keep our shops open morning, noon . and night. They’re not the enemy within. They’re the people who make . Britain what it is. United: Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna supports Ed Miliband's union reforms saying it is needed to take the 'big money out of politics' ‘How dare he? How dare he insult people, members of trade unions, as he does? How dare he write off whole sections of our society? ‘One Nation Conservatives, would be . turning in their graves if they could hear the nasty, divisive, . small-minded rhetoric of the leader of their once great party. 'We know from recent experience what happens to political leaders who write off whole sections of a country. ‘That’s . what Mitt Romney did when he talked about the 47 per cent of people who . would never vote for him. And look what happened to him.’ Under . the current system, union members automatically pay an annual fee of £3 . to the Labour party unless they specifically opt out – swelling party . funds by millions of pounds a year. Mr Miliband has unveiled plans to force trade unionists to actively opt in to the funding of Labour, with the reward that they will become full party members. He will tell delegates he believes his changes could see his party’s membership increase by 300,000 – a figure critics say will make him a hostage to fortune if it does not come about. But the target number is far fewer than the three million union members who  currently contribute to Labour coffers because they have not opted out. Labour is likely to head off the threat of a huge loss of funds by charging those who opt in more than the current £3 a year. Critics say the reforms could  actually strengthen the unions, because it could see them hanging on to more money designed for political campaigning. Mr Miliband will say: ‘It will be a . massive challenge for the Labour Party to reach out to your members in a . way that we have not done for many years and persuade them to be part . of what we do. ‘And, like anything that is hard, it is a risk. But the bigger risk is just saying let’s do it as we have always done it.’ Chuka . Umunna, who is Labour’s business spokesman, said it was important to . ‘take the big money out of politics’ even if it hit the party’s . finances. But backbencher Ian Lavery said Labour faced ruin and meltdown as a result of the ‘ill thought through’ reforms. Yesterday . Len McCluskey, general secretary of the powerful Unite union, called on . Mr Miliband to be even stronger in his defence of union links. ‘Trade unions . have always been a force for good in our society,’ he told a fringe . event at the conference. Instead of attacking, people should look to try . and unite the nation.’ n Mugs celebrating the death in April of Lady Thatcher are on sale at the TUC conference. Bearing . the legend ‘I Still Hate Thatcher’, they are available alongside . T-shirts and mugs with the slogan ‘Tories are Lower than Vermin’. Conservative politicians said the merchandise highlighted the nasty side of the Left. Conor Burns, MP for Bournemouth West, said: ‘She said they couldn’t forgive her because she won and they lost. She was right.’ Unions and Left-wing campaign groups are planning a national day of strikes and civil disobedience on Bonfire Night as part of their campaign against the Government’s austerity programme. Yesterday TUC delegates approved the call for unions to co-ordinate a programme of strikes. The union-backed People’s Assembly had already organised a protest, which was planned to take place on November 5. However this is now set to be directly supported by the unions themselves. Key workers – from nurses to firemen, teachers to postmen – could cause chaos if they decide to join the walkout. The plan raises the possibility of firemen and nurses striking on Guy Fawkes night, a move which could force people to cancel parties due to health and safety fears. Unions are legally allowed to ‘co-ordinate’ their strike action, or organise walkouts on the same day, as long as they have each successfully balloted their workforce on separate trade disputes. This is not the same as organising ‘sympathy strikes’ where workers walk out in support of other striking workers without having held a legal ballot. These were outlawed during the 1980s. Yesterday Unite’s executive director of policy Steve Turner said he believes the ‘yes’ vote has committed the union to a policy of ‘fighting back, industrially where possible’. He added: ‘But more than that, it commits us to organise a mass mobilisation.’","Ed Miliband to hold speech praising workers unions at TUC conference .

Ferdoush Hasan, 22, is accused of raping the 14-year-old in February, as well as a second charge . Two schoolgirls were raped at a house where vulnerable youngsters were taken advantage of by older men, a court heard. A 14-year-old victim was held down by Abu Sufian, 21, and Raabsan Khan, 19, while Ferdoush Hasan, 22, raped her last February, it is claimed. Newcastle Crown Court heard the sex attack was just days after another girl, who was also 14, was raped by Hasan alone. All three men, from South Shields, deny a joint charge of rape. Hasan denies a second, solo, charge. Prosecutor Anne Richardson told the court the attacks happened at a house where the trio, who were all students at South Tyneside College, were living. Miss Richardson told jurors: 'The crown’s case is these defendants took advantage of young girls who were vulnerable, who were drinking alcohol and smoking although underage and who came to the defendants’ house in order to have somewhere to do both of those things. 'No doubt you will take a fairly dim view of that and wonder what on earth young girls like this are doing in a house with men older than them, who speak little English and they had no friendly relations. 'The crown’s case is precisely because these girls were vulnerable and somewhat foolish and naive, the defendants felt they could act in the way the crown alleges. 'Basically, these girls could be used for sex and either they would not say anything for fear of getting into trouble or if they did say anything, the circumstances and background and how they came to be in the house would mean nobody would believe them.' The court heard the first attack was in early February last year when the alleged victim turned up at the house with friends after drinking a half litre of vodka. 14-year-old victim was held down by Abu Sufian (left), 21, and Raabsan Khan, 19, it is claimed . The girl told police 'all of the males were dark skinned, just lying on the beds in that room'. It is claimed Hasan led the girl to a room in a different part of the house from where everyone had gathered and raped her. Miss Richardson told the court: 'She was trying to push him off to no avail as her arms were pinned down by his hands.' The second alleged victim had also gone to the house with friends. Prosecutor Anne Richardson told Newcastle Crown Court the attacks happened at a house where the trio were living . Miss Richardson said: 'Effectively it was just somewhere to sit when it was cold.' It is claimed the girl, who refused the men’s offer of alcohol but was smoking cigarettes, ended up left alone with the trio during the visit. Miss Richardson said: 'Two of them grabbed hold of her arms, one on either side, and held her down.' All three men deny the claims against them. The trial continues.

Tragedy: Gabrielle Molina, 12, took her life after enduring relentless online bullying, family said . Police have confirmed that the 12-year-old girl who was found hanging in her Queen's home last week committed suicide because she was being bullied at school. Gabrielle Molina was a seventh grader at a local middle school where her classmates would call her a slut and a whore, her family said last week. Police commissioner Raymond Kelly recently confirmed that she left behind a suicide note that referred to the bullying. Cops are investigating whether Gabrielle was a victim of online harassment as well as face-to-face abuse and took two computers from her home. Gabby’s fellow students at Jean Nuzzi Intermediate School 109 in Queens who sent the messages are currently under investigation, according to the New York Daily News. Her 15-year-old sister . found the young girl hanging in the bedroom they shared at their home. She said later that Gabrielle told her about the bullying but made her swear to secrecy that she would not tell their mother. However her parents knew she had been having some trouble with bullies at school, including a fistfight earlier this spring. But the full extent has only emerged after her death. Her father George told the New York Post that . they called her a slut and a whore and told her she looked like she . suffered from Down syndrome - and that a recent breakup pushed her over . the edge. 'I was trying . to comfort her because she was getting weak,' said the distraught . father, who was seen sobbing outside the family's home on Thursday. 'I . wanted to make her happy.' She . was also teased after a sickening video entitled 'Gabby's Fight' appeared on YouTube, friends said. It showed the girl, who was barely 5ft tall, being beaten up by a former friend. George . Molina said that the school failed to address the incident quickly . enough and the footage was not immediately removed from the internet. Loss: Schoolmates bullied the young girl for her looks and because she self harmed, her friends said . After the fight a school counselor set up a meeting with Gabby's parents and between the girls, who made up, her mother said. Fellow students also knew that Gabby was self harming, and also teased her for that, friends told the New York Daily News. A close friend of Gabby's, Samantha Martin, told the Daily News that she cut herself a lot and some of it stemmed from problems at home. 'They had a lot of problems, they fought a lot,' she said. 'But she always seemed happy. (But) people knew she was cutting herself.' But Schools Chancellor Dennis Walcott . said that a preliminary investigation did not show any . serious bullying problems at the school - which its students denied. Gabby 'said that she wanted to move . schools because she felt uncomfortable. People wanted to jump her and . people bothered her,' her friend Samantha Martin, 12, told the Daily News. Scene: Gabby's sister returned to their family home on Wednesday and found the girl hanged in their room . Police questioned students at the school last Thursday but no charges have been brought. Gabby's mother said that the girl had not come down for school in the morning on Wednesday and that her door was locked, which was not unusual. Her grandparents knocked on the door throughout the day but, when she did not respond, they thought she was sleeping. But when her sister returned home from school, she forced the door open and found her body. In a letter she left behind, Gabby apologized to her family - her sister, 21-year-old brother Geonel, and parents George and Glenda - for taking her life. Family members said she had wanted to . become a lawyer. Her aunt, Irma Molina, told the Post that she . didn't understand the young girl's death. 'She's very quiet, very friendly,' she said. 'She wanted . to dance and sing. She’s so young.' 'Cruel': Students at her school, IS 109, posted a video of her being beaten up online, friends said . Neighbors also told the Post of their shock at the death of the young girl, whose family has lived at the home for nearly 10 years. 'They're just a wonderful family,' said a neighbor. 'It's just so sad. I don't know how they are going to get by.' The National Crime Prevention Council notes that 43 per cent of teens are subject to cyberbullying, and there have been recent, high profile cases. In one heartbreaking story, 15-year-old Felecia Garcia killed herself last October after fellow students allegedly posted a video of her having sex with members of the football team. She was branded a 'slut' and humiliated by her classmates online, eventually taking her life by jumping in front of a train.","Police confirm Gabrielle Molina left a note explaining she had been taunted .

A fan who caused outrage by appearing to taunt an alleged sexual assault victim on live television Saturday has explained his actions. A sign held up by a University of Michigan student behind the hosts of ESPN’s College Gameday pregame show that said ‘Hi Lizzy Seeberg’ sparked outrage and appeared to taunt a girl who accused a University of Notre Dame football player of sexual assaulting her Aug 31, 2010 only to have the allegations appear to have been ignored every step of the way. Ms Seeberg, 19, was a freshman at St Mary’s College, a small women’s only Catholic college literally across the street from the mighty Notre Dame. I did it: The person who held up the 'Hi Lizzy Seeberg' sign wrote a letter to Deadspin detailing his reasons behind the offensive gesture . Unable to live with the aftermath of the alleged sexual assault and Notre Dame’s refusal to even acknowledge her repeated attempts to engage the school in any manner, Ms Seeberg was found dead nine days later – the devout Catholic had overdosed on antidepressants prescribed to treat her anxiety and depression. The name of the player was never made public and the prestigious Catholic University appeared to have swept the whole thing under the rug, until addressing it earlier this year. Having seemingly dissipated into the ether of time, Lizzy Seeberg’s name, and alleged plight, weren’t on the minds of many people Saturday morning until a sign saying ‘Hi Lizzy Seeberg’ appeared behind College Gameday co-host Desmond Howard while discussing the Notre Dame-Michigan game being played later that day on UM’s campus. Mr Howard won the 1991 Heisman Trophy as college football’s greatest player for that season while at the University of Michigan. He did not react on-air to the sign, nor did anyone from ESPN. She loved country music: Pictured here at a Keith Urban concert, Lizzy Seeberg was buried in this hat after her suicide, according to reports . Reaction online to the sign was fast and furious, no one appeared to appreciate the apparent jab at a young girl who killed herself after allegedly being sexually assaulted. ‘just ""Hi Lizzy Seeberg."" So disrespectful. How does espn let that get on TV.’ (sic) tweeted @SutterHomeWhine. ‘Why the HELL would someone come to @CollegeGameDay with a ""Hi Lizzy Seeburg"" sign??!? #Tasteless #NoRespect #GrowUp,’ (sic) tweeted @skrayyy. The knee-jerk reaction ‘You stay classy, Michigan,' was also tweeted. Realizing his ‘statement’ was taken in a way he hadn’t intended, the student who held up the sign emailed Deadspin with an explanation. Calling the entire ordeal ‘unacceptable,’ the letter’s author writes that it’s ‘not just unacceptable in the eyes of college football fans, or whatever, but unacceptable in the eyes of society. Notre Dame is better than this. We, as a people, are better than this.’ Referencing the open secret that is not ‘ just a systemic culture of sexual assault that puts Notre Dame in a bad light. It's also the culture of dismissal and denial that pervades this university.’ ‘Notre Dame, since day one, has spent a lot of time covering this up. From the non-statements of a priest, to the anger of President Jenkins, Notre Dame hasn't officially said anything,’ he further wrote. The letter writer, now hitting his stride, notes the texts that Ms Seeburg received from a friend after telling of the alleged assault. A devout Catholic: Ms Seeberg was saving herself for marriage and said the football player's alleged demands for a lap dance left her uncomfortable and that she 'didn't know what to do' ‘Don't do anything you would regret,’ and ’Messing with notre dame football is a bad idea.’ (sic) ‘In short, [the sign] was done to show that she isn't forgotten, and that people do know and care about her story. Even if her school refuses to acknowledge it, there are some people out there who do,’ he wrote in the letter. With this being the last time Notre Dame will likely ever play at the University of Michigan’s ‘Big House,’ the student decided Saturday was the time to make his point. ‘We, at Michigan, will never have a chance to say anything to this disgraceful farce of a university again, after today. So, I did. Because that is the right thing to do,’ he wrote. ‘Everyone is important, Notre Dame. Everyone has value, Notre Dame. You don't treat a victim this way, or her family this way, Notre Dame. And if you don't, you will be called out on it,’ he later added. The student then urges people to donate to a mission set up by Ms Seeberg’s family in her honor, as a way to remember the endless charity work she did to help Chicago’s poor and less fortunate, or to her school’s legacy fund in her name – and says he donated $25, ‘the cost of a Michigan/Notre Dame gameday t-shirt.’ Ms Seeberg’s story took months to be made public after she accused a Notre Dame football player of the sexual assault. The allegations were detailed in a police report obtained by National Catholic Reporter. The aggressor: Notre Dame officials tried to paint her as the aggressor, saying her actions were those of a woman scorned . ‘He started sucking my neck and I started crying harder,’ Ms Seeberg wrote in the report, according to NCR. ‘He pulled down my tank top by the straps. He slipped them down my shoulders and proceeded to suck and lick my right breast while holding me down on his lap by the arms,' she continued. 'I felt his hands start to move down towards my shorts as if he was trying to unbutton them or pull them off. I was still crying at this point and felt so scared that I couldn't move,’ the report further said. The prosecutor declined to bring charges in the case after Ms Seeberg killed herself, which, NCR points out, is fairly common in the instance of an accuser taking their own life if they are the only witness to the alleged crime. Ms Seeberg, according to the NCR report, was ‘both politically and personally conservative, a brand new member of the College Republicans who led her parish youth group and spoke openly about saving herself for marriage.’ Notre Dame officials moved quickly to portray her as a woman scorned, an ‘aggressive young woman who lied to get back at him for sexually rejecting her the first moment they were ever alone together,’ NCR reported. The alleged attacker had a history of misbehaviour and a reputation as a hot head, he was even suspended from high school for misbehaviour, said NCR. Several inconsistencies in the stories told by those involved muddled the truth, or maybe there were separate truths – each based on perception. Whatever the case, the prosecutor never pressed charges, the player was never named and moved on with his life - Lizzy Seeberg ended her's. No punishment: The still unnamed player involved did not miss a single game, and even played in January's National Championship for Notre Dame's Fighting Irish football team (in blue and gold) Where Ms Seeberg wrote that she felt ‘uncomfortable’ as she was pulled closer to her attacker while dancing in his room with others present and forced to do a lap dance, the others told investigators that ‘she was being rather forward and dancing with the young man; she was dancing for him.’ ‘He told me to give him a lap dance and I didn't know what to do,’ Ms Seeburg wrote in the report. Notre Dame officials refused to comment on the allegations when confronted by NCR reporter Melinda Henneberger. The same day the Chicago Tribune made Ms Seeberg’s allegations and subsequent suicide public – almost three months after the fact – Notre Dame football coach joked during a media conference call ‘that he didn't know the Tribune could afford all the reporters who were peppering him with questions about the case,’ according to NCR. Coach Kelly did not even suspend the player in question while the accusations were looked into, he played in every game, and was part of every single practice. The school addressed the allegations in January 2013, admitting to Huffington Post that it ‘could have acted a bit more quickly,’ but instead of apologizing for failing to even acknowledge the allegations for more than two years, the school spokesperson took the opportunity to point out that Ms Seeberg was not raped, ‘in fact, it was an allegation of touching above the waist.’ Not acceptable: The letter writer wrote that the many accusations of sexual abuse on campus are unacceptable and that someone had 'to stand up for what is right' Ms Seeberg’s case isn’t the first one of females accusing Notre Dame football players of sexual assault, rape or other improprieties. One girl accused a member of the team of raping her in February 2011, the girl who drove her to the hospital after the attack claims she too was raped by a football player, NCR reported. That girl was also urged to keep quiet in text messages sent by other players, her parents told NCR. When told of the allegations, school administrators told the shocked parents they’d get the players to ‘knock it off,’ according to NCR. Those are only a few of the numerous alleged attacks by Notre Dame football players, all of which can be easily found online – they are widely reported. This is why the sign holder attempted to bring attention to what he feels is a grave injustice. ‘Notre Dame is, among other things, chicken for not having the spine to even say anything to the family of a girl while they have her blood on their hands,’ the sign holder wrote in his letter to Deadspin. Notre Dame officials were not able to be reached by MailOnline for comment.","Despite widespread outrage, he claims the sign was meant to bring attention to her case, and that of others whose accusations of sexual assault at the University of Notre Dame have been ignored or covered up .

Only five consultants work in A&E overnight across the entire country, it can be revealed today. Emergency departments are being left in the hands of junior doctors between midnight and eight in the morning. And they are being overseen by only a handful of slightly more  experienced medics – many of whom are locums. Midnight terror: Once the clock strikes 12am, there are only five senior consultants in all of England, leaving junior doctors in charge . Figures obtained by the Mail show that just five NHS trusts in England employ a consultant to work in A&E overnight – even though thousands of seriously ill and injured patients turn up during these hours. Although most of the other hospitals have an ‘on-call’ consultant who can be contacted after they have gone home, junior staff are often reluctant to trouble them. Even during the day, 90 per cent of trusts have only one consultant working in A&E at weekends. The number of patients turning up in A&E has soared by 50 per cent in a decade and many hospitals are struggling to cope with the surge in demand. Today Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt will announce a range of plans – including £500million of extra funding – to help casualty departments avoid a crisis this winter when it is feared the numbers of patients will increase further. Hope for help from Hunt: Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt is set to announce £500million of extra funding to A&E departments to get them through the winter . These are likely to include making a named GP responsible for every older person so fewer end up in A&E in the first place. He also wants to free family doctors from paperwork so they have more time to see patients – particularly out-of hours when many go to casualty instead. But it is unclear how the measures will be able to force consultants to work overnight. Opinion polls show the public expects the most experienced hospital doctors to work their share of anti-social hours. Not all patients who arrive in A&E need to see a consultant and they can be managed by junior doctors or nurses. However, consultants play a vital role in A&E where crucial life-or-death decisions about the most seriously ill patients need to be made very quickly. The Mail used the Freedom of Information Act to ask all NHS hospitals how many consultants worked in A&E overnight and at the weekend. Around two thirds of some 160 hospital trusts in England have A&E departments. Just five of the 92 trusts which replied . employed one consultant overnight – Brighton and Sussex, Imperial . College in London, University Hospitals of North Staffordshire, North . Bristol and the Pennine Acute Hospitals in Greater Manchester. At the . remaining 87 NHS trusts, the last consultant goes home at either 8pm, . 10pm or midnight. The figures also showed that more than half of trusts . only employ one ‘middle grade’ doctor overnight, who will generally have . two and six years’ experience. Increasing numbers: 21.7million people were admitted to A&E last year, a 50 per cent rise in ten years . These will be tied-up with the most critical patients, leaving junior doctors to deal with everyone else. And 90 per cent of trusts said there was just one consultant working at the A&E department during the day on Saturdays and Sundays. Statistics show that patients are 10 per cent more likely to die if they are brought to hospital at weekends compared to during the week. Katherine Murphy of the Patients Association, a charity, said: ‘Patients are increasingly resorting to A&E because they cannot get an appointment with their GP. When they use A&E they expect to see the most competent staff who are in a position to make the correct diagnosis. ‘The care that is provided outside normal working hours must be of the same standard – for too long we have put up with this nine to five mentality within the NHS.’ Roger Goss of charity Patient Concern said: ‘You need top quality doctors in A&E more than anywhere else as here – by definition – is where the emergencies come in.’ Jamie Reed MP, Labour’s health spokesman said: ‘These figures reveal the full-blown staffing crisis at all levels of England’s A&Es. There can be no case for ministers not investigating these findings.’ The Mail’s figures also reveal that some units are so understaffed that more than half of the consultant posts are currently vacant. Many doctors do not want to work in A&E because it is regarded as stressful and the hours are longer than those in other departments. A spokesman for Jeremy Hunt said: ‘We know senior consultants’ presence in A&E makes a big difference to patients. That’s why a large portion of this year’s winter funding (the £500million) will go to help pay for extended consultant hours in A&E.’","Just five NHS trusts employ senior consultants for A&E overnight .

"By . Ap Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 09:30 EST, 1 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 15:57 EST, 1 September 2013 . Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that the U.S. now has evidence that sarin nerve gas was used in Syria and that ‘the case gets stronger by the day’ for a military attack. A day after President Barack Obama stepped back from his threat to launch an attack, Kerry said in a succession interviews on the Sunday news shows that the administration learned of the sarin use within the past 24 hours through samples of hair and blood provided to Washington by first responders in Damascus. Kerry said he was confident that Congress will give Obama its backing for an attack against Syria, but the former Massachusetts senator also said the president has authority to act on his own if Congress doesn't give its approval. Scroll down for video... Deadly nerve agent: John Kerry announced Sunday morning that the U.S. now has evidence that Syria's government used the deadly nerve agent sarin in the August 21 chemical weapon attach outside Damascus . While Kerry stopped short of saying Obama was committed to such a course even if lawmakers refuse to authorize force, he did say that ‘we are not going to lose this vote.’ Kerry said Obama has the right to take action against Syria, with or without Congress' approval. But he stopped short of saying Obama was committed to such a course even if lawmakers refuse to authorize force. Congress is scheduled to return from a summer break on Sept. 9. GOP Rep. Peter King of New York, who criticized Obama for not proceeding immediately against Assad, said the president may have trouble winning the backing of Congress. ‘I think it is going to be difficult,’ said King, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, adding that there is an ‘isolationist’ tendency in his GOP caucus. On an account dubbed 'the official Twitter account for the Presidency of the Syrian,' a picture was posted early Sunday of Assad meeting with the Iranian national security committee . Some 355 people showing 'neurotoxic symptoms' died August 21 after an attack with what the U.S. now says was likely deadly sarin gas . Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he thinks the Senate ‘will rubber-stamp what he wants but I think the House will be a much closer vote.’ Paul said he believes ‘it's at least 50-50 whether the House will vote down involvement in the Syrian war.’ But Rep. Mike Rogers, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called the evidence, including the fresh finding on sarin gas, ‘convincing and getting better.’ Rogers, R-Mich., predicted that ‘at the end of the day, Congress will rise to the occasion,’ but he also said ‘it's going to take that healthy debate to get there.’ ‘This isn't about Barack Obama versus the Congress. This isn't about Republicans versus Democrats. This has a very important worldwide reach in this decision.’ 'We are not going to lose this vote': Obama has asked Congress to vote to authorize a strike against Syria and Kerry now says the case for an attack has only gotten stronger . With Secretary of State John Kerry's revelation Sunday that Syria's government used the lethal nerve agent sarin gas on its own people in the August 21 attach outside Damascus comes a worldwide. Chemical weapons, and sarin most notably, cause an agonzing death and can be deployed over large areas with widespread casualties without regard for a victim's age or status as a civilian. According to the United Nations, chemical weapons have caused more than 1 million deaths globally since World War I. The Geneva Protocol, which prohibited the use of chemical weapons, was signed in 1925. However, the protocol did not prohibit nations from developing or stockpiling new chemical agents. By the Cold War era of the 1970s and 1980s, the UN estimates some 25 countries were developing chemical weapons capabilities. Nonetheless, few instances of chemical weapons use have been seen since World War II. Notable exceptions have been seen in Iraq and Iran. Since 1993, the Chemical Weapons Convention has been signed by 189 nations that have agreed to a complete disarmament of chemical weapons of mass destruction. A 2001 photo shows canisters of sarin gas at a Kentucky army facility. The United States is one of 189 signers of the Chemical Weapons Convention, a move towards complete worldwide disarmament of such weapons . Deadly: A molecular model of sarin, a deadly nerve agent that kills swiftly and painfully. Sarin is one of the most volatile and deadly of nerve gases . Sarin was developed as pesticide by the Germans in 1938. It has since been identified as one of the most potent and rapidly acting of the so-called nerve agents. This is, in part, due to how rapidly sarin evaporates into a gas and spreads into the environment. Sarin in its vapor form causes symptoms within seconds and in its liquid form symptoms appear within minutes. Sarin stops the off-switch enzyme of the body's glands and muscles, causing them to work continuously, Symptoms include: Runny nose, watery eyes, pinpoint pupils, eye pain, blurred vision, drooling and excessive sweating, cough, chest tightness, rapid breathing, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and/or abdominal pain, increased urination, confusion, drowsiness, weakness, headache, slow or fast heart rate, low or high blood pressure. Even a small amount of sarin can cause serious injury and many victims will not know they've been exposed to the oderless, colorless, tasteless compound. Obama, who has talked repeatedly of U.S. reprisals against President Bashar Assad for the alleged use of chemical weapons against his own people in Syria's protracted civil war, announced Saturday that he had decided to defer any immediate action in order to seek a congressional authorization. ‘The case hasn't changed and the case doesn't change at all. The rationale for a military response is as powerful today’ as it has been, Kerry said. ‘This case is going to build stronger and stronger,’ he said. But he also said he thinks ‘the people of America should be celebrating that the president is not acting unilaterally.’ Kerry maintained there is no weakness in the U.S. case underscoring Obama's about-face, saying instead that ‘the president believes that we are all stronger as a nation when we act together.’ The secretary said that Assad ‘has now joined the list of Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein’ in deploying chemical weapons against his population and that ‘the case remains the same’ for a U.S. response. Kerry echoed Obama in saying the world cannot stand by and watch Assad use chemical weapons. Killer agent: Sarin was first developed as a pesticide by Germany in 1938. It works by stopping the 'off switch' of the body's muscles and glands . Asked if the U.S. obtained its new information from U.N. weapons inspectors who had visited Syria, Kerry responded, ‘No, it is independent. ... But it is confirmation of the signatures of sarin.’ ‘In the last 24 hours,’ he said, ‘we have learned through samples that were provided to the United States, that have now been tested, from first responders in east Damascus, and hair samples and blood samples have tested positive for signatures of sarin.’ He was asked repeatedly what Obama would do in the event that Congress refuses to give its consent, Kerry said, ‘The president has taken his decision.’ ‘I think this is a smart decision by the president. ... He is not trying to create an imperial presidency,’ Kerry added. ‘I believe that in the end, Congress will do what is right.’ Administration officials have said that Obama appeared set on ordering a strike until Friday evening. After a long walk in near 90-degree temperatures around the White House grounds with Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, the president told his aide he had changed his mind. These officials said Saturday that Obama initially drew pushback in a two-hour session attended by Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, Director of National Intelligence James Klapper, CIA Director John Brennan, national security adviser Susan Rice and homeland security adviser Lisa Monaco. They declined to say which of the participants had argued against Obama's proposal. Kerry appeared on NBC's Meet the Press, CNN's State of the Union, CBS' Face the Nation, Fox News Sunday and ABC's This Week. Paul was on NBC, Rogers was on CNN and King was on Fox.","The Secretary of State said the ‘the case gets stronger by the day’ for a military attack .

MPs have been banned from touching statues of ex-Prime Ministers including Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher. The bronze monuments to Great British leaders have become damaged by today’s politicians touching their feet for good luck before giving speeches. But art bosses in Parliament say four statues at the entrance to Commons are now ‘seriously under threat’ and are preparing to rope them off to stop MPs from paying the traditional tribute. Tribute: The statue of Margaret Thatcher was unveiled by the Iron Lady and David Cameron in the Commons in 2007 . The member’s lobby outside the main double doors to the Commons chamber contains four impressive statues of former Prime Ministers. A bronze of Sir Winston Churchill looms large, and touching his foot has become a tradition for up and coming MPs hoping some of the war leader’s political stardust would rub off on them. Tories have also taken to rubbing the statue of Margaret Thatcher, while Labour MPs pay tribute at the feet of ex-PM Clement Attlee and Lib Dems make a beeline for David Lloyd George. But the tradition is causing such significant damage that experts have taken casts of the feet in case they need to be replaced. The 7ft 6in bronze of Baroness Thatcher by sculptor Antony Dufort was unveiled by the Iron Lady and David Cameron in the Commons in 2007. Since Lady Thatcher's death in April there have been calls for a prominent statue to be erected in a public place in central London. Towering: The statue of Winston Churchill in member's lobby was unveiled by the war leader's widow Baroness Spencer-Churchill after the Commons was rebuilt . Melanie Unwin, the Commons’ deputy art curator, said ‘Four statues  - Winston Churchill, Clement . Attlee, Margaret Thatcher and David Lloyd George - in the Members’ Lobby are seriously under threat due to the tradition of touching the toes of the statues for good luck. ‘There are now cracks and small holes on the surface of the Churchill statue, and substantial loss of surface texture on the other statues.’ The feet have been re-waxed and re-coloured regularly to protect them and help to monitor the level of touching. Ms Unwin added: ‘Casts have been taken of the feet of the statues in case the damage gets to a point where they need to be recast.’ Political idols: Labour MPs pay tribute at the feet of Clement Attlee (left) while Lib Dems prefer to rub the foot of former Liberal PM David Lloyd Georg . In a bid to curb the damage, new MPs are no longer told by officials about the tradition and parliament’s tour guides try to stop visitors from touching the statues. But the Speaker’s Advisory Committee on artworks has now ordered the area to be roped off, to stop MPs getting close to their idols. ‘The seriousness of the problem, which was compromising the integrity of internationally important art works, left no choice but to install small barriers to prevent the feet of the statues being touched,’ Ms Unwin added. When the Commons is sitting only MPs and some journalists are allowed in member's lobby, which was destroyed during the Blitz.","Today's MPs like to touch the feet of former leaders for good luck .

Undersea explorers have discovered a trove of buried treasure that may lead to the discovery of more than 400,000 gold coins. Barry Clifford and his team of archaeologists also found a musket and thousands of lead balls in the 18th century pirate ship they found off the coast of Cape Cod. Clifford told ABCNews.com the coins were found stacked stacked up 'like poker chips' in clumps known as concretions. Treasure: Barry Clifford shows a concretion containing coins which was recovered around the wreckage of the Whydah, a ship that sank during a ferocious storm off Cape Cod in 1717 . Explorer: Barry Clifford (pictured in 2000), has been searching the site with his team for 30 years . 'There's just a tremendous amount of material on board the vessel,' he said. They also found thousands of lead musket balls beneath the sand. During the expedition, which culminated . on September 1 they travelled 1,500 feet from the shore off Cape Cod, . for a three-day expedition.

It is believed Hollande was trying to make schoolchildren laugh . This unflattering picture of Francois Hollande sparked a censorship row yesterday. It shows the French President with a gormless-looking grin at a school to coincide with the start of the new term. The image was released by a photo agency. And when the agency tried to withdraw it from circulation, the photo quickly hit social media sites like Twitter and went worldwide. The photo shows Hollande grinning in front of a blackboard on which is written: 'Today, it’s back to school.' The photograph was taken on Tuesday during Mr Hollande’s visit to a school in Denain, northern France, to coincide with the start of term for hundreds of thousands of French pupils. It appears he was pulling a funny face to make the pupils laugh. The original image came with the caption: 'During a visit to the school Denain Michelet, September 3, 2013, Francois Hollande smiles, chairing a panel discussion on the reform of school timetables established by the government.'

A graduate from Washington has designed a simple yet revolutionary camera lens that can be fitted to a smartphone camera and used to zoom to microscopic levels. The six millimetre Micro Phone Lens has a magnifying range of between 15x and 60x - by comparison a high-end smartphone camera comes with around 10x zoom. It is made of silicone that is capable of sticking to a smartphone camera lens without any extra adhesive and costs just $15 (£9). Scroll down for video . A Washington graduate has invented a six millimetre lens, pictured, that can be fitted directly onto a smartphone camera and is capable of magnifying objects up to 60x. The Micro Phone Lens has a basic 15x zoom and will cost £9 plus shipping when it goes on sale in late September . Base magnification: 15x . Maximum magnification: 60x with phone zoom . Minimum recommended camera: 5 Megapixels . Product diameter: 1/4'"" (6 mm) Material: Platinum catalysed silicone . Optically identical to glass . Soft lens that can't be scratched . Self-adheres to almost any mobile phone or tablet camera . Reusable and can be washed with soap and water . All photos taken can be edited and shared in the same way as normal photos using the phone's built-in gallery and editor. The Micro Phone Lens was created by 22-year-old Thomas Larson from Seattle after he began working on the idea while studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Washington. Larson set up a Kickstarter project to raise funding for the project in August and has already raised more than $68,000 . (£44,000) before the campaign ends on 10 September. The lenses are made of a patent pending technology called platinum catalysed silicone. It is a sticky material that can be washed using soap and water, without damaging its adhesive qualities.

A smartphone with the 6mm Micro Phone Lens attached. It is made of sticky platinum catalysed silicone that can doesn't require extra glue, can't be scratched and can be washed using soap and water . Larson claims that because the lens is classed as soft - meaning it is flexible - it can't be scratched like traditional glass lenses and is 'optically identical to glass'. This means it has the same transparency as glass and can also bend and view light in a similar way. Future versions of the lens could reveal the intricate details of an insect wing (insect not specified) - a user can easily see the fragile structure and mottled texture of the body part . Larson's Kickstarter campaign is for funding of a 15x version of the lens but Larson is also working on a 150X version that would produce sharper images, such as these microscopic views of an onion, left, and pollen, right . Here a piece of fabric looks as if it is covered in thick multicoloured wires, but in fact the 'barbs' are very soft fibres that have been magnified 150x by a future version of Larson's Micro Photo Lens . He adds that, in theory, the lens should stay sticky 'forever'. On his Kickstarter page, Larson said he: 'believes, a cheap and portable microscope of this kind . could not only be used for entertaining purposes, but also provide . possibilities for health and disease prevention in the developing world.' Although Larson claims the Micro Phone Lens works with most major smartphones and camera, he recommends it is used with a camera that has 5MP or higher for the best results.

The judge said that his detention was necessary in order to protect witnesses and preserve evidence. No date has been fixed for his trial and Patricia Wilson's body has never been found. For weeks, Gendarmes scoured fields and woods and divers searched lakes without success. The prosecution case against Cayrou was based on threats he made against the British woman prior to her disappearance and blood found on objects in the boot of his car which contained her DNA.

Babies would need to eat twice as much shop-bought food to get the same energy and protein as meals cooked at home, researchers found . Baby foods made by firms including Cow and Gate, Heinz and Ella’s Kitchen have far fewer nutrients than homemade meals, according to a new study. Many contain high levels of sugar and some are promoted for use from four months of age - a time when babies should still be on a diet of breast or formula milk. Babies would need to eat twice as much shop-bought food to get the same energy and protein as meals cooked at home, researchers found. The study, from the department of human nutrition at the University of Glasgow, said many weaning foods 'would not serve the intended purpose' of giving a baby extra nutrients or a range of tastes and textures. Current guidelines encourage weaning from six months of age, with babies fed only breast or formula milk before this time. But some parents choose to wean early and baby foods are often marked as 'suitable from four months'. Experts analysed all the baby foods produced by the main UK manufacturers. These were Cow and Gate, Heinz, Boots, Hipp Organic, Ella’s Kitchen and Organix. Products included ready-made soft foods and dry foods such as cereal that could be made up with milk or water, biscuits, rusks, bars, snacks and cakes. Nutritional information for each product, such as calories, fat, iron and calcium, were collected from manufacturers’ websites, the products themselves and from email enquiries. Of the 479 items, 79 per cent were ready-made spoonable foods and 44 per cent were aimed at infants from four months. Some 65 per cent of the products were sweet foods. Of the 479 items surveyed, 79 per cent were ready-made spoonable foods and 44 per cent were aimed at infants from four months. Some 65 per cent of the products were sweet foods . The researchers said the typical calorie content of the spoonable foods was 282 kJ per 100g, which is almost identical to breast milk at 283 kJ per 100g of formula. But purees and spoonable foods made at home were 'more nutrient dense' than the shop-bought foods. Examples of homemade foods included chicken stew, beef with mash, stewed apple with custard and apple with rice pudding. And while commercial finger foods contained more calories, they had a 'very high' sugar content. The iron content of most of the foods was also lower than that found in formula. Writing in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, the researchers said: The UK infant food market mainly supplies sweet, soft, spoonable foods targeted from age four months. 'Most products are ready-made spoonable foods that are no more energy dense than formula milk, and are generally much less nutrient dense than homemade foods. 'This meant that around 50g of a soft spoonable family food might supply the same amount of energy and protein as 100g of ready-made spoonable food.' The Department of Health recommends a gradual transition to solids starting with cereals, vegetables and fruits, before moving on to proteins. It recommends babies still continue to receive breast milk or a pint of formula a day while they are being weaned, up to their first birthday. The experts said many shop-bought foods are sweet, possibly to cater for babies’ inherent preference for sweet foods. Purees and spoonable foods made at home were 'more nutrient dense' than the shop-bought foods. Examples of homemade foods included chicken stew, beef with mash, stewed apple with custard and apple with rice pudding . 'However, repeated exposure to foods during infancy promotes acceptance and preferences.' While shop-bought foods use fruit sugars to sweeten foods rather than added sugars, both probably contribute to tooth decay in equal measure, the experts added. A statement from Heinz said: 'Generations of parents have trusted Heinz baby foods as safe and nourishing and which are specially prepared to meet babies nutritional needs with recipes that provide the right tastes and textures.' A statement from Organix said it did not add vitamins and minerals to foods due to organic production rules. 'An exception to these rules is where there are general food industry laws and regulations that supersede any organic rules. 'For example, Thiamin or Vitamin B1 is required by law to be added to any weaning foods that are cereal based, to provide enough of this important vitamin for infants. 'This plays a vital role in the development of a healthy nervous system and is needed for energy release, digestion and growth.' Nobody was available for comment from Hipp Organic. Helen Messenger, a spokeswoman for Cow and Gate, said: 'Our foods offer good quality nutrition tailored to meet babies’ needs and must comply with strict legal standards. The Department of Health recommends a gradual transition to solids starting with cereals, vegetables and fruits, before moving on to proteins. It recommends babies still continue to receive breast milk or a pint of formula a day while they are being weaned, up to their first birthday . 'We recommend that our baby foods are used as part of a mixed diet which includes homemade foods plus breast milk or formula, which remains the most important source of nutrition for infants under 12 months. 'The latest Government data shows that most babies in the UK are getting the nutrients they need from their weaning diets and that there are no significant shortfalls.' Rosemary Dodds, senior policy adviser at the National Childbirth Trust (NCT), said: 'Manufacturers have been dragging their feet, lagging behind current thinking and research evidence that babies don’t generally need solid foods before about six months. 'It’s time they stopped labelling foods ‘from 4 months. If babies are spoon-fed pureed fruit and vegetables before this time, it can replace the nutrients from milk. 'Many parents do find jars of food convenient when they are out and about, but babies can eat family foods most of the time. 'Buying commercial baby foods is also much more expensive than using family foods.'","A University of Glasgow study found babies would need to eat twice as much shop-bought food to get the same energy as home-cooked meals .
