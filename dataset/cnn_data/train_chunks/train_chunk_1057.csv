"South African judge Thokozile Masipa says she will respond to the prosecution's appeal against the Oscar Pistorius verdict on Wednesday. Prosecutor Gerrie Nel told the Pretoria High Court the decision to acquit Pistorius of the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, should be overturned.  Nel also argues that Paralympic star's punishment was 'shockingly inappropriate'. Masipa, who presided over the Pistorius trial, will also decide whether the case can be heard at the Supreme Court of Appeal. Oscar Pistorius leaves court on day three of sentencing procedures at the High Court in Pretoria . Judge Thokozile Masipa found Pistorious guilty of culpable homicide but cleared him of murder .

The Paralympian admits shooting girlfriend Steenkamp four times with hollow point bullets through a locked toilet door on Valentine's Day 2013. He told the court he thought she was an intruder. Masipa found him guilty of culpable homicide, also known as manslaughter, and sentenced him to five years in jail, meaning that he could end up spending only 10 months of his jail term at Pretoria's central prison. Pistorious hugs his brother Carl, who came to court on crutches after a car crash earlier this year . March 3 - Oscar Pistorius pleads not guilty in court to murder and three gun charges.

April 15 - Re-examined by his own counsel, Pistorius recalls how he was 'terrified' that the person in the bathroom was an intruder. 'I feared for my life. I was just scared,' he says. 'I was thinking about what could happen to me, to Reeva. I was just extremely fearful.' April 16 - Judge Masipa announces the trial will adjourn until May 5, following a request for a break from Mr Nel. May 5 - Upon resumption, Pistorius's neighbour, Johan Stander, describes how he received an urgent call to help following the incident.

May 8 - A social worker who visited Pistorius in the aftermath of the killing describes the murder suspect as 'heartbroken'. Yvette van Schalkwyk, who says she decided to give evidence at the trial because she was upset by suggestions reported in the media that Pistorius was feigning grief to sway the judge in his favour, adds: 'He cried 80% of the time.

"Cricketer Matt Prior, criticised for his passion for cycling by his former England team-mate Kevin Pietersen, has co-founded a new professional team. The wicketkeeper-batsman is chief executive of ONE Pro Cycling, who were launched on Tuesday with the aim of competing at UCI Continental level, the tier below Team Sky, but one above the UK domestic teams. Prior said: 'Cycling is a huge passion of mine and I am delighted to be setting up ONE Pro Cycling with a team of experienced and dedicated people.

"Newcastle’s initial attempts to recruit emergency goalkeeper cover were flatly rejected by the Premier League — but the Tyneside club may yet return to argue their case.

West Ham midfielder Mark Noble is Sam Allardyce's only injury concern for the Barclays Premier League trip to Sunderland on Saturday.

"Gareth Barry became the joint record holder for being shown the most yellow cards in Barclays Premier League history when the Everton midfielder was booked against former club Manchester City. The caution was the 33-year-old's 99th in the league, putting him on par with Kevin Davies and Lee Bowyer. Former Bolton striker Davies tweeted: 'Had a great run but all records are there to be broken!! Morning!!' before later adding: 'How dirty is Gareth Barry by the way!!! Ha.' Gareth Barry became the joint record holder for the most yellow cards in Barclays Premier League history . Barry now has 99 bookings in his professional career in the Premier League after Saturday's latest yellow . Kevin Davies remains joint top but is about to lose his crown with Barry still playing in the Premier League . Davies tweeted after finding out about sharing the record with Barry, as well as Lee Bowyer . Davies is about to lose his yellow card record, which stood at 99 after years in the Premier League . Davies is unlikely to get a chance to hit back with the 37-year-old striker now playing his football away from the top flight and in League One with Preston North End. He picked up the total playing for Southampton, Blackburn, and Bolton in the Premier League. Barry is almost certain to overtake Davies and Bowyer as he continues to thrive for Everton. However he will not have 'chance' to do it immediately. The former England midfielder's booking against City was his fifth in the Premier League this year and means he will be suspended for Everton's next match against QPR.

"Paul Lambert has claimed there was 'absolutely no bust-up' when Roy Keane quit as Aston Villa's assistant manager. Boss Lambert scotched reports Keane was embroiled in training-ground rows with Villa players before walking out on the club last week. Christian Benteke's first goal in nine months handed Villa their first win in 10 games in an edgy 1-0 victory at Crystal Palace on Tuesday night. Aston Villa assistant manager Roy Keane left his role at the Premier League club last week . Paul Lambert (far left) has refuted claims suggesting Keane left on bad terms . After denying any rift with Keane, Lambert hailed Benteke's resolve in notching his 30th goal in 60 Premier League games, his first since knee surgery in March. 'If anyone wants to know about Roy, I'll put it on your plate so you know: there's absolutely no problem whatsoever,' said Lambert. Former Manchester United lynchpin Keane's party line for quitting his Villa post was to focus on his role with the Republic of Ireland. Lambert added: 'He's got a lot of commitments with Ireland, he's never had a break from going away with Ireland, and never had a break from Aston Villa. So I totally respect his decision. 'Contrary to reports, there was absolutely nothing, absolutely no bust-up, no arguing, nothing like that. 'I thank him for his time coming to work for me. 'I spoke to him before the Burnley game, after the Burnley game, and we still have the same relationship. So I just want to put that to bed, alright? 'Back to your point, it's a massive four points in the last two away games, and we're four games unbeaten. 'Two young centre halves having played well, Benteke back in with a goal and I thought Alan Hutton was fantastic.' Christian Benteke wheels away in celebration after scoring against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park . Benteke scored his first goal since March against Neil Warnock's side during the first half . Villa crept up to 12th courtesy of just their fourth league win in 14 games this term, with Palace left frustrated due to toothless final-third play. Lambert hailed Benteke's return to goal-scoring form after a poor red card against Tottenham last month cost him a three-match ban. 'He's missed half the year, so that's the magnitude of it (his 30th goal in 60 league games), I'm delighted for him,' said Lambert. 'It was a great goal from Christian today. 'The suspension never helped his case, but that was a fantastic return.' Palace boss Neil Warnock lamented Scott Dann's mistake, allowing Benteke to pick his pocket and race away to score the game's decisive solitary goal. Warnock labelled Dann Palace's outstanding player this term, but conceded the centre back suffered 'cruel punishment' for his error. Eagles goalkeeper Julian Speroni dives to his left but is unable to stop Benteke's strike from going into his net . Neil Warnock was disappointed with Scott Dann's 'unfortunate' mistake which led to Benteke's winner . 'I think he should have kicked it over the stand, and not be ashamed to do it,' said Warnock of Dann's costly error. 'Brede (Hangeland) could have come out as well, but these decisions they make, they stand or fall. 'It's unfortunate for Scotty because he's probably been our best player. It's a cruel punishment, but hopefully he'll learn by that: you can't score in row Z can you? 'I can't fault the effort, I thought we started really well, played some good stuff and created some good chances. 'You've got to make your own lucky really, and we just lacked that little bit of quality. 'I thought Benteke just held them together, it's nice to have that type of player. 'We are disappointed the way the goal was given away and they didn't have to work hard for their goal. 'It just wasn't to be, just the gambling in the box, predators who latch onto knock-downs: they are the ones that count, and you've got to take advantage of opportunities like that.'","Roy Keane left his role at Villa Park after spending just six months at club .

"Standing in the cold night air at Burnley, Joe Cole could have been forgiven for thinking about the grander stages he has graced in his career. The former Chelsea and England star’s mind could have wandered to the lucrative offers he turned down to finish his career abroad last summer instead of taking a pay cut to join Aston Villa on a free transfer from West Ham. But after scoring on his first Premier League start for Villa in a typically full-blooded English encounter, there was nowhere Cole would rather have been than Turf Moor. Joe Cole wheels away after scoring his first goal for Aston Villa to put them ahead at Turf Moor . Cole's strike was his first since December 2013, and came on his first start for Aston Villa in the league . ‘This is what it’s all about, playing in the Premier League,’ he said. ‘I could have gone and filled my pockets, and that’s not a criticism of the players who do that because it’s a short career and we’re not really qualified to do anything else after football. ‘I’ve been lucky enough and the fire still burns for me. I just want to play. I prefer to be in Burnley at Turf Moor than playing in the Middle East somewhere in 100 degrees. You know what I mean? It’s a proper game. ‘You have to respect the little kid who just dreamed of playing one minute in the Premier League. If you keep that in mind, you can keep playing for as long as you want.’ Cole has revealed that he turned down the opportunity to play for more money outside of England this summer . The former England midfielder is mobbed by his team-mates as Villa took the lead on Saturday . Cole knows his days at the top of the game, when he was an England regular, are behind him . At 33, the one-time prodigy of English football knows his best years are behind him. Even playing a full game might be asking too much these days. But Cole was excellent for the 67 minutes he was on the pitch, showing some of his old movement and anticipation to fire Villa ahead just before half-time and silence any doubters who question if he still has anything to offer at this level. ‘You deal with things like that,’ he added. ‘Once you get past 30 nowadays, people tend to question you. ‘They always have opinions. Have you got it, have you not got it? Are you going to be good enough to play for West Ham, for Chelsea or for England? Would I be able to go and play in France (with Lille)? ‘It’s just how you feel in yourself. I’m hungry to play, I’ve got the desire. While that’s still there, I’ll have a go.’ Danny Ings' late penalty denied Villa all three points, and Burnley almost snatched a late winner . Cole’s first goal since last December was not enough to prevent Villa’s winless run from stretching to nine games after Danny Ings equalised with a late penalty for Burnley and then hit the post in added time. That was the cue for a section of Villa’s fans to turn on manager Paul Lambert who 24 hours earlier had confirmed the shock departure of his No. 2 Roy Keane. First-team coach Scott Marshall sat alongside Lambert on the bench on Saturday, and afterwards the Villa boss said that he will ‘mull it over for a few weeks’ before appointing a new assistant. Lambert’s side are away again on Tuesday night at Crystal Palace while Burnley have another home game against Newcastle after picking up seven points from their last three games. ‘Momentum is a big factor,’ said goalkeeper Tom Heaton. ‘It shows how far we’ve come from the start of the season that we were a goal down in the Premier League and were disappointed not to have won. We’ll take a point and move forward.’","Joe Cole scored his first goal for Aston Villa in draw with Burnley .

"Catholic bishops meeting to discuss 'family issues' at a two week summit have said unmarried couples living together can be 'positive', and gay relationships and divorces must be welcomed. Displaying remarkably liberal attitudes for a Church famed for its conservatism, bishops meeting in the Vatican today also said that a couples' decision on the use of contraception should be respected. The summit, which reached its midway point today, has been described as a 'step in the right direction' by activists and boasts all the hallmarks of the notably progressive attitudes the Catholic Church has adopted since the ascension of Pope Francis last year. Scroll down for video . New era: Pope Francis is pictured at the synod this morning. Displaying remarkably liberal attitudes for a Church famed for its conservatism, bishops said unmarried couples living together can be 'positive' Prayer: The summit boasts all the hallmarks of the notably progressive attitudes the Catholic Church has adopted since last year's ascension of Pope Francis (pictured at the meeting today) The two-week meeting of bishops on family issues arrived at its half-way point today with a document summarizing the closed-door debate so far. No decisions were announced, but the tone was one of acceptance rather than condemnation, aiming to guide Catholics toward the ideal of marriage. Bishops called for 'courageous' new ways to help families, especially those 'damaged' by divorce. Unlike the last family synod in 1980, which despaired over the rise in annulments in the U.S., bishops are now calling for streamlined annulment procedures globally. The synod is also the first time a Vatican meeting has discussed gay and lesbian issues within the Church - a move described as 'a crack in the ice that we have been waiting for, for a very long time' by Francis DeBernardo, executive director of the Catholic gay rights group New Ways Ministry. Explanation: The two-week meeting of bishops on family issues arrived at its half-way point today (pictured) with a document summarizing the closed-door debate so far . The bishops said homosexuals had 'gifts and qualities' to offer and asked rhetorically if the church was ready to provide them a place 'accepting and valuing their sexual orientation without compromising Catholic doctrine on the family and matrimony.' For a 2,000-year-old institution that believes gay sex is 'intrinsically disordered,' even posing the question is significant. The bishops, however, repeated that gay marriage was off the table. The bishops said they must grasp the 'positive reality of civil weddings' and even cohabitation, with the aim of helping the couple commit eventually to a church wedding. The decision to include gay and lesbian issues at a meeting discussing Catholic family values bears all the hallmarks of Pope Francis' progressive attitude. Pope Francis famously said 'Who am I to judge?' when asked in 2013 about rumors that a top priestly adviser had a gay lover. Progressive: The Vatican synod is discussing gay and lesbian issues within the Church for the first time. The move has been described as 'a crack in the ice' by the Catholic gay rights group New Ways Ministry . Welcome: Vatican Swiss Guards  salute Pope Francis as he arrives for the synod last week . The bishops also called for a re-reading of the 1968 encyclical Humanae Vitae that outlined the church's opposition to artificial birth control. The bishops said couples should be unconditionally open to having children, but that the message of Humanae Vitae 'underlines the need to respect the dignity of the person in the moral evaluation of the methods of birth control.' There has been much talk inside the synod about applying the theological concept of the 'law of gradualness' in difficult family situations. The concept encourages the faithful to take one step at a time in the search for holiness. Applying the concept to matters of birth control would be an acknowledgement that most Catholics already use artificial contraception in violation of church teaching.","Catholic Church adopts rare progressive tone during talks of family issues .

"The world's very first space detective agency has been launched in a bid to settle disputes in court with the use of satellite images. Satellite imaging specialist Professor Raymond Harris and space lawyer Raymond Purdy have teamed up to form new company Air & Space Evidence Ltd of London. The firm, of which both are named as directors, will enable members of the public to successfully obtain and use authentic satellite imagery to stand up a court case. Scroll down for video . The world's first space detective agency - Air & Space Evidence Ltd of London - has been launched by  space experts in a bid to provide satellite images to criminal and civil court cases. Pictured: Satellite image of London . From domestic disputes between homeowners to murder investigations, the space detectives will be able to provide satellite images for any given case. Mr Purdy, 41, who said the agency's services won't cost much more than having a property surveyed, said most of the detectives' work will involve providing and analysing images taken by orbiting satellites. However, in some cases where images with greater resolution are needed, they also plan to use aerial photos from drones. Mr Purdy told New Scientist: 'Trials have been collapsing because courts cannot be convinced of the authenticity of image data. 'We can make a difference by ensuring space images have audit trails that stand up,' The pair will draw upon their expertise in commissioning space images and their familiarity with space image suppliers like Digital Globe of Longmont in Colorado for their work. Mr Harris added: 'Because it is always possible to modify a digital image, you need strong archiving procedures plus information on when it was captured and what happened to it subsequently. We know how to do that.' Satellite imaging specialist Raymond Harris and space lawyer Raymond Purdy have teamed up to form the new company which will enable the public to obtain and use authentic satellite imagery to stand up a court case .

"Ten years ago, Andy Lee walked into the Mandalay Bay arena in Las Vegas, Nevada as an Olympian but tantalised by the lure of professional boxing and the fickle riches it promises. Now, just two days on from the 10th anniversary of that first visit to the Bright Light City, he steps into a Vegas ring determined to finally fulfil his dream of becoming a world champion. At the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas arena, the 30-year-old Limerick middleweight takes on fellow southpaw Matt Korobov, a 31-year-old Russian, for the vacant WBO world championship. Andy Lee is hoping to realise his dream of becoming a world champion on his return to Las Vegas . A decade on from being invited to watch Vitali Klitschko’s heavyweight title defence against Danny Williams by former trainer Emmanuel ‘Manny’ Steward, the Limerick native may live up to his old coach’s predictions after an eight-and-a-half year pro career. Hailed by the late and legendary Steward as his ‘left-handed Tommy Hearns’, Lee was tipped as a champion in waiting from the day he moved to Detroit’s Kronk Gym, eventually making his pro debut in March, 2006. Having gone unbeaten in 15 fights, a surprise 2008 loss to Texan Brian Vera upset his original title plans before the defeat was avenged three years later. But a seventh-round 2012 stoppage loss to then WBC champion Julio Cesar Chavez in his first title shot — with Lee halted on his feet — made many question Steward’s predication. ‘It’s gone fast but it’s been good and it’s all been necessary to get me to this point,’ says Lee on his 33-2 career. ‘All those experiences and all those years are needed physically and mentally to get to the point where I am now. I feel it’s the right time. ‘It’s almost 10 years ago to the day that I came here first to Las Vegas as a guest with Emmanuel. Ten years later, here I am, I’m going to fight for the world title so it’s been good in a roundabout way. It’s been 10 years and it’s time to do it.’ His determination to seize the moment is bolstered by the confidence he has gained since coming under the tutelage of Adam Booth, who trained David Haye to become unified cruiserweight world champion and later WBA heavyweight champion. Russian Matt Korobov knocks out Anthony Bartenelli during their Las Vegas bout in 2009 . During his rebuilding process after the loss to Chavez, Lee’s form was hard to judge with two knockout wins over weak opposition bookended by sluggish points wins over middling fighters. His most recent victory, however — a fifth-round knockout of John Jackson (son of two-weight world champ Julius) — not only became an internet sensation, it also suggested Lee’s ability had not wavered despite the fact that Jackson had earlier put him on the canvas for the first time in his career. ‘I feel like I’m boxing better than I ever have — like a seasoned professional,’ says the 30-year-old. ‘I’m still young enough to have the hunger and the enthusiasm, especially since I’ve been two years with Adam. It’s been a new challenge for me and it’s really refreshed me. Going to the gym every day and not knowing what I’m [going to be] doing, learning and improving every day. Now it’s time. I’m in my prime — if not now than never. ‘A lot of it [the slow rebuilding process] was intentional because I was still learning and it was a whole new thing training with Adam so I had to adjust to that so time was needed. This is the right time for me to fight and become a world champion.’ Standing in his way is the undefeated Korobov (24-0), a former two-time amateur world champion. A pugilistic paradox which makes the fight so unpredictable is the fact that, since turning pro in 2008, Korobov has yet to fight any opposition comparable to that which he faced as an amateur. ‘He is a good boxer. I know he hasn’t been that sensational [as a pro] but he’s beaten everybody he’s fought and has amateur pedigree,’ says Lee. ‘But I believe I have better basics than him. I’ve developed as a professional more so than he has. If anything, he’s gone backwards, he’s not the fighter he was as an amateur or at that level, comparatively as a professional. I see a good fighter but I don’t see one who can box consistently for 12 rounds. Andy Lee and trainer Adam Booth work out ahead of their world title fight . ‘He hasn’t fought a really meaningful fight that he has a good chance of losing, so that’s going to play on his mind. I’ve been in this situation so many times before where the outcome of the fight is uncertain. He’s going to find it to be his first really hard fight as a professional and I’m going to ask a lot of questions of him that he hasn’t been asked yet. ‘My aim is to match him all the way in the early rounds, be there with him, box him and come on strong going down the stretch. ‘That’s the way I see the fight going,’ says Lee, hinting at the bout going the distance, but adds: ‘He might try to come out and make a statement and try to bang me out of it and if he does, I’ll look forward to that because I’ll bang straight with him and whoever comes out of it will come out of it. My chin is proven and my power is proven.’","Andy Lee faces Matt Korobov for vacant WBO world championship .

"James DeGale emerged from the shadow of his domestic rivals on Saturday night before taking a dig at both Carl Froch and George Groves. DeGale arguably stole the show with his stunning third-round knockout of Marco Antonio Periban but the 2008 Olympic champion must now wait for Froch to decide if he will grant him a shot at his world title. ‘I like Carl but it feels like he doesn’t want to fight me. I respect him but I think he’s being a bit of a coward not fighting me. Fight me or vacate the title,’ DeGale said. James DeGale on his way to an impressive third-round stoppage of Marco Antonio Periban . Periban is slumped against the ropes and referee Howard Foster waved the fight off immediately . DeGale risked his position as mandatory challenger to Froch by taking on the experienced Periban but a left hook sent the Mexican sprawling and referee Howard Foster immediately waved the fight off. ‘I bet I still won’t get any credit. My last two performances have been against world-class opponents,’ said DeGale. ‘It doesn’t matter though, my next fight is for a world title.’ DeGale was followed into the ring by Groves who looked out of sorts before stopping Denis Douglin in the seventh. Groves was vulnerable in the early stages and doubts remain as to how well he has recovered from his brutal knockout defeat by Froch in May. George Groves struggled to get going but eventually stopped Denis Douglin in the seventh round . DeGale, who lost to Groves in 2011 and as an amateur, said: ‘I haven’t been impressed with him. I know he’s young but he looks a bit shot. His confidence isn’t there and he’s not fighting right.’ Anthony Joshua looks primed for his toughest test to date when he faces veteran American Kevin Johnson in London in January. Heavyweight Joshua recorded his 10th successive stoppage, pummelling Michael Sprott into submission after just 90 seconds. Johnson, however, is made of sterner stuff, having never been stopped despite facing Vitali Klitschko and Tyson Fury. Joshua said: ‘Johnson is durable and he’s got a lot of experience and quite a lot of mouth, so it should be fun.’ Anthony Joshua made short work of Michael Sprott, pummeling his experienced opponent inside 90 seconds .","James DeGale knocked out Marco Antonio Periban in the third round .

"'I don't want to call it destiny,' says Andy Lee, gazing out across the Las Vegas skyline from his penthouse suite on the 45th floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel. 'But something tells me the stars are aligning and this is my time.' It was a decade ago this week that Lee first set foot in Vegas as an amateur with a dream of one day making his mark on this famous strip of Nevada desert. So excited was the East London-born Irish kid that he filled up three disposable cameras with photos of him alongside all the famous boxers he met. Lee was the guest of his then-trainer Emanuel Steward, the fabled Hall of Famer, who was in town for Vitali Klitschko's fight with Danny Williams at the Mandalay Bay. A lot has changed since then: you'd never find a disposable camera on the strip these days, Klitschko is currently the mayor of Kiev and Steward passed away aged 68 in 2012. Andy Lee is hoping to realise his dream of becoming a world champion on his return to Las Vegas . Lee is put through his paces by trainer Adam Booth ahead of his showdown with Matt Korobov . For Lee these have been 10 years of ups and downs. In the ring, he lost his only other world title fight in June of that same year – against Julio Cesar Chavez Jr - and then had to cope with the loss of his mentor just four months later. So this trip, to take on Matt Korobov for the vacant WBO middleweight title at an Arena some 45 floors beneath his suite, is an emotional one for the 30-year-old. He said: 'Being back here brings back a lot of memories. America has a unique feel as a country but you can go away from it for a while but as soon as you touch down it all comes back – the people, the smells, the look of the place. 'It's nice to be back. It's almost 10 years to the day since I first came here. I was still amateur at the time and Emanuel invited me out to take it all in. Here I am 10 years later about to fight for my own title – it's funny how things work. 'I'll be honest, when I first started coming here I never really liked it. It's pure capitalism, this is where you come to waste money – very rich people and very poor people. But then I started enjoying it, you just can't take it too seriously when you're here. They say it's a playground and you have to try and treat it like that.' But he and his trainer Adam Booth are both deadly serious when it comes to the threat posed by Korobov. Russian Matt Korobov knocks out Anthony Bartenelli during their Las Vegas bout in 2009 . Lee's former trainer Emanuel Steward (left) passed away at the age of 68 in October 2012 . The Russian was arguably the planet's finest amateur in his pomp but he is yet to transfer to the paid ranks the dazzling talent shown in the vest and headguard. Korobov is undefeated in 24 fights but, despite being a year older than Lee at 31, is nowhere near as experienced as a professional. That could be key, according to the Limerick southpaw, who has fought and won three times here in Vegas during the early stages of his career. He added: 'I have all the experience for it now. I wasn't good enough for it before in terms of being a fighter and maybe I needed to learn more. If it had happened then maybe it wouldn't have lasted but now it's going to happen, I'm going to win and I'm a better fighter for it. 'It's all coming together at the right time. Even with the bad experience I had with the Chavez fight, had I not had that then, I wouldn't be this well prepared now.' Lee knocked out American boxer John Jackson during the fifth round of his last fight in June . Lee (left) has described Booth (right) as 'hands-down the best trainer in the world' The majority of the preparation for this fight has been done at another of the world's famed gambling districts, Monte Carlo, where Booth now lives. The man once labelled 'The Dark Lord' steered David Haye to the WBA heavyweight title then George Groves to the brink of world honours. Lee describes him as 'hands-down the best trainer in the world' and also explained why Vegas is to thank for Booth's love of boxing. 'Look across there,' Lee says, pointing to a white building some 500m away. 'Caesars Palace, where Thomas Hearns and Sugar Ray Leonard fought for the first time in 1981 – and of course Emanuel Steward was Hearns' trainer. 'That was that fight that got Adam into boxing, he was taken to the cinema to watch it and that's where it all started for him. Now, here he is, with me, one of Emanuel Steward's fighters, about to fight for a world title and we can see the place from our balcony. 'If that's not destiny, if you want to call it that, I don't know what is.'","Andy Lee takes on Matt Korobov for the vacant WBO middleweight title .

"Wigan's players have offered to pay half of the cost of away tickets for their trip to Leeds on Boxing Day after fans complained about the prices set by the Whites. Numerous Latics supporters contacted their club with complaints about the fees for the game at Elland Road, which are currently priced at £36 for advanced sales and go up to £41 on the day. Wigan's own players have now stepped in to offer financial aid for that Sky Bet Championship fixture on December 26 by paying 50 per cent on the first 500 advance tickets sold. Wigan have struggled in the Championship this season and are currently in the relegation zone in 23rd place . Wigan fans complained to the club that the prices to watch the club at Leeds on Boxing Day was too much . 'Christmas is an expensive time of year for everyone, especially football fans, and we want to show our appreciation to the fans who follow us week-in, week-out by making this gesture,' said club captain Gary Caldwell. 'To have the fans behind us is a massive boost for the players and we know that we haven't been able to give them as much back this season as we want. If this helps to get them to Elland Road and give us their support then we are glad we can help.' Chief executive Jonathan Jackson added: 'It's a lovely one-off gesture by the players and I hope very much the fans take up their offer because we need as many supporters there as possible. Wigan manager Malky Mackay has endured a torrid start to his tenure and is yet to record a victory . 'It is a situation we do not have any control over as a club as it is the decision of every home club to set match-day ticket prices for their own stadium and it is not up to us to comment upon that. 'But it demonstrates once more how the players genuinely appreciate the support they receive from our fans.'

"A porn star has publicly named and shamed Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Michael Del Zotto claiming the NHL star is 'constantly pestering her to arrange dates'. Adult film actress and director Lisa Ann posted a string of embarrassing messages on Twitter suggesting the sportsman persistently asks her to organize rendezvous with other women. She calls him the 'most annoying texter in the history of my life' and notes: 'Strange, most guys want to date me, not use me to find other dates.' Embarrassing: Porn star Lisa Ann has posted a series of messages on Twitter describing how star NHL player Michael Del Zotto constantly pesters her to arrange dates with other women . Del Zotto, 24, was a New York Rangers first-round draft choice in 2008 and played in the city from 2009 until 2014, when the Blueshirts traded him to the Nashville Predators. But Nashville wouldn't re-sign him, and Del Zotto, known for his shaky off-ice reputation, became a free agent until Philadelphia Flyers signed him this summer on a one-year contract. Lisa Ann, 42, has been in the adult film industry for more than 20 years - while also making mainstream appearances on the the Howard Stern Show and in a music video for rapper Eminem. As well as posting the revelations about Del Zotto's questionable dating methods, the porn star also told her 750,000 followers the story of how they became acquainted. Defenseman: Del Zotto signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers in August after spending time as a free agent . She wrote: '(S)hort story... It all started about 2 years ago when I was hosting an event @MichaelDelZotto reached out to the promoter to meet me.. 'I looked him up, he was with the Rangers at the time, looked cute, I thought ok, Pro Athlete, he won't try to kill or rob me, so sure I will. 'So, we go on a date, its nice, hang out- yada yada yada... about a week later he started asking if could hook him up with girls on the road. Revelation: After telling her 750,000 Twitter followers that Del Zotto 'pesters her', the adult film actress then told the story of how the two met (right, the porn star poses as politician Sarah Palin) 'I say NO... I say YO, you are a cute kid, you can pull tail, if not have your agent do it.. just don't ask me.... 'After 4 months of going to games and explaining that to him, I finally gave up.. so about a year goes by and we don't talk.. 'We reconnect and start talking and we get right back to this before we even had another date our selves.. I did warn him of this outcome.' Tell all: Lisa Ann fails to hold back in her assessment of the ice hockey star's behaviour .

"As reports swirl that the future of TLC's surprise hit reality series Here Comes Honey Boo Boo hangs in the balance after it was revealed that 'Mama June' Shannon is dating a child sex offender, her daughter Pumpkin has come out swinging in her defence. Hoping to set the record straight, 14-year-old Lauryn Shannon - otherwise known as Pumpkin - has spoken toRadarOnline about her mom's prior relationship with Mark McDaniel in a bid to douse the flames. 'The story is not true. My mom left Mark 10 years ago,' the teenager insists, adding: 'They haven’t seen nor talked [to each other] in 10 years.' Scroll down for video . 'The story is not true. My mom left Mark 10 years ago': Here Comes Honey Boo Boo star Mama June Shannon is reportedly dating convicted sex offender Mark McDaniel - allegedly pictured here in a hotel room last month, which daughter Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon has slammed as 'Photoshopped' While TMZ has obtained a photo allegedly taken a month ago of the 34-year-old reality star snuggling up to the 53-year-old in a hotel bed, Pumpkin has slammed the evidence as simply 'Photoshopped'. With Mama June having separated from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson just last month after she allegedly discovered the 42-year-old actively trolling for women on various dating websites, her daughter says the mom-of-four is enjoying the single life. 'She is all about the kids. She only needs us girls, no-one else,' Pumpkin states. 'We are all sticking together as one happy family with us four girls.' The matriarch is also mom to Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson, nine, Jessica 'Chubs' Shannon, 17, and Anna 'Chickadee' Shannon Cardwell, 20. 'She is all about the kids': Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14 - seen here in March 2013 - insists her mom and her ex 'haven't seen nor talked [to each other] in 10 years' and the recently separated star is enjoying the single life since splitting from long-time partner Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson last month . The three youngest girls still live at home in MacIntyre, Georgia, while Anna - who has a two-year-old daughter, Kaitlyn - has since moved to Alabama after marrying baby daddy Michael Cardwell. According to reports confirmed by the MailOnline, Mark McDaniel is a registered sex offender in the reality show's home state of Georgia. The registry details that Mark only got out of prison in March after he was convicted in 2004 of aggravated child molestation, which is 'when such person commits an offense of child molestation which act physically injures the child or involves an act of sodomy'. TMZ reports that Mama June has been dating her ex for the last few months, citing the aforementioned photo as proof of their liaisons. Just released: Mark was released from prison last month after being jailed for 10 years for molesting an unnamed eight-year-old relative of then-girlfriend Mama June's . The pair were also said to be romantically involved at the time of his arrest. Horrifyingly, TMZ claims that McDaniel was convicted of assault one of June's own relatives. The website reports: 'Prosecutors say he molested an eight-year-old child - forcing oral sex. 'We're told Honey Boo Boo's mom has been seeing McDaniel for the last few months ... sneaking away from production of the show and meeting up with him. We're told she's also been setting him up by buying him various gifts.' In light of the revelations, TLC said it is now examining whether the show will continue. Serious charge: The 53-year-old - pictured here in a mug shot believed to be from his original arrest - was convicted of aggravated child molestation reportedly perpetrated against an eight-year-old . Registered: McDaniel's crime is public record on the Georgian sex offender registry, as part of his release requires him to keep authorities constantly updated on his whereabouts . A representative told the MailOnline: 'TLC is not currently in production on Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. We are very concerned about this new information and are reassessing the future of the series.' TMZ contacted Mama June for comment but has yet to receive a response. The reality star does have a history of dating convicted criminals - including estranged partner Sugar Bear, who is the father of her youngest daughter and show star Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson. In 1998, he was sentenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper. In doubt: The future of Mama June's show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo - which stars her youngest daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson - is now being reassessed . Recent split: Last month, the reality matriarch and her partner on nine years, David Michael 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, revealed they had separated. The couple shared a televised commitment ceremony last year . The couple - who had a televised commitment ceremony last year after nine years together - only announced their split last month, but it is understood Mama June may have already been dating Mark at the time. Tragically, this is not the only sex offender that Mama June has been linked to. The father of Honey Boo Boo’s 17-year-old sister Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon, Michael Anthony Ford, 37, who dated her mother just a few months before she became pregnant, is currently behind bars. Criminal past: In 1998, Sugar Bear was sentenced to five years in the nearby Montgomery Prison for robbing a series of campsites and setting fire to at least one camper . In 2008, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet due to an offence committed in 2005. According to prison documents, he was charged with two more counts of sexual exploration of a child, also steaming from 2005, and is currently serving 10 years for each charge. He is not expected to be released until 2026. Here Comes Honey Boo Boo first aired in 2012 and was a spin-off from TLC's Toddlers And Tiaras. The show aired its fourth season finale in August and, prior to the controversy, there had been no announcement on whether it would be renewed.

'When I try to find a way of summarising the attitude of the team, and of some longer-serving individuals, I keep alighting on the word “bored”,' added Scholes. 'It just seems the most accurate way to describe the way the team seem to treat the style of football that once made them the best side on the planet.' Xavi and Sergio Busquets were two of the Barca stars responsible for making their short-passing style the envy of world football, but both played in the Barca team Scholes branded bored with the tactics. Busquets scored the winning goal in the final minute of the game. Scholes also confessed he thought Neymar was 'a bit lightweight'. But while admitting that Messi's goalscoring feats over the last decade 'put him in a different category to the rest of us who played the game', Scholes also said that the Argentina forward no longer works as hard as he did during Barca's glory days. Scholes experienced defeat in European football's biggest match against Barcelona in 2009 . Scholes watches on as Barcelona celebrate their triumph over Manchester United at Wembley in 2011 . Pep Guardiola's team are arguably the greatest club side in modern football . 'In him, as much as anyone, I detected that mood of boredom,' said Scholes. 'He has never been a player given to chasing the full-back when his team lose the ball, but now, more than ever, he keeps his movement to an absolute minimum.' Barcelona lost out on the La Liga title to Atletico Madrid last season and watched as bitter rivals Real Madrid became European champions. Their last major trophy was the Spanish league title in 2013 under Tito Vilanova's management. Guardiola won three La Liga titles, the Copa del Rey twice, two UEFA Super Cups, two FIFA Club World Cups, as well as the two Champions League crowns in four years at the Nou Camp from 2008.

"Pope Francis waves today in the Vatican. The Sistine Chapel is where popes are elected in secret . The Vatican has announced that the number of visitors to the Sistine Chapel will be restricted in a bid to protect the fragile frescoes inside - but at the same time, the space has been hired out by Porsche. The German car manufacturer currently offers an exclusive tour of Rome - complete with access to the Vatican's treasures outside official opening hours. Priced at more than 4,000 Euros per person, the itinerary includes a concert in the Sistine Chapel - famed for its ceiling painted by Michelangelo. This is described on the company's website as 'an extraordinary experience'. The tour also includes a dinner in the midst of the exhibition at the Vatican Museums and a visit to the papal gardens at the Vatican and the Necropolis. But at the same time, it was announced today that visitors to the Sistine Chapel - where popes are elected in secret conclaves - will be limited to six million a year to protect the delicate frescoes inside. These have suffered damage by growing crowds of tourists, an official said today. Visitors to the chapel can reach 20,000 a day in summer, with up to 2,000 people inside at a time. Dust brought in from outside, body sweat and carbon dioxide pose a major risk to Michelangelo's ceiling frescoes, which are more than 500 years old. They include one of the most famous scenes in the history of art - the arm of a bearded God reaching out to give life to Adam. To protect the work of the Renaissance master, the Vatican has installed a new climate control system that will filter the air in the chapel. There will also be a new high-tech lighting system that will cut damaging heat by more than half. 'I am convinced that the Vatican Museums, in particular the Sistine Chapel, have reached the maximum number of visitors possible,' Antonio Paolucci, head of the Vatican Museums, said at a news conference to introduce the new lighting and climate control systems. Porsche are offering an exclusive tour of Rome, costing more than 4,000 euros per person, which includes a concert inside the chapel. Pictured, a Porsche Boxster . Paolucci said the current number of six million visitors a year would be the maximum tolerated. 'We did not do all this in order to allow more people into the Sistine Chapel.' Work on the new systems began in June and are expected to be in place by the end of this month. Michelangelo's frescoes, inaugurated in October 1512 by Pope Julius II, underwent a major 14-year restoration that ended in 1994. They also include the famous 'Last Judgement' on the wall behind the altar, which the artist painted separately in 1535 and 1541.

White smoke comes out from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel indicating that a pope had been chosen . In recent years, art historians and restorers have called for severe limits on the number of tourists allowed to enter the chapel, part of the vast Vatican Museums complex. Paolucci said the current system - a mix of reservations made through the Internet or travel agencies and queuing up outside - would continue for the time being but did not exclude the possibility of switching to a reservations-only system. Apart from the potential damage to the frescoes, critics have also said the number of people allowed into the chapel should be reduced for reasons of decorum because it is also a place of worship. But Paolucci appeared to rule this out. 'We all would like the Sistine Chapel miraculously empty ... but we live in the democracy of consumption,' he said.

"Luis Suarez has assured Barcelona supporters the goals will soon start to come for him at the Nou Camp but admitted he needs to start acting on instinct in front of goal. In an interview with Radio Cataluyna the former Liverpool striker also tipped Javier Mascherano to become a top manager after he retires, Neymar to become the best player in the world, and opens up about telling his four-year-old daughter why he could not play football when he first joined the club. 'We have got the best player in the world in Leo [Messi] and the player who is going to be the best player in the world in the future in Neymar,' said Suarez who has so far been king of the assists in Barca's front three with five passes to goal but only one goal. Luis Suarez looks on with frustration after going close to scoring for Barcelona against Valencia on Sunday . On the subject of scoring he said: 'I got annoyed with myself for the first miss [against Valencia] there was a doubt in the finish, I changed my mind just as I was going to hit it. It was a good job we won because I would have felt even worse. Then I scored a perfectly good goal that was wrongly ruled out for offside. 'I have to get back to just going with my instinct. I had a chance in Cyprus in the Champions League [against Apoel] when Leo set me up and I had the far post to aim for but I wanted to make absolutely sure and tried to hit it hard. I have to forget myself a bit and just go with instinct.' Barcelona are currently two points behind Real Madrid in the table having lost the Clasico last month. 'We know it is going to be difficult because Real Madrid are very strong but they can slip at any time as we have slipped in the past, that happens in football. We have to keep getting better game by game and we know the obligation is to win,' he said. Suarez celebrates with his team-mates after their last victory over Valencia in La Liga on Sunday evening . And on the pressures of living up to the Golden Shoe reputation he joined from Liverpool with he added: 'I know I've come here to score goals but all the time the team is doing well and I feel that I'm helping the team then I'm going to be very happy. 'If the team starts doing badly and I'm not scoring then I will have to face the criticism but while the team is winning and I'm helping then it's fine. I want to help with goals, of course I do, but we also have two other phenomenal strikers who score a lot of goals so it is not a drama.' Despite hitting it off with Neymar and Messi, it is Javier Mascherano who Suarez has spent the most time with since joining, having moved into the same Gava neighbourhood on the Costa Brava. And he has tipped the Argentine to go on to become a top manager when he retires. He told Radio Cataluyna: 'He is going to be a wonderful coach. He is very intelligent and he sees the game so well. I love him as a player and he'd be someone who I would always want to have on my side. He's clever, he's a leader but he also is great team-player. And you put him anywhere on the pitch and he will deliver.' The former Liverpool star has only scored one goal for Barcelona since his arrival in the summer . Suarez celebrates his first goal for Barcelona against Apoel Nicosia FC in the Champions League last week . Asked about the disciplinary problems that have plagued his career he said: 'Now I am trying to argue less with rival players. I'm not going to stop fighting for the ball but I'm trying not to fall into the trap of getting involved with defenders because I know I could come off worse because of things that have happened in the past.' The Uruguyan also opened up on how he told his daughter why he was not initially playing at Barcelona. 'She is four-years-old but she takes everything in and it hurt me a lot when she started asking why I wasn't playing,' he said. 'At first I would say that it was because of my knee injury. But when we played Rayo Vallecano and I was at home watching the game and she asked me why I was not playing. I said: ''Daddy made a mistake and they have shown him a red card''. And she said ''okay!'' and that was it. There were still a couple more games to play but she never asked me about it again. 'Now she is happy that I'm playing and she knows all the players' names which surprises me a lot. I called her the morning after I scored my first goal in Cyprus against Apoel and she said: ''You scored a goal Daddy and Leo scored two''. I said to her: ''No, Leo scored three'' and she said: ''I only saw two, I fell asleep after that''. So she is keeping an eye on who is scoring the goals.' Suarez has performed well for Barcelona thus far with five assists but promises the goals will come soon .","Former Liverpool star has scored only one goal in seven Barcelona games .

"Premier League defenders Vincent Kompany, Branislav Ivanovic and Pablo Zabaleta have all been shortlisted for the FIFA FIFPro World XI - but there is not a single Englishman on the list. FIFA released the 20-man list of defenders on Wednesday and it is the first time  that not a single English defender has been shortlisted for the team. In a position that has been well represented by England in the past, it is a damning indictment of Roy Hodgson's squad not to have any defenders selected.

"Bayern Munich winger Franck Ribery believes either Manuel Neuer or Arjen Robben deserve to win the 2014 FIFA Ballon d'Or - but fears 'politics' could work against them. Bayern goalkeeper Neuer, widely regarded as the best number one in the world, helped Germany win the World Cup, while Holland forward Robben enjoyed an excellent campaign with club and country. Both men are on the 23-strong shortlist for the award, but Cristiano Ronaldo is the favourite to win for a second straight year after leading Real Madrid to Champions League success. Manuel Neuer conceded three goals at Man City on Tuesday but he is regarded as the world's best goalkeeper . Franck Ribery believes Neuer, lifting the World Cup this summer, should win the Ballon d'Or . Ribery also states that Bayern Munich team-mate Arjen Robben deserves the Ballon d'or award . Ribery finished third in the voting last time and insisted afterwards he deserved to have won it ahead of Ronaldo for his success with Bayern. Asked about what he expected this time around, he said in an interview with Sport Bild: 'What can I say? For me, Manuel Neuer or Arjen Robben have to win it, there are only two views. 'Manu has won everything, is a good person, not arrogant. Arjen played an unbelievable last Bundesliga season and after that an excellent World Cup. But I fear that there is still a lot of politics.

'The Golden Ball for the best player? I don't believe that any more. In 2006 (Italy defender Fabio) Cannavaro won - because he was world champion, that's all.' Ribery insists he is not bothered the award for the world's best player has eluded him. 'I am not jealous, this title means nothing to me today,' the Frenchman added. Bayern Munich are currently top of Bundesliga and have qualified for the last 16 in the Champions League . Ribery also revealed he came close to leaving Bayern for Madrid in 2009, when Louis van Gaal took over as coach, saying his agent spoke with Madrid officials. Ribery, who also said Chelsea and Manchester City were interested in him, added: 'I was pulled one way and then the other, that made my head spin. I was on the verge of leaving. I then had two, three conversations with (former general manager) Uli Hoeness and (chairman) Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. And they were really cool, I will never forget that.' The forward claimed both Madrid and Chelsea had offered 'crazy' transfer fees of '60, 65, 70, or even 80 million euros'.","Last year's winner Cristiano Ronaldo is favourite to retain the award .

"Manuel Neuer has hit out at Cristiano Ronaldo, claiming that the Real Madrid star will win the Ballon d'Or as much for his image as his skills. The Germany goalkeeper is considered one of the front-runners for this year's award, but some way behind the favourite Ronaldo. Neuer seemed to suggest his chances are hampered because, unlike Ronaldo, he doesn't go in for the 'red-carpet' lifestyle, or have underwear modelling deals. VIDEO Scroll down to see a saving masterclass from Manuel Neuer . Manuel Neuer was scathing about Cristiano Ronaldo in his interview with the German magazine Kicker . Ronaldo has produced his own line of underwear and is as famous off the pitch as on it . Neuer won the World Cup with Germany this summer but doesn't expect to take the individual honour . 'I'm a sportsman, not an ambassador for a brand, beyond being Adidas' first goalkeeper,' Neuer told Kicker. 'I'm not some guy who poses in his underpants.' 'I don't like the red carpet. I prefer the green turf. I feel better on the pitch trying to be the best I can be.' Neuer was a key part of the Germany team that won last summer's World Cup, and the most likely from the squad to win the individual award. Ronaldo, who will be playing at Old Trafford on Tuesday night, is the favourite for the Ballon d'Or . The Real Madrid star has won the Ballon d'Or twice, most recently in 2013, and looks set to win again . Neuer says it is difficult for goalkeepers to win the award, which hasn't gone to a stopper since 1963 . But the Bayern Munich stopper believes that goalkeepers have little chance of winning individual awards. The Ballon d'Or has not been awarded to a goalkeeper since 1963, and only two defenders have won it in the past 20 years. 'After the games, the main things they show are goals, the chances, the assists,' explained Neuer. 'Spectators don't tend to remember that the keeper stopped difficult balls by taking a big risk or organised the play from the back.' Argentina captain Lionel Messi will hope to show on Tuesday night that he is still on a level with Ronaldo . Ronaldo has won the Ballon d'Or twice while Lionel Messi has been given the award on four occassions . Ronaldo is on course to win the Ballon d'Or for the third time, and the second in a row, but faces competition from Neuer and four-time winner Lionel Messi. The two front-runners will meet in an international friendly at Old Trafford on Tuesday night when Argentina take on Portugal, in a game that is being billed as a shoot-out for the top individual award. Both players have been backed by their respective international managers and team-mates ahead of the voting, with Portugal manager Fernando Santos conceding 'they are both genius'. Messi and Ronaldo, unlike Neuer, are the most famous and most marketable players in world football, and whatever happens at Old Trafford, are likely to dominate the votes.

"Manchester United striker Robin van Persie has put his early season dip in form down to finding it 'difficult to get back into the flow' after competing in international tournaments with Holland. Van Persie played a major role in the Dutch national team's progress to the World Cup semi-finals under the guidance of now Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal. The Red Devils star took part in Holland's World Cup play-off match against Brazil on July 12 before joining up with his Manchester United team-mates on August 4 after being given an extended break by Van Gaal.

The 31-year-old was part of the Dutch national team which reached the 2014 World Cup semi-finals . Van Persie, speaking to Sky Sports before his side's match against Liverpool, said: 'I have played in five tournaments now and based on the period after it was always quite difficult to get back into the flow. 'It was a tough start for me and the team. I think it was easier for me because I was working with Van Gaal for the past two years with Holland.

"Ronny Deila has expressed hope that a compromise deal can still be reached to keep Kris Commons at Celtic beyond the end of the season. Commons spoke out after the 4-3 Europa League defeat from Dinamo Zagreb on Thursday evening, insisting the current deal on the table was unacceptable and confirming he was after a longer agreement to fulfil his wish of remaining in Glasgow. Deila responded on Friday by stating that the 31-year-old had not simply been offered a 12-month extension, but rather that the club was trying to ‘structure’ a deal with the potential for a longer stay if certain criteria are met. Kris Commons (centre) believes his latest contract offer from Celtic is unacceptable . Ronny Deila is confident Celtic can strike a deal to keep Commons at Parkhead . English clubs are monitoring the impasse ahead of next month’s transfer window, but Deila claimed Celtic were happy to keep working towards a possible agreement. ‘It’s about negotiation,’ said Deila. ‘Kris wants something, we want something and it’s about agreeing on something that we both want to do. ‘It is not right to say that he is only being offered a one-year deal. We are talking about a structured deal. That’s where the difference is. ‘There is no deadline for an agreement. He has a contract until the end of the season, so there is no big rush. The rush will be if he can find some other clubs in January. But if he looks at the contract, he is going to stay here for the rest of the season. ‘It’s not a case of him being offered the contract and told to take it or leave it. Not from our side. If it’s from him, then he is playing a hardball game and we will see. Commons in action during Celtic's 4-3 Europa League defeat against Dinamo Zagreb . ‘I still see a future for him here. He is a good player.’ Asked if the contract could be appearance-linked, Deila said: ‘That’s the structure of the deal, yes. We are talking about different things when you have older players. I had the same thing at Stromsgodset. If older players get very long contracts, then you never know with them. ‘If they get a bad injury, how long can they keep up? Are they keeping their legs? And when is their passion gone? So if you give them a long contract it is a risk for the club. That’s why we need to think about what we are doing. ‘But of course there are circumstances which could keep him here for three or four years. That’s up to Kris and the club to agree. Commons is adamant he wants to remain with Celtic but made it clear better terms will have to be put forward . 'It is a positive thing that both parties want it.’ Meanwhile, Celtic are waiting to discover if they will be back in the UEFA dock after a flare was let off among their supporters at the game in Zagreb. If UEFA match delegate Miroslaw Ryszka includes the incident — which led to a clash with Croatian police — then Celtic are likely to face punishment. Club officials had told supporters not to bring flares to the game and warned that it could lead to disciplinary action from the governing body.

"Robin van Persie insists he is back to his best and has denied suggestions he is over the hill. Van Persie will look to continue his recent good form on Sunday when Manchester United host bitter rivals Liverpool. The arrival of Radamel Falcao, and Wayne Rooney's appointment as captain had led some to question the 31-year-old's place in the starting XI. Robin van Persie has denied reports he is over the hill, and insists he has plenty of years ahead of him . Louis van Gaal (left) placed faith in his striker and has been rewarded with goals in United's last three games . The striker looked a shadow of the man who scored 29 goals in his debut year at Old Trafford at the start of this campaign. But after scoring three goals in his last three games - including a match-winning brace against Southampton - Van Persie believes he has reached peak form again, which is handy for United ahead of their biggest home fixture of the season. 'When you hit 30 and you're having a bad spell everyone say it's because you're 30 or 31 and things might be over for you,' the United striker told MUTV. 'I live a quiet life for my football and I'm almost convinced now that I will play for many years to come at the highest level, at least that's what I want and what I'm aiming for. Van Persie (left) celebrates with Ashley Young after scoring against Southampton on Monday . The Dutch forward is fouled by Southampton's Sadio Mane at St Mary's Stadium . 'The age thing is not an issue for me at all.' Van Persie's poor showing at the start of the season was something of a mystery given his excellent displays under Louis van Gaal at the World Cup. Van Persie scored one of the goals of the tournament during the group stages when he fired a superb diving header over Iker Casillas during Holland's 5-1 shock win over Spain. Van Persie says playing every game for the Dutch in the World Cup took its toll on him and he suffered as a result when the domestic season began. 'It was a hard start to this season,' Van Persie said. Van Persie held his arms out to the Manchester United faithful at St Mary's on Monday . There was doubt over Van Persie's position at United after the arrival on Falcao (left) and the decision to name Wayne Rooney (right) as captain of the club . 'It's hard to maybe pick things up straight away after the World Cup. 'It can be tough to really get back to your best form. 'But over the past couple of weeks I've been feeling very well physically. 'I feel like I can make more runs and keep things going up until the last bit of the game. I feel good and I don't think it's a coincidence that the goals are flowing in much better now.' Van Persie was part of the United team that was hammered 3-0 by Liverpool in March. It was one of the most embarrassing results of last season and was one of the reasons why David Moyes was sacked two months later. Moyes, unforgivably in the eyes of some United fans, said Liverpool were the favourites to win the match before kick-off, but this time it is the hosts who are being tipped for victory. After a run of five straight wins, United have shaken off their early-season disappointment and are now just eight points below Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea. Jonny Evans (right) celebrates Van Persie's goal against Southampton on Monday night . Van Persie spent time with seriously ill supporters at the club's training complex this week . But Van Gaal, never happy with anything but the best, is still not satisfied with the fact that his team are third in the standings behind Chelsea and Manchester City. 'I dream for Manchester City's place or Chelsea's place,' the Dutchman admitted, frankly. '(But) now we have to live match for match and that is the most important thing.' Van Gaal got a little taste of the rivalry between United and Liverpool in pre-season when the two teams met in Miami for the final of the International Champions Cup. United cook Mike Donnelly made it clear to United's new manager just how important it was to get one over on their rivals that day even though the match was a friendly. 'Even on the tour of the United States, all the members of my staff were (talking about the rivalry with Liverpool),' Van Gaal said. 'We have a cook and his name is Mike and when I don't know about anything to do with United and rival clubs he shall say it. 'He is a big Manchester United fan and I hear immediately from him.' Gary Neville claimed on Monday United and Liverpool resembled two pub teams this year while ex assistant manager Mike Phelan also weighed in with criticism of the club's physio department. Van Gaal could not care less, though. When asked if he or his squad had been affected by the criticism, he replied: 'No, because I don't think somebody who is living outside the community of Manchester United can judge how we are doing. It is based on no facts. I analyse everything and it is based on no facts.'","The arrival of Radamel Falcao cast doubt over Robin van Persie's place .

"The Florida mother who has complained about Toys 'R Us selling Breaking Bad action figures has learned that it's best to tread lightly so as not to get Bryan Cranston mad. Cranston, the star of the critically acclaimed AMC drama about a cancer-stricken chemistry teacher-turned-genius meth cook, responded Monday to Susan Schrivjer on Twitter, proving that not only is he the one who knocks, but he is also the one who has the last word . '""Florida mom petitions against Toys 'R Us over Breaking Bad action figures."" I'm so mad, I'm burning my Florida Mom action figure in protest,' Cranston, 58, fired off to his followers, sending ripples of glee through the Twitter-sphere. Scroll down for video . He's the one who tweets: Bryan Cranston took a funny swipe at a Florida mother who has complained about the presence of Breaking Bad action figures in toy stores . Apples of discord: Susan Schrivjer has called on Toys 'R Us to pull these action figures of Cranston as Walter White and Aaron Paul and Jesse Pinkman pulled from the racks . Susan Schrivjer, from Fort Myers, Florida, made national headlines this week when she launched an online campaign to have action figures of Cranston's Walter White and Aaron Paul's Jesse Pinkman pulled from Toys 'R Us' racks. 'I was very shocked and appalled,' Schrivjer told the Today show about stumbling across the figures. For the shockingly uninformed: the popular show followed the transformation of mild-mannered high school  teacher Walter White into ruthless drug kingpin Heisenberg when a diagnosis of terminal cancer forces him to cook meth as a means to secure his family's future. Both White and his business partner, Jesse Pinkman, have action figure versions completed with gas masks, a duffel bag of cash, and a toy bag of Heisenberg's trademark blue crystal meth. 'Anything to do with drugs is not doing the right thing,' Schrivjer told Today. 'I just think that they need to look at their visions and values, as they call them.' Fully loaded: Both White and his business partner have action figure versions complete with gas masks, a duffel bag of cash, and a toy bag of crystal meth . Doppelgangers: Cranston, 58, who portrayed Walter White/Heisenberg in Breaking Bad (left), was evidently not amused by the campaign targeting the action figures . She has since put a petition up to remove the figures at Change.org, garnering 8,000 signatures as of Tuesday afternoon. 'I was very shocked and appalled,' Susan Schrivjer told reporters about stumbling across the figures . 'Toys R Us is well known around the world for their vast selection of toys for children of all ages. However their decision to sell a Breaking Bad doll, complete with a detachable sack of cash and a bag of meth, alongside children’s toys is a dangerous deviation from their family friendly values,' the petition states. 'While the show may be compelling viewing for adults, its violent content and celebration of the drug trade make this collection unsuitable to be sold alongside Barbie dolls and Disney characters.' In response, Toys 'R Us told NBC News that 'the product packaging clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up.' Also, the toys, which are carried in limited quantities, 'are located in the adult action figure area of our stores.' In an interview with the station WFTX, Schrivjer admitted that she was a fan of Breaking Bad and found the show 'riveting.' But she expressed concerns that children playing with figurines of Heisenberg and Jesse Pinkman would come to mimic their criminal behavior. 'Do you want your child in an orange jumpsuit?' she wondered aloud, referring to the meth cooks' work attire on the show. Toys 'R Us says 'the product packaging clearly notes that the items are intended for ages 15 and up' and only available in the store's adult action figures area . The Florida mom said that while she loved the show, she does not want her kids running around dressed in orange jumpsuits like Walter and Jesse (pictured)","Bryan Cranston, 58, took to Twitter to mock Susan Schrivjer's online campaign to rid Toys 'R Us stores of Breaking Bad figurines .

"Sebastian Vettel has described his move to Ferrari as an 'incredible honour' after signing a three-year deal to replace Fernando Alonso. Alonso is heading for McLaren, the team he left so acrimoniously in 2007, with Vettel ending his stay at Red Bull. Vettel, the four-time world champion, will team up with Kimi Raikkonen at the Prancing Horse. He will earn about £50million a year as the highest-paid driver in history. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Sebastian Vettel showing off in the desert . Sebastian Vettel, pictured in the Abu Dhabi paddock on Thursday, has signed a three-year deal with Ferrari . Vettel enjoyed a successful relationship with Red Bull, winning four world titles with the Milton Keynes team . Vettel and Fernando Alonso are sat alongside each other at the press conference ahead of the Abu Dhabi GP . 'The next stage of my Formula One career will be spent with Scuderia Ferrari and for me that means the dream of a lifetime has come true,' Vettel said. 'When I was a kid, Michael Schumacher in the red car was my greatest idol and now it’s an incredible honour to finally get the chance to drive a Ferrari. 'I already got a small taste of what the Ferrari spirit means, when I took my first win at Monza in 2008, with an engine from the Prancing Horse built in Maranello. 'The Scuderia has a great tradition in this sport and I am extremely motivated to help the team get back to the top. I will put my heart and soul into making it happen.' The two announcements have been the worst-kept secrets in Formula One. Whilst there has been no confirmation from Alonso as to his future plans, it is understood he has already agreed a deal to return to McLaren which will be announced in December. The team are still mulling over whether Jenson Button or Kevin Magnussen will partner Alonso from 2015. Vettel celebrates his fourth world title on the pit straight at the Indian Grand Prix in October 2013 . Alonso leaves after five years at Ferrari - here he is pictured celebrating his last win at the 2013 Spanish GP . Double world champion Alonso flies the Ferrari flag after winning the Chinese Grand Prix in 2013 . For Alonso, it is the end of his five-year relationship with the team which ultimately has failed to yield the third world title he long believed would be his in switching allegiance to the Maranello marque. The Spaniard did finish runner-up on three occasions, missing out by four points in 2010 and just three in 2012, whilst he was a long way adrift last season, with Vettel champion on each occasion. Instead, Alonso leaves with only 11 victories to his name, the last of which was on home soil in Spain last season, as well as another 33 podiums. Since Red Bull's announcement of Vettel's departure seven weeks ago, Alonso has since played games with the media when quizzed on his future plans. Although apparently knowing where he is heading, the 33-year-old still conceded leaving Ferrari was tough. Alonso is expected to replace 2009 world champion Jenson Button at McLaren next season . Alonso said: 'Today is not an easy one for me, because even if I always look to the future with great enthusiasm and determination, at the end of this season my journey as a Ferrari driver will come to an end. 'It was a difficult decision to take, but a carefully considered one, and from start to finish, my love for Ferrari was a prime consideration. 'I have always been lucky enough to make my own decisions about my future and I have that possibility now too. 'I must thank the team for that, as it understood my position. 'I leave Scuderia Ferrari after five years, during which I reached my very best level professionally, tackling major challenges that pushed me to find new limits. I also proved to be a true team player, putting the interests of the Scuderia before my own. Michael Schumacher won five world championships with Ferrari at the turn of the century . Schumacher is presented with a trophy by football legend Pele ahead of the 2006 Brazilian Grand Prix . 'When I had to take important decisions about my future, I did so with Ferrari in my heart, driven by my love for the team. 'I am very proud of what we have achieved together. Thanks to the efforts of the men and women of Maranello, on three occasions we came second in the Formula One world championship, two of them fighting for the title right up to and including the final race, running in a championship winning position for many laps. 'Without a shadow of a doubt, these five years produced some of the best moments of my career. 'I also feel that, in leaving the team, it is family rather than friends I am leaving behind. 'Now I look to the future with great enthusiasm, knowing that part of my heart will always belong to the Prancing Horse.

Gascoigne is understood to want Sean Bean to play him, and the film is apparently at the 'planning stage' 'An initial contract has been signed. We're working with a well-respected production company who have been nominated for an Oscar in the past,' a source told the Daily Star. 'Paul has had an incredible life and we know they'll do it justice on screen. He's very excited.' The newspaper reported that 55-year-old Bean may be ruled out of playing the lead role due to his age. Other suggestions are Danny Dyer and Jack O'Connell. The former Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur player won 57 caps for England, before retiring in 2004. Gascoigne has recently been on the mend following a three-day emergency detox in October. He told The Sun: 'I was doing well, but every day was like Groundhog Day - doing the same thing - and I started drinking again. 'I was going to the gym, going shopping then going home. I just had a little blip. I messed up. But when that happens to me the whole world sees it.' Sportsmail contacted Gascoigne's representatives for comment on Saturday morning.

"It was as though ‘Liverpool’ was a banned word. You were exceedingly hard-pressed to find any mention of Bournemouth’s forthcoming Capital One Cup glamour tie at the Goldsands Stadium on Saturday. There was no excited chatter outside the ground, none of those awful half-and-half scarves on sale. There were no promotional posters anywhere with ‘sold out’ slapped across them and the PA announcer didn’t see fit to mention it until after the final whistle. The only reference to the biggest game in the club’s recent history came on the tickets page — not that there are any left — and the fixture list. You see, while cup ties like Wednesday’s are a nice distraction, Bournemouth are increasingly of the belief that such fixtures can become commonplace. Harry Arter (right) celebrates after scoring to put Bournemouth 2-0 ahead against Cardiff on Saturday . A fan makes his way towards the Goldsands Stadium ahead of the Championship match on Saturday . With five goals from five different scorers, the Cherries are back on top of the Championship after beating Cardiff in an exhilarating advert for football at this level. Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool, you have been warned. This may be an excursion to the seaside but it’ll be far from pleasurable. ‘We can’t show them too much respect,’ said Bournemouth’s star striker Callum Wilson, who has now scored 12 goals this season, including the winner against West Brom in the last round. ‘They are a Premier League team but we want to beat them. We’re not going to set up at home to protect a 0-0, we want to score goals and show them what we’re about, how we play.’ Bournemouth's Callum Wilson (left) battles for the ball with Cardiff's John Brayford on Saturday . Wilson, who ironically was recommended to manager Eddie Howe by Cardiff boss Russell Slade, scored in the 89th minute to finally kill off the Welsh side’s spirited challenge and send his team top on goal difference. It is Bournemouth’s 12th match without defeat in all competitions and Wilson’s form is just scratching the surface of the attacking threat Liverpool will have to deal with. The Cherries are the leading scorers in the top four divisions with 44 in 21 games and are ready to expose the Reds’ often fragile defence. Saturday’s outstanding performer was Matt Ritchie, who got the ball rolling after just 38 seconds, with further goals coming from Harry Arter, Marc Pugh and Yann Kermorgant before Wilson rounded it off. They were stylish finishes too — Arter started and finished the move that led to his goal, Pugh produced a superb curling shot and Kermorgant bent home a lovely free-kick. Yann Kermorgant (right) scores from a free kick to put Bournemouth 4-2 ahead on Saturday . ‘The way we’re playing you’re going to get the chances,’ said Wilson, the 22-year-old who joined for £3million from Coventry last summer, of the team’s attacking approach. ‘The team’s not just relying on the strikers. Five different goalscorers today shows that we’re getting goals from different positions.’ Howe was suffering from flu so delegated post-match media duties to assistant Jason Tindall but he’ll certainly feel perkier following this result as he prepares to go head-to-head with friend and mentor Rodgers. For Cardiff, it was a disappointing and disorienting afternoon. Disappointing in that they scored three goals away from home and lost. Disorienting in that they took to the field in all-white to a predictable reaction. ‘Why the f*** are we in white?’ and ‘Are we Swansea in disguise?’ sang the travelling support for most of the first half while waving anything blue above their heads, drawing sympathetic applause from the home fans. As if Vincent Tan’s decision to change their principal colours to red isn’t bad enough, he’s dressed them like bitter rivals Swansea on the road too. ‘This is a yardstick,’ said Slade. ‘Eddie’s done a wonderful job here. We need to work harder to get to their level.’ An eight-goal thriller — and the week’s main attraction is still to come. Cardiff fans dressed as Christmas elves cheer from the stands at the Goldsands Stadium in Bournemouth . PERFORMANCE OF THE WEEKEND . Birmingham’s renaissance under Gary Rowett continued as they thrashed Reading 6-1 at St Andrew’s. City have lost one in seven since Rowett joined from Burton and have now hit the relative heights of 15th.

"What a difference 90 minutes can make. Watford headed in to Friday night's live TV game at Fulham looking to avoid a fifth straight defeat. But they left Craven Cottage dreaming of automatic promotion having put in one of the finest team performances in the Championship so far this season. Troy Deeney (right) is congratulated by his team-mates after scoring his second goal against Fulham . Add to that some favourable results on Saturday and the Hornets find themselves occupying the final play-off position, just five points off Ipswich in second. The contrast between the run leading up to Friday night and the thumping 5-0 win rather aptly sums up the rollercoaster ride at Vicarage Road since the Pozzo family took over. After a slow start to the 2012-13 season, Gianfranco Zola's Hornets were the best team in the Championship in the second half of that campaign. They really should have got promoted but froze on the big stage; first narrowly losing out to Hull for automatic promotion, then being beaten by Crystal Palace in the play-off final. Deeney prods the ball beyond Fulham keeper Gabor Kiraly at Craven Cottage during Watford's 5-0 win . Early last season, Zola left the club having failed to recapture the form of his debut campaign and in came Beppe Sannino. Sannino could only achieve a 13th-placed finish last season and he is one of three managers to have left the club already this campaign, with Oscar Garcia and Billy McKinlay also coming and going. Before Friday night, Slavisa Jokanovic looked to be on the brink of becoming the fourth boss to go but the emphatic win has not only given him time, but should have raised confidence levels to the heights they were at in the spring of 2013. Zola's stamp is still very much on this Watford side, who still use the fluid 3-5-2 system he brought in so effectively. Hornets boss Slavisa Jokanovic has got his side back on track after a poor run of form . How much Watford's system is defined by the fact parent club Udinese have been 3-5-2 stalwarts for decades is another matter, but if it keeps working as it did on Friday night, no one at Vicarage Road will be complaining. It was a performance of genuine Premier League quality. The midfield trio of Gianni Munari, Daniel Toszer and Almen Abdi - as excellent at Craven Cottage as he was as Watford's creator-in-chief under Zola - look like they would be at ease in the top flight. Troy Deeney and Matej Vydra were the best strikeforce in the Championship two years ago and given their ages - 26 and 22 respectively - there is no reason they can't be again this season. Scotland international Ikechi Anya offers blistering pace out wide and while the defence is still a concern, the experience of goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes and centre back Sebastien Bassong may prove invaluable - especially if the latter's loan deal from Norwich can be extended beyond January. Almen Abdi runs off to celebrate scoring Watford's fourth goal in front of the Sky TV cameras . It has been a case of one step forward under Zola, then two steps back in the year since his departure as the club has become something of a laughing stock. But Friday night's performance was as good as, if not better, than Watford were playing in the winter and spring of 2012-13 when they were sweeping all before them. It was this time two years ago that Watford began to set the Championship alight. If they can record consecutive wins by beating struggling Wigan at Vicarage Road on Saturday, they may just start to believe promotion is on the cards. Good week for... BLACKPOOL . Finally. It's been a disastrous season for Blackpool, who already look all but relegated. Saturday's 1-0 win over Birmingham though, Lee Clark's first since taking over and the club's first in six, has given Blackpool a modicum of hope. It was made all the more sweeter for Clark against the club who sacked him earlier this season. Blackpool's Steven Davies celebrates after scoring his side's winning goal against Birmingham City . Bad week for... BRIGHTON . Having finished in the play-offs in consecutive seasons on their return to the second tier, the Seagulls' most likely route out of the Championship looks like relegation after Saturday's 3-0 defeat at league leaders Derby left them two points adrift of safety in 22nd place.

"Fulham boss Kit Symons hopes to keep Hugo Rodallega at the club beyond the end of the season. The Colombian striker has emerged as a key figure in Fulham's revival under Symons, scoring eight goals so far this term, but he will be out of contract in the summer. 'You want to keep your best players and he's one of our best players and he's absolutely on fire at the moment and long may that last,' said Symons. 'Since I've been in charge Hugo's been brilliant.

'So he's an obvious one to pick out but the response from everyone, I've got to say, all the players, has been excellent.' Fulham host Watford on Friday night looking for an eighth win since Symons took over following their disastrous start to the season under Felix Magath. The Hornets, by contrast, have lost their last four matches to slip from top spot to seventh, but Symons is still predicting a tough test. 'We're very, very confident but also we won't show any sort of complacency and we won't underestimate Watford,' added Symons at his pre-match press conference. Fulham boss Kit Symons is hoping he can convince the striker to extend his stay with the west London club . Rodallega holds off the challenge of Aaron Hughes during the match at the Amex Stadium on Saturday . 'They got off to a fantastic start to the season. Recent results have not been great for them but we've looked at all their games and they've played some good stuff within those games. 'They're a real threat, they've got some excellent players, so we won't be taking them lightly. But I fancy us to beat whoever we play in any game, be it home or away.' Despite their wretched run, the Hornets are still only six points behind leaders Derby. Head coach Slavisa Jokanovic said: 'We have not had good results over the last four games and it's our obligation to stop that run. 'This competition is long and tough with many important games in front of us, and we are still very close to the top of the table.'","Hugo Rodallega has scored eight goals for Fulham this season .

"Even Stuart Lancaster’s tracksuit carried the marks of battle on Saturday evening. England’s head coach wound up with blood on his back. It belonged to Brad Barritt, whose selfless commitment embodied the gutsy nature of this vital victory. In saving face, the home players were left with damage there too. Orders to use their heads clearly had been taken quite literally but the winners at Twickenham had also understood the message from their coaches to play smarter. The upshot was that a QBE series of stalled progress at least ended with a positive result against one of the mighty SANZAR teams.

They knew this was a triumph for the here and now, to ease the pressure and dilute the torrent of recent criticism, without providing solutions to long-term conundrums. At the heart of this resilient performance based on forward force was the captain, Chris Robshaw. On several occasions, the Harlequins flanker made the sort of breakdown interventions which have often been considered beyond his scope, to dig his side out of deep holes. His work over the ball against the Wallabies was magnificent. Yet, for all his satisfaction about personal and collective deeds, the skipper was realistic in his post-match reflections. ‘Over the last two weeks we’ve probably simplified things a bit and it showed with the way we played,’ he said. ‘It still wasn’t as smooth as we’d like but it was smooth enough today. ‘We’re extremely pleased with our forward play. You look back at the history of English rugby and they have always had a good pack to go back to. But it’s about having more than that. Captain Chris Robshaw (centre) celebrates victory with props David Wilson (left) and Kieran Brookes . England head coach Lancaster looks on during the international at Twickenham on Saturday . 93.9% - England won 93.9 per cent of their line-outs. 18 - England only made 18 off-loads in their four Tests. In their match against England alone, New Zealand made 15 off-loads. 64 - Tackles made by Chris Robshaw this autumn, the most for an England player. 91.3% - England’s average tackle success rate. Their lowest figure was 86 per cent against Australia. 225 - Metres run by Mike Brown, the most by any England player. 2 - England only lost two of 27 scrums on their own feed. ‘We know we’ve stuttered throughout the series. We know it’s not all smelling of roses and there are improvements to be made, but there’s a huge amount of relief to finish like that. We feel like we’ve got back to where we need to be but it is about going up another gear.’ A recurring question in the aftermath of this game was whether England have taken a step in the right direction this autumn. While coaches and players were keen to hint at marginal gains, the truth is that the team have not advanced - they are more or less where they were, with a wider base. The positive news is that they have identified yet more players who can stay afloat in the choppy waters of Test rugby. George Ford has been the principal ‘find’ - in confirming his ability to run the show at No 10 - but others in that category are Anthony Watson and George Kruis. Lancaster will take comfort from the expansion of the talent pool but sheer weight of numbers will not suffice. The urgent priorities now are to achieve selection stability, especially behind the scrum, and rediscover the attacking spark which characterised England’s play during the last Six Nations.

George Ford kicks a penalty against Australia at Twickenham during the November international on Saturday . Northampton and England blindside Tom Wood feeds Ben Youngs after a clean take at lineout time . 31 - Metres gained by No 8 Ben Morgan against Australia. Only Mike Brown (58) and Anthony Watson (36) gained more ground for England. It is quite understandable for the head coach to urge his players to come to his aid by performing well game after game at international and club level. That is the hallmark of the leading All Blacks, for instance, and a feat of consistency which English squad members continue to find elusive. The likes of Owen Farrell, Danny Care and Billy Vunipola have dropped back in November and the coaches crave a spirited response. What is in no doubt is the towering scale of England’s clout up front. As showcased in the scrum-led demolition of the Wallaby pack, Graham Rowntree has assembled and honed a formidable group of imposing forwards. Ben Morgan’s two tries were just reward for his fine carrying, while Courtney Lawes was a colossal influence, particularly in defence and Joe Marler had his best game of the autumn.

Owen Farrell (right) has been out of form and low on fitness and is now a No 12 option for England . Rowntree conceded that he is facing a ‘good headache’ in the weeks ahead. Several casualties will be pushing for a recall, notably props Alex Corbisiero and Dan Cole, locks Joe Launchbury and Geoff Parling, plus Tom Croft and the fit-but-misfiring Vunipola in the back row. They all have a mammoth task to gatecrash a dominant unit. England could just about field two packs to compete with the best in the world. But the back line continues to frustrate and puzzle the coaches and outside observers alike. The selection wheel keeps turning, with midfield the perennial focal point. Ben Youngs and Ford should continue their half-back alliance in Cardiff - providing they stay fit - but Manu Tuilagi will surely storm back into the centre equation and Luther Burrell should be in the mix too. A case could be made for those two being unleashed together, with Burrell at 12 and Tuilagi outside him. Billy Twelvetrees was told he could take a short-term grip on the inside centre position if he shone against Australia but he was unable to seize his chance. With Kyle Eastmond also tried and discarded, Sam Burgess will come into the reckoning, based on his ‘barn-storming’ potential to break tackles and off-load.

England’s wide attacking was made to look hesitant and wooden in comparison with the far more fluent Wallabies, who will come back to Twickenham on World Cup business next year armed with a multitude of threats. However, the ghosts of their scrum nightmares have been resurrected and that could be a major benefit to Lancaster 10 months from now. That is a deadly weapon but they need to develop more. Quickly.

"Last week, I received a very strange invite asking me to come down to a TV studio packed with men and women and then, in the full glare of the spotlight, to publicly grab my own crotch. Usually this sort of behaviour gets your collar felt by the long arm of the law for indecent exposure but on this occasion I was assured it would be all for a good cause. That cause turned out to be the Check One Two movement's #FeelingNuts campaign, which aims to persuade men to regularly check their tackle for testicular cancer regularly. Clearly, it is a most worthy campaign and so, I was happy to get involved. Worthy cause: Spencer was invited to grab his crotch as part of the #FeelingNuts movement . Over 2,000 new cases of testicular cancer are found each year in the UK, mostly in men from age 20-39 (so that's me included), but thankfully this cancer has a relatively high chance of being cured, as long as you detect it early enough - hence this big awareness campaign for men to check their goolies. So all you have to do is this. Send a twitter picture or video, or some other social media platform that you communicate on posting: 'I'm #Feelingnuts' and then add something funny/witty/whatever and the all important #FeelingNuts and then challenge another couple of friends (girls and boys) to do the crotch grab challenge as well. Spreading the word: Spencer and co-star Jamie Laing attended the #FeelingNuts event at the O2 Arena . Feeling charitable: Spencer was keen to get on board with the charity as he says it is a very worthy cause . Also while you're down there it would be a good idea to check your gonads for any strange bumps which could be cancer. The Twitter campaign is building fast and so far Ricky Gervais, Jack Whitehall, Alan Carr, Hugh Jackman and even William Shatner have posted pictures of themselves delicately cupping their genitals. More celebrity support turned up for the #FeelingNuts event  at the O2 Arena in London's Docklands, which I was at, along with my Made In Chelsea colleague Jamie Laing and  Jack Whitehall who was hosting the event. Important issues: While there Spencer and Jamie were interviewed by Fresh Meat actor Greg McHugh . Awkard: Spencer says that his interview with Hugh was probably one of his most uncomfortable ones to date . We were interviewed by Jack's former co-star on E4 drama Fresh Meat, actor Greg McHugh, who plays Howard on the show. Greg did the interview in the style of the Howard – the very nerdy and socially inept Scottish geology student. It was possibly the most painful interview I've ever done but was nowhere near as awkward and grabbing my own crotch in front of the 200-strong predominantly female crowd. Luckily it appeared to go down well with the audience. But I won't be making a habit of it. To find out more about the #FeelingNuts campaign visit checkonetwo.co.uk .

"An Iowa airman killed in battle during World War Two has finally been laid to rest in his hometown of Badger - nearly 70 years after he was shot down near the Belgium-Germany border. Staff Sergeant Maurice Fevold was just 21 when  his plane was hit during the Battle of the Bulge,  the last major Nazi offensive against the Allies. The plane's wreckage was not found until 2007, and it was only through recent DNA testing that Sgt Fevold's remains were identified, after being recovered in 2012. Bill Bushman, left, is presented with Sgt. Maurice Fevold's burial flag at the funeral service in Badger . More than four miles of flags lined the street leading to Blossom Hill Cemetery for the soldier's funeral . This week a funeral was held for Sgt Fevold and he was given full military honors from the Iowa National Guard, the Fort Dodge Messenger reported. More than four miles of flags lined both sides of the street leading to Blossom Hill Cemetery for the soldier's funeral procession. The Badger Fire Department also parked fire trucks along the route, and the Iowa Air National Guard provided a KC-135 plane that flew over the service. The Battle of the Bulge was the largest - and bloodiest - battle fought by Americans in World War II . Major Mike Willer said Sgt Fevold sacrificed his life to help others and deserved to be honored no matter how long it has been since he died. He said that even if you did not know him it is important to pay him respect . Major Mike Willer, the chaplain who gave the eulogy at the Bruce Funeral Home in Fort Dodge, said Sgt Fevold sacrificed his life to help others and deserved to be honored no matter how long it has been since he died. 'Even if you did not know him, we pay you respect as we pay him respect,' Major Willer said during his speech. 'That's what soldiers do.' The Battle of the Bulge was the largest - and bloodiest - battle fought by Americans in World War II. It involved  six weeks of vicious fighting in the heavily forested Ardennes Mountains of Belgium. Some 600,000 US troops were involved  and American casualties amounted to around 81,000. The cost to the German Army was 100,000 men killed, wounded or captured and 800 tanks destroyed. The extreme cold was a major problem - more than 15,000 Allied troops alone were treated for frostbite and other cold-related injuries. Allies secured victory on January 25, 1945, putting the the final triumph over Nazi Germany  in reach. Less than five months after the Battle of the Bulge ended, on May 7 the war in Europe was over. Bill Bushman said he is the oldest living relative of Sgt Fevold, who was his mother's uncle. He said he has heard little about his great-uncle, but was honored to be involved in the funeral service. Mr Bushman's mother and Mr Fevold's sister are also buried in at the cemetery. 'This is the best place for him,' Mr Bushman said. On Monday, flags flown at half-mast to honor Sgt Fevold, on the request of Iowa Governor Branstad. Speaking to Radio Iowa, National Guard spokesman Colonel Greg Hapgood explained that the B-26 Marauder on which Sgt Fevold was an armorer and gunner went missing  in December of 1944. He added:  'A few years ago, someone found in the forest near Allmuthen, Belgium, the remains of an aircraft, and upon further investigation by the United States government and some private groups, some (human) remains were discovered, and they have just recently been identified.' According to reports Sgt Fevold and five other crew members were on the bomber that took off from Saint Quentin, France, to attack an enemy-held railroad bridge in Eller, Germany. It is thought that their plane was shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire near Seffern, which sits close to Germany's border with Belgium. All five crew members were officially declared deceased on December 23, 1944, Radio Iowa reports. The bomber was just one of a total of ten U.S. aircraft were recorded as lost in the vicinity of Seffern during the Battle of the Bulge.

The extreme cold was a major problem during the six weeks of fierce fighting in the Battle of the Bulge - more than 15,000 Allied troops alone were treated for frostbite and other cold-related injuries . Colonel Hapgood said: 'Sergeant Fevold was highly-decorated for his service as a crewmember on bombers during World War Two. He entered the service in 1943 and served until he went missing in December of 1944.' Among the soldier's numerous military decorations are the Purple Heart, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, Presidential Unit Citation, and Enlisted Aircrew Member Wings. 'Since 2006 the Iowa National Guard has the incredible privilege to participate in eight repatriations. Both from the World War Two era and also from the Korean War, ' Colonel Hapgood added. 'It's amazing the lengths our government goes to to recover these warriors and bring them home. And it's very, very fitting to bring him home and welcome him and give him the honor he so greatly deserves.'

"The French girlfriend of injured Formula 1 driver Jules Bianchi last night  sent out a prayer through Twitter for her 'champion' as he fought for his life in a Japanese hospital. Camille Marchetti, 24, led tributes to the 25-year-old Marussia driver after he span off a rain-soaked track and into a recovery vehicle clearing up an earlier crash in the Japanese Grand Prix yesterday. Unconscious but breathing for himself, Bianchi was taken to Mie University hospital, ten miles from the track in Suzuka, and the race was stopped nine laps early. Bianchi's father, Philippe, has since told French television that his son's condition is 'critical' and he has undergone surgery for serious head injuries. Mr Bianchi and wife Christine are understood to be travelling to Japan to be with their son. It is not yet known if Miss Marchetti is going with them. Scroll down for video . Glamorous: Camilee Marchetti (pictured with Bianchi at an event) is an osteopathy student at the Collège Ostéopathique de Provence in France and originally hails from the Mediterranean island of Corsica . But last night, Miss Marchetti, who has dated Bianchi for a number of years, led prayers for the race ace's recovery as the world waited for news on his condition. 'You are my champion! You are the strongest,' she wrote on Twitter, ending the tweet with emoticons of a heart and two hands locked in prayer. Glamorous Miss Marchetti is an osteopathy student at the Collège Ostéopathique de Provence in France who originally hails from the Mediterranean island of Corsica.

Concerns: Marussia team principal John Booth (centre) walks into the hospital where Marussia Formula One driver Jules Bianchi of France is hospitalized, in Yokkaichi, Mie prefecture . Her prayer comes as Bianchi's Marussia team asked for 'patience and understanding' as it released a statement thanking people for the 'huge outpouring of support and affection for Jules and the team at this very difficult time'. It continued: 'With regard to the communication of information concerning Jules' medical condition, we will respect and be guided by the wishes of the Bianchi family. 'Together with Jules' care, they will remain our highest priority. 'Therefore, we would ask for patience and understanding with regard to further medical updates.' Bianchi is a graduate of the Ferrari academy and former Ferrari driver Felipe Massa and team principal Marco Mattiacci went with him to hospital. It is the most serious accident to hit a race weekend since Felipe Massa fractured his skull and spent a week in a coma while qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix, in 2009.

Officials immediately red-flagged the Suzuka Grand Prix, meaning championship leader Lewis Hamilton claimed his third win in succession and eighth of the season. But celebrations on the podium were muted after news of Bianchi's condition broke. 'It's obviously a real anti-climax to hear that one of our fellow colleagues is seriously injured so that's really the main worry,' Mercedes' race winner Lewis Hamilton told the BBC. 'You could see some commotion and the car was really badly damaged on the right. We just hope he's OK.'

"The Prime Minister's office has fired back at renewed criticism of Australia's commitment to the fight against the Ebola virus in west Africa, labelling any call for deployment of aid workers 'reckless in the extreme', without proper evacuation protocols. The government has provided an official response to Daily Mail Australia in the wake of a verbal attack from the U2 front-man and noted humanitarian Bono, who blasted Tony Abbott for not joining the global fight against Ebola. He said the government's decision not to send medical workers to west Africa was 'outrageous' and 'not very Australian.' Scroll down for video . Not seeing eye-to-eye on the Ebola crisis. 'To think Australia's very far away and you can protect yourself by protecting the airports and the docks, it's not very smart,' Bono (right) said of the position taken by the Tony Abbott (left) government . The singer criticised the Prime Minister's failure to respond to the outbreak of the deadly disease 'at the source' during an interview on 60 Minutes. '(Politicians have) got to account for their actions, including your Prime Minister,' Bono said. 'I thought it was outrageous, the idea that you wouldn't send medical workers to west Africa.' 'This is just not the Australia that I know.' But a spokesman for Mr Abbott made it clear on Monday that protecting Australians comes first. 'Our primary concern is around our domestic protocols and the secondary is about our regional concerns, to make sure there is readiness should there an outbreak in a country which does not have certain capabilities,' he said. He confirmed the first focus would be on protecting Australia at the borders and assisting should Ebola ever grip the Asia-Pacific region. The Prime Minister's office also took issue with Bono's claim that 'to think Australia's very far away and you can protect yourself by protecting the airports and the docks, it's not very smart'. 'You have to protect it at the source of the problem. These diseases do not respect borders,' Bono claimed. 'Our domestic protocols are in fact, world class and if there are cases, as has been demonstrated with the three of four false starts, we are prepared,' the PM's spokesman added. Health workers suit up in protective clothing before taking people suspected of having Ebola to a re-opened Ebola holding centre in the West Point neighbourhood in Monrovia, Liberia. The World Health Organization says that more than 4,500 people have died due to the Ebola epidemic in west Africa . The British are sending up to 750 people to help in Sierra Leone, while the US has dispatched more than 3000 to Liberia to assist in the fight against the Ebola virus . A World Health Organisation map depicting the rapid spread of Ebola in parts of west Africa, with hundreds of new cases now in Liberia and Sierra Leone . As for deploying Australian aid workers or doctors in future, he added that 'we are of course of a mind to help where we reasonably can in the situation that is happening (but) what we need is to have strong evacuation plans in place for any official or health worker should something occur, that’s a fairly reasonable position'. 'For anyone, including the Labor Party, to say that we should be sending people to west Africa without these precautions in place if they were to get sick, is reckless in the extreme.' The United Nations secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon called on Bono to help raise awareness of the dire situation. The Federal Government says the UN has recognised Australia's 'fast and effective response'. 'We have provided another $18 million on top of the $40 million we already have provided to the World Health Organisation and that has and that has resulted in strong praise from UN.' Foreign Minister Julie Bishop (pictured with the Prime Minister) has defended Australia's decision not to send aid workers or doctors, saying the advice provided by both Australia's health and defence departments shows that there could not yet be a safe evacuation from west Africa under current protocols . Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Australian Health and Defence Departments have both advised that Australian health workers, as yet, could not be safely evacuated back home. 'The Australian government is not about to risk the health of Australian workers in the absence of credible evacuation plans that could bring our people back to Australia,' Ms Bishop said. A position echoed by Health Minister Peter Dutton on the ABC Radio's AM program this morning. 'We are providing financial support and providing support through NGOs (non-government organisations),' Mr Dutton said. 'We're assessing whether or not health care workers could receive adequate medical attention on the ground if they contracted the virus from the patients they're treating. We have 20 or 30 health workers volunteering in the region at the moment and we're providing what support we can through consular assistance to those people. 'I think it's prudent for the Government to make sure we have every scenario covered and that's a process we're going at the moment before we take any decisions at the next step.' Music legend Bono (left) was sought out by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon to raise awareness and funds for the fight against the Ebola virus in west Africa . The WHO reports that 'the Ebola virus was first reported in 1976 through two simultaneous outbreaks in Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo' The World Health Organisation (WHO) has estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months, there will be 10,000 new cases each week, potentially affecting 1.4 million people across west Africa . Bono is founder of the ONE foundation, which campaigns to end extreme poverty and preventable disease. 'I think we all saw this (picture of) this young kid lying in her own excrement and a load of people just standing around watching her die because they didn’t, they just knew not to touch her and she’s lying there dying,' Bono told 60 minutes. 'These are very dangerous moments.' Bono is the founder of ONE foundation, which campaigns to end extreme poverty and preventable disease . Bono also took the Prime Minister to task for slashing the funds dedicated to proving foreign aid. 'I know you've got difficulties, every country does, and I respect them but I think the aid budget got 20 per cent of the cuts, so that's a lot of lives,' Bono said, speaking about the Australia's 2014 Federal Budget. 'It just doesn't strike me as being very Australian.' Australian Medical Association president, Associate Professor Brian Owler, is also among those calling on the government to develop and announce a plan to help deal with the Ebola crisis . Bono's comments come after the head of the country's medical association implored the government to formulate a plan, labelling Australia's response to Ebola 'a shambles.' Associate Professor Brian Owler called on the Commonwealth to develop and announce a plan to help deal with the crisis. While Australia has not committed to sending workers into the region, it's believed up to 16 health care workers have been trained to go to west Africa and do the 'dangerous work' with Ebola patients, should the government position change. But adding to the frustration, neither the AMA nor the Chief Medical Officer know who the people are or what sort of training they've received. 'It's not the AUSMAT (Australian Medical Assistance) teams that you would expect would be trained to do this work,' Professor Owler said. 'People should be reassured that the risk of transmission of that infection is very, very, low, but obviously it is a concern,' he said. The US and UK asked for assistance from Australia a month ago, Professor Owler added. The British have committed 750 people to help in Sierra Leone, while the US has dispatched more than 3000 to Liberia. The World Health Organisation last week estimated that unless 70 per cent of infected people were treated in the next two months, there will be 10,000 new cases each week, potentially affecting 1.4 million people across west Africa.","Prime Minister's office insists anyone wanting Australians to be sent into west Africa without evacuation protocols are 'reckless in the extreme'

"There is nothing more disappointing than a soggy salad when it comes to summertime lunching. But such unsatisfactory snacks could become a thing of the past as scientists have found a way to genetically extending the life of lettuce so leaves will stay fresh for more than a week. By looking at the lettuce’s genetic make-up they are breeding selectively ‘tougher’ plants. No more soggy salad! Scientists have developed a way to genetically extend the life of lettuce so it stays crispy for up to eight days . Researchers from the University of Southampton found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green, crisp and firm for longer. Having made the observation, Gail Taylor, a professor in plant biology at the university worked out which genes are responsible for these characteristics. She is now working with Vitacress - one of the biggest producers of packaged salads - to selectively breed lettuces with these qualities. It means the leaves, which often wilt and turn brown after just a few days, will last at home for up to eight days. ‘People will know how frustrating it is to buy a bag of prepared salad only for it to wilt and turn into a brown mush after a few days. If you don’t eat it quickly enough you end up being wasteful and throwing it away,’ Professor Taylor said. Small means fresh: Researchers from the University of Southampton found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green, crisp and firm for longer . ‘Our research means growers will soon be supplying supermarkets with leaves that will last more than a week after you get them home. ‘That will allow families to do their weekly food shop and have a fresh salad on any day of the week. ‘Our findings are also applicable to spinach and rocket leaves, which often come in the mixed leaf bags. However, they already tend to be more hardy.’ Baby salad leaves, which are usually cos or lollo rossa, undergo rigorous processing – which includes harvesting, transportation, washing, sanitisation, removal of excess water, and packaging - before they reach supermarket shelves. Putting the spring back in greens: One professor in plant biology worked out which genes are responsible for these crispy lettuce leaves. Experimental specimens are pictured left and an experiment to test crispness is pictured right . Only the most robust leaves can survive this process without being bruised and damaged, which makes growing salad crops with ‘processable’ leaves extremely important for the packaged salad industry, as it reduces waste and increases shelf life. Professor Taylor found producers could also increase the shelf-life of salad by reducing the water used during growing by 20 per cent, which has the added benefit of being more environmentally friendly. ‘We were able to show if you reduce water use in intensive salad production by about 20 per cent, you actually develop smaller, tougher leaves with stiff cells walls, which is what we’re interested in,’ she said. Cream of the crop? Professor Taylor found producers could increase the shelf-life of salad by reducing the water used during growing by 20 per cent, which has the added benefit of being more environmentally friendly. A filed of selectively bred lettuces are pictured . She said that the researchers have used fundamental biological knowledge and applied it through genetics and crop production techniques to help Vitacress improve the quality of its products. Professor Taylor said there is a trade-off between taste, crispiness, and shelf-life ‘because you want the leaves to be firm but not too hard.’ Dr Steve Rothwell, from Vitacress, said: ‘The results open the door to exciting further studies across a wider range of crops and geographies to drive down the use of water while improving crop quality and shelf life.’ Salad redesigned: The researchers have used fundamental biological knowledge and applied it through genetics and crop production techniques to help Vitacress improve the quality of its product .","Researchers from the University of Southampton found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green and firm for longer .

"Brazilian police have uncovered a huge ring operating on the 'dark internet' - a seething matrix of encrypted websites allowing users to browse with complete anonymity. The year-long 'Operation Darknet' uncovered a large haul of child pornography that had been made in Brazil and was being distributed in four other countries. The operation has so far led to the arrests of 55 people, with police issuing a further 100 arrest and search warrants and suspects found in Portugal, Italy, Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela. Invesitgation: The year-long 'Operation Darknet' uncovered a large haul of child pornography that had been made in Brazil and was being distributed in four other countries . Operation Darknet was launched simultaneously in 18 Brazilian states and the federal district of Brasilia last year. During the year-long investigation, six children were rescued from suspected rapists and abusers. At a press conference in Rio, Chief of Police of the State of Rio Grande do Sul, Sandro Luciano Caron, said: 'We managed to identify people who were trying to distribute child pornography materials and also those who have abused children.' More than 90 people who shared the child porn images have so far been identified, with the majority of them known child abusers, he added. Until now, only the FBI and Scotland Yard have managed to break into the dark internet, but Caron said Brazilian police have since been able to adopt the same investigative techniques. Dark internet: Normally, file sharing and internet browsing activity can be tracked by law enforcement through each user's unique IP address. The Tor network on the Deep Web hides the IP address of the user . Caron said a number of harrowing details emerged during the investigation, including one man who allegedly started planning the  abuse of his child while his unsuspecting wife was still pregnant. The nature and extent of some of the abuse shocked and horrified even the most experienced officers involved in the investigation, he added. Operation Darknet is considered the latest example of South American governments finally starting to address the problem of the sexual exploitation of children. Earlier this week Colombia broke up a child-trafficking operation in which children as young as 12 are believed to have been smuggled out of the country for sex. Seven people were arrested. Tor - short for The onion Router - is a  matrix of encrypted websites that allows users to surf beneath the everyday internet with complete anonymity.

"It's the series that will open your eyes to the wonders of the animal world. Yesterday, nature writer SIMON BARNES revealed the astonishing lives of birds. Today, he tells why you should learn to love vampire bats - and rats... The world would be a much happier place if humans were more like vampire bats. It’s their unselfishness I’m talking about: the free giving of something you need but are prepared to surrender to another. We humans like to think that altruism in any form is uniquely human: a real and above all moral division between us and the rest of the animal kingdom. Vampire bats contradict this view. All kinds of legends have built up around this pint-sized creature of the night, but one bit at least is true: that they do actually drink blood. There are three species: the white-winged vampire and the hairy-legged vampire prefer the blood of birds, and are adept at clambering through the branches to reach nests and nestlings. Scroll down for video . Bad rep: Vampire bats are social and help each other out in times of need - albeit by regurgitating blood . Common vampires prefer to feast on mammals, mostly livestock, but they will on occasions drink human blood. It’s said that the bite is not painful, although — or perhaps because — they use razor-sharp incisors to remove the skin; the resulting wound has been described as looking like a golfer’s divot. Vampires are around 4in long, with a wingspan of 7in or so. They are adept on the ground, crawling with agile speed to reach a target and search out a convenient blood vessel. The anti-coagulant in their saliva allows the blood to flow, and they lap it up like a cat with a saucer of milk; on a good night they can take a meal of half their own body weight. This sounds as if all the odds favour the bats, but this is not so. It’s common for a vampire bat to go through a night without a meal; within three days it will have starved to death. Blood-hunting is a skill that improves over time: year-old bats will fail one night in three; experienced animals fail only one night in ten. All the same, failure is a fact of life for even the best blood-hunters. Dinner: Anti-coagulant in their saliva allows the blood to flow, and they lap it up like a cat with a saucer of milk . Vampires are social creatures, coming back to the same day-roost at the end of every night. There are some big colonies, up to 2,000, but most are much smaller, and centre on a core population of females who, even if not related, tend to know each other well. A bat who has failed to find blood in a night’s flying will beg a meal from a neighbour. From a friend, we would say, if we weren’t so terrified of sounding anthropomorphic. The friend will then regurgitate blood, thus sharing a meal. Under this system, females have been known to live for up to 15 years. Reciprocal altruism is still altruism; obviously this is a system that works on a mutual back-scratching basis. Human society depends on the small kindnesses that you perform as a matter of course and that you expect to be performed for you in turn. But it is not just humans who are humane. Seagulls that haunt landfill sites, pigeons that fly around city centres, cockroaches in our kitchens: all these we treat with contempt. But when it comes to fear and loathing in the animal kingdom, nothing beats a rat. The brown rat is one of the great success stories of the last millennium. Not known in Britain before the 11th century, it has become a seldom-seen omnipresent fact of town and country life. Rubbish reputation: But the brown rat is one of the greatest success stories in nature in 1,000 years . We are never more than 10ft from a rat in a city, so they say: information designed to make our flesh creep. There are more rats than people in Britain; in New York alone there are said to be 100 million of them. I live in the countryside and keep horses and chickens — so naturally, I have rats. They pollute my animals’ feed and they damage stuff, so I try to control them, which is a euphemism for killing them. But why, actually, is there a need for wild species to be under human control? The idea of losing control, of being unable to regulate the numbers of wild animals we have around us, is something that profoundly distresses us modern humans. It is an insult to our omnipotence, a serious challenge to our understanding of ourselves and our place on the planet. Humans define ourselves by our control — and yet there is a contradiction within 10ft of you. We may be able to eradicate a lot of species with great efficiency, both on purpose and by accident, but there are some species that we simply can’t control, no matter how hard we try. They are just too good for us: too smart, too well adapted, too effective. Hardy: We may be able to eradicate a lot of species with great efficiency, but there are some we simply can’t . Western civilisation has never had many good things to say about rats, for all that they have been roped into thousands of scientific experiments for the very good reason that rats can tell us an awful lot about human beings. But some cultures are less single-minded in their detestation of rats. I have visited a Jain temple in southern India in which the rats were not only fed but honoured. In some Indian cultures, rat meat is considered a delicacy. In the Chinese horoscope, the year of the rat is by no means inauspicious; its natives are said to be creative, intelligent, generous, honest and ambitious. There is a fine statue commemorating a rat with such qualities in Kyoto, Japan; you can find it if you do the Philosopher’s Walk, a stroll that takes you past a number of Zen temples. It’s a walk devised for contemplation of higher things. What’s to hate about rats anyway? Sure, they’re ubiquitous, destructive and far too effective at breeding. But as you stroll on the Philosopher’s Walk, you are entitled to ask yourself: well, who isn’t? Not far behind the rat in the fear and loathing department comes the hyena. These are the cheats of the animal world, scavenging the leftovers of the noble lions, stealing the kill from the leopards and giving everyone the willies when they are caught in the safari vehicle’s headlights with their grinning Halloween-mask faces. Laughing: They are cheats and scavengers - but hyenas have big brains and a better social life than lions . The bare skin of the face gives them a particularly malevolent appearance; it doesn’t help when you explain that this is an adaptation that helps them to keep clean, a useful thing for a beast that spends so much of its time with its head stuck in corpses. The spotted hyena is the one we are most familiar with, from wildlife documentaries if not from experience on safari. Their glorious whooping calls — they like to keep in contact with each other — are one of the great sounds of the African night: a spine-tingler for the first-timer, and providing a sense of homecoming for those of us who keep going back. Hyenas always have an air of being up to no good, of being caught in the middle of some episode that even they must admit is rather shaming, but they’re going to do it anyway, so off they go into the bush, grinning hard. Yet there is a lot to recommend a hyena. Their social life is rigidly efficient, and they have big and complex brains, which make this possible. They live by the clan, and everything they do is tied up with the female dominant hierarchy that underpins it. This contrasts with the social life of lions, which always seems to operate in a haphazard and rough-and-ready way. Lions seem to be making it up as they go along, and are perfectly capable of breaking all their own rules. There is beauty to be found in the hyena. Its sense of smell is more than 1,000 times more acute than ours . Round a kill, the male does what he wants and everybody else scraps for the next bite, rather than waiting for a preordained turn, though the alpha male lion will tolerate a cub — but no one else — eating alongside him. Lions are highly social but not really on top of their own social lives, in a manner that reminds me of modern humans. But hyenas have it all worked out. The boss female is in charge. It has been estimated that the top female is two-and-a-half times more likely to raise successful young than any of her peers. A hyena den is, against all expectations, a lovely sight: always busy and playful. The pups, all black, look as if they would be perfectly at home on your hearthrug. There is great beauty to be found in the hyena. Its sense of smell is more than 1,000 times more acute than our own. Their powerfully muscled jaws and bone-crushing premolars give them one of the most effective bites in the world. As so often, the truth and beauty of the creatures we live with are obscured by human traditions and untrue assumptions. We are not encouraged to look closely or think afresh about non-human animals because, after all, we know everything. Or do we?

"Women experience more mental health problems than men due to stress-related pressure, according to a new mental health report. The Australian Psychological Society's survey of stress and wellbeing also found 2014 was a tough year for women, with many reporting significantly higher levels of stress in their day-to-day lives. More than 70 percent of Australians reported their current stress levels had an impact on their physical health. The Australian Psychological Society's survey of stress and wellbeing found 2014 was a tough year for women . But worryingly, 64 per cent reported current stress levels had an impact on their mental health. 'Stress can have an extremely detrimental effect on a person's mental and physical health,' APS executive director Professor Lyn Littlefield said. 'It's important to first identify the cause of stress to work towards avoiding the source, or adopting stress management behaviours. 'Different people are affected by different things, but it is interesting to see the varying impact family and personal financial issues have on stress levels for men and women.'

More than half (53 percent) of women found that personal financial issues are a major factor of stress-related pressure, compared to just 44 percent of men. While more than half (52 percent) of all women reported family issues are a major source of stress compared to just 38 percent of men. Women also reported a greater impact of stress on their health, with 21 percent of women than 13 percent men saying that stress was strongly impacting their physical health. And more women (23 percent) than men (14 percent) reported that stress was strongly impacting their mental health.

"Ocean-going robots are being used in a pioneering science project off the coast of Britain. Three innovative machines are tracking tagged fish and monitoring the sea. The robo scouts can remain at sea for months using wind, solar and wave power. Using acoustic 'pingers', plaice, sole, brill, and rays are being tracked at sea by the drone boats . Using acoustic 'pingers', plaice, sole, brill, and rays are being tracked at sea by the ocean robots programmed to patrol a large area of the MPAs are a number of seabed listening stations which work in concert with the ocean robots. The three autonomous vehicles – AutoNaut, C-Enduro and the SV3 Waveglider – are all carrying a range of sensors to collect additional data on the physical properties of the ocean, such as water temperature and salinity. On-board cameras will also capture valuable photographs and video footage of seabirds and other marine life. The three robot boats will spend about two weeks tracking 85 plaice, sole, brill, and rays caught and tagged by the MBA and released yesterday. The project is the biggest of its kind ever in Britain and could herald a new era in ocean exploration as the vehicles are designed to operate remotely across the oceans for months using wind, solar and wave power. Scientists from the Marine Biological Association (MBA) in Plymouth, Devon, also hope the experiment will shed light on the private lives of some fish species and show whether new protected areas are effective in conserving stocks. 'This is a pioneering project,' said Guy Baker. 'We have not been able to follow fish in real time at day and night before.' Remote sensing cuts the cost of marine science at sea by freeing up research vessels manned by scientists, he said. The wave-power technology behind AutoNaut could also lead to a revolution in marine transport, believes the man who developed the robot. Although the drone ship is just 3.5 metres long, the technology could be scaled up for a ship, said Mike Poole, a director of MOST (Autonomous Vessels). That would save on fuel costs for ocean transport, he added. AutoNaut, C-Enduro, also British-built, and American vessel SV3 Waveglider were launched yesterday  from Queen Anneís Battery in Plymouth in what is the second phase of the Exploring Ocean Fronts project. Last month five marine robots, including the wave-powered Devon craft, proved they could survive gales of up to 70mph as they travelled hundreds of miles gathering data in the Atlantic off the Isles of Scilly.

The second phase of the project is expected to last until mid-November and follows the highly successful first phase, which saw five marine robots travelling for hundreds of kilometres off the Isles of Scilly to collect ocean and meteorological data. The two-phase project is the largest deployment of marine autonomous systems ever seen in the UK and will provide valuable information about the shelf seas, marine life and the scope for autonomous vehicles in future research projects.","Will help protected species and spread new light on breeding patterns .

"An 11-year-old girl who is legally blind hasn't let her disability stop her from pursuing her passion for gymnastics. Adrianna Kenebrew of Houston, Texas, was born with glaucoma, and as a result is extremely nearsighted and has almost no peripheral vision. But she has high goals, and told Today.com: 'I want to be the first visually-impaired gymnast to win gold at the Olympics.' Model athlete: Adrianna Kenebrew is legally blind, but hasn't let her disability stop her from pursuing her passion for gymnastics . Adrianna, who is in sixth grade, began taking gymnastics three years ago, and was named 2013 Female Athlete of the Year for her region by the Texas Amateur Athletic Federation. 'I just always wanted to flip and swing,' she said. Her mother, Asha Kenebrew, said that coaches give her cues as she's approaching the vault, but she receives no other special assistance as she's navigating the uneven bars, balance beam and other types of equipment. Adrianna uses a special magnifying machine and a small monocular lens in school, and she wears glasses when competing. Winning attitude: Adrianna, who was named 2013 Female Athlete of the Year for her region by the Texas Amateur Athletic Federation, says her disability makes her work harder . According to Kimberly Yen, a pediatric ophthalmologist at Houston’s Texas Children’s Hospital, Adrianna's vision with the glasses is 20/400 in her right eye, and 20/150 in her left eye. Adrianna says that her impairment makes her work harder, adding: 'I like who I am.' Mrs Kenebrew says that her daughter has had countless surgeries to prevent additional loss of vision. 'The gym is one of the only places where there are no real accommodations for her. Everything is the same. She gets on the same balance beam as everybody else,' Mrs Kenebrew said. 'I don’t know, but I think that may be why she loves the sport.'","Adrianna Kenebrew of Houston, Texas, was born with glaucoma and has been taking gymnastics for three years ."
"Admission: Anna Dugdale, head of Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital said she would not want her own mother to be treated there . The head of a £229m flagship hospital in crisis has shockingly revealed that she would not allow her own mother to be treated there. Anna Dugdale spoke out today as Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital reaches breaking point due to a catastrophic rise in patients. Ms Dugdale said that drastic bed shortages at the 13-year-old hospital had forced them to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions. The crisis is getting worse all the time because the rural region has a growing, ageing population and patients are staying in hospital longer. Coupled with a rise in A&E admissions - which have rocketed from 54,000 in 2008-09 to 68,000 this year - exhausted staff are said to be under immense pressure. Ms Dugdale, hospital chief executive since 2008, admitted: 'I wouldn't choose this for my mum, but I wouldn't want her in the car park either. 'I would want her in the hospital. 'It's really tough for everybody. I do this job as I'm proud of what we do and I love it. 'We are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad. 'Our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors.' Ms Dugdale said there were 'all sorts of options' but insisted that she would never turn patients away from her 953-bed hospital. The huge level of demand for care has forced the use of non-ward areas for bed space - including makeshift wards in the medical school. Operations have had to be cancelled due to the volume of new admissions. And an increasing number of nursing staff are going off sick due to stress and sheer exhaustion - making the creaking hospital's staffing situation even worse. Asked if they'd reached crisis point, Ms Dugdale said: 'Our bread and butter is dealing with crisis, so I would never say that, as that's what our clinicians are trained to deal with. 'But the pressure that the emergency teams are under does take its toll day in, day out. Crisis-hit: Drastic bed shortages coupled with a rise in A&E admissions have left the 13-year-old hospital (above) in dire straits . 'It's very hard, physically and emotionally. I'm always full of admiration for them.' And she stressed: 'Absolutely something does need to be done now.' A report, which went before the N&N trust board yesterday, (Fri), revealed the A&E four-hour target had been missed a number of times and two patients had to wait more than 12 hours in A&E. Ms Dugdale said those two cases involved 'patients with complex needs'. 'It's a complex situation and what we've seen is people reduce the headroom. It just makes it really difficult to cope with.' The number of A&E admissions has risen by 3.5% from April to August 2013 to the same period this year. 'The scale of the operational challenge is being felt throughout the hospital across clinical and administrative areas and most particularly among staff involved in the care of emergency patients,' the board report read. 'Sickness due to stress is high and the general level of sickness across the trust is up.' Ms Dugdale said stress had been compounded as A&E admissions had climbed at the time of some ward moves - during a redecoration programme to maintain standards. She said she did not know how long it would take to bring the 'extreme' pressure under control but that dedicated staff were doing all they could.","Anna Dugdale has run Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital since 2008 .

"Nine rail workers were just seconds from death in Lancashire after being given no warning that an 80mph passenger train was bearing down on them, rail accident investigators have said. The track workers, operating on a small bridge on the West Coast main line in Lancashire, were reliant on getting visual and audible warnings of approaching trains as their view was restricted by the curvature of the track. But they received no advance warning that an Edinburgh to Manchester Airport train was approaching. Scroll down for video . The workers received no advance warning that an Edinburgh to Manchester Airport train was approaching . The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said: 'They were forced to take immediate evasive action when the train first became visible, approximately four seconds before it reached the site of work. 'Some staff were unable to reach a safe position and pressed themselves against the bridge parapet.' The RAIB has launched an investigation into the incident that happened south of Hest Bank between Carnforth and Lancaster on the afternoon of September 22 this year. The RAIB said the track workers comprised contract staff and a controller of site safety employed by Network Rail (NR). They were packing ballast under sleepers on the up (towards London) main line on a small bridge. A lookout-operated warning system (LOWS) was being used to give warning of approaching trains because of the gang's restricted view. This system is designed to allow lookouts to signal the approach of a train by operating two toggle switches on an LOWS lookout unit. This then transmits a radio signal to a LOWS static unit which then gives both visual and audible warnings. The investigation will focus on why the workers were not warned of an approaching train (File photo) The RAIB said that on the afternoon of the near-miss, the LOWS equipment was being operated by two NR lookouts, one on each side of the site of work and each equipped with an LOWS lookout unit. The lookout watching for trains on the up line was located about half a mile from the site of work, in a position which gave him a good view of trains approaching from the north. The static unit was located near the track workers. The LOWS is reported to have been both tested and operating normally prior to the incident. The RAIB said: 'Our investigation will examine the reasons why no warning was provided to the track workers. It will consider the sequence of events and factors that may have led to the incident, and identify any safety lessons.' Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union, said: 'This incident once again illustrates the dangers that confront track workers on Britain's railways on a daily basis. 'We have repeatedly raised concerns about the safety of the LOWS and this RAIB report should force the pace for Network Rail to come up with a safer alternative.'","Shocking incident took place between Carnforth and Lancaster .

"A coffee connoisseur from Florida has smashed the world drinks records for the biggest and most expensive Starbucks drink by ordering himself a 101-shot latte which cost an impressive $83.75. Political consultant and talk show host William Lewis told the Today Show that the feat had started as an online challenge and added that he was more than happy to accept because he feels that Starbucks' 31oz maximum drinks policy is a direct contradiction to their promise to fulfill any customer's customization request. It is not the first time that Mr Lewis has gained notoriety through a Starbucks stunt. The would-be comedian regularly updates his Facebook fans about his morning coffee order - usually a six-shot Venti, four-pump vanilla, one-pump mocha, extra-hot, extra fat, upside down latte. Caffeine overload: William Lewis smashed world drinks records by ordering the 101-shot latte . That's once pricey cup of coffee! The mega beverage set Mr Lewis back $83.75. Thankfully he had enough reward points stored up on his Starbucks card to cover the cost . However Mr Lewis' close friend Rico Petrocelli insists that this latest challenge is his best yet. 'This is the apex of his Starbucks career,' Mr Petrocelli told the Today Show. 'It's like pulling up to McDonald's drive-thru and saying, ""give me 600 hamburgers"". And it's not just Starbucks which keeps Mr Lewis' Facebook fans entertained. The Florida native is also a keen coupon collector, a hobby which helped him to cover the cost of the 'mega' latte as it is now known. Thanks to his continued custom at Starbucks, Mr Lewis was able to pay for his beverage using the remaining reward points on his Starbucks MyRewards loyalty card, which grants a free drink of the customer's choice after every 12 coffee orders. 'I advised him not to drink it': Mr Lewis' barista admitted that she didn't think it was wise for him to drink the entire latte . Above average: Starbucks usually insist that no hot beverage can be served larger than a 20 ounce Venti size . Despite Mr Lewis' enthusiasm about completing the challenge, not everyone shared his optimism - with Starbucks barista Danielle Strachan admitting that she advised him not to drink it, even though she thought her words of wisdom might land her in trouble with her employer. Starbucks spokesperson Linda Mills told the Today Show that the company's policy is that its hot beverages can't be served larger than a 20oz Venti size. She insisted that Mr Lewis' beverage was 'naturally against our policy' and advised that he exercise caution with regard to such excessive caffeine consumption. It seems their advice may have had impact however; after posing for photographs, Mr Lewis invited two of his close friends to share the 'mega' latte with each third portion coming in at around 32oz per man - just a fraction more than Starbucks' 31oz Trenta cup.","The record-breaking beverage cost a whopping $83.75 .

"The wait is nearly over. The much-anticipated fragrance from One Direction - Our Moment - goes on sale on August 25th at Harrods and is being described as the biggest ever celebrity perfume launch. The store has held off doing any additional promotion as the fragrance is likely to sell out within the first few days of going on sale. The celebrity fragrance market grows bigger every year - with last year's sales worth £255 million in the UK - and this year's figures looking like they will top that. We've come a long way from the first celebrity fragrance - L'Interdit - designed for Audrey Hepburn by Hubert Givenchy in 1957. To date, the most successful celebrity fragrance ever is Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds, which followed the launch of her first fragrance, Passion, in 1989. Scroll down for video . One Direction's first scent is called 'Our Moment' and comes in a hexagonal shaped bottle with what looks like Barbie's upside-down tutu topped with a tiara as a stopper . The scent is designed to appeal to fans of Niall Horan, Zayn Malik, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson . Now it seems that everyone has their own fragrance - Justin Bieber, Beyonce, Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj and Mariah Carey's fragrances have been huge hits. And like One Direction, they all say they are hands-on with every aspect of the production of their perfumes, from the all-important packaging to the shape of the bottle to what goes into it to produce the actual scent. There are only four sample bottles of Our Moment available in the UK - but I've managed to get my hands on one, so can tell you precisely what it's like. The pale pink box features black and white pictures of the boys on one side and silvery grey roses - a hint of what's inside the bottle. This is definitely one for the girls - and very girly girls at that. Hardly surprisingly there is a waiting list for this - but the real surprise is that the ages range from 16 to 68 - so it's not just for very young fans, . The bottle is a bit of a surprise - in that it's a hexagonal shape with what looks like Barbie's upside-down tutu topped with a tiara as a stopper. To date, the most successful celebrity fragrance ever is Elizabeth Taylor's White Diamonds . Actually it's meant to be a pink flower, made of netting, that reflects the blend of jasmine petals and frangipani, which combined with pink grapefruit, wild berries and red currants make up the actual fragrance. If that's not enough - dry woody notes of musk and patchouli add to the overall effect. It's certainly a scent that you won't forget in a hurry as it doesn't wear off. I liked getting perfume when I was a . little girl. In those days, it came in teddy shaped glass bottles from . Woolworth's and was either lavender water or eau de cologne. I . found Our Moment very sweet and a tad too heavy for daytime for . grown-ups - and even an hour after first spraying this, the smell still . lingered over me like a huge cloud of frangipani and candyfloss. I have . nothing against frangipani, it's just combined with everything else that . the overall effect is a bit cloying. Now it seems that everyone has their own fragrance; Justin Bieber's scent is called 'Girlfriend' (right) Lady Gaga poses naked in the ad campaign for her perfume, Fame. The singer has miniature scantily-clad men crawling over her body to save her blushes . It's designed to appeal to One Direction fans and I have no doubt that this will be flying off the shelves. The least expensive bottle is £21 for 30ml, but it's truly a smell you'll need to fall in love with before you part with a penny of your pocket money.

"A leading American cardinal has slammed the Pope for destabilising Roman Catholicism, leaving congregations feeling 'betrayed'. Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke said the Church is 'a ship without a rudder' leaving believers 'feeling a bit seasick'. His words come after a Vatican conference proposed relaxing their approach towards homosexuality. Angry: Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke condemned Pope Francis for 'confusing' the faithful . He said: 'Many have expressed their concerns to me. At this very critical moment, there is a strong sense that the church is like a ship without a rudder. 'They are feeling a bit seasick because they feel the church’s ship has lost its way.' The conference, which convenes every two years, discusses the Church's approach to family dynamics. A preliminary report released from the confidential meeting revealed a proposal to sideline the 'all or nothing' attitude currently held by Catholics in respect of 'irregular' set-ups such as unmarried parents. Shocking: The pontiff sent shock waves through the Church by kissing a severely deformed man . 'Liberal approach': He has been condemned by hard-line Catholics for being too relaxed on social issues . It added that there are 'positive elements' in gay relationships that have 'gifts and qualities' the Church should not reject. Philadelphia Archbishop Charles Chaput also raised concerns with the pope's comments, saying of homosexuality: 'None of us are welcomed on our own terms in the church. We are welcomed on Jesus' terms. That's what it means to be a Christian. You submit yourself to Jesus and his teaching. You don't re-create your own body of spirituality.' The report has been seen as one of many moves by the papacy to negotiate new perspectives on social issues that had until now been sidelined - such as abortion, divorce and contraception. The pontiff sent shock waves through the Church when he washed two women's feet in a local prison on Holy Thursday last year. Compassion: He demonstrated compassion by washing the feet of a woman and a man with boils last year .

Earlier this week it was claimed the iCloud storage service in China was attacked by hackers trying to steal user credentials, a Chinese web monitoring group said, adding that it believes the Beijing government is behind the campaign. Using what is called a 'man-in-the-middle' (MITM) attack, the hackers interposed their own website between users and Apple's iCloud server, intercepting data and potentially gaining access to passwords, iMessages, photos and contacts, Greatfire.org wrote in its blog post. An Apple representative declined comment on the allegations that Beijing was trying to spy on Apple customers, but noted that the company had updated its technical support page to provide advice on how to protect against such attacks. 'We're aware of intermittent organized network attacks using insecure certificates to obtain user information, and we take this very seriously,' the page read. Apple tells users to never enter their iCloud password if they get warnings about invalid digital certificates when visiting www.icloud.com. It also describes procedures users can use to verify they are connected to Apple's legitimate site when using various browsers. Greatfire.org, which conducts research on Chinese Internet censorship, alleged government involvement in the attack, saying it resembled previous attacks on Google ,Yahoo and Microsoft Corp's Hotmail. Asked about the attack, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told a daily news briefing that Beijing was 'resolutely opposed' to hacking. The attack cited by Greatfire comes several weeks after Apple said it would begin storing iCloud data for Chinese users on China Telecom (0728.HK) servers. The attack cited by Greatfire comes several weeks after Apple said it would begin storing iCloud data for Chinese users on China Telecom (0728.HK) servers. It also coincided with the start of iPhone 6 sales in China, which began Friday after weeks of talks between China and Apple over what the government said were cybersecurity concerns. Two independent security experts contacted by Reuters said Greatfire's report appeared credible. 'All the evidence I've seen would support that this is a real attack,' said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at security software developer F-Secure. Greatfire.org said the attack most likely could not have been staged without knowledge of Internet providers like China Telecom, given they appeared to originate from 'deep within the Chinese domestic Internet backbone'. But the group said the attack may not be linked to Apple's recent decision to store user data on China Telecom servers. It was unclear if the hackers were still active. Apple did not have an immediate comment when contacted. A China Telecom spokesman said: 'The accusation is untrue and unfounded.' Apple said at the time the move to China Telecom was made to improve the speed of service for Chinese servers and flatly denied the possibility that it would expose user data.","Cook discussed user data security at a meeting  with top Chinese government official in Beijing .

"Tearful: This mugshot of Shanesha Taylor moved people on the internet to donate more than $100,000 . A mother who won public sympathy - and donations of more than $100,000 - claiming she left her two little boys alone in a sweltering car only so she could attend a job interview is now faces charges for keeping the money to herself. Shanesha Taylor missed a deadline on Thursday to set up a trust fund for her children with the donated money, as she had promised to do. Breaching the deal means she will now face trial on December 10 on two felony charges of child abuse. Ms Taylor, 35, of Phoenix, Arizona, became an Internet sensation after her tear-stained mugshot was published following her arrest for leaving her children - a two-year-old and six-month-old - in a 100F car while she went to a job interview. She received $114,000 in donations from a public that seemed inclined to give her a pass for endangering her children because she was apparently trying to get a job and was heartbroken over what she had done. Prosecutors gave her a break, too, allowing her to keep her kids and not face charges as long as she set up a $60,000 trust fund for her children with the donated money. But Ms Taylor breached the deal by missing Thursday's deadline for putting money in the trusts, even after the amount of her payments was lowered to $40,000. Outside a court hearing on Thursday, Ms Taylor repeatedly refused to say how much of the donated money remains, but said it was well over $60,000. She said she didn't fund the trusts because her children will not get the money if they choose not to attend college. Prosecutors say the mother of three has spent about $4,100 per month, including more than $1,000 in non-essential items such as cable TV, clothing and dining. Prosecutor Bill Montgomery said this week his patience 'has reached its limit.' Ms Taylor said she isn't living an extravagant lifestyle, taking her children out to eat at places like McDonald's and Chuck E. Cheese's. More importantly, Taylor said, she is still looking for work on a regular basis. Ms Taylor left her two sons - one two years old and the other eight months - in her car for about 45 minutes outside an insurance company where she was being interviewed for a job . Passersby called the police after noticing the boys inside the car. Police said the keys were in the ignition but the air conditioning was off and the fan was blowing hot air. Temperatures inside the car reached 100F . 'I am not some lazy bum sitting on the couch,' Taylor said. Ms Taylor was arrested March 20 after leaving her two young sons in her car for about 45 minutes while she interviewed for a job with a Scottsdale insurance company. Authorities said the temperature inside the car exceeded 100F. A witness found the infant crying hysterically and sweating profusely. She told investigators she didn't have anyone to watch her then-2-year-old and 8-month-old sons. Her situation, along with her mug shot, inspired a New Jersey woman to start an online fundraising campaign for her. Donations poured in. She struck a deal with prosecutors in July that allowed her to avoid prosecution if she fulfilled a number of requirements, such as setting up the trust funds, taking parenting classes and completing a substance-abuse treatment program. Firestorm: A struggling New Jersey mother set up this youcaring page for Ms Taylor. It raised more than $100,000 but also been a forum for heated comments in support and against of Shanesha . Divisive: Ms Taylor's story split public opinion between those who are supportive of a mother on food stamps trying to get ahead any way she knows how and those who believe she should never put her kids in danger under any circumstances . Prosecutors backed out of the deal after they say Ms Taylor failed to put $60,000 in the trusts. Still, they gave her another chance by lowering the amount to $40,000 as they negotiated with her. Ms Taylor told Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Kemp she missed the deadline for making the trust deposits because she thought it was Nov. 15. Ms Taylor's attorneys, Benjamin Taylor and John Agra, were clearly frustrated at Thursday's hearing and asked the judge to remove them from the case. 'This is a deal of a lifetime,' said a clearly frustrated Benjamin Taylor, who isn't related to his client. Taylor said she and her attorneys have experienced a 'communication breakdown' in recent weeks. The blown deadline has sparked criticism and speculation on social media. Some people say Taylor is not worthy of sympathy, while others have accused her of already spending the funds. But she also still has supporters who are giving her the benefit of the doubt. Gary Braden of Phoenix donated twice to the online fund. He said her request to put less money into the trust funds doesn't necessarily mean anything unethical is going on. 'They keep saying she spent it all. Then why would she offer to put up $35,000?' Braden said. 'I put myself in her position. If I don't have a job, I'm not going to put up a bunch of money that I can't touch.' Braden said he will continue to follow the case, but he has no regrets about opening his wallet. 'As far as I'm concerned, she could have burned the money. It wouldn't have bothered me,' Braden said. 'Whatever the person did with the gift, that's on them.'","Shanesha Taylor escaped charges, won sympathy after tearful admission .

"A 53-year-old paedophile opened a milk bar near a high school before he assaulted another victim, despite having previously been jailed for two years for sexual offences against a teenage boy. Brett Barrett, who was locked up in a Queensland jail in the late 1990s, started a new life in Victoria where he took over the store in Melbourne’s south east that advertised 'after-school specials' in late 2013,The Age revealed. The convicted child sex offender was sentenced to seven months jail on Thursday after he groped a boy, showed him pornography, and sent him a picture of his genitals. Convicted child sex offender Brett Barrett ran a milk bar in Melbourne’s south east near a high school . Barrett's lawyer said he would appeal the sentence handed down for three counts of committing an indecent act against a teenager. The Age reports that detectives investigating Barrett’s latest sex crime did not know he was running a milk bar. This is thought to be because his last conviction was before the National Child Offender Register was introduced to Victoria in 2004, meaning Barrett did not receive police monitoring while living in the state. The Register tracks those convicted of sex offences against children after 2003. An individual can be placed on the register for a period of eight or fifteen years, or for life, depending on the type and severity of the offences. All states now use a website that monitors and shares mandatory information about convicted paedophiles with police across states and enables alerts to be generated when registered persons say that they are planning to travel interstate or overseas. However, there have been calls for a public national sex offender register, a proposal recently rejected by all states and territories apart from the Northern Territory at a Council of Australian Governments meeting. The Northern Territory became the first jurisdiction in Australia to introduce a website where the public can look up what convicted sex offenders are in their area, including an image and physical description. The NT’s register will be named after murdered Queensland teenager Daniel Morcombe, whose parents Bruce and Denise have campaigned for over a decade for a public register. 'Every parent has the right to know if there is a dangerous sex offender living in their neighbourhood,' they said in a statement. Tireless ‘name and shame’ campaigner Derryn Hinch has also fought to have a national public register introduced and told Daily Mail Australia that this milk bar story is not an example of someone slipping through the system because a ‘system doesn’t exist’. If there was a national public register the public could have seen this sleazy guy running “after-school specials” for kids and they could have checked the register and looked him up,’ Mr Hinch said. Mr Hinch, who has served time in jail and five weeks under house arrest as a consequence of his belief that the public have ‘a right to know’ who sex offenders are, also slammed the sentence handed down to Barrett. ‘What also angers me is he’s got a seven month jail sentence despite previous convictions and the lawyer says he’s going to appeal. I hope he does appeal and it gets changed to seven years.’ The veteran journalist said Australia is home to over 100,000 predators and if it’s just the NT that uses a public register they will cross state borders to avoid detection. ‘The Northern Territory is going to bring this in and this story is a prime example of the reason we need it to be national because it’s a domino effect and people crossing state borders… this gives me even more belief that in three years we will have a national register,’ he explained.

"His day in court: Onyango Obama, 69, faces deportation and testified in his defense in a Boston immigration court on Tuesday . President Obama's uncle has testified at his deportation hearing that he housed his famous relative for a few weeks when he was student at Harvard Law School. This statement contradicts earlier claims by the White House, which says that Barack Obama has never met his controversial uncle Onyango Obama. The 69-year-old half-brother of the president's late father will be allowed to remain in the United States after a hearing at a Massachusetts Immigration Court on Tuesday afternoon. After listening to witnesses praise the liquor store owner's high moral character from his friends and landlord, the immigration judge ruled that he should be allowed to apply for legal citizenship. Onyango Obama has lived in the United States since the 1960s, when he came here as a teenager to attend school. Obama, a liquor store manager, was ordered to leave the country in 1992, but remained. His immigration status did not become public until his arrest for drunken driving in 2011 in Framingham, just west of Boston. After his arrest, he allegedly told police, ‘I think I will call the White House.’ Today, . he said he did not remember making that specific request upon his . arrest, but Boston Globe journalist Maria Sacchetti reports that he said . he 'made a mistake drinking 3 beers' before getting behind the wheel . that night. In court, he . listed his relatives that live in the U.S., including the most famous . family connection: 'I do have a nephew. He's the President of the United . States.' He went on to say that Barack Obama stayed with him for three weeks when he first moved to Cambridge in order to attend Harvard Law School. The president started at Harvard in 1988, and his press office has previously claimed that he never actually met the 69-year-old. Scroll down for video . Well connected: When he was arrested for drunk driving in 2011, President Obama's uncle suggested that the police call the White House to speak to his nephew, the Presdient (seen here on Tuesday in DC) The elder Obama's landlord, Alfred Ouma, . also testified that Barack stayed with his uncle when he was a student . in Boston. The White House has not yet commented on today's proceedings. Earlier this year, the Board of Immigration Appeals sent the case to the Executive Office for Immigration Review for reassessment. Margaret Wong, Obama's Cleveland-based immigration attorney, called him a ‘wonderful older gentleman.’ ‘He has earned his privilege to stay in the United States. He has been here for 50 years,’ she said Tuesday before the hearing. The White House has said it expects the case to be handled like any other immigration case. In the drunken driving case, Obama admitted to sufficient facts, meaning he did not plead guilty but acknowledged prosecutors had enough evidence to convict him. Moral character: A friend and a landlord testified on Onyango's behalf, saying that he was a good neighbor who paid taxes and mentored Kenyan students in the United States . A judge continued the case for one year without a finding, saying the charge would be dismissed if Obama did not get arrested again during that time. Wong said Obama has successfully completed that program. In the president's memoir, Dreams from My Father, he writes about his 1988 trip to Kenya and refers to an Uncle Omar, who matches Onyango Obama's background and has the same date of birth. Onyango is the second Obama family member to be found living illegally in the United States. His sister, Zeituni Onyango, the president's aunt, made headlines when she was granted asylum in 2010 after her first asylum request in 2002 was rejected and she was ordered deported in 2004. She did not leave the country and continued to live in public housing in Boston. Her status was revealed just days before Obama was elected in November 2008. At the time, then-candidate Obama said he did not know his aunt was living here illegally and that he believes laws covering the situation should be followed.","Onyango Obama, 69, has been an illegal resident of the U.S. since his student visa ran out in 1970 .

"Paedophilia is an illness and is linked to abnormalities in the brain’s white matter, according to one leading expert. Clinical psychologist James Cantor, studied MRI scans to look at the brains of paedophiles and believes that there is a literal ‘cross-wiring’ of  the sexual response system and parental, nurturing system, in paedophiles' brains. He also noticed that people who are sexually drawn to children are more likely to be left-handed, less intelligent and shorter than average men. Scroll down for video . In another study, clinical psychologist James Cantor, (pictured) studied MRI scans to look at the brains of paedophiles and believes that there is a literal 'cross wiring' of paedophiles' sexual response system and parental, nurturing system, in their brains . Dr Cantor, of the University of Toronto, Canada, was surprised to find ‘huge differences’ in the white matter of paedophiles’ brains when compared to those of typical men. Talking on The Agenda with Steve Paikin, he explained he had expected to find differences in the brain’s grey matter, where major variations are often found. He said ‘nothing’s ever in the white matter,’ which he describes as ‘cabling tissue’ that links different parts of the brain together. Dr Cantor said that when men find women sexually attractive, they unconsciously lower their voices and widen their stance, whereas when they talk to children their voices become higher. He explained that instead of evoking the typical responses that men exhibit when seeing a child, ‘it’s as if [paedophiles’] responses are cross-wired’ so that when they see a child, their brain ‘triggers the sex response system instead of the parental, nurturing system’. A previous study by the University of Toronto, Canada, discovered 'huge differences' in the white matter of paedophiles' brains when compared to those of typical men. A cross section of a typical human brain, is pictured where the grey matter is stained blue . While the implications of his study are unclear and Dr Cantor does not suggest the cross-wiring could be fixed by an operation, he said his research adds to evidence that no man is in control of what he is sexually interested in. Dr Cantor also said that paedophiles tend to be between 10 and 15 IQ points lower than average and are typically 2.5cm shorter than a typical male. ‘Two-and-a-half centimetres in physiological terms in very, very large – double the effect we would see if a woman smoked when she was pregnant,’ he said. Interestingly, Dr Cantor also discovered that while 10 to 12 per cent of the Canadian population is left-handed, 30 to 35 per cent of paedophiles are left-handed. The only other groups that have similar left-handed rates are people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, he said. Dr Cantor noticed that people who are sexually drawn to children are more likely to be left-handed, less intelligent and shorter, than average men . He came to these conclusions by giving paedophiles different tasks from verbal and non-verbal tests to spelling exercises. Dr Cantor acknowledges that some people do exist who are evil and need to be kept out of society, but controversially thinks that this approach will not solve the problem of paedophiles attacking children. He believes mental health professionals should create situations where paedophiles can see a professional but stay anonymous, so that they can be treated with sex-reducing medication, counselling, group therapy, or any other appropriate treatments. He said that people’s gut reaction of immediately removing paedophiles from society is ‘making things worse rather than better’. ‘We need to be able to be dispassionate and clinical and think rationally about the situation, rather than give in to our instinct,’ he said.","Clinical psychologist Dr James Cantor, studied MRI scans to look at the brains of paedophiles .

"The eight-year-old boy who touched hearts around the world with his heartbreaking battle with brain cancer has sadly died. School boy Sam Martin, who was diagnosed with an aggressive and inoperable brain tumour in July 2013, died peacefully at his home on the Sunshine Coast, in Queensland, on Wednesday night. His devastated father Mark Martin confirmed the news in a brave tribute post on a Facebook page that has thousands of followers and was set up to support Sam. 'Sam simply drifted off to sleep without any further pain, anguish or suffering which is a blessing given what the little guy has been through the last 14 months,' Mr Martin wrote on Thursday. Scroll down for video . Eight-year-old Sam Martin lost his battle with brain cancer on October 8 2014 . Last month, Sam's family confirmed that he was expected to pass away at any day after the stage three adult-type fibrosarcoma he was suffering from had not been cured by 13 rounds of chemotherapy and seven weeks of radiation therapy. A heart-wrenching video showed his declining journey from a glowing, energetic and healthy young boy to a very frail, sick child and pulled at the heart strings of complete strangers who expressed their warm wishes on the Facebook page dedicated to the lovable boy. Sam's father described his 'mixed feelings' over his son's death in his post on the  page Sam's Journey. He said he was feeling 'immense sadness and extreme pride.' 'Immense sadness in that Sam passed away peacefully at 19.47 last night at home with Tanya, Ella, Roxy and I by his side,' he explained.

The father praised Sam's older sister, Ella, calling her 'the unsung hero of this whole deal'. 'In her own special way she has been the glue that has kept us all together, her ability to lift both Tanya and I when we've had our moments has been priceless. 'While Sam has attracted a fair amount of our space and time over the past year and a bit the world better look out for this one, she has a fire, a strength and a determination that is scary,' Mr Martin wrote. Sam Martin's tragic story has touched the hearts of thousands of people from across the globe . Sam's dad, Mark Martin, said his son has always had a truly magnetic personality and a certain 'like ability' He also wrote a touching tribute to his wife Tanya, Sam's mother. 'To this day her strength and beauty blows me away and I could not have asked for a better partner to have walked the path we have so far. While the path ahead is daunting and unknown together I know we will be fine.' He added: 'While Sam is no longer physically here rest assured this won't be the last you hear of our special little man.' Doctors sent Sam home to be with his family in September as they were unable to operate on the tumour which had moved into the brain. Brain cancer kills more children than any other type of cancer, yet nine out of 10 Australians are completely unaware of this statistic . His parents Mark and Tanya Martin and big sister Ella, 10, have been overwhelmed by the support shown from strangers from all over the world including the Netherlands, Malaysia, Canada, London and Denmark. Mr Martin said it was hard to find the words to describe the love shown for his son. 'Ever since Sam was born he has had a certain 'like ability' to him, one of those truly magnetic personalities,' he told the Sunshine Coast Daily. 'It is heartening to see even through all this he has maintained that quality, as is evident by the outpouring of love from everyone.' Doctors sent Sam home to be with his family as they were unable to operate on the tumour in his left cheek . Sam was very fatigued from the medication to keep his pain at bay before he died . One of more than 5,000 people who have joined the Sam's Journey Facebook page, is Melinda Casaubon who although she doesn't know Sam or his family, held a group walk up Mount Coolum in his honour. 'I have a son the same age so I just can't imagine what they are going through,' Ms Casaubon told Daily Mail Australia. 'I thought it would be nice to get outdoors and do something local where we can enlighten Sam and his family's day and also think about the things we take for granted.' The 52 lives website also has a page dedicated to Sam asking people to light a candle and post the photo on his Facebook page or email it through the site. Before he died Sam was almost uncommunicative and very fatigued from the medication to keep his pain at bay. Melinda Casaubon, with her two children, held a walk up Mount Coolum  in Sam's honour . 'It's really sad to see. It rips me apart because there is no interaction because he is on that many drugs to manage his pain,' Mr Martin said. In August, Australian neurosurgeon Charlie Teo told Daily Mail Australia brain cancer kills more children than any other type of cancer, yet nine out of 10 Australians are completely unaware of this statistic. And the figures speak for themselves. Only three per cent of funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council has gone towards brain cancer. From 2009 to 2013, brain cancer research received just under $28 million. Over the same period, breast cancer took 11 per cent of the Government funding pool, or $100 million. Leukaemia research received just a touch less at $96 million over the four years. Dr Teo said Australia is guilty of leaving children to fight brain cancer battle alone. 'That's pretty dismal [the funding levels] considering just two in ten patients will survive for five years in Australia,' he told Daily Mail Australia. Brain cancer has more impact on society than any other cancer but it receives least amount of funding.' When asked about why there's low awareness surrounding the disease, Dr Teo had a simple answer. 'It's because everyone dies,' he said. 'There are no survivors who can tell their story and become ambassadors for the cause - not even from my high profile clients. They're all dead.' For the average Australian family who've been affected by the tragedy, they often don't want to relive the devastating moments. 'It's an especially terrible death for children who lose function, become paralysed and suffer horribly from the debilitating death,' Dr Teo said. Sam's family hope to raise awareness of childhood brain cancer and the impact it can have.","Sam Martin, 8, died from an inoperable tumour on Wednesday .

"A pair of thugs who pushed a blind and deaf man and his brother on to train tracks in a 'horrifying assault' at a busy station have both been jailed. Daniel Webster, 23, and Niall Martin, 24 pushed a 31-year-old, off the platform at Chelmsford station in Essex, then threw his brother Joseph down after him as he tried to intervene. Martin admitted ABH on the brother and was given a nine-month sentence - but he has been freed already after he spent five months in custody, making him eligible for parole. Daniel Webster, left, has been jailed for 22 months after attacking a blind and deaf man, along with his brother. Niall Martin, right, was jailed for 9 months for his part in the assault . Webster was jailed for 22 months after pleading guilty to GBH and ABH against both brothers. Chelmsford Crown Court heard that the victim was attacked by Webster and Martin late at night on February 20 this year after the pair came over to ask him about train times. A row broke out, and Webster launched his attack on the victim, who was described in court as 'profoundly deaf' and is registered blind. CCTV footage from the station shows a second man trying to come to the aid of his vulnerable brother, only for both of them to be thrown on to the tracks. CCTV from Chelmsford station, Essex, shows Daniel Webster throwing one of the victims on to the train tracks. National rail staff had to block incoming trains for fear the brothers would be killed . As the pair scramble back to the platform edge and attempt to climb back to safety, Martin and Webster punch them both in the head, leaving them stranded. Network rail staff were forced to put a block on all trains coming through the station over fears that the pair could have been killed. Webster punches one of the victims as he tries to get back on to the platform in the 'horrifying' attack . Jailing the pair yesterday  Judge David Turner QC said it had been a 'disgraceful episode' and labelled their actions 'manifestly dangerous'. He said: 'This is exactly the sort of thing that terrifies members of the travelling public late at night.' Speaking afterwards, Detective Constable Alan Reed of British Transport Police said: 'This is one of the most appalling incidents I have investigated. 'Webster and Martin showed a savage disregard for their victims, and one of the brothers is still suffering from the injuries sustained to his foot. 'It is no exaggeration to say the brothers could have been killed after being thrown onto the tracks. 'I would like to pay tribute to the victims, who have shown great dignity following what was a terrifying ordeal for them . 'I hope the sentence will provide them with some sense of closure, although in truth, the impact this has had on both of them is likely to remain with them for the rest of their lives.' The court heard that the victim spent six weeks on crutches and was off work for six months. He now walks with a limp and has been told the foot injury may take two years to heal and may need further surgery.","Daniel Webster, 23, and Niall Martin, 24, got into row at Chelmsford station .

"A 75-year-old woman who received a letter of apology from the career criminal who burgled her home felt so sorry for him that she sent him £20 in prison. Kevin Derbyshire, 24, and an accomplice stole £10,000 worth of jewellery when they raided the home of Loretta Smith in Bolton, Greater Manchester. The men were caught after footage of the raid, taken from a camera on Mrs Smith's property, was posted online. Apology: Kevin Derbyshire (left) wrote a letter to Mrs Smith while he was awaiting sentencing for the burglary, which took place in August last year. Graham Llewellyn's (right) letter to the 75-year-old has gone unanswered . Both Derbyshire and his accomplice, Graham Llewellyn, also 24, wrote to Mrs Smith as they awaited sentencing for the crime. Derbyshire promised to buy her a bunch of flowers and 'the best bottle of wine he could afford' and apologised profusely for the crime, which he said he committed while on Valium. Mrs Smith said she felt 'so sorry' for Derbyshire that she decided to send him £20, explaining that she thought it was a 'normal' thing to do. She said: 'I'm sorry if people think I'm stupid but I don't think it was silly. 'I thought his letter came from the heart but maybe I'm just gullible. 'I'm hoping it will bring him to his senses and make him realise he has to go out and work.' Mrs Smith, who is company secretary of a taxi firm, has not replied to Llewellyn - who said that he was drunk when he raided her home. Most of the items stolen in the raid last August were returned but a diamond ring and bracelet have not been recovered and Mrs Smith was left with a £500 repair bill to a broken window. Details of the apology emerged at Bolton Crown Court where Derbyshire's lawyer used it to help with his plea for mitigation. Mrs Smith said: 'The police tell me these two men are prolific burglars and shoplifters and I'm told people like them send letters to victims because they are instructed by their solicitors to do so. 'But it was no big deal for me to send him money - it would be normal for me to do something like that and It was just something that I wanted to do. 'I know it might not make sense but it did to me at the time. If people think I'm silly then hey ho. 'He wrote to me again but I haven't answered. When he wrote back he never mentioned the money but it may not have got to him at that point. 'He did say when he comes out of prison he is going to buy me a bunch of flowers and the best bottle of wine he can afford. 'The other guy has also sent me a letter but I haven't replied - he said that his wife had got a little boy and she had a daughter due and he was drunk. The raid took place while Mrs Smith was at work after Derbyshire and Llewellyn spotted an open skylight window and climbed into the property. Revelation: Details of the apology emerged at Bolton Crown Court (pictured) where Derbyshire's lawyer used it to help with his plea for mitigation. Mrs Smith said that she thought the letter 'came from the heart' Attempts were made to destroy a CCTV hard drive which had installed following a previous break in - but within 24 hours of the crime images from the camera clearly identifying Derbyshire and Llewellyn were posted on Facebook. After seeing the pictures, Llewellyn bundled the stolen property into a black bin bag and left it outside Mrs Smith's home. She said: 'They took a lot of serious stuff. There were several designer watches and an expensive one I got from the Caribbean with diamonds. 'My ruby ring and diamond ring went and a diamond solitaire and my diamond eternity ring. It was absolutely terrible. 'Derbyshire sent me a letter apologising profusely and said he was on Valium. He sent the letter to my house three weeks ago, it was in my mailbox with no name just the address. 'He just said he was very very sorry. His writing was appalling, really bad spelling. 'He said it was only when he read it on Facebook that he realised what a horrible thing he had done and what people thought of him. I think that's why he wrote. 'I felt sorry for him. He obviously wasn't very bright. I thought ""well there you go you've done it"". 'What touched me was the fact that he had been on Facebook and read all the comments and it had really upset him what people thought of him. 'I made it very short and sweet thanking him for the letter and said I was sure that he had not only upset me but he must have upset his partner or wife both financially and emotionally. 'I thought at first I'd send him some stamps so he could send letters to loved ones - but I sent him £20. The lady at the prison said £20 was a lot of money but he will still need toiletries or whatever.' In court Derbyshire's lawyer Nicholas Ross said his client was 'remorseful' and said of Mrs Smith's gift 'It was out of remarkable sympathy, and I might say, in an almost saintly way, a token of her generosity.' Kate Harney, mitigating for Llewellyn, said his client was 'almost institutionalised' and had previously committed offences in order to go to jail where he felt more at home. But she added he was hoping to turn his life around after finding a partner and becoming a father.","Kevin Derbyshire, 24, stole £10,000 worth of jewellery from Loretta Smith .

"This is the dramatic moment when drug smugglers set fire to a ship carrying more than £50 million worth of hashish after being spotted by customs officials. Thick, dense plumes of smoke quickly billowed from the bridge of the Gold Star freighter just minutes after it was 'buzzed' by a helicopter from the Italian coastguard. The nine people on board the Tanzanian registered ship then jumped overboard as they attempted to avoid being arrested but they were miles out to sea and had to be plucked to safety. Scroll down for video . Up in flames: The Tanzanian-registered cargo ship MV Gold Star is seen with its bridge in flames . Night vision: An Armed Forces of Malta vessel (right) battles the fire . Italian customs officials intercepted the Gold Star as it sailed off the coast of Sicily in the Mediterranean following a tip off that it was carrying a huge consignment of drugs and she had been followed for several days before the operation was launched. Besides a helicopter several fast patrol boats were used in the 'raid' and a search of the ship's hold revealed a massive consignment of drugs, 30 tons of hashish which had been loaded on board in Turkey. Italian officials said the crew were Syrian and Egyptians and before they could board the 82 metre 38-year-old ship they had to obtain permission from Tanzania where it was registered. Firefighting boats had to be called in to put out the flames and the ship was today being towed to the Sicilian port of Syracuse where the arrested men were also being held before being questioned. Black cloud: Smugglers decided to set their drug haul on fire, which was evidently noticeable to customs officials . No way out: Customs officials pull up alongside the burning vessel as the game is up . Costly: There was thought to be £50million worth of hash on the boat . Stricken: The smugglers jumped overboard after deciding to set their loot on fire . A spokesman for Italian Customs said: 'The ship was intercepted after intelligence was received that it was carrying drugs - but we never expected such a huge consignment and for the crew to set her on fire. 'The idea was no doubt to try and destroy the evidence so that we could have no case against them but their plan failed and the fire was put out and the drugs were found during the search. 'Nine people on board jumped into the sea but they couldn't get very far as they were several miles from shore and they had to be rescued by Italian customs officers. 'The fire is now under control and the ship is being taken to a port where it will be thoroughly searched again and the nine crew members will be questioned by prosecutors.'","Freighter was 'buzzed' by a helicopter from the Italian coastguard .

"Cancer has played an enormous role in Lachlan Korvin's life . Lachlan Korvin was only 10 years old when he lost his mother Tracey to brain cancer in 2003. But before he could properly come to terms with the loss, he was dealt with another blow -receiving his own testicular cancer diagnosis the following year. Since then, the 24-year-old's whole life has been dedicated to helping people cope with the trauma that comes with either being diagnosed with the illness or having a loved one struggle through it. Aside from working as a radiographer at Dandenong Hospital in Victoria, Mr Korvin is part of the team who on Friday will launch the world's first support website for the 23,000 young Australians who are affected by the illness in some way each year. 'I had some idea of what was going on at the time, but it was never really a sit down sort of thing,' Mr Korvin said of his mother, who he described as 'warm, funny and a bit organic'. 'She was diagnosed and after the initial treatment she went into remission and then she relapsed, which is what took her. That was really scary - when it came back, and then it obviously just got worse. 'When I was diagnosed, that was a bit harder because I'd had that experience and knew what could happen.' Back in 2005, during the completion of his own treatment, Mr Korvin said there were very few avenues for a young person to seek support when cancer struck in their lives. Pictured here with his parents, the 24-year-old lost his mother Tracey (right) to brain cancer when he was 10 years old . 'I was diagnosed while in high school and I had a cool group of friends who helped me through the journey, so there was some understanding and I was very lucky in that sense as not a lot of people had that,' he said. 'But your friends can only go so far when you need people who have been there and done that. 'There's always a lot of uncertainty as to what's going to happen and you have so many questions running through your head, especially during the early stages of diagnosis. 'Things like: will the treatment affect my fertility? Am I actually going to survive? Will I be physically scared? Is the family ever going to be the same again? And then depending on your age you might think: I am too young for this to happen and what role am I going to have to play now, do I have to step up? Mr Korvin (left, with his brother) was then diagnosed with testicular cancer. During his remission he learnt of cancer support group CanTeen and has since remained an active member . 'That is what gets people - this bombardment of despair.' This uncertainty and the lack of support is what inspired Mr Korvin and the CanTeen team to design a website where fears could be expressed and advice and support sought at any time of the day or night. Mr Korvin  learnt of CanTeen through the hospital grapevine following his remission and after getting involved, became an incredibly active member, eventually making his way up to the support group's board. 'I joined up in late 2005 when there was a heavy focus on peer support through in the program and then after a few years I thought I should take on a bigger role because it has done so much for me,' Mr Korvin said. He is now heavily involved in the launch of the CanTeen Online Support Platform, the world's first website that provides young people with 7-day access to counsellors and 24/7 access to an online community where they can share their experiences through forums and testimonials. He now works as a radiographer in Dandenong Hospital in Victoria (left) and sits on CanTeen's board and helps organise many of their events including National Bandanna Day (right) Pictured with his girlfriend Katherine: Mr Korvin is one of the bright young minds behind CanTeen's world first support website for cancer patients and their loved ones which will be launched on Friday . 'CanTeen research shows that young people dealing with cancer are five to six times more likely to develop mental health issues like anxiety and depression,' CanTeen's CEO, Peter Orchard , said. 'Having instant peer and professional support available seven days a week – from anywhere in Australia - will combat the main triggers of psychological distress, which include feelings of isolation and a lack of information about what their cancer journey will involve. 'Our specially trained counsellors truly understand the physical, emotional and practical impact of living with cancer and will be available over extended hours via instant messaging, email or phone. Designed by young people who have all had cancer touch their lives, the website which has received $2 million in government funding, will be launched on Friday.","Lachlan Korvin lost his mother to brain cancer when he was 10 years old before fighting off testicular cancer a year later .

"With its glamorous stars such as Immodesty Blaise and Dita von Teese, glittering costumes and teasing routines, burlesque has never been more popular. But although it might seem like a modern phenomenon, burlesque has roots that lie deep in the world of the Victorian music halls - and even beyond. The old halls were at the heart of popular entertainment in Victorian London and drew huge crowds hungry for fun, music and spectacle. Scroll down for video . Risque: Modern burlesque star Dita von Teese is following in the footsteps of her Victorian predecessors . What made them particularly successful was their embrace of a female audience; the first type of establishment ever to do so. In the preceding years of the 18th century, everything from taverns to coffee houses had been for men alone. Inside their doors, singers and musicians entertained the men while they dined, drank and discussed business and politics, or, perhaps after a glass or two of wine, join in with the choruses. Singing nights became so popular that taverns began to put on musical nights in special rooms, and soon glee clubs were a regular night out for young men. At the bottom of the scale were the ‘penny gaffs’: dismal shops where costermonger boys and girls paid a penny apiece for some rough food and drink served up with patriotic singing and comedy sketches. Colourful: Wiltons Music Hall in Whitechapel was once one of London's most popular venues . Star: The 1930s American actress Jeanette Macdonald was one of the last great music hall stars . One lad told the Victorian historian Henry Mayhew, 'The songs are out and out, and makes our gals laugh. The smuttier the better, I thinks; bless you! The gals like it as much as we do'. So widespread were the penny gaffs, there were reputedly 20 of these dens within a five-mile radius of St Paul’s Cathedral in London. Entertaining though they might have been, they certainly were not places for a decent woman to visit, any more than the taverns and gin palaces were. By the 1830s some slightly better song and supper rooms began to attract a more refined audience, although women were still not allowed to enter, and performers could expect a hail of bottles or boots as well as verbal abuse if their act went down badly. Singers at venues like the Coal Hole, a notorious dive just off the Strand, would be paid £1 a week and all they drink they could hold. They probably needed to be drunk in order to face their audiences. The Eagle on London’s City Road (famous from the nursery rhyme ‘Pop Goes the Weasel’) was one of the musical taverns, and there were countless others in towns and cities the length of the country. Fame: Marie Lloyd, a singer, was particularly notorious and was even banned from the USA for immorality . But things were changing and the first purpose-built music hall opened its doors in the London borough of Lambeth in 1852. The Canterbury Hall had a capacity of 700, and the early all-male audiences came to eat and drink as much as to be entertained. A resounding success, it was soon enlarged to hold 1500 people and pioneered the concept of the music hall, including entertainment for women. Charles Morton, the Canterbury’s owner, believed that women had a civilising effect and made a deliberate effort to attract them by introducing ‘Ladies Thursdays’. Gentlemen could bring a female companion, but in a setting where prostitutes openly worked the aisles the men were not always accompanied by their wives. A flood of new venues opened up in London and throughout the rest of the UK, with the result that by 1870, there were 31 large halls in London and 384 in the rest of the country. Helped by the opening of the first underground railway line, the Metropolitan, more affluent suburban audiences could easily make their way to Town for a night out, and with money to spend they demanded more and better shows in a less risque setting. Impersonator: Vesta Tilley, who died in 1952, was a hugely popular male impersonator . Marriage: Tilley went on to marry Sir Abraham Walter de Frece, Conservative MP and theatre impresario . Popular: Ms Tilley finally retired from her music hall career in 1920 when she married Sir Abraham . New performers were needed to fill the stages at all the brash new Empires and Palaces that soon sprang up to meet the new middle-class demand, so young women – often the daughters of supper club and tavern veterans – stepped into the spotlight for the first time. The stage offered an independent life for many of them, and stardom for a few. A typical music hall bill would feature a chairman keeping order with a gavel, a comedian or two, dancers in daring costume, novelty acts like a juggler, contortionists, trapeze artists or trick cyclists, a drag act, and a magician. Stage magic often employed new science like electricity or magnetism, and audiences were enthralled by the illusions. A dynasty of stage illusionists called the Maskelynes opened a magic theatre on Piccadilly known as the Egyptian Hall, and here young women were sawn in half or levitated or chased through comedy disappearing acts for thousands of performances. The centrepiece of music hall, however, was music – and the star was always the singer. Men like Albert Chevalier and then George Robey were adored, but it was the women and their signature songs who topped the bill. Vesta Tilley was a male impersonator. She was Burlington Bertie, every inch the monocled dandy to look at, but singing in a high and very feminine voice. Retired from the stage she ended her long life as Lady de Freece, wife of the Conservative MP for Blackpool. Marie Lloyd was the Queen of Music Hall. She had made her debut as a table singer at the Eagle, but soon she was the naughty phenomenon of the age. In her distinctive trill she warbled innocent-seeming lyrics with titles like Oh! Mr Porter, What Shall I Do? and She’d Never Had Her Ticket Punched Before that were loaded with double entendres – innocent enough today, but shocking to the Victorians and Edwardians. When the moralists protested about her song I Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas she amended it to I Sits Among the Cabbages and Leeks – to howls of appreciation from her admirers. Loved: Marie Lloyd (right, with her sisters) was one of the genre's brightest stars but succumbed to alcoholism . Outpouring: When Marie died, aged just 52 years old, her funeral was attended by 100,000 people . Marie had a colourful private life; she was refused entry to the US at the start of a tour because she had shared a cabin on the voyage over with a man to whom she was not married. Unlike Vesta Tilley’s, her ending was a sad one – she took to the brandy and fell over drunk on stage. The audience thought it was part of the act and roared with laughter, but she was mortally ill and died a few days later aged only 52. 100,000 people came to her funeral. The grand music hall tradition lay behind later artists like Gracie Fields, George Formby and Stanley Holloway, Charlie Drake and even the Goons, but the days of the halls were numbered. By the 1930s, they had been virtually obliterated by the rising popularity of nights spent enjoying the new films at the cinema. But while the music halls are gone, they certainly aren't forgotten. While later shows such as The Good Old Days were a coarse pastiche of the real thing, our own modern burlesque still captures the glitter, daring and downright risqué thrill of the long-gone old halls.

"The lawyer to high-powered activist and adviser Reverend Al Sharpton, who has been accused of rape, was reportedly seen kissing his accuser right before the incident occurred. Sanford Rubenstein was filmed on a security video making out with the woman who has accused him of rape, and her female friend, in an elevator, according to a source who spoke with the Daily News. The video was taken as the three were heading up to Rubenstein's penthouse apartment. Accused: A file photo shows civil rights power attorney Sanford Rubenstein, who's been accused of raping another trusted ally of Al Sharpton after the reverend's 60th birthday bash on Saturday . Search and seizure: Detectives carried away several bags of evidence from Rubenstein's penthouse apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side. The evidence reportedly included bloody condoms found near Rubenstein's bed and a sex toy . Told of the video, Keith White, a lawyer for the Brooklyn mom who accused Rubenstein of rape, insisted, “It’s not true.” Earlier this week, Reverend Sharpton blasted his former attorney collaborator in the wake of these accusations. Sharpton's highly visible move Tuesday to distance himself from Sanford Rubenstein came a day after police combed the 70-year-old civil rights attorney's apartment for evidence that could paint a picture of what happened in the hours after Sharpton's birthday bash Saturday. Among the potential evidence hauled from Rubenstein's Upper East penthouse on Monday were two bloody condoms and a sex toy. 'Even if it was consensual, why would he take a key leader of our organization back to his apartment right after a fund-raiser,' outraged Sharpton asked the Daily News. 'It's disrespectful to our movement, and the women in our network are absolutely outraged.' Sharpton told the News that Rubenstein, who's stood with the reverend at events dating back to 1997, 'has no future' at the National Action Network. Kenneth Montgomery, one of the accuser's lawyers, told the News: 'She’s fighting to keep her life together, keep her dignity, and not fall apart.' Neighbors and friends, meanwhile, detailed Rubenstein's seedy lifestyle of frequenting strip clubs and using his limousine to pick up much younger women, according to the New York Post. Sanford Rubenstein maintains that he had consensual sex with the 42-year-old retail executive whom he took home after the civil rights leader's birthday party at the Four Seasons last Wednesday. He has not been charged with a crime. However, the woman has told NYPD detectives that Rubenstein took advantage of her when she was passed out drunk and incapable of telling him no. Rubenstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman issued a statement to MailOnline refusing to comment on the Post's claims, 'even those I know to be patently false.' He also reiterated an earlier assertion that Rubenstein will be cleared by the police investigation and that he did not commit a crime. NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan on Tuesday and reportedly collected 'biological evidence,' according to the Post. Rubenstein lives in the $7million penthouse apartment at the top of this East 63rd Street highrise on the Upper East Side . Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. The Post, quoting 'sources close to Rubenstein,' alleges a tawdry personal life that revolved around the constant pursuit of sex. One source told the newspaper: 'The guy’s hung like a cashew.' Another said: 'Every time I see him, he wants to tell me about his latest ménage à trois. It’s all about sex with this guy.' Neighbors say they often seen the septuagenarian lawyer with young women 'barely out of their teens,' according to the Post. One source says the Rubenstein is a regular at strip clubs. He reportedly spent to much time at high-end club Scores that all the strippers greeted him by name when he came in. He also reportedly paid an artist to paint a series of canvasses depicting the club - including a scene showing him getting a rub-down, the Post claims. Sanford Rubenstein (left), seen here at a 2005 party in Miami, is accused of raping a 42-year-old woman. The woman pictured here is not his accuser . He currently haunts at a strip club in Hell's Kitchen that features muscled, tattooed strippers who are black or Hispanic and prefers women who are 5-foot-11 or taller, the Post claims. Meanwhile, attorneys representing the alleged victim  said Monday they have 'devastating' information about the alleged crime. Sources familiar with the case have claimed that the 42-year-old woman, who works for Sharpton’s National Action Network, went home with the 70-year-old attorney willingly last week, and even had sex with him a second time the following morning. But attorney Keith White who represents the alleged victim has challenged these assertions, insisting that a crime had been committed. ‘There’s a lot of new information that will be devastating to Mr. Rubenstein,’ White told New York Daily News. ‘We want to give the district attorney a chance to take this information and do the right thing.‘ . White's partner, Kenneth Montgomery, accused Rubenstein and his legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman of trying to 'demonize' his client. Describing the 42-year-old as a mother and a pillar of the community, Montgomery said her 'world has been turned upside down.' Investigators suspect Rubenstein may have used an object to penetrate the 42-year-old woman during the alleged attack in his $7million Manhattan penthouse, making her bleed, sources told the New York Daily News. The anonymous accusation, which emerged Sunday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed in the morning. The claims came as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side for evidence. On Monday afternoon, police removed a dozen evidence bags, among them one marked 'biological evidence.' They also carried a mattress out of Rubenstein's apartment. Close: The Rev Al Sharpton, center with Rubenstein to the left, has said there is no place for the alleged behavior - but avoided jumping to the conclusion that he is guilty . As part of the investigation, police reportedly set up a call between the alleged victim and Rubenstein, during which the woman asked the 70-year-old attorney, 'What happened last night?' The lawyer replied that they had sex but did not incriminate himself, a police source told the paper. He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement  sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported. He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn’t mean you’re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain’t no place for that in our community.' Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left. Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee. A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter. Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters . But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex. Rubenstein hit back at the claims Monday through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman. Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'. The media-savvy Rubenstein currently represents the family of Eric Garner, who died after a police chokehold during an arrest in July. The case sparked protests and calls for change within the police department. He also represented the family of Sean Bell, killed in 2008 in a hail of police bullets. The city eventually settled with Bell's family for $7.5million. High-profile case: Rev. Herbert Daughtry, far left, Rev. Al Sharpton, second from left, and attorney Sanford Rubenstein, far right, escort Esaw Garner, second from right, the wife of fatal police chokehold victim Eric Garner, after a press conference August  21, 2014 . Rubenstein is a member of the National Action Network and has often stood arm-in-arm with Sharpton at protests. On Monday, Sharpton met with Garner's family and said he would discuss the Garner investigation at a rally on Saturday. Sharpton issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of the allegations. 'National Action Network and Rev. Al Sharpton has not been notified or advised by any official investigating authorities,' the statement read. 'The allegations as reported occurred at a private residence after a NAN event and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev. Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.'","Sanford Rubenstein, 70, accused of raping 42-year-old last week in his Manhattan apartment .

"A freshman football player for the University of Kentucky has been charged with first-degree rape. Defensive end Lloyd Tubman was arrested and charged Tuesday, before he was then suspended indefinitely by the university. Coach Mark Stoops announced the suspension and said in a statement he was 'very concerned about the allegations and all parties involved.' Stoops appeared shaken when discussing the situation after Tuesday's practice, saying, 'Anytime somebody in our program has an issue like this, it's obviously a major concern. We just feel for all parties involved and we'll let the legal process go through its course.' The Lexington-Fayette County jail's website said Tubman was being held on a first-degree rape charge. Charged: University of Kentucky football player Lloyd Tubman was charged with first-degree rape . Alleged rape: The university has said that Tubman was arrested by campus police following an incident last week at a residence hall on campus . The university said in a release that the 6-foot-5, 225-pound Tubman was arrested by campus police following an incident last week at a residence hall on campus. The release also stated the 19-year-old, who played at Louisville Seneca High School, 'is subject to discipline under the University’s Code of Student Conduct. 'Because of legal and student privacy regulations, University officials cannot provide comment to Tubman’s specific participation in the student conduct process.' Stoops learned about the incident last Thursday and said 'It was a tough time as you could imagine. ... I'm not so much concerned for myself in that situation. But really, it was very difficult to meet with Lloyd and meet with his mother and to see somebody in your program hurting. I feel for all parties. 'It's obviously not a situation that anybody wants to be in.' Tubman has not played this season and was likely to be redshirted . Multiple incidents: Tubman's arrest and suspension comes less than a week after four Wildcats players were charged with second degree disorderly conduct for their involvement in air pistol shots being fired near a campus residence hall . The charges brought against Tubman stem from a university crime bulletin published last Thursday, Chief of Police Joe Monroe told Kentucky Kernel. The bulletin said 'On Thursday, October 2, 2014 at approximately 4:15 p.m., it was reported to the University of Kentucky Police that at approximately 11:45 a.m. that day, a female student was sexually assaulted by a male student in a residence hall on campus. The alleged suspect is known to the victim and the crime is currently being investigated.' The state's uniform citation only said that Tubman was arrested at 2:08 p.m. and taken to the Fayette County Detention Center without incident. Tubman has not played this season and was likely to be redshirted. His arrest and suspension comes less than a week after Wildcats freshmen teammates Stanley Williams, Dorian Baker, Drew Barker and Tymere Dubose were charged with second degree disorderly conduct for their involvement in air pistol shots being fired near a campus residence hall on Sept. 28. No one was injured, but the campus was locked down for several hours while police investigated. Police found the air pistol the next day, along with three BB guns. Guns are banned on Kentucky's campus. Stoops suspended the four players for last week's game against South Carolina for violating team rules but said Monday that they will be reinstated for Saturday's game against Louisiana-Monroe. The players face an Oct. 28 appearance in Fayette District Court and possible internal discipline for their roles in the incident. Stoops also said Tuesday 'We constantly talk to [the football team] about things,' according to The Courier-Journal. 'Last week when we had the other issue, I addressed all issues, including this -- including sexual assault and any kind of assault and all those things. I addressed it at that time again. And we'll continue to do the best we can and educate these guys and help these guys and, again, coach them and teach them and mentor them, and we'll be there for them when they need us to.'","University of Kentucky freshman defensive end Lloyd Tubman was arrested and charged with first-degree rape Tuesday .

"Braving the cold as they queued overnight, an onlooker may have thought these shoppers were hoping to get their hands on the latest gadget. Instead, they lined the streets for something less glamorous - the chance to enter a new Aldi store. About 250 people waited outside the store in Birmingham, ahead of its opening at 8am. With its low price strategy, Aldi has enjoyed a remarkable rise in recent years. It is one of the budget chains, along with shops such as Primark and Lidl, that has delivered the biggest change in shopping habits since the 1950s. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of expectant shoppers waited for the opening for a new Aldi store in Birmingham yesterday morning . Richard Scott (pictured right) was the lucky winner of the star prize, a Dyson vacuum cleaner . The new Aldi store is the 15th to open in Birmingham - the budget supermarket is on course to open 54 in 2014 . At the opening yesterday morning, Aldi staff handed out golden envelopes to the first 100 customers through the doors, which included the star prize, a Dyson vacuum cleaner. Robot Vacuum Cleaner WAS £129.99 NOW £79.99 (saving £50) Nine inch Portable DVD Player WAS £49.99 NOW £22.99 (saving £27) 21.5 inch LED TV and DVD Combis WAS £119.99 NOW £89.99 (saving £30) Bluetooth earphones WAS £22.99 NOW £9.99 (saving £13) Maginon FS-500 Film Scanner WAS £29.99 NOW £9.99 (saving £20) The store also had special discounts on items including a 32 HD TV and a seven inch tablet PC. Shoppers also queued up for the chance to purchase a cut-price 21 inch LED TV & DVD Combis, portable DVD players, an espresso coffee machine and a range of goody bags. Elsewhere, the store were selling packs of carrots, parsnips, cauliflower, onions, leeks and baking potatoes for a reduced 59p each. Store manager Christopher Walker said: 'The team and I have very much enjoyed welcoming customers to our new store. 'The turn-out was fantastic and it was great to see so many people walking away with great prizes.' The star prize - the Dyson vacuum cleaner - was won by Richard Scott, from Billesley, in Birmingham. An Aldi spokesman told MailOnline: 'We do this at the majority of new Aldi stores that open. 'It's a really nice way to introduce people in the area to Aldi and to get them round to the store. 'It helps create a bit of attention and a buzz on the first day.' Aldi posted a profit of £260.9million in 2013, up from £157.9million in 2012 and is closing the gap on the 'big four' supermarkets of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrison - it has the biggest rise in sales in 2014 . The enthusiasm from the crowds highlights the rapid success Aldi and other budget chains have enjoyed in Britain. The budget stores are proving an increasing threat to Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrison's as more shoppers discover the low-cost groceries and cut-price luxuries that they offer. Recently, it was revealed that half of British consumers had admitted to visiting a discount store last month. Aldi, which is nipping at the heels of Waitrose to become Britain’s sixth largest supermarket, posted a 65.2 per cent rise in profit last year. It posted a profit of £260.9million in 2013, up from £157.9million in 2012, as it stepped up its assault on the country's so called 'big four' supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons. Examples of Aldi's efficiencies include shelf ready packaging, which allows products to be displayed in-store in the packaging used during delivery, and packing areas that reduce queuing at checkouts. Aldi also now commands a 25 per cent share of the premium dry aged steak market and it sells 700 bottles of wine every hour. Aldi - whose managing directors Roman Heini (left) and Matthew Barnes (right) are pictured - has grown in popularity among shoppers turning to budget chains . During 2013 Aldi opened 42 new stores. It said it is on course to open 54 in 2014, with 60-65 planned for next year, taking the total to over 600. Aldi sees scope for 1,000 by 2022. The firm said it is investing more than £600million over the next two years to support its growth. It also received a boost last month when rivals' Tesco saw sales fall at their fastest rate for 20 years and their share value plummet  after claims executives had artificially boosted profits by £250million. Tesco has suspended four executives and begun an internal investigation. Aldi's history began in a small grocer's shop in the mining town of Essen in Germany opened in 1914 by Anna Albrecht, . By 1948, her sons Karl and Theo had taken it to four other locations in the country, and in 1954, the first self-service shop was opened. The brothers had a falling out in 1960 over whether or not to sell cigarettes in stores, and the brand was split into Aldi Nord and Aldi Sud. In 1971, Theo Albrecht was kidnapped for 17 days and held to a ransom of $3million. The Albrecht family has remained notoriously private since. Karl Albrecht is now in his nineties and was listed Germany's richest man by Forbes last year. The brand's name is a combination of the family's and the word discount. After branches were opened in America, the first store in Britain welcomed shoppers in 1990. It now has more than 500 across the world.","About 250 people queued up outside a new Aldi store in Birmingham .

"She was the daughter of a Suffolk rector but the young Flora Sandes used to dream of being a soldier, spending her childhood galloping through the countryside while pretending she was fighting in battle. Twenty years later, when war broke out for real across Europe, the adult Flora enlisted for the army in Serbia, one of the allied countries, and in the process, became the only British woman to see front line action. Now Flora's amazing story is to be told in a BBC radio documentary on BBC Radio Suffolk tonight as part of its WWI at Home series. A postcard showing Sergeant-Major Flora Sandes, the only woman to fight on the frontline in WWI . She lived an extraordinary life, even by today's standards; battling against the odds to achieve her dream of fighting as an equal alongside men. And it wasn't just the art of 'soldiering on' in which she saw herself as an equal to her male companions: Drinking, smoking, racing cars and shooting - all still very much masculine pursuits were considered fair game to Flora. Surprisingly her background would not have suggested such maverick spirit. Born in 1876 in North Yorkshire, Flora was the youngest of eight children. The family, headed by her rector father Samuel Sandes, moved to Suffolk when she was nine years old. She had a typically middle-class childhood that included a governess and stint at finishing school, but rather than dreaming of steady life with a husband and children, Flora always yearned for adventure. According to Louise Millar, Flora's biographer: 'Women in those days were supposed to lead lives of demure respectablity which included tea parties and playing tennis. It could be very dull, particularly for someone like Flora who was a tomboy.' Flora loved being in the army, saying 'I never loved anything so much in my entire life.' This photograph was taken in Montenegro in 1919 . After training as a stenographer in . London, Flora used her wages and a legacy from a rich uncle and headed off . to explore the world. She . worked as a secretary in Cairo, camped in British Columbia in Canada and, even, while working her way across America, shot a man in self-defence. Flora . was 38 years old when Britain declared war on Germany in 1914, living in London . with her 15-year-old nephew Dick and her elderly father. She signed up to be a volunteer with the ambulance service and within eight days was on her way to Serbia with the first volunteer unit to leave Britain. At first, she worked with the Red Cross but soon enlisted in the Serbian army - one of the few in the world to accept women. She soon moved up the ranks, becoming corporal and then sergeant-major, and didn't shy away from the action. While engaged in hand-to-hand fighting, Flora was wounded by a grenade while helping to defend her position. She was rescued by a lieutenant in her company who risked his life to crawl out under fire to drag her back to safety. One of the guys: Sergeant-Major Flora Sandes inspecting her troops . For her exceptional bravery under fire, she was awarded a medal and made headlines around the world, but it had come at a price - shrapnel had shredded the flesh of her back and the right side of her body from shoulder to knee. Her right arm had been broken and badly lacerated. Once recovered, she rejoined the men in the frontline trenches, fought alongside them as they regained the country they had lost nearly three years before, and survived Spanish influenza. Says Millar: 'They called her a 'brother', as as an honorary man. She . was a good soldier, starting the war as a private and had made sergeant-major by . end of war.' She adds: 'Serbia was the only country that allowed women to do anything . they wanted During the war they had more freedom than anywhere else partly because the Serbians didn't know what to make of these women and their need was so desperate.' When the war ended she remained in the army, saying: 'I never loved anything so much in my life.' But in 1922 when she was demobilised, Flora found it hard to readjust. ‘I felt neither fish nor flesh when I came out of the army,’ she said. ‘The first time I put on women’s clothes, I slunk through the streets.’ She drifted between England and Serbia for several years but then found love in the shape of Yuri Yudenitch, a handsome, educated 'White Russian officer', 12 years her junior, who had served as one of her sergeants. The Serbian army was one of the few to accept women and Flora felt at home with the other soldiers . They married in 1927. Two years later, they moved to the new kingdom of Yugoslavia and there they stayed. But with tensions once more brewing, neither were to enjoy a peaceful life. The Nazis invaded in April 1941 and four days later, aged 65, Flora pulled on her uniform and marched off to fight. Within days, though, her old war wound put an end to her plans. It took only 11 days for the Germans to defeat the Yugoslav army and occupy the country. Flora was imprisioned by the Gestapo - the German political police - and was freed after a week, but had to report to a Gestapo officer every week. Sadly her beloved husband died of heart failure in 1941. After the war Flora was left alone and penniless. However undeterred she moved to stay with her nephew first in Jerusalem and then Rhodesia - now Zimbabwe - where at the age of 70 she raised local hackles by drinking and smoking with the black peasant population. Always a maverick: even before WWI Flora was raising eyebrows with her unconventional behaviour . The young soldier: the 15-year-old Flora looked demure but was a tomboy at heart . She finally returned to Suffolk and took to using an electric wheelchair to travel between the local villages. She would set off, white hair streaming behind her, as she pushed it to its full speed. Increasingly nostalgic for the war, she lived for the annual gathering of the Salonika Reunion Association, for whom she was a heroine. After a brief illness, she died at Ipswich and East Suffolk Hospital on 24 November 1956 of ‘obstructive jaundice’, aged 80. She had renewed her passport shortly before she died, still dreaming of places to see and trips to take. According to her biographer Louise Millar, Flora was even more modern than women are . today in a sense. 'She let nothing hold her back. She did what she wanted . to do and she . was proof that women could do whatever they wanted. 'I think she helped . shift the perception of what women could do. She was a heroine. She really pushed the boundaries.' A documentary on Flora Sandes will be aired on BBC Radio Suffolk today as part of the BBC’s World War One At Home series.","Flora Sandes grew up in Suffolk but enlisted in the Serbian army .

"Row: Veteran John Shiel is fighting the council over this strip of land, and says has been told by a council officer to remember it is not the Falklands . A 18-year battle over a tiny strip of land turned dirty today after a war veteran claimed a council officer told him to remember their wrangle is not the Falklands War. John Shiel of Budleigh Salterton says East Devon District Council has wasted huge sums fighting him over a site measuring two metres long and a maximum of 40cm - or 15 inches - wide. The local authority has now apologised to Mr Shiel, a former sergeant with 42 Commando Royal Marines, saying their employee did not know he fought in the Falklands. Their row started when he enclosed a 10 square metre strip of land next to his property in 1996 having been told by the Land Registry they had no record of ownership. He was also advised by East Devon District Council (EDDC) that it did not own the land. But in 2012 EDDC objected to his ownership claim after a member of the public raised the matter. The Land Registry then decided the matter should go to a tribunal. That was held last year with the council hiring a barrister, because they claim he used it to widen his plot to make room for his car - and should pay market value for it. Despite that the judge ruled Mr Shiel was entitled to the land he had claimed, last month when Mr Shiel and his wife were away on holiday council contractors erected a fence around a metre inside the boundary Mr Shiel said was set by the tribunal. He claims that when he rang the council about the matter was told the dispute wasn't the Falklands War. Mr Shiel, a former Budleigh Salterton Mayor said: 'It's totally inappropriate to make such a comment. 'I think the council knows my background and that I fought in the Falklands War and made the comment because of that. 'I cannot believe the council has gone to such lengths over this. The land is useless to them . Battle: Mr Shiel took the land near his house because nobody owned it, but then the council claimed it 12 years later, sparking a legal battle . Hero: Mr Shields was in the marines (pictured) when Britain fought Argentina in the 1982 battle for the Falklands . 'I don't know how much they've spent on it all so far but barristers and surveyors cost - it must be thousands. 'I was awarded costs against the council after the tribunal but I never claimed it because it's public money. Mr Shiel has now erected a Falklands memorial with poppies to denote where he says the boundary should be. He feels the council has put the fence in the wrong place because it is relying on inaccurate Land Registry maps, which are not to be used for precise measurements on the ground. New twist: Last month he went on holiday with his wife and arrived back to find a fence had been put in by the council . An EDDC spokesman said: 'The land is indeed just a small strip but it's of real value to Mr Shiel because he wants to park a vehicle there as his own plot is not quite wide enough. 'We are legally bound to get the best value for any area of public land - however small. 'We'd be happy to discuss a fair price for the land but any sale would be subject to public consultation. 'Talking with Mr Shiel, a council employee gave the Falkland Islands as an example of a land dispute to illustrate the point that there is a matter of principle at stake here. 'The employee was not aware Mr Shiel had served in the Falklands. 'No offence was intended and we are sorry if any was taken. 'The council continues to rely on the findings of the adjudicator at the earlier tribunal and will only surrender ownership of the land if an arrangement can be found that is fair to all parties.'","John Shiel in battle over land measuring two metres long by 40cms wide .

"Boston Marathon bombings suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev knew his older brother and alleged accomplice Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed three drug dealers in 2011, prosecutors claim. The revelation made by Dzhokar's defense team was made in a bid to access federal files with crucial information on the 2013 attack at Boston Marathon, which killed three and injured 260. Tamerlan, who was killed three days after the bomb attack, has long been linked to the triple homicide more than a year before but the case remains unsolved. Revelation? Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (left) knew his 'bullying' older brother Tamerlan (right) killed three drug dealers in 2011, his defense team will claim. The case has never been solved but Tamerlan, now dead, was linked to it . Now, a witness has agreed to testify that Tamerlan was involved - and his younger brother knew about it, according to Yahoo. The shocking revelation, if true, will come as a blow to the Boston Police Department, who failed to catch the culprit before the devastating bombing. It will doubtless support the defense team's portrayal of Tamerlan as a bullying older brother who pressurized Dzhokhar into committing the act. Tamerlan was killed during a confrontation with police three days after the bombings when his brother ran over him with a car. He was close to one of the homicide victims and his friends reported him to police as 'suspicious' after he failed to attend the memorial service. A jury for the case was sworn in last week. Robel Phillipos is charged with making false statements when questioned about his movements on April 18, 2013, three days after the bombing and hours after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his brother as suspects. Prosecutors say Phillipos lied about being in Tsarnaev's dorm room while two other friends removed Tsarnaev's laptop and backpack, which contained fireworks that had been emptied of their explosive powder. Call for answers: The shocking revelation, if true, will come as a blow to the Boston Police Department, who failed to catch the culprit before the devastating bombing in 2013 which killed three and injured 260 people . U.S. prosecutors said in their opening statements that Phillipos had repeatedly lied to FBI interviewers about his actions that day. His attorney, Derege Demissie, contended that his client had no memory of his actions that day. 'There will be ample evidence, much of it is undisputed, that Robel spent he entire day of April 18 smoking marijuana, highly intoxicated, with several friends,' Demissie said. 'His memory is jumbled, confused and completely discombobulated.' Demissie said that Phillipos used a vaporizer for two hours and also smoked in a car with the windows rolled up - a practice known as 'fish bowling' or 'hot boxing.' Authorities also revealed that Phillipos' friend, Azamat Tazhayakov, will testify against him in court. Tazhayakov was convicted of tossing the backpack. Assistant U.S. Attorney John Capin painted a contrasting picture, arguing that Phillipos lied after the FBI released photos of Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a request for the public's help in identifying them. 'What did these three men do when they recognized their friend as a suspect in the Boston Marathon bombing investigation? They went to his dorm room,' Capin said. It comes just days before both sides of the case present a list of their witnesses.","Tamerlan Tsarnaev has long been linked to the killings but case never solved .

"A pit bull in Los Angeles was recovering Monday after being viciously slashed with a knife nearly ear-to-ear by a man who simply despised his breed. Spartacus didn't even put up a fight as his attacker, who authorities believe may have been his family's neighbor, stabbed his head and body before bashing him with a shovel.

"A British hostage killed at a BP glass plant in Algeria by terrorists linked to Al-Qaeda sent his wife a final text saying: 'You are the most amazing wife ever', an inquest has heard. Sebastian John, 26, from the East Midlands, was among six British men and a UK-based Colombian killed by jihadi insurgents from the Sahara during a four-day standoff at the In Amenas complex last year. A total of 40 hostages were killed when the al-Qaeda linked terrorist Mokhtar Belmokhtar stormed the facility in January 2013. Sebastian John, 26, pictured with his wife Nicola and their seven-month old son, was among six British men killed by jihadi insurgents during a four-day siege at the In Amenas gas complex in Algeria in January 2013 . The other British victims were Carson Bilsland and Kenneth Whiteside, both from Scotland; Stephen Green, from Hampshire; Paul Morgan and Garry Barlow, both from Liverpool, and Colombian Carlos Estrada. During evidence today at the inquest, Nicola John described how her late husband phoned her on 16 January to say he had been taken hostage by Al-Qaeda. The inquest heard how he later text her asking her to look after their 'tiny man', before sending a brave email - the last contact he had with his wife - trying to reveal the identities of the terrorists. Mrs John told the court: 'He told me he had called the British Embassy to get the helicopters of the Algerian army to get back. He told me either they would kill the hostages or blow the plant up.' During the phone call, he urged his wife to relate instructions to 'get the army back', fearing an attack would create mayhem. She told the inquest: 'I told Seb that I loved him and he told me that he did too. I said I would do as he asked and I believe he just hung up. This was the last time I spoke to Seb.' She later received agonising text messages, one reading, 'I love you so much, never forget that xx'. Eight minutes later, Mr John wrote another message saying: 'Talk to my mum please. Look after our tiny man. You are the most amazing wife ever xx'. The civil engineer, whose UK home was in Nottingham when he died, had already been singled out by assistant coroner for West Sussex, judge Nicholas Hilliard QC, for attempting to send the covert emails. The court heard that, during the attack, hostages were 'encouraged' to make contact with the outside world, relaying the terrorists' demand that 100 Jihadi prisoners be released in northern Mali. Senior investigating officer Detective Superintendent James Stokley told how Mr John had sent emails with pictures of the terrorists while he was held hostage. Judge Hilliard said it was 'an extremely brave thing to do at considerable risk to himself'. BP executive Carlos Estrada was among hostages who were killed at the In Amenas plant during a four-day stand-off. His wife said he text her saying 'The worst is over' before he was killed . Paul Morgan (left) and Garry Barlow (right), both from Liverpool, were also killed in the four-day siege . In her evidence, Mrs John also told the inquest her husband had been informed by e-mail that he would be going to work in Algeria but was unaware of any terrorist threat. She said his only worry was being away from his young family, the hot weather and a possible driver's strike. But she said her husband would 'often break down in tears at the prospect of going' because he did not want to leave his wife and baby son. She said: 'If he had been able to identify an objective reason, he would not have gone.' Once in the Maghreb, Mr John 'did not really like it and wanted to come home'. Mrs John added: 'He thought if there were any concerns at all then BP would get him out of there'. Today, Claudia Gaviria, the wife of another victim, Carlos Estrada, told the inquest how her husband had been pressurised into travelling to In Amenas by other executives. Mr Estrada had worked for BP for 18 years and had risen to the post of Vice President for North Africa when he was taken captive and killed, the inquest heard. She said: 'I strongly believe that had Carlos known of the risks posed, he would not have elected to travel to Algeria and would have travelled to his meeting in Egypt, as was originally planned.' At the start of the crisis, Ms Gaviria began to receive worrying text messages from her husband, the inquest heard. The first read: 'Love, there was an attack on the camp with lots of shooting. It is okay, it is fine, I love you'. Mr Estrada asked his wife not tell their daughter about the situation 'so she is relaxed for the exam'. He later wrote: 'I am okay my darling. The worst is over and the situation is returning to normal', the inquest heard. Kenneth Whiteside, from Scotland, was another of the British men inside the gas facility when terrorists took workers hostage . But, tragically, at around 9pm that night, Mr Estrada left a voicemail on his wife's landline telling her he loved her - the last contact she had with her husband. She told the inquest: 'He did not saying anything about the situation in Algeria. I think he was crying.' Carson Bilsland died from injuries caused by an explosion, the inquest heard . David Green, the father of another victim Stephen, also told the court how he was reassured all British casualties had been taken to a hospital to await repatriation. But the court heard Stephen's body was not identified for days and was left with the dead terrorists. Mr Green added that a family liaison officer informed him the British Ambassador was on the site, co-ordinating the operation. He said: 'I did not want my son Stephen to be lying out in the desert. 'The Algerians mistook him for a terrorist and he was not identified for another ten days after that which caused further distress, but that is my knowledge of what the British Ambassador did in In Amenas. 'I believed wrongly - as it turned out - that he would be protected by BP and the Algerian government.' The court also heard the account of survivor Nick Hitch, the highly experienced project manager at the In Amenas Compression Project. He said in a written statement of his belief the hostage crisis was 'an inside job', saying one spoke with an English accent and the other with a North American. The oil worker added the In Amenas plant had two forms of emergency siren - an intermittent siren for fire and a constant siren for a security breach. On the morning of the crisis, the intermittent siren began to blare, leading Mr Hitch to believe it was 'a fire drill'. Almost 800 people were at the desert complex in eastern Algeria, pictured, when heavily armed militants entered at dawn on January 16 last year . The gas facility is a joint venture run by Statoil, the British company BP and the Algerian state energy firm Sonatrach . But, after hiding out with fellow workers, the extremists finally located Mr Hitch and his two colleagues. The group were lead to a courtyard and held together with their fellow ex-pats. He recounted how the Islamists brought two barrels of 'TNT' into the courtyard, along with land-mines and a long fuse cord. The terrorists then proceeded to attach the hostages to the explosive cache by the neck. 'They rigged us up with the cord around our necks and attached us to the explosives', he said. Mr Hitch became convinced the attackers had deliberately targeted VIPs - senior employees - like himself. He said the killers 'clearly had had help from people inside the facility'. He said: 'Most [of the Algerian workers] appeared wary of the terrorists. However, there was a distinct group of about twenty or thirty terrorists who were separate from the rest.' This group was 'laughing with them [the terrorists] and engaging in conversation with them', he told the court. 'I formed the view there was effectively an al-Qaeda cell in the camp. They showed a lot of inside knowledge in the way they took out the facilities'. Almost 800 people were at the desert complex when heavily armed militants entered at dawn on January 16 last year. The coroner previously heard the terrorists were allowed to travel 30 miles across the Sahara desert from the Malian border with Algeria, to the facility, unchecked. The six-week inquest into the deaths of the British men is being held at the Royal Courts of Justice, pictured . The court heard that the complex had been stormed by some 34 Islamists armed with AK47-type machine guns, telescopic rifles and explosives and dressed in military fatigues. Gunmen attacked two buses carrying foreign gas workers at the plant before taking hostages at the plant's living quarters. The first British victim to be killed was Mr Morgan, a 46-year-old security contractor, who was said to have died during the initial attack  as the terrorists. Many of the victims were last seen alive being placed in terrorist vehicles on the second day of the stand-off, the inquest heard. The inquest heard how on January 17 hostages were grouped together according to nationality and told they were going to be moved as the terrorists anticipated an attack from the Algerian military. Post-mortem examinations carried out in the UK found that Mr Barlow, Mr Whiteside and Mr Bilsland had all died from injuries caused by an explosion. Mr John died from a blunt injury to the head, Mr Morgan was killed by a gunshot wound to the head and Mr Green died from a gunshot wound to the chest. Mr Estrada,  who lived in Chelsea, west London, died from injuries caused by an explosion and multiple gun shot wounds, the court heard. The gas facility, in eastern Algeria, is a joint venture run by Statoil, the British company BP and the Algerian state energy firm Sonatrach.","Father-of-one Sebastian John among six Britons killed by jihadi insurgents .

"This is the moment a woman passenger was dragged along an Underground platform after her scarf was caught in the doors of a departing Tube train. She was pulled about 10 metres before a staff member managed to grab her and she fell to the ground. This resulted in the scarf being forcibly removed from her neck and carried into the tunnel by the train. The potentially fatal incident, which occurred in February, has been described in a rail accident report published today. The train driver was unaware that the woollen knitted scarf the passenger was wearing around her neck was trapped and started to move the Piccadilly line train at Holborn station in central London. This is the moment a woman passenger was dragged along an Underground platform after her scarf was caught in the doors of a departing Piccadilly line Tube train at Holborn station . The female passenger suffered injuries to her back and neck as a result of the accident . The woman, who had been attempting to board the train, was dragged about 10 metres along the platform. A staff member tried to help by catching hold of her and she fell to the ground during the incident this February . The woman was unable to pull the scarf free as the train began to move and the member of staff on duty did not alert the driver to the situation, the report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) said. The passenger, who had been attempting to board the train, was then dragged along the platform. The RAIB report said: 'The passenger suffered injuries to her neck and back, but the actions of the member of staff may have saved her from being more badly hurt.' The accident report said the driver had been unable to see what was happening on the platform after the train had begun to move. It added that the role of the station assistant who came to the passenger's aid involved the safe despatch of trains - but that the equipment and procedures associated with the role do not enable such assistants to intervene effectively in an emergency. The accident report said the driver had been unable to see what was happening on the platform after the train had begun to move . The incident occurred at about 7pm on February 3 this year. Nigel Holness, operations director for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, said: 'The safety of customers and staff is our top priority and we do all we can to ensure customers can travel safely at all times. 'The quick thinking of our staff during this incident prevented further injury to the customer, and all of our safety procedures and warnings were carried out as normal before the train moved away from the platform. 'Thankfully, incidents of this nature are extremely rare on our network and the Tube is one of the safest railways in the world following heavy investment in safety improvements, and we are constantly seeking to further improve our excellent safety record. 'We have fully assisted the RAIB in their investigation, as well as carrying out our own, and we will fully consider their recommendation.' The RAIB said that the last fatal accident of this type on the Underground system, on October 21, 1997, had occurred at the same location in similar circumstances and involved the same type of train. In the 1997 incident, a nine-year-old boy caught his anorak in a closing Tube train door and was dragged along the platform and under the train. However, the report into this year's incident said: 'There do not appear to be any factors associated with the location that could create any link between the 1997 and 2014 accidents.' On the 2014 incident, the RAIB made a recommendation to London Underground 'covering possible improvements to the means available to staff to stop trains from departing if an emergency occurs during the train despatch process'. Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said: 'The fact that the RAIB have praised the member of staff is just another in a long line of concrete examples that reinforce our case for the retention and expansion of staffing levels on the platforms and stations across London Underground.' Another RAIB report just published said that during the start of the evening rush-hour, concrete cladding fell from a bridge spanning Denmark Hill station in south London, with most of the debris landing on the station's platform 1. The fallen concrete was reported by two train drivers and train services were stopped on the line closest to the debris. No one was struck and there was no damage to trains in the incident on August 1, 2013, but train services were disrupted for the rest of the day while emergency repairs were carried out. The report said the concrete cladding was added to the bridge structure in about 1910 and fell because of gradual deterioration of the fixing arrangements. It said: 'Deterioration of the cladding fixing arrangements had been reported to Network Rail (NR) over a period of at least four years but the resulting actions taken by NR and its works contractor were inadequate.'","Woman attempted to board Piccadilly line train at Holborn station .

"With energy prices rising, one in eight Australians are struggling to pay their electricity bill, a new survey has found. The Ernst & Young research found nearly one in three households across Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland have missed a payment in the past 12 months. While more than one in 10 have missed more than three bill payments over the last year. The proportion of consumers who were often worried about being able to pay their electricity bill has remained ‘consistently high’ at 70 per cent since last year's survey, according to the report. Scroll down for video . Ernst & Young survey (pictured) found that electricity prices are the most significant cause of financial stress for Australian consumers and one in eight are struggling to pay their electricity bill . Over the last 12 months, 22 per cent of Australians paid their electricity bill late, 32 per cent forgot to pay, seven per cent had a disputed bill, while five per cent said they didn't receive their bill. The survey found 60 per cent of Australians who were unable to afford bill payment was the ‘single biggest reason for not paying on time’ and one in 10 said energy bills are their top ‘stressor’. Ernst & Young Oceania Customer Leader Jenny Young told Daily Mail Australia that electricity prices are the most significant cause of financial stress for Australian consumers. ‘Australians are very worried about financial stress in general but electricity bills are one of the key financial stressors,’ she said. One in 10 said energy bills are their top ‘stressor’, according to report . Nearly one in three households across Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland have missed a payment in the past 12 months . ‘Interestingly, we did the same research a year ago and found 73 per cent of households were worried about their electricity bill. ‘The figures dropped down to 70 per cent this year, which doesn’t seem to reduce the point of stress but it has improved slightly. Ms Young said there is an opportunity for retailers to retain and attract market share by better meeting the needs of customers in monitoring and controlling energy use and by managing 'bill shock'. The report found one in 10 Australians have, or would consider switching to solar energy . 'This research shows customers are looking for simplicity, transparency and the ability to manage their energy use and method of payments. ‘This is a significant opportunity for electricity retailers to improve their customer service and help consumers manage and monitor their usage and bills to be able to pay for electricity. Ms Young said the survey results provide an insight into strategies retailers can use to assist customers with on-time bill payments. ‘Australians should look at different alternatives because there are quarterly and monthly options and some providers let you choose the months you get paid so you can afford to pay them smoothly.’ One in eight Australians are struggling to pay their electricity bill . The report also found 90 per cent of Australians have, or would consider switching to solar energy. ‘It was interesting to find nine out of 10 Australians were considering solar because it’s worth looking at that alternative,’ Ms Young said. ‘The interest in solar is one of the options to save money and that was by far  the most dominant reason to switch to solar. ‘Not everybody does switch to solar because of the cost of installation but there is significant interest around solar and there are also other options to look at saving.'","One in eight Australians are struggling to pay their electricity bill .

"What is the special quality that makes a house a home? Often, that elusive 'something' has its origins in our memories. This month, a survey of 2,000 new homeowners found more than half felt dissatisfied. But while few first-timers can afford the house of their dreams, the discontent seemed to be caused as much by emotional factors as by more practical considerations. A common complaint was that their new property didn't 'feel like home', while a quarter admitted they still refer to their parents' house as 'home'. Charlotte and son Jake at Hancox which was built in the 1480s and is a Wealden hall house . It was clear that many felt the absence of something intangible - the comforting atmosphere of the place in which they spent their childhood. But what is it really like to return, as an adult, to the house where you grew up? I'm writing this article in a room that was built before Columbus reached America. It's a gusty autumn day; the wind mews in the chimney, the logs shift and sigh in the grate. For centuries, other people have heard these same sounds in this same room. And everything - from the scent of woodsmoke, to the nubbly texture of my great-grandmother's woven curtains, to the deep caramel colour of the never‑since redecorated walls - is familiar to me from my earliest childhood. I live, you see, in the family house in rural Sussex where I grew up. Charlotte says she loves the thought that for centuries, other people have heard the same sounds in the same rooms that she lives in with her family . In my 20s I lived in London, but when my eldest son, George, now 24, was a baby, I moved back, and I've been here ever since. Of my life so far, only about one-fifth has been spent elsewhere, a percentage that shrinks with every passing year. I've been shaped by this house, Hancox, to an unusual degree. And I consider myself lucky. I feel connected not only to my own past, but to the past of those who've lived here before me - and as the house is more than 500 years old, that’s a lot of (benign) ghosts. Charlotte says she loves the way the house feels at one with the landscape. Only about one-fifth of her life has been spent elsewhere. I feel pleasantly rooted in an area I know well. This continuity, I believe, also provides a sense of security for my three sons. Two of them have autism, so for them, the stability that comes from familiarity is doubly important. Others might feel stuck, or confined, by this arrangement, but I don't. The interplay between the history of the house and our present lives never ceases to fascinate me. I even wrote a book about it. Hancox, built in the 1480s, is a Wealden hall house - a type of old timber-framed structure often found in the South-East. The passing generations have added or subtracted bits here and there, but in essence, it is still the same unplanned mound of brick and timber it always was. It's entirely constructed of materials from within a five-mile radius: oak beams, clay tiles, locally forged ironwork, plaster mixed with the chopped red‑brown hair of Sussex cattle. You can see this hair in the many places where childish exuberance has punched holes in the softly bulging walls. I love the way the house feels at one with the landscape, a russet-coloured mound rising up amidst the tussocky pattern of small hills, small woods, small fields. Outside, the garden - defined by crumbling walls - merges with the farmyard. A barn, a dairy, a brewhouse and stables stand in dilapidated testimony to the semi-self-sufficiency of the lives of our forebears. The house came into my family in 1888. If you don't move house, there's less incentive to clear things out, and, besides, I come from a proud race of clutterers. If my great-grandparents came back from the dead, they'd find that remarkably little had changed. True, we do have electric light, we don't draw our water from the 70ft brick-built well outside the kitchen door and the coach-house shelters lawnmowers and power tools instead of pony-traps. Charlotte knows the area well and says it provides a sense of security for her three sons, two of whom have autism . Hancox pictured in 1909. The house came to Charlotte's family in 1888 and most of its features still remain the same . But inside and out, they'd recognise a great deal. Furniture, window frames, latches, door handles, kitchen utensils, even some of the carpets and curtains have remained. Lifestyle features and TV programmes show us perfectly decorated living rooms, immaculately functional bathrooms, streamlined kitchens. But all these tempting images appeal to one sense only - sight. And a home isn't just something to be looked at. Sounds, smells and textures cannot be experienced on a screen or between the pages of a magazine, however glossy. Our early experience of home is conveyed to us through all our senses; on an unconscious level, this never leaves us. View from the kitchen garden wall of the house . Outside, I can hear the swish of 21st-century traffic. Inside, the washing machine is shrieking at me to tell me it's finished its load. But the sheep bleating in the barn, the squeaking of the pine trees as they rub their branches together in the wind, form a timeless aural tapestry - rarely consciously noticed - linking my present to my past, and to the lives of so many before me. I am aware that I live in a highly unusual house. Would I feel so strongly if I had grown up somewhere less special? Perhaps. Simon, my partner, moved into a newly built bungalow in a village near Swindon when he was a toddler. Seven Sandy Lane was 'utterly ordinary', he says. But, nonetheless, its particular atmosphere defined his Sixties childhood. After little more than half a century, his memories feel 'historical': 'There was one bunker for coal, for the sitting room fire and another for coke for the kitchen boiler.' There was no central heating. The bedroom he shared with his brother had been intended as a garage, so was built with only a single layer of bricks and faced north-east; curtains glued to the window by frost were the norm for several months of the year. Today, almost every aspect of Seven Sandy Lane has changed. The brick is covered with pink render, the small front lawn and rosebed have been paved over for parking and a loft extension means it isn't really even a bungalow any more. Nothing is left of the whiff of Austerity Britain that permeated Simon's childhood. That's not particularly to be regretted, but the point is that those early experiences - the Formica, the coke, the gravel path, the cork bath mat - still exist in his mind as highly potent memories. 'I even have this slight fondness for Swindon,' he says, 'but I realise it's not particularly rational.' Charlotte at the house with her mum and older brother . Emotion and rationality - surely this is where our ideas about 'home', as opposed to choices about 'property', clash? Unfortunately, modern economics oblige most people to conflate the two. The first home bought by a young couple will almost never be the last. It probably won't even be where they bring up their children. For the majority, the dwelling place is by far their most valuable asset. We are encouraged to increase its value by adding bathrooms, conservatories and the like. It's not fashionable to leave things as they are. When the time is ripe, the place is put back on the market; the modern way is to move house every few years. But while that may all make sound financial sense, is it really compatible with the idea of home? The dissatisfaction of those first-timers in the survey is unsurprising. 'Home' is something that grows over time. There's no instant fix, whatever the magazines tell us. It's about those early years, when all the imprinting is done. But I've some comfort for the young parents still secretly pining after their own childhood homes: they are, simultaneously, creating a similar, equally precious, set of memories for their own children. My son George expresses - with autistic directness - the sentiments that many of us feel. Every day he tells us: 'I want to stay here, in the kitchen at Hancox, all days, all weeks.' That makes perfect sense to me. Hancox: A House And A Family, by Charlotte Moore, is published by Penguin.","Charlotte loves that for centuries her house has remained unchanged .

"Lionel Messi equalled Raul's Champions League record by reaching 71 goals in 90 games as Barcelona beat Ajax to reach the last 16. Playing against his old club, Luis Suarez is without a goal in his first three games for Barcelona but Messi's double at least meant the former Liverpool striker got his first win for his new club. Messi scored from Pedro's cross on 76 minutes to reach Raul's landmark and book Barca's place in the knockout stages.

Messi is congratulated by Jordi Alba, Suarez and Neymar after moving within one goal of Raul's Champions League record . Ajax: Cillessen, Van Rhijn, Veltman, Moisander, Boilesen, Klaassen, Serero (Denswil 80), Andersen (Riedewald 72), El Ghazi, Sigthorsson (Milik 62), Schone. Subs Not Used: Boer, Kishna, Viergever, Zimling. Sent Off: Veltman (71). Booked: El Ghazi, Veltman, Moisander. Barcelona: Ter Stegen, Dani Alves (Adriano 83), Bartra, Mascherano, Jordi Alba, Rakitic (Rafinha 80), Busquets, Xavi, Suarez, Messi, Neymar (Pedro 74). Subs Not Used: Bravo, Pique, Douglas, Munir. Booked: Mascherano, Jordi Alba, Dani Alves. Goals: Messi 36, 76. Att: 52, 116 . Ref: Pedro Proenca (Portugal). Suarez's best opportunity to open his account came on the hour when Messi played him through. He had promised not to celebrate if he scored against his former club and the promise was not tested as Jasper Cillessen came out to save his shot. Gerard Pique was once again out in the cold this time not in the stands but on the bench as Luis Enrique paired Marc Bartra with Javier Mascherano. Xavi took his place in midfield to draw level with Iker Casillas on a record 144 Champions League games, but all eyes were on Suarez. The man who scored over 100 goals for Ajax in little more than 150 games, captained them to success in the Dutch Cup final in his final full season and played enough games in his last campaign – before moving to Liverpool in January 2011 – to earn a league winners medal has always enjoyed the unstinting support of the club's supporters even during what was a troubled last season at the club marred by a ban for biting Otman Bakkal. They cheered his name as the Barcelona team was read out and just hoped he would net score his first Barcelona goal against them. Barcelona's former player Marc Overmars, who is now Sporting Director at Ajax, described the Barcelona front three that Suarez now makes up with Messi and Neymar as 'a dream' before the game but this was the first time the fantastic three had finished the game with three points; albeit after a difficult first half. Neymar had the ball in the net on four minutes but his goal was ruled out for offside and it was the last we saw of Barcelona's attack for a while as Ajax domintated. Lucas Anderson picked up on a poor clearance from Dani Alves and shaved a post with his shot and Marc-Andre ter Stegen then had to turn Davy Klassen's shot away for a corner as Ajax had their first chances. Stegen's save and some timely interceptions from Jordi Alba and Mascherano were all that was keeping Ajax at bay. Suarez forced a corner to give Barcelona some much-needed respite but Ajax were laying siege to Barca's goal. Alba handled in the box and was lucky to escape without conceding a penalty. At the other end he forced a save from Cillessen but Ajax remained on top. The night gets worse for Frank de Boer's men when Joel Veltman is sent off for picking up two bookings .

They were furious when El Ghazi stayed down injured in the Barcelona area and the visitors played on and forced a free-kick at the other end. Messi took the kick and Cillessen saved brilliantly but seconds later he made the mistake that would cost Ajax the lead. He came for a 50-50 ball with Bartra, lost the race. The central defender crossed from the byline and Messi scored with a looping header. It was the most unusual of goals – a Messi header from a cross from a centre-half – but it calmed Barca's nerves in what had been a chaotic first half. And it was goal number 70 in 90 Champions League games that left him level with Cristiano Ronaldo and one short of Raul's record. Messi turned provider on the hour sliding a pass through for Suarez. It should have been his first goal for Barca. His first touch took him clear of the Ajax defence but Cillessen won the one-on-one and so there was no 'no-celebration' from the Uruguayan who had promised to respect his former supporters. Arkadiusz Milik headed against the post as Ajax pushed for the equalizer but they were reduced to ten men when Joel Veltman was sent off for a second bookable offence and as Barca poured forward wth the extra man Messi got his historic goal.

Suarez will hope he gets off the mark soon after another frustrating night in front of goal. There were at least signs in the second half when he played more centrally and Messi tucked in behind him that things are beginning to click. Enrique still has problems, with Alves below par at right-back and Pique an unused substitute. But he also has Messi. The Argentine had a quiet first half hour as Barca suffered but when he came alive he killed the game. And at just 27 years of age has leveled with Raul – the only difference being that it has taken him 90 games and not 142 as it did the Spaniard. 'Messi is the best player I have seen in my life' said Enrique after his double. He added: 'We were better in the second half. We always tried to win the ball back as far from our goal as possible and we were able to do that better after the break. 'It's important qualify with two games left.

"Roma needed two late goals from Adem Ljajic to deny plucky Sassuolo an historic victory in a Serie A match at the Stadio Olimpico. The Giallorossi rested talismanic captain Francesco Totti with Wednesday's crucial Champions League showdown with Manchester City in mind and the capital club missed his leadership as Sassuolo snaffled two early goals in the 2-2 draw. Simone Zaza scored both, first capitalising on Morgan de Sanctis' goalkeeping gaffe and then beating the Roma stopper from a close encounter only minutes later.

Daniele De Rossi's dismissal shortly after the break spelled doom for Roma but they rallied to cut the deficit through a Ljajic penalty 12 minutes from time. As the seconds ticked away, the Serbian rifled a last-gasp leveller before Sassuolo defender Sime Vrsaljko saw red to rub salt in the visitors' wounds.

"Miralem Pjanic's second-half double ensured Roma kept up the pressure on Serie A leaders Juventus after beating Inter Milan 4-2 in a thrilling encounter at the Stadio Olimpico on Sunday night. Pjanic proved to be the difference, with his superb display capped off with a stunning free-kick deep into injury-time as the hosts cut Juventus' lead at the top to just three points. Rudi Garcia's men got off to the perfect start when they took the lead on 21 minutes, with former Arsenal man Gervinho capitalising on woeful Inter defending to score the opener.

Inter Milan: Handanovic; Campagnaro, Ranocchia, Juan Jesus, Dodo; M'Vila, Medel, Kuzmanovic; Guarin; Palacio, Osvaldo. Goals: Ranocchia 36, Osvaldo 57 . Adem Ljajic was able to drift into the area with ease, before cutting the ball back for Gervinho, who had the simplest of tasks as he tapped home from close range. The visitors looked for an instant response and just four minutes later were unlucky not to draw level, with Morgan De Sanctis coming to Roma's rescue. A throw-in caught the hosts completely by surprise and Zdravko Kuzmanovic nearly took full advantage of the defensive lapse, with the midfielder's right-footed effort on goal clawed away by the veteran keeper for a corner. Up the other end Gervinho had the ball in the back of the net for the second time of the evening - in a near identical scenario to the first goal - but this time it was ruled out for offside.

The 27-year-old was again quickest to react in the box, tapping home from close range following another precise ball across goal, but Gervinho strayed into an offside position before the ball came in. Despite this Roma remained firmly in the ascendancy, so when Inter got themselves back on level terms on 33 minutes it was well against the run of play. Andrea Ranocchia rose highest from Kuzmanovic's corner from the left, planting his header into the bottom corner, giving De Sanctis no chance in the Roma goal as they went into the break frustrated on level terms after a dominant first-half display. It didn't take long for the hosts to regain their lead after the interval though courtesy of Jose Holebas.

The Greek left-back picked up the ball from Seydou Keita before going on a dazzling run, skipping past two defenders on his way into the penalty area, before firing an unstoppable shot past Samir Handanovic on 47 minutes. The visitors, though, didn't let the latest setback affect them, with a new-found belief there for all to see since Roberto Mancini has taken over as manager. Dani Osvaldo - on a season-long loan from Premier League high flyers Southampton - fired the ball home via a deflection off Rannochia to score his sixth goal of the season to make it 2-2 just before the half-hour mark.

Opposite number Rudi Garcia was equally frustrated 10 minutes later after he felt his side should have been awarded a penalty after goalscorer Pjanic went down under the challenge of Juan Jesus. Inter huffed and puffed in the closing stages but ultimately were unable to get themselves back into the game, with Pjanic capping off a man-of-the-match performance with his second goal of the night deep into stoppage time, with a beautifully lofted free-kick giving Handanovic no chance in the Inter goal.","Roma remain second in Serie A after beating Inter Milan 4-2 on Sunday .

"President Obama today presented 24 Medals of Honor to commemorate acts of bravery by servicemen - most of whom were previously overlooked because they were Hispanic, Jewish or African-American. 'Today we have the chance to set the record straight,' the president said at the rare ceremony at the White House on Tuesday. The 24 recipients span three wars - from World War II to Korea to Vietnam - and just three of the veterans are still alive. The two dozen servicemen were . identified following a congressionally mandated review to ensure that . recipients of the country's highest recognition for valor were not . bypassed due to prejudice. Scroll down for video . Celebrated: Obama applauds, from left, Sgt. 1st Class Melvin Morris, Master Sgt. Jose Rodela, and Sgt. Santiago J. Erevia. The trio are the only living veterans out of Tuesday's 24 recipients of the Medal of Honor . Obama said that a Medal of Honor ceremony 'is always a special occasion, ut today it is truly historic.' 'This ceremony reminds us of one of the enduring qualities that makes America great, that makes us exceptional,' he said. 'No nation is perfect. But here in America, we confront our imperfections and face a sometimes painful past, including the truth that some of these soldiers fought and died for a country that did not always see them as equal.' Eight of the men fought in the Vietnam War, nine in the Korean War and seven in World War II. The three living veterans all attended the ceremony on Tuesday, where they were greeted and applauded by President Obama. Celebrated: Master Sgt. Class Jose Rodela was among the men previously overlooked due to their race . Honor: Sgt. First Class Melvin Morris was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courage in South Vietnam in 1969 . Thanked: Sgt Santiago J. Erevia was cited for courage during a search and clear mission near Tam Ky, South Vietnam, on May 21, 1969. The recipients had been previously overlooked due to prejudice .

The Medal of Honor was presented posthumously to the families of the 21 soldiers who have died. Each of the soldiers had previously . received the Distinguished Service Cross, which is the nation's second . highest military award. But in 2002, Congress called for a . review of Jewish American and Hispanic American veteran war records from . World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, to ensure those . deserving the Medal of Honor had not been denied it because of prejudice . at the time. Emotional: Obama and Lenora Alvarado prepare to posthumously award Alvarado's father, Specialist Four Leonard Alvarado, the Medal of Honor at the ceremony . Saying thanks: The men were applauded during the ceremony in the East Room of the White House . During the . review, records of several soldiers who were neither Jewish nor Hispanic . were also found to have criteria worthy of the Medal of Honor, and . these men have also been honored. In . an interview last month, Morris, who is black, said it never occurred . to him that his race could have prevented him from receiving the top . accolade. When the Army contacted him last May and arranged for a call from Obama, he said he was astounded. 'I . fell to my knees. I was shocked,' Morris said. 'President Obama said he . was sorry this didn't happen before. He said this should have been done . 44 years ago.' The Medal of Honor is awarded for personal acts of valor above and beyond the call of duty.

"A man with a mission to spread happiness and start conversations amongst strangers managed to win over a carriage of travellers with his dance moves. Peter Sharp, from Perth in Western Australia, started a dance party on a busy train in an attempt to 'break the ice' and get the commuters talking. The footage from the even has been viewed more than 80,000 times since being uploaded onto Youtube on September 3. Scroll down for video . Peter Sharp told the commuters on a Perth train that he did not want money, but rather just to 'spread a little bit of happiness' He then played James Brown's hit I Got You and broke out into dance inside the train carriage . 'I don't want money, I just want to spread a little bit of happiness, so I'm going to do that today by starting a small dance party,' Mr Sharp told the carriage of people. 'I'm doing this because we are all amazing individuals and we all have a story to tell, we all have something to share, so as a way of breaking that ice I'm going to start a small dance party. 'If you want to join, you're more than welcome. If you just want to watch or clap, that's also equally OK.' Dressed in a suit and bow tie, Mr Sharp instantly launched into his dance routine while James Brown's hit, I Got You, blared through the speakers.

In an earlier video, Mr Sharp explained that he began the train dance parties in order to turn 'fear based public spaces into love based public spaces'. 'On the train, it's like this crazy void in space and time where people just disconnect from life and the opportunities that are sitting right next to them,' Mr Sharp said, adding that he hoped to change this attitude through the 'joyous movements of dance and play'.","Peter Sharp started a dance party on a train in Perth in order to 'spread a little bit of happiness'

"Kurdish forces defending Kobane urged a U.S.-led coalition to escalate air strikes on Islamic State fighters who tightened their grip on the Syrian town at the border with Turkeyon Saturday. A group that monitors the Syrian civil war said the Kurdish forces faced inevitable defeat in Kobane if Turkey did not open its border to let through arms - something Ankara has so far appeared reluctant to do. The U.S.-led coalition escalated air strikes on Islamic State in and around Kobane, also known as Ayn al-Arab, some four days ago. Kurdish forces defending Kobani urged a U.S.-led coalition to escalate air strikes on Islamic State fighters who tightened their grip on the Syrian town at the border with Turkeyon Saturday . The U.S. military conducted six airstrikes against Islamic State militants near the besieged Syrian city of Kobani on Friday and Saturday, U.S. Central Command said. The U.S. and Dutch militaries also carried out three airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq near Tal Afar and Hit on Friday and Saturday, Central Command said in a statement. Additionally, U.S. forces 'conducted multiple airdrops to help resupply Iraqi security forces at the request of the Government ofIraq,' it said, adding the supplies of food, water and ammunition were dropped around Baiji, the site of Iraq's largest oil refinery. The air attacks near Kobane hit an Islamic State fighting position and two small units, damaged a command-and-control facility and destroyed three trucks, the statement said. A U.N. official said on Friday thousands of people most likely will be massacred if Kobane falls to Islamic State, which has seized large parts of Syria and Iraq. The main Kurdish armed group, the YPG, said in a statement the air strikes had inflicted heavy losses on Islamic State, but had been less effective in the last two days. A Kurdish military official, speaking to Reuters from Kobane, said street-to-street fighting was making it harder for the warplanes to target Islamic State positions. 'We have a problem, which is the war between houses,' said Esmat Al-Sheikh, head of the Kobane defence council. 'The air strikes are benefiting us, but Islamic State is bringing tanks and artillery from the east. We didn't see them with tanks, but yesterday we saw T-57 tanks,' he added. While Islamic State has been able to reinforce its fighters, the Kurds have not. Islamic State has besieged the town to the east, south and west, meaning the Kurds' only possible supply route is the Turkish border to the north. The U.S. and Dutch militaries also carried out three airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Iraq near Tal Afar and Hit on Friday and Saturday, Central Command said in a statement . The U.N. envoy to Syria on Friday called on Turkey to help prevent a slaughter in Kobane, asking it to let ""volunteers"" cross the frontier so they can reinforce the Kurdish forces defending the town that lies within sight of Turkish territory. Turkey has yet to respond to the remarks by Staffan de Mistura, who said he feared a repeat of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre in Bosnia when thousands died. Kurdish leaders in Syria have asked Ankara to establish a corridor through Turkey to allow aid and military supplies to reach Kobane. A senior Kurdish militant has threatened Turkey with a new Kurdish revolt if it sticks with its current policy of non-intervention in the battle for the Syrian town of Kobane. '(Islamic State) is getting supplies and men, while Turkey is preventing Kobane from getting ammunition. Even with the resistance, if things stay like this, the Kurdish forces will be like a car without fuel,' said Rami Abdelrahman, who runs the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an organisation that monitors the conflict in Syria through sources on the ground. Turkey has been reluctant to help the Kurds defending Kobane, one of three areas of northern Syria where Kurds have established self-rule since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. The main Syrian Kurdish group has close ties to the PKK - which waged a militant campaign for Kurdish rights in Turkey and is listed as a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies. A Kurdish military official, speaking to Reuters from Kobani, said street-to-street fighting was making it harder for the warplanes to target Islamic State positions. Tall plumes of smoke were seen rising from Kobane on Saturday and the sound of gunfire was close to constant as battles raged into the afternoon, a Reuters journalist observing from the Turkish side of the frontier said. After sunset, the sounds of gunfire and shelling continued. Red tracer gunfire lit up the sky in the eastern sector of the town, much of which has fallen to Islamic State. Battles also raged at the southern and western edges of the town. A Kurdish military official in the Syrian city of Qamishli, another area under Kurdish control, said thousands of fighters stood ready to go to Kobane were Turkey to open a corridor. But Ghaliya Naamat, the official, said the fighters in Kobane were mainly in need of better weaponry. ""Medium-range weapons is what is lacking,"" she told Reuters by telephone. 'According to the news and the information in Kobani, there is no shortage in numbers. The shortage is in ammunition.'The symbolism of U.S.-led air strikes failing to stop Islamic State militants from overrunning Kobane could provide an early setback to U.S. President Barack Obama's three-week-old air campaign against Islamic State in Syria. The campaign is part of a U.S. strategy to degrade and destroy the group that has seized large areas of Syria and Iraq, threatening to redraw the borders of the modern Middle East according to its ultra-strict vision of Islam. If Islamic State seizes full control of the town - which U.S. officials acknowledge is possible in coming days - it would be able to boast that it has withstood American air power. The Kobani crisis has sparked deadly violence in Turkey, which has a Kurdish population numbering 15 million . The U.S.-led coalition has launched 50 strikes against militant positions around the town, most of those in the last four days. The U.S. military conducted six airstrikes against Islamic State militants near the besieged Syrian city of Kobani on Friday and Saturday, U.S. Central Command said. While much of the population has already fled Kobane, 500-700 mostly elderly people are still in the town, while 10,000-13,000 are nearby in a border area between Syria and Turkey, U.N. envoy De Mistura said. The Observatory said no fewer than 226 Kurdish fighters and 298 Islamic State militants had been killed since the group launched its Kobane offensive in mid-September. It said the overall death toll including civilians was probably much higher. Islamic State views the main armed Kurdish group, the YPG, and its supporters as apostates due to their secular ideology. Idris Nassan, deputy foreign minister of Kobane district, told Reuters by telephone that air strikes had helped the Kurdish fighters regain some territory in the south of the city but they were not enough. 'A few days ago, ISIS attacked with a Humvee vehicle, they use mortars, cannons, tanks. We don't need just Kalashnikovs and bullets. We need something effective since they captured many tanks and military vehicles in Iraq,' he said, calling for outside powers to send weapons. Tall plumes of smoke were seen rising from Kobani on Saturday and the sound of gunfire was close to constant as battles raged into the afternoon, a Reuters journalist observing from the Turkish side of the frontier said . 'The supply of fighters is very good for YPG,' he added. 'But fighters coming without arms, without weaponry is not going to make a critical difference.' The Kobane crisis has sparked deadly violence in Turkey, which has a Kurdish population numbering 15 million. Turkish Kurds have risen up since Tuesday against President Tayyip Erdogan's government, which they accuse of allowing their kin to be slaughtered. At least 33 people have been killed in three days of riots across the mainly Kurdish southeast, including two police officers shot dead in an apparent attempt to assassinate a police chief. The police chief was wounded. The U.S. State Department said on Friday that Ankara had agreed to support the training and equipping of moderate opposition groups in Syria - another prong of Obama's strategy. Ankara resents suggestions from Washington that it is not pulling its weight and wants broader joint actions that also target the forces of President Bashar al-Assad - whose government has tacitly welcome the air strikes against Islamic State.","Kurdish forces want even more air strikes on Islamic State fighters in Syrian town .

"The ringleaders of one of the country's largest ever banking scams have been jailed after police seized £6.5million in stolen and fake cheques. Charles Nyongo and Onais Hove led a country-wide team of fraudsters who intercepted cheques in the post before altering the recipient's details to steal cash. The men, who are both 43, were jailed for nine years each at Bradford Crown Court after the seizure of more than 3,000 fake cheques - the largest haul ever recorded by the banking industry. Charles Nyongo (left) and Onais Hove (right) led a gang of fraudsters responsible for one of the largest cheque scams in the history of banking . The court heard how the criminals, from Leeds and Hove respectively, intercepted cheque books and reproduced their pages after creating templates for different banks. They would photograph a page in the middle of the book and duplicate the details before posting the book on again to its intended recipient to evade suspicion. By the time the account holder had reached the page in their cheque book where the fraudsters started, they would likely have moved on to a new target. Hospices, schools and elderly, vulnerable people were among victims of the scam which started in Scotland before spreading across the UK. The fraudsters took photographs of cheques in new cheque books to duplicate them with account holders' details (file image) Charles Nyongo and Onais Hove stole post intended for schools, hospices and elderly people to defraud them. Once they picked up a cheque intended for the recipient, the gang altered its details to those of a third part or 'mule account' which they had access to but was not set up in their names. Alternatively, they would duplicate the pages of a fresh cheque book by taking a photograph of a sheet in the middle of the book and copying it perfectly with their own specialised paper and ink. They would then post the cheque books on to the account holder. By the time they reached the spot in the book where the fraudsters had started, they would have moved on to their next target. An investigation carried out by the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit found more than 3,000 cheques at addresses across the UK. Nyongo and Hove denied conspiring to defraud UK banks and possessing articles for use in fraud, but were found guilty of all charges and sentenced to nine years each in prison. Det Chief Insp Perry Stokes, head of the DCPCU, said: 'We have dismantled a highly organised and professional fraud gang - one of the largest of its kind ever seen in the UK. 'As the ringleaders, Hove and Nyongo were ruthlessly indiscriminate in selecting their victims. 'Their knowledge of the bank cheque system was considerable, and our investigation revealed a series of fraud factories across the country. 'We are delighted to have brought these criminals to justice and to have removed the threat they posed to British banks and their customers.' The pair were sentenced at Bradford Crown Court (pictured) for nine years each for their crimes .","Charles Nyongo and Onais Hove headed gang of fraudsters .

"Ancient Greece's Venus de Milo, Michaelangelo's David and Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring are all set to appear in a blockbuster show in east London today. For these reproductions of classic artworks have all been made out of Lego blocks by American artist Nathan Sawaya. He has brought his his exhibition of Lego sculptures to the UK for the first time after it has been seen by millions of people around the world. Tearing his art out: Nathan Sawaya stands with his sculpture 'Yellow' at the Art of Brick Exhibition in London . Faithful reproduction: Sawaya's interpretation of Vermeer's Girl With A Pearl Earring . Trippy: In this sculpture entitled 'Computer' a hand reaches eerily out from the screen to use the keyboard . Sawaya's giant colourful statues of skulls, bodies bursting open, dinosaurs and faithful interpretations of classical works have already been seen in New York, Shanghai and Singapore. Now the former corporate lawyer is showing more than 75 of his artworks in the exhibition The Art Of The Brick which will open, appropriately enough, in Brick Lane in east London on Friday. More than a million Lego bricks have been assembled into his figures, which include one of his most familiar images in which a human chest is prized apart, with blocks spilling out. It took Sawaya almost 4,200 hours to produce his collection, which includes a Tyrannosaurus Rex skeleton which is made up of 80,000 bricks. Organisers expect the exhibition, due to continue at The Old Truman Brewery venue until January 4 of next year, to be a huge draw.

"A university learning specialist has received death threats and hateful messages after she exposed shockingly low academic levels among revenue athletes the University of North Carolina. Mary Willingham found that between eight and ten per cent of college’s football and basketball players had a reading level of a third grader. By studying eight years of test scores from University of Carolina’s revenue sports players, she found that a majority had a reading level between fourth and eighth grade. Whistleblower: Mary Willingham has received death threats since she exposed the shockingly low reading levels of revenue sports players at the University of North Carolina . ‘We may as well go over to the elementary school up the street and let the fourth-graders and third-graders in here,’ she told CNN. Ms Willingham looked at 183 revenue sports players at the UNC between 2004 and 2012, and found that between eight and 10 per cent read below fourth grade level and 60 per cent between fourth and eighth grade level. Ms Willingham also discovered that up to 25 per cent of basketball and football athletes did not have the reading level to study at a community college, let alone at a university. In the two days which have passed since her findings were published as part of a wider investigation by CNN, Ms Willingham has received four death threats and 30 'alarming messages' ‘Not people who disagree, people who put in the subject or body (of the e-mail) straight-up hate speech,’ she said. Moneymakers: The UNC football and basketball teams generate multi-million dollar profits for the college . Early in her career as a learning specialist, Mary Willingham was in her office when a basketball player at the University of North Carolina walked in looking for help with his classwork . Football and basketball are the two sports that generate revenue for the university with men's basketball team alone making a $16.9million profit in 2012. Ms Willingham, who also worked as a learning specialist for athletes from 2003 to 2010, told CNN of one example of a basketball player at the UNC who was completely illiterate, and another who could not read multisyllabic words, despite UNC at Chapel Hill being one of the top public universities in the U.S. Despite admitting earlier in the investigation that officials had seen the alarming figures, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill issued a statement saying they did not believe Ms Willingham’s story and could not comment on the data used by Ms Willingham and CNN as university officials had not seen it. However, Willingham's research into revenue sports students was based on screenings ordered and paid for by the university itself, and she has shared her findings with senior officials on at least two occasions. A further investigation by CNN using data from 21 Tier-1 universities, including Ohio State University, Texas  A&M University and Georgia University, found that most institutions had between seven and 18 per cent of revenue sports athletes scoring below elementary school reading level. Denial: Despite previously admitting to having taken part in the findings of Ms Willingham's research, the UNC-Chapel Hill released a statement saying they did not believe her story .

"There’s an awful lot to see and do in New York – but I’m staying in The James hotel and it’s sapping my motivation to go out and explore. It’s a Disney Land of swankery that’s hard to walk away from. First of all, there’s my room. It’s on a corner, 11 floors up, overlooking the streets of Manhattan’s trendy Soho district – and it’s mesmerising. Two sides of the room are almost entirely formed of windows and when I arrive I spend a good while peering out of them at the district’s jumble of offices, townhouses and designer shops. Glass act: The corner bedroom suites at The James offer great views of Manhattan . Luxury: Pay a bit more and you can have a room with a magnificent stand-alone bath . Trendy: The James' Jimmy bar is a magnet for Manhattan's trenderatti . Slightly frustratingly I can’t see any famous landmarks, but it’s still an enticing Big Apple panorama. I’m meeting two friends for a drink later so figure a quick shower is in order, but the shower nearly derails my timekeeping. It’s a rain shower that’s all the rage in quality hotels, but this one is like standing under a monsoon. It’s magnificent and I’m half-tempted to spend all evening amid the soothing cascade. The bathroom is very clean, modern – smothered in easy-on-the-eye tiles - and stocked with very generous quantities of organic shampoo, conditioner and body wash by Intelligent Nutrients. While crucially for bleary-eyed nighttime visits, it has a dimmer switch for the lights. Take the plunge: There are great views from the rooftop pool, with the Freedom Tower visible to the south. Picture courtesy of an HTC One . Smiles better: Ted on the rooftop with the skyline in the background, pictured relaxing in one of the hotel's bathrobes . Roof with a view: The jumbled rooftops of Soho as seen from the top of the hotel . It’s separated from the room by a glass wall, a style the hotel calls ‘peek-a-boo’. I call it baffling. I just can’t fathom why anyone would want to be visible to their roommate – and the outside world – while sitting on the loo or wielding a loofer (not supplied) in the shower. Fortunately The James has anticipated some of its guests harbouring conservative sensibilities. Total privacy is assured by way of a screen that winds down efficiently at a touch of a button inside the bathroom. The exposure theme doesn’t end there, because a bare concrete pillar is another distinctive feature of the room. I’m not often wooed by industrial aesthetics but in this room it works – somehow giving the space a bit of extra artiness. Of course, it helps that a huge flat-screen TV is attached to it. The room – the hotel calls it ‘a corner studio’ – comes with one enormous kingside bed. I’m staying with my dear mother, so to accommodate us one of the in-room service attendants brings up a camp bed. It looks so incongruous in our otherwise chic surroundings that I half expect to have to sign a disclaimer promising that I won’t reveal that the hotel uses them. Urban garden: The outdoor dining arrangement at The James is just superb . Enticing: The James 'urban garden' has several levels and walkways . A brand new feather-filled duvet for it is unwrapped in front of us - it’s a camp bed, but a Rolls-Royce of camp beds. I’m meeting my chums at the top floor bar – called ‘Jimmy’ – which is blessed with the wow factor. Several wow factors, actually. There’s the view uptown – towards the Empire State building. The view downtown - and the Freedom Tower. And the plunge pool. Standing on the decking with a glass of highly quaffable chenin blanc gazing at the sun setting over the New York skyline is truly staggering. The bar, meanwhile, is staffed by two very able cocktail conjurers, dispensing liquor to what looks to be Soho’s trenderatti, scattered hither and thither on upholstered cubes. It’s a bar that attracts the well-heeled – and actual big heels. I revisit the pool for an early morning dip the following day – and it’s just as magical without the aid of a wine haze. The pool is really only big enough for a handful of people, though, so pick your moments for a swim. The James’ in-house eating options are as magnetic as its rooftop delights. The restaurant – The David Burke Kitchen - is named after the celebrity chef that bears ultimate responsibility for the standard of fodder. The hotel is clearly proud of the collaboration, with the restaurant given lashings of hype on its website. The confidence certainly isn’t misplaced. The excellent cooking is on the rustic side, with a bit of artistry and flair thrown in for good measure. Starters include Peanut Butter maple bacon dates, chicken dumplings and cornbread crusted oysters. Diners can choose from such delights as heritage pork, salt brick beef and red snapper for mains. High life: The James rises up 29 floors above Manhattan's trendy Soho district . Corking: The impressive hotel lobby, where free wine and cheese is served between 6 and 8pm . Flair: The David Burke Kitchen's coconut trifle . I plump for a delicious and refreshing tomato and watermelon gazpacho for my starter with chicken and English peas for my main course. Cooked to perfection. For dessert I opt for a sumptuous coconut trifle served in a jam jar. Inventive and cute. The wine list is nothing short of sensational, with a frankly astonishing range of grape-based liquor on offer. The cellar harbours everything from the highly drinkable and affordable to legendary reds such as Chateau Petrus and what some might regard as  one of the finest white wines in the world – Batard-Montrachet Grand Cru. You’ll need deep pockets, for these, though. What makes eating at The James extra special are the seating options. It’s a gourmand’s playground. You can dine indoors in a stylish loft-type space, or outside, as we did, in a sort of urban garden. It has multiple levels with walkways and steps leading to variously sized dining areas all surrounded by lush foliage. There’s a bar in there somewhere, too. It’s quite brilliant. Note - map and compass recommended. Extricate yourself from The James’ and you’ll find the surrounding area has plenty going for it. Soho is in that bit of New York without skyscapers in between the bits with skyscrapers (Downtown and Midtown). Designer shops such as Dior and Luis Vuitton nestle in nearby streets, along with culinary hotspots such as Balthazar and Lupa. Washington Square - where a myriad of New York characters gather to relax by the fountain, play chess and eat ice cream - is also just a few minutes away on foot. Arty: A wall made up entirely of computer keys in the entrance to the hotel . Five reasons to stay at the James New York: . We spend 30 minutes there listening to a busker playing an actual grand piano that he’d wheeled into the park. Astonishing. No city tires you out quite like the frenetic Big Apple. Fortunately, my bed is more than equal to the task of leaving me rested and refreshed, ready for more urban adventures. It’s supremely comfortable with luxuriously soft pillows. Fuelling up with breakfast at The David Burke Kitchen turns out to be an experience almost as gourmet in nature as dinner. Just-right eggs benedict is served up with lashings of smooth coffee and a quirky grapefruit brulee – think crème brulee, but with the caramel covering halves of grapefruit – that proves a winner with Mother Thornhill. The hotel does all the basics really well – clean comfortable rooms, great food, first-class bathroom experiences, superb location and, in case you were wondering, very courteous staff. Crucially, there’s also free – and very fast – Wi-Fi. There are flourishes here, though, that propel The James from being a good hotel to a great hotel. The intriguing urban garden dining experience I’ve already mentioned, but there are also pleasing touches such as free – highly quaffable – wine with cheese and biscuits served in the lobby every evening, bowls of food and water laid out by the entrance for guests’ dogs and modern art peppered along the corridors. I particularly like the wall by the entrance covered with computer keys. It’s no wonder that The James brand - there are also hotels in Chicago and Miami - attracts celebrities such as Sofia Vergara, Zoe Saldana and Channing Tatum. Yes, it's got glass-walled bathrooms, but my love for this place is utterly transparent. Rates at The James New York start from £216 per room per night on a B&B basis, excluding taxes.

"They're well-known for peddling counterfeit goods and hawking copycat versions of iPhones and knock-off designer bags. And now the Chinese have outdone themselves, by unveiling their latest masterpiece: A replica of Venice complete with four kilometres of man-made canals that run through the heart of the district. Built in the port city of Dalian in China's north-eastern Liaoning province, gondola rides have also been made available to paying customers, with gondoliers dressed in traditional Venetian clothing for added effect. Knock-off Venice: China's duplicate version of the unique Italian city comes complete with man-made canals . Gondoliers dressed in traditional Venerian clothing take paying customers on rides . The canal is surrounded on both sides by 'European-style' architecture created by Chinese architects who visited Venice and made copies of some of the more popular buildings in an ambitious attempt to emulate the ubiquitous style of modern day Venice. According to local developers, the canal system was favoured as a way of cutting down on the increasing amount of traffic and a growing rate of car ownership that was affecting air quality in the city. The real deal: Venice in Italy is considered one of the world's most romantic places and was recently the setting for George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin's wedding . According to local developers, the canal system was favoured as a way of cutting down on the increasing amount of traffic and a growing rate of car ownership that was affecting air quality in the city . The Venice of the east project cost some 5 billion RMB (£507 million) to construct. Images of the project were mostly praised on Chinese social media sites. But there were also many who pointed out it was sad China did not use its own unique architecture as a basis for a project and instead had resorted to copying foreigners once again. Only last year it was revealed that China had made a copycat version of the Alpine village of Hallsatt which is a UNESCO world heritage site in Upper Austria, sparking an angry backlash from the Austrians who said they had not been consulted or asked for permission for the project. The replica of Hallstatt, a centuries-old village in Austria opened in the Chinese province of Guangdong opened amid some controversy as natives of the original Hallstatt were not initially made aware that their historic buildings and streets were being copied. Images of the project were mostly praised on Chinese social media sites when they were unveiled . Last year it was revealed that Hallstatt (pictured), a centuries-old village in Austria, was copied by China . It was only revealed when a Chinese visitor to Austria's Hallstatt let word of the project slip. The 'made in China' version of the town cost an estimated $940 million to build. Some residents of the original Hallstatt, a town of around 900, made the journey to Guangdong to attend this opening ceremony after the two sides eventually agreed to settle their differences and work together for the benefit of both. With most of the people living in the original village in Austria dependent on the hundreds of thousands of tourists who overrun Hallstatt's 900 inhabitants each year, they see the project as good for business.","Replica of the famous Italian city opens in Dalian in north-eastern China .

"Remains found buried in a shallow grave in a creek bed behind an abandoned property last weekend belong to missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, it has been confirmed. Hannah, 18, vanished on September 13 in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, after a party. She was last seen late at night with Jesse Matthew Jr, who has been charged with her disappearance. On Saturday search parties which had been scouring the countryside around Charlottesville found human remains, which were buried in a shallow grave in a densely wooded area. Scroll down for video . Scene of tragedy: This is the property in Albermare county behind which the body of Hannah Graham was found. Officials have confirmed that the body is hers . Missing: Hannah Graham disappeared in Charlottesville, Virginia, on September 13 . The grisly find was made around an abandoned property on a rural road - the area where suspect Jesse Matthew, who has been charged with Hannah's abduction, grew up. All other search efforts were called off as soon as the remains were found. The sophomore was last seen on a surveillance video walking with kidnapping suspect Jesse Matthew in downtown mall in Charlottesville, Virginia on September 13. Charlottesville police chief Timothy Longo told reporters after the find: 'Sometime before noon [Saturday] a search team from the Chesterfield County Sheriff's department discovered what appears to be human remains. 'Forensic tests need to be conducted to determine the identity of these remains. But we wanted to be quick in informing the Graham family. Uncovered: Human remains were found five miles from where Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington was found dead, according to the local police . 'This investigation is complicated, it's a complex criminal investigation, it is unlikely that we will have any more information in the near future.' Describing the 'unprecedented' search effort, he said: 'It was 35 days ago since University of Virginia student Hannah Graham disappeared from our downtown pedestrian mall. He added: 'Thousand of hours have been spent by hundreds of law enforcement and civilian volunteers in an effort to find Hannah.' It came days after Sue and John Graham, Hannah's parents, issued a last, passionate plea for Virginians to look out for signs of her. Suspect: Jesse Leroy Matthew Jr., 32, has been charged with abduction with intent to defile . Writing on October 13 - a month after she vanished - they said: 'It is heart-breaking for us that the person or persons who know where Hannah is have not come forward with that information. 'It is within their power both to end this nightmare for all, and to relieve the searchers of their arduous task.' Witnesses have said they saw Matthew with Hannah on the night she disappeared. The spot at which the human remains were found, on Old Lynchburg Road in Albermarle County, is not far from where Matthew's mother used to live. He is said to have grown up in the area and to be familiar with it.","Hannah, 18, went missing in Charlottesville, Virginia, on September 13 .

"The schoolboy who murdered teacher Ann Maguire is on 24-hour suicide watch and has already been moved from a young offender institution after violence threats, it was claimed today. William Cornick, 16, was sentenced on Monday to life in jail with a minimum of 20 years after stabbing to death 61-year-old Mrs Maguire at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April. At first the boy was held at Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire but is said to have since been moved to another undisclosed YOI for his own safety. Behind bars: William Cornick (left), 16, of Leeds, was sentenced on Monday to life in jail with a minimum of 20 years. At first the boy was held at Wetherby Young Offender Institution (right) in West Yorkshire . Jail: An HM Inspectorate of Prisons report last year said the vast majority of young people at Wetherby Young Offender Institution, which holds about 230 youths, reported feeling safe . Cornick - one of 16 children serving indeterminate life sentences in Britain’s YOIs - had been held on the Anson wing in Wetherby, which is designed for long-term inmates, reported The Times. The boy was seen to be at risk from other convicts and placed in solitary confinement in a cell with a glass door, according to a report submitted to Leeds Crown Court by his defence team. The Anson wing is now the only dedicated juvenile unit in England and Wales for young people with life or long-term determinate sentences, according to an HM Inspectorate of Prisons report last year. It said the vast majority of young people at Wetherby, which holds about 230 youths, reported feeling safe - although incidents of self-harm were ‘higher than in comparable establishments’. Spanish teacher: Ann Maguire (left), 61, was killed at Corpus Christi Catholic College (right) in Leeds in April . Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, claimed yesterday that the decision to by Mr Justice Coulson to lift Cornick’s anonymity order was not in the public interest. She wrote in The Guardian: ‘The child will be notorious inside prison and will never be able to grow past the crime he committed. The crime is now his permanent identity.’ And Penelope Gibbs, who chairs the Standing Committee for Youth Justice (SCYJ) umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said yesterday that the sentence was too long. She told BBC Radio 4: ‘I don't think a child - and he was a child - should get a life sentence because they are young, their brain is not mature and a life sentence is indeterminate, it could last forever.’ Mrs Gibbs added: ‘He needs to be in prison, he needs to be rehabilitated so he's no longer a danger to himself and others - but a minimum of 20 years is too long.’ Part of Cornick's rehabilitation could see him return to a classroom during his sentence. Murder scene: This is the classroom at at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds where Cornick killed Mrs Maguire. Part of his rehabilitation could see him return to a classroom during his sentence . Brian Hamilton, chair of the Manchester College: University and College Union prison branch, said Cornick could be taught in a class of around eight people with a focus on basic literacy and numeracy skills and vocational training to ensure prisoners are employable on their release. Cornick, who took and passed five GCSEs a year early, would be unlikely to be able to study for higher level qualifications. Mr Hamilton, who teaches in prisons, said: ‘I believe this young man is quite intelligent. He would probably be above the level they are trying to take them to in that establishment.’ Cornick attacked Mrs Maguire after boasting to friends that he was going to kill her. He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’. He later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’ After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.","William Cornick, 16, was jailed for life with 20-year minimum on Monday .

"An unlucky couple both ended up in hospital with broken hips after the wife’s walking stick got stuck between the cracks of a new multi-million pound footpath. Cath Henry, 81, and her husband Lindon, 80, were walking arm-in-arm while on their way to a Gala Bingo hall in Stoke-on-Trent, Stafforshire when her stick became jammed in grooves designed to help the visually impaired. Mr Henry went crashing to the ground as he tried to save her and both pensioners suffered fractures to their hips in the fall. Cath Henry, 81, (left) and her husband Lindon, 80, (right) both suffered broken hips in the fall on new footpath . Members of the public rushed to the couple’s aid before an ambulance arrived and they were taken to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. They have since been moved to Haywood Hospital where they will spend the next few weeks at opposite ends of the same ward. Mr Henry - who has already had a hip replacement - said: ‘As we started to walk to Gala Bingo, Cath linked our arms and we started to cross the road. ‘My wife suddenly got her stick caught fast in the grooves on the pavement and started to fall over. ‘As our arms were still linked she tried to shove me away. I tried to save her but we just went over. ‘Cath was flat out on the ground and we were both quite shaken up. I was just in shock when it happened and I panicked. I was so worried about her.’ Mrs Henry, who has had pins and screws in her leg, added: ‘I thought we were going for a nice night out at the bingo and then next thing I'm in hospital. ‘It was horrible breaking my right hip.’ The area outside the Gala Bingo hall in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, where the couple fell and broke their hips . Stoke-on-Trent City Council spend millions of pounds on renovating the pavements and seating in the area . The great-grandparents fell in Stafford Street in Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, on October 10, where council leaders have spent millions of pounds on new paving and seating. The area where Mrs Henry’s walking stick got stuck was between pavement grooves which are there to help visually impaired pedestrians realise they are crossing between the road and pavement. The couple is now calling for the council to rip up the paving slabs, which were laid down as part of a multi-million pound transformation of the city centre. Mr Henry, a retired pottery artist, said: ‘The pavement there is very bumpy and it is bad for disabled people trying to walk over it. The council wants to repave it. ‘I know we're not getting any younger, but when you walk on those grooves you're over. ‘I understand they need to be there, but it is terribly unstable for older people and those with walking sticks.’ Their daughter, Sam Henry, 51, said: ‘I was completely shocked. ‘They had gone out for a game of bingo and then they end up in hospital needing operations on broken hips. ‘The pavements can be quite dodgy there.’ The couple, who are great-grandparents, pictured before the fall which has left them both in hospital for weeks . Daughter-in-law Jayne Henry, 53, said the couple - who have been married for 60 years - were hoping to return to their home as soon as possible. She added: ‘They are a bit distraught not being able to look after each other. ‘At first the nurses were wheeling Cath's bed down to Lindon and then she was in a wheelchair. ‘They were close to each other but it was a bit too far to walk after their injuries. ‘They have been moved to the Haywood Hospital now and we are hoping they will be home soon. ‘Lindon is walking a bit better now but Cath is still having trouble.’ Mr Henry and his wife, a retired seamstress, have three children - Laraine Hudson, 59, Lindon Henry, 54, and Sam, 51. The couple - who still live together independently - also have eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. Disability campaigners have also raised concerns about the new-look streets and said the kerb and roads should be painted different colours. Pam Bryan, secretary of the Stoke-on-Trent Area Network for Disability group, said: ‘The council is aware there are issues. ‘The kerb and the road are the same colour and people not aware they are approaching it are tripping over it. Mr and Mrs Henry are calling on the council to rip up the paving slabs after they were injured in freak incident . ‘It predominantly affects the elderly. The council has tried to alleviate the problem by putting metal studs in the kerb edge to try to make it more apparent, but it has not improved things. ‘In light of this accident, we would like them to look at the problems again.’ Stoke-on-Trent City Council has used millions of pounds of European cash to install new paving across a number of streets in Hanley. The grooved slabs were a legal requirement and comply with Disability Discrimination Act and Department for Transport guidelines. Councillor Ruth Rosenau, cabinet member for transportation, said: ‘This is a most unfortunate accident and our very best wishes go to Mr and Mrs Henry. ‘The public realm improvements have been designed to reduce traffic into the city centre. ‘In this area, only buses and taxis are able to access the road, and the pavement and the road are on the same level to improve the look and feel of the environment for visitors. ‘We worked closely with the RNIB, Guide Dogs UK and Action for Blind People in developing the improvement works, and the raised surface along the edge of the paving area is necessary to distinguish between pedestrian and vehicle routes.’","Cath Henry and her husband were walking arm-in-arm on their way to bingo .

"A playboy billionaire racked up a whopping £2million bar tab in just three hours last night when he splurged on champagne and expensive jewellery. The Russian businessman managed to spend the huge amount at a private nightclub in Mayfair. He spent so much his bill for Luxor champagne alone reached £20,000, but staff at the Playboy Club's Salvatore's Bar waived his drinks tab. Scroll down for video . The mystery Russian billionaire's bar tab, showing his bill which totalled more than £2million . Staff members Elise Planchard (left) and Kirsty Egan (right), with model Celina Van Der Linde (centre) at the event in Mayfair last night . But the mystery big spender in his mid-40s still left paying an eye-watering £2,042,520. The seven-figure final total included £980,000 for Art Deco Asscher necklace, £356,000 for one diamond tennis bracelet and £109,500 for a second. He also paid another £145,000 for an Emerald cut tennis bracelet and £111,600 for a pair of 14ct Pear Drop earrings. And after splurging on the jewels at the Vashi Dominguez Fine Jewellery Salon Prive, the billionaire also had a colossal VAT bill of £340,420 to pay. Salvatore's Bar at the Playboy Club is described as 'sophisticated' and welcoming, and features a pianist and world-class cocktail mixer. It not only boasts some of the most expensive bottles of champagne imaginable, but also claims to store a collection of rare vintage cognacs dating back to the 1700s. When the wealthy Russian came to pay up at the end of the night, jeweller Vashi Dominguez picked up the tab for the 10 magnums of gold-flecked Luxor champagne he had ploughed through. The luxury event saw models parading millions of pounds of diamonds and jeweller perused by guests - one of whom turned up in £1.4m Pagani Huayra that he parked outside. One onlooker from the event said: 'The room had about 40 of the most wealthy men in London but this was still a huge surprise that just one of them spent over £2m in less than three hours.

Salvatore's Bar, in the Mayfair Playboy Club, where the mystery buyer spent £2million . 'It was one of the most luxurious events I've ever been to, and all of the guests were billionaires - not millionaires, or multi-millionaires, the guest were the crème de la crème of London's wealthiest elite. 'There were some Arab royal families, Russians and very high net worth Europeans. There were as many personal bodyguards as there were guests. 'The models were milling in and out of the guests and when the drinks started flowing you could tell it was only a matter of time for one of them to drop a seven figure sum.' 'When the sale was done it was arranged very quietly and not at all in a showy way. 'The Russian simply gestured to his PA that he wanted the necklace and the bracelets worn by a particular model and the sale was arranged on the spot.' When contacted a representative for diamond jeweller Vashi Dominguez said: 'Our Salon Prive event at the Playboy club was a hugely successful and enjoyable event, but it is our company policy not to comment regarding the identities of our customers.' While most bar tabs pale in comparison to the jewellery binge at the Playboy Club last night, many other businessmen and celebrities have drunk bills that would make any normal person cringe. In 2011 the Boston Bruins ice hockey team celebrated their Stanley Cup victory in style - by accumulating a £96,520 tab. Reportedly the work of just six members of the team, the crew partied at the MGM Grand in Mashantucket, Connecticut with $34,916 worth of drinks before they bought a $61,603 bottle of Ace of Spades Midas Champagne. At the time, the bottle was just one of six of the 30-litre bottles in existence that are made by luxury brand Armand de Brignac and produced by Champagne house Cattier. It is the largest bottle of luxury champagne in the world. And in 2012 a self-proclaimed City whizzkid who spent more than £200,000 on Britain’s most expensive round of drinks also bought a bottle. Alex Hope, 23, who claimed to have earned a fortune by trading foreign currencies, was said to have forked out £125,000 on a single bottle of champagne along with £60,408 on other beverages. Mr Hope booked a table at the UnderGround night club at Liverpool’s Hilton Hotel and ordered the 30-litre bottle of Armand de Brignac in advance of his visit, according to bosses. He was said to have entertained celebrity guests, including Manchester City footballer Adam Johnson and Man United star Wayne Rooney’s wife Coleen. Two waiters were needed to carry in the bulky 99lb Nebuchadnezzar-size bottle of champagne, which is the equivalent of 40 standard ones.

"The burgundy-coloured splatter wouldn't look out of place at another of Catalan city Sitges' famed events, a yearly international film festival specialising in horror and fantasy. But there's nothing to fear about this Barefoot Grape Crushing Competition, which ran on Sunday as part of the 53rd Annual Sitges Wine Festival, or Festa de La Verema, which celebrates the annual harvest. The squishing of grapes in front of a historic church has been a pivotal part of the Spanish festival's programme for 36 years as groups of locals ditch their shoes and produce the raw material for their signature drop. The Penedes region produces about 90 per cent of the world's cava and while not all of the grapes are squashed in this ancient manner, the locals are certainly adept at extracting all of the juice possible from their grapes. Teams compete with a duo together in a wooden half barrel doing the stomping - otherwise known as the fun bit - while another member squeezes the crushed grapes with their hands over a wire mesh to ensure every last drop of the previous liquid is liberated. The winning team is simply the one to produce the most juice. Potentially not the most politically correct of festivals, other events include a beauty competition and the weighing of the heir and heiress of the event using wine bottles. Sitges is 35km from Barcelona and before the economic boom in the 1960s turned it into a popular tourist resort, the area's primary industry was wine. Other events include barrel rolling contests and the best of the regions food is showcased, with local restaurants changing their menus to the more grape focused than usual.

"Former Chief Inspector for Surrey Police Tanya Brookes . A shamed senior policewoman described as ‘a disgrace to her uniform’ by a judge has been freed from prison just four months into a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence for fraud. Former Chief Inspector Tanya Brookes, 46, who was convicted of dishonestly making £11,000, is now back home with her husband and children. Her early release was described as ‘outrageous’ last night after The Mail on Sunday discovered Brookes, who served with Surrey Police, had been allowed out with a tag on ‘home detention curfew’ following a successful appeal to reduce her sentence to 18 months. Even taking that into account, she has served less than a quarter of her time in jail – and will even keep her generous pension. The mother of four, who was convicted of 33 charges, cheated shops by forging vouchers or claiming refunds for goods such as micro-scooters and blankets that she had bought at a discount online. Jailing her at Winchester Crown Court in May, Judge Andrew Barnett said: ‘You have disgraced the uniform you once wore.’ Surrey Police and Crime Commissioner Kevin Hurley said: ‘It is outrageous that Tanya Brookes has been allowed out of prison so soon. It looks wrong.’ The Ministry of Justice said it would not comment on individual prisoners. Nicholas Tucker, prosecuting at the case back in May, said at the start of the first trial how Brookes, who was also married to another senior police officer, David, had joined the Surrey force as a university graduate and he described her as a 'high-flyer'. He said that it was as she was about to mark her 20 years’ service in July 2011 that she became the subject of an investigation by her own force. In his opening of the case, Mr Tucker said one of Brookes’s main targets was The White Company. He said that she would buy items such as Poitier cotton sheets or a cashmere satin-edge blanket from the chain’s outlet store in Bicester, Oxfordshire, at a discount rate. Outlet: Brookes, 46, made trips to Bicester Village, the outlet street in Oxfordshire, to buy cheap items . She would then falsify a bank statement on her computer showing that the full price for the product had been paid and return it to another branch of the store and fraudulently reclaim the difference in price. She would tell shop staff that the items had been bought by 'an extravagant great aunt'. Mr Tucker continued: 'Mrs Brookes would often be wearing her police ID on a lanyard round her neck - this was irregular, and the prosecution say it was a ploy by Mrs Brookes to capitalise on the trust people tend to place in police officers.' He also described how she fraudulently gained a £6,000 discount from a luxury holiday for her family by falsely claiming that she was a counter-terrorism officer at Gatwick Airport. The deceit was in order to claim a discount given to people connected with the travel industry from specialist holiday firm Caribbean Unpackaged for the £10,000 trip to Buccament Bay on St Vincent. Mr Tucker said that Brookes even sent an email to the company saying they could not pass on her details because her identity was a secret because of the nature of the role. Mr Tucker added that as she returned from this holiday, Brookes also falsely claimed for a damaged Buggaboo buggy worth £849 and a Maclaren buggy worth £195 from British Airways by providing a forged proof of purchase from John Lewis. She had made a similar false claim against Monarch airlines for a £491 pushchair she alleged had been damaged on a return flight from Tenerife in May 2009.","Tanya Brookes, 46, was convicted of dishonestly making £11,000 .

"Don’t you just love our country? I’m not being sarcastic. In April 2010, it was recorded in Hansard that ‘this House expresses profound sadness at the death of Corin Redgrave [and] recalls his life as a brilliant actor, peace campaigner, supporter of the downtrodden and man of enormous principle’. Yet Redgrave, a stalwart of the Workers’ Revolutionary Party, had devoted much of his life to the overthrow of parliamentary democracy and our wicked capitalist ways. Committed to the economic and political theories of Lenin and Trotsky, he saw money and materialism as the root cause of ‘inequality, social conflict and wars’. Mention Thatcher to him and he went blue in the face. Corin fell in love with his second wife, Kika Markham, during a lecture at the Derbyshire College of Marxist Education . Corin fell in love with his second wife, Kika Markham, during a lecture at the Derbyshire College of Marxist Education. They spent their honeymoon thinking up ways of ‘fighting Thatcher, unemployment and racism’. As an actor, Corin developed into a magnificent and authoritative presence. His one-man show about Oscar Wilde was acclaimed in London and New York. I myself witnessed him play Sir Anthony Blunt, the Soviet double-agent, in a one-man show presented in Bromyard, Herefordshire, the town in which Corin and his sister, Vanessa, had spent the war as evacuees. Such was his magnetism that, at the end, he had us all lustily singing The Red Flag. As an actor, Corin developed into a magnificent and authoritative presence. His one-man show about Oscar Wilde was acclaimed in London and New York. He had shaped up into someone as impressive as his late father, Sir Michael Redgrave . As a performer, Corin had shaped up into someone as impressive as his late father, Sir Michael Redgrave. I was slightly disconcerted to discover in Our Time Of Day, however, that, when Sir Michael died and was cremated in 1985, Corin ever afterwards kept the ashes in his car, ‘unable to part with them’. Strange behaviour. As a chain-smoker and alcoholic, Corin was asking for trouble and, in 2005, recovering from prostate cancer on holiday in Italy, ‘he was shivering and shaking like a leaf’, says Kika. The emergency doctor ‘couldn’t tell if it was very bad flu or whether it might have been a heart attack’. As a chain-smoker and alcoholic, Corin was asking for trouble and, in 2005, recovering from prostate cancer on holiday in Italy, ‘he was shivering and shaking like a leaf’, says Kika . Back in Britain, Corin was addressing a meeting of the Dale Farm gypsies in Basildon when he collapsed. He was taken, unconscious, to intensive care and put on a life-support machine. He had suffered ‘severe brain damage from the lack of oxygen after the cardiac arrest’. Would it have been a kindness had he died? The ensuing five years, which are recorded here in a completely engrossing and harrowing mix of diaries, memos, scraps, letters and heartbreaking reminiscence, were hell on Earth for Kika — because, when Corin regained consciousness, he had clean forgotten who she was. He was lucid, ‘articulate and passionate’, but his memory had been obliterated. Our Time Of Day is a horror story about a husband who wakes up and has no idea he’d ever been in love with his wife. Emotion and tenderness — all gone. ‘I can’t remember our life together,’ Corin confesses and, as Kika says, ‘both our lives had disappeared. For what use are memories if they only exist for one person’. She was placed in the unique position of grieving for a man who was not technically dead. To all intents and purposes, Corin was insane. Moved to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, in Bloomsbury, he thought he was ‘in some kind of hotel in Singapore’. He failed to recognise London, believing the trees and parks were a garden in Vienna. He didn’t want to co-operate with the doctors because ‘he didn’t think there was anything the matter . . . He thought people were lying to him and that his life was in danger.’ He was convinced he was the target of a ‘State conspiracy’ and the Secret Police were coming for him. ‘We must get away!’ he screamed. He tried to do just that, in a taxi. ‘Corin is angry and won’t be pacified,’ remembers Kika. Eventually, Vanessa offered to look after her brother at her flat. But there was little improvement. Such was Corin’s rage and fear, he reckoned people were hidden in the wardrobe, listening to him — so he insisted on silence. Piteously, he could never remember that his mother had died and faced ‘the terrible freshness of sorrow’ each time he was told the truth. He started to confuse Kika with his first wife, Deirdre, and what it boiled down to was that Corin no longer had any capacity to reflect. He could only cope and survive ‘in the moment’. Kika talking about her memoirs. She says that by the time Corin's brain damage had set in they had both lost their lives . The miracle, however — the anomaly — is that, despite being sectioned in a mental hospital, despite his increasing ‘disinhibition’ (urinating in public view, buttonholing complete strangers), despite his loss of co-ordination and balance, Corin’s ‘creative power has not diminished one bit’, and he could still work: Beckett on the radio, film and television cameos. But then, he could go quite unpredictably crazy again. Hearing a playback of himself in King Lear, he asked, without trying to be funny: ‘Who’s written this? It’s not Shakespeare. Who’s written it?’ Within the midst of this maelstrom, Kika’s steadfastness is an inspiration, like a heroine in a Greek tragedy. Though ‘we were unable to communicate with one another through familiar ways’, and even though Corin had no remorse about his condition (because he didn’t believe he was poorly — asked if he was upset at having no recollection of his life with Kika he said, rather callously, ‘No, not really. It’s strange’), she never for a single second gives up on what they’d had, what they’d been, before the darkness fell. Darkness fell for good in 2010, when Corin suffered a burst aneurysm. His ashes are interred in Highgate Cemetery — not kept in the car. ‘I was alone,’ says Kika, ‘without a plan.’ The actuality is that she’d already been alone for years.

"Newcastle United have completed a deal to bring Facundo Ferreyra on loan from Shakhtar with an option to make the switch permanent for £6.5m. The Argentine striker will boost Alan Pardew's attacking options at St James' Park and comes after the 23-year-old refused to return to his parent club. Ferreyra was one of six Shakhtar players along with Brazilians Douglas Costa, Fred, Dentinho, Alex Teixiera and Ismaily who failed to report back to Ukraine following a friendly against Lyon in France on Saturday due to the political unrest in Ukraine. Heading for the Toon: Facundo Ferreyra (right) has joined Newcastle on loan from Shakhtar with an option to make the deal permanent . But the Toon have been keeping tabs on the Argentine for two years, with Ferreyra first alerting the Tyneside club while playing for Velez Sarsfield in his native league, scoring 16 goals in only 22 league starts in the 2012-13 season. Shakhtar then paid £7.5m for the striker but he featured rarely, netting six goals from five league starts. Ferreyra has yet to make a senior appearance at international level, having previously played for the Argentina Under 20 side.

"The mother of Jack Sykes posted this harrowing photo of him in hospital on her Facebook page after he died of injuries caused by a house fire which killed his father, Darren, and brother, Paul . A father ‘murdered’ his two sons by luring them into an attic playroom and setting the house on fire, it was claimed yesterday. Darren Sykes – who also died in the blaze – tricked Jack, 12, and Paul, nine, into believing they could play on a new train set he had bought for them. He started a fire using fuel downstairs, went into the attic room and closed the hatch as the fire began to rip through the building, said his ex-wife. In a traumatic account, 42-year-old Claire Sykes said her children were caught ‘like rats in a trap’ by their cruel father. The elder boy managed to get out of the loft room only to suffer terrible burns below, according to his family. All three were rescued by firemen wearing breathing apparatus after neighbours realised the house was in flames. But the 44-year-old father and his younger son were pronounced dead when they arrived at hospital. Jack clung to life in intensive care for five days with his mother at his bedside. He died on Monday. Yesterday Mrs Sykes spoke of how her ex-husband ‘murdered’ their sons over the bitter family split. She said: ‘He was adamant I wouldn’t get anything following the divorce and this was his way of making sure of that. ‘I want people to know they were murdered by their father. I can just see them running hell for leather up those stairs. They had no chance. 'Darren had been texting them all day about these new trains he had, and they seemed quite excited that he was showing an interest. ‘They must have shot straight into the attic not knowing what he had planned. He has set it up as a playroom for them and as soon as they were in he shut the hatch. Devastated Claire Sykes has posted a series of heartbreaking messages on Facebook, accusing her former partner of murdering their sons and encouraging parents to cherish every moment with their children . The fire, which was started deliberately, killed Mr Sykes (centre) and his nine-year-old son Paul (left). His other son Jack (right) died yesterday after fighting for his life in hospital . ‘They were like rats in a trap and fell for his cold, calculated plan.’ She has also described how she treasures a pair of blankets that belonged to her two boys. She told the Daily Mirror: 'They used to come down in the morning wrapped in them. 'I can't take them off because I can still smell them.' Mrs Sykes described her ex, a carpet estimator, as ‘violent and controlling’. She left the family home in Penistone, South Yorkshire, earlier this year and they later divorced. The father, who had been given just five hours a week of access to his sons, picked the boys up from their grandmother’s house, where they were living, at 6.10pm last Wednesday. Only 20 minutes later his house was on fire, with the ‘terrified’ boys inside. Mrs Sykes, a buildings administrator, said: ‘He’s taken away the only two things I really wanted. It was his final way of taking control and getting his own way. The boys' mother said they both died in her arms and 'their hearts will stay with me forever' She made the comments in a series of heart-rending posts on the 'Pray for Jack' Facebook page . ‘If it hadn’t have been last week, it would have been a birthday or Christmas. He would have got what he wanted in the end.’ Mrs Sykes gave an emotional account of her elder son’s final hours. After suffering 50 per cent burns he battled for life at Manchester Royal Infirmary. She said: ‘I held him in my arms before he died. I told him how much I loved him and he looked at me and then I saw the light go out of his eyes. At least I got to say that to him.’ She described Jack as a ‘talented musician’ and Paul as a ‘cheeky chappy who would help anybody’. Mrs Sykes urged other parents to ‘cherish every moment they have as a family,’ adding: ‘You never know what’s around the corner.’ Police and fire investigators said evidence pointed to the fire being started deliberately and they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the tragedy. An inquest will be held at a later date.","Darren Sykes tricked sons into believing they could play with the new toy .

"Any boyfriend intending to propose to his better half would be thrilled if he could preserve the moment forever with a secretly taken photograph - as long as she says 'yes' of course. But one loved-up man went to extreme lengths to ensure he would have a permanent record of that life-changing moment - by hiding a photographer in a nearby bin. Adam Puckrin popped the question to his girlfriend Bailey Carson at the Peterborough Zoo in Ontario, Canada, on Saturday morning. He wanted to capture the moment but, to maintain the surprise, he had to hide his snapper. Pop the question: Adam Puckrin gets down on one knee to girlfriend Bailey Carson .

Mr Faulkner said: 'There weren't too many places to hide so I jumped in the bin. 'I'm a relatively small guy so it wasn't too bad a fit. 'Adam got Bailey to walk down towards the lake, where I was already hiding ready to take photos.

Diamond idea: Miss Carson shows off her engagement ring after the unusual proposal . 'A few romantic words later, Adam proposed, and Bailey said yes! 'All of a sudden she spotted me and couldn't stop laughing.' Mr Faulkner is a wedding and engagement photographer and arranged with Mr Puckrin to plan a fake date at the zoo. Once the happy couple got to the side of the lake, Mr Puckrin lowered down on to one knee and popped the question. As the couple celebrated, Miss Carson spotted Mr Faulkner cowering in the bin with his woolly hat on to ward off the cold. Fortunately, she found it funny and started taking her own pictures to capture the happy moment.

"Dale Cregan was so calm and collected the day that he murdered two police officers that he even shared a joke with a 999 call handler. The 30-year-old gave a false name to report a concrete slab being thrown through a window at his home in Hattersley, Greater Manchester. He then detailed exactly where the perpetrators had fled to with precise details, answering questions in a chillingly cool manner, adding at the end of the conversation 'I'll be waiting'. But all along it was part of his plan to kill police. The unfortunate officers who answered the call for help were Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32. Scroll down for audio . Home: Forensic officers last September at the scene close to where police constables Fiona Bone, 32, and Nicola Hughes, 23, where shot dead by Dale Cregan in Hattersley, Greater Manchester . Evidence: A Glock handgun (right) found at the scene of the murders committed by Dale Cregan (left), 30 . After the call - in which the operator . exchanged a joke with him about his cough - he opened the front door as . they walked up the front garden path and shot the officers in the chest with a . Glock handgun. Cregan shot Pc Nicola Hughes eight times, including three strikes to the head as she lay on the ground. Pc Fiona Bone was hit up to eight times after she managed to draw and fire her Taser. Cregan discharged 32 bullets in total in barely half a minute. He then left his ‘calling card’ of a military grenade which he threw it onto the path where the two officers lay. The killer then dropped his gun and drove a short distance to Hyde police station where he calmly walked up to the counter clerk and said: ‘I'm wanted by the police and I've just done two coppers.’ Cregan put his arms out to be handcuffed and said he was there to hand himself in. He then told an officer: ‘I dropped the gun at the scene and I've murdered two police officers. You were hounding my family so I took it out on yous.’ Killings: Cregan shot Pc Nicola Hughes (left) eight times, including three strikes to the head as she lay on the ground.

He then left his 'calling card' of a military grenade which he threw it onto the path where the two officers lay . Cregan is set to die in prison with a whole life sentence for murdering four people in Greater Manchester after his long-running trial came to an end. Cregan had pleaded guilty earlier in the trial to killing policewomen Nicola Hughes, 23, and Fiona Bone, 32, and father and son David Short, 46, and Mark Short, 23. He also admitted the attempted murders of three others and causing an explosion with a hand-grenade. A jury at Preston Crown Court found him not guilty of one remaining count of attempted murder involving a grenade attack on Sharon Hark, which he denied. Cregan went on the run days before he killed David Short last August after he gunned down his son, Mark, in a pub in Droylsden, Greater Manchester, three months earlier. Here is the transcript of the phone call Cregan had with a 999 police emergency operator: . OPERATOR: Police emergency . DALE CREEGAN: Someone's just thrown a big concrete slab through my back window of my house . O: Of the house, of a car, what are we talking? DC: No, sorry, in my back window in my house . O: In the house. What’s the address there, please? DC: 30 Abbey Gardens, Mottram . O: Did you see them? 'There's like a field out the back, and I've seen them running over the field. I can point it out to the officer' Dale Cregan on where the 'male who threw the concrete slab' ran . DC: Seen one, yeah . O: Do you know of them? DC: No, I don't know them . O: OK, do you know why they've done it? DC: Haven't got a clue . O: The rear window, did you say? DC: Yeah, it's in the back garden . O: Were you in the room where it came through or did you hear the bang? DC: No, I was upstairs, I looked out the window and seen one boy running off . O: Is it the kitchen window it's gone through? DC: Yeah, kitchen. O: So it's just happened, prior to you ringing, has it? DC: Yeah . O: And it's a piece of concrete, yeah? DC: Yeah, it's a piece of concrete, corner of a paving stone . O: So it's a piece of concrete paving stone, yeah? DC: Yeah . O: So you saw one person running off, yeah? DC: Yeah . O: Which way did they run, what direction? DC: There's like a field out the back, and I've seen them running over the field. I can point it out to the officer . O: What road is the field on, is it off Abbey Gardens? DC: Yeah, kind of, yeah . O: Not on the other side of Ashworth Lane? DC: Yeah . O: So they've gone towards Broadbottom Road across the field? DC: No, yeah kind of, yeah. It's weird where it is, because there's like all the gardens and then a bit of a field that you can see out of the window, and that's where I've seen him . O: Is it in the direction of Mottram Church or the other way? DC: The other way . O: So they've gone onto the estate further towards John Kennedy Road? DC: Yeah, that's it . O: OK, was he a white male? DC: He had a hood up mate, so I couldn't really tell you . 'How long would it take, do you know roughly? I know that it's not that serious' Dale Cregan asks the operator how long it would take for the police to arrive . O: It was a male though? DC: Yeah, it was a male . O: Do you know how old he was? DC: No, but he was about my size, about 5ft 9in, medium build . O: What was he wearing then? DC: Black coat with a hood up, grey tracksuit bottoms . O: You didn't recognise him, no? DC: No . O: And you've no idea why it might have happened? DC: Off the top of my head no, I’ve been trying to wrack my brains now to see if I’ve p***** anyone off, but I don’t think so, no . O: Was he carrying anything this lad, other than obviously the piece of stone that he lobbed? DC: It didn't look like it mate . O: And you didn't see anyone else, no? DC: No . O: Your name please? DC: Adam . O: What's your second name, Adam? DC: Gartree . O: Sorry, spell that for me? DC: G, a, r, t, r, e, e . O: Sorry, just give me that again - g, r . DC: G, a, r, t, r, e, e . O: E, r, e, e? 'Alright then, thanks very much. I'll wait here, I'll be waiting' Dale Cregan . DC: No, t, r, e, e - Gartree . O: Ah, Gartree, I thought it didn't look right. And you live at 30 do you, Adam? DC: Yeah . O: And you think it's an act of damage as opposed to someone trying to break into the house, do you? DC: Possibly yeah, but I'm thinking, because if you look through the back window - I'm decorating at the minute so there's no curtains up - if you look through the back window you can see my plasma, so I’m wondering... O: Where they broke the window, is it near a handle or anything to open another window? DC: It's quite a big window actually, so they would have had no problem getting through . O: Climbing through, OK. DC: (coughing) Excuse me (coughing) O: You sound as bad as I do (laughing). Right, I'll get an officer up there, have a look around, see if they can see anybody similar and then they'll come and see you, alright Adam? DC: How long would it take, do you know roughly? I know that it's not that serious . O: Well, because it's just happened, it's gone in on the priority, so that's within the hour certainly, but they'll try and get up there as soon as if there's a possibility he's still knocking about . DC: Alright then, thanks very much. I'll wait here, I'll be waiting . O: Alright Adam . O: Bye . DC: Bye bye .","Dale Cregan lured two unarmed constables to his home with bogus 999 call .

"Art lover: Actor Federico Castelluccio, best known for his role as a hitman on The Sopranos, has come upon a long-lost Italian masterpiece . Actor Federico Castelluccio, best known for his role as a hitman on The Sopranos, has come upon a long-lost Italian masterpiece while looking to expand his art collection. Few people know that besides being a thespian, Castelluccio, 50, is also a connoisseur of Baroque European art and a gifted realist painter in his own right. A few years ago, The Sopranos star discovered a canvass at an art dealer in Frankfurt, Germany, mistakenly labelled as an 18th century religious painting of Saint Sebastian by an unknown Italian artist. Castelluccio, a native of Naples, bought the painting at an auction and hired art experts who attributed the work to the Baroque master Guercino, painted sometime between 1632 and 1634. The painting, rendered in somber hues and featuring striking chiaroscuro - an effect of contrasted light and shadow - depicts a traditional image of early Christian martyr Saint Sebastian tied to a tree and pierced with arrows. The complex process of authentication involved infrared reflectology, chemical testing of the pigment used by the famed Bolognese artist and X-rays, reported the New York Post. Castelluccio spent several years - and an estimated $140,000 - meticulously restoring the artwork, which could be worth millions of dollars at an auction. The Guercino will now go on display for the first time in more than three centuries as part of an exhibit hosted by the Cosso Foundation and the Miradolo Castle in Turin, Italy, beginning October 4. The actor is also planning to write a book about his priceless acquisition that had been languishing in Frankfurt until he came along. Scroll down for video . Luck be a lady: Castelluccio, pictured second right in a scene from The Sopranos, found a 17th-century painting of Saint Sebastian by Guercino . Goodfella: The Italian-born actor played Furio Giunta, a Sicilian gun-for-hire working for Tony Soprano, as portrayed by James Gandolfini (left) The book, which is currently at proposal stage, will also tell the story of how Castelluccio, who emigrated from Italy in 1968 with his family, developed a passion for art growing up in Paterson, New Jersey. Catelluccio graduated from the School of Visual Arts in New York City with a bachelor's degree in painting and visual arts. He began his career as an actor in the 1980s, but his big break came in 1991 when he appeared in Diary of a Hitman. His other credits include Made starring Jon Favreau and the more recent A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints opposite Robert Downy Jr. Hidden talents: Few people know that the actor is also a painter and a serious art collector. The 50-year-old spent several years and an estimated $140,000 restoring the 350-year-old Baroque artwork . From 2000-2002, Castelluccio appeared on the highly acclaimed HBO series The Sopranos playing Furio Giunta, a Sicilian gun-for-hire working for Tony Soprano, portrayed by James Gandolfini. Since then he has appeared in several of shorts, and he is currently attached to four new projects in pre- and post-production. Frederico Castelluccio also has made a name for himself as a serious artist who has exhibited his works, influenced by Renaissance and Baroque masters, in galleries from New York City to New Mexico.","Federico Castelluccio, 50, best known for his role as hitman Furio Giunta on The Sopranos, is also a painter and serious art collector .

"A Canadian jihadist once thought to be dead has re-emerged to declare that ISIS is prepared to attack the United States at any moment. Farah Mohamed Shirdon, a 21-year-old former movie theater employee from Calgary, told Vice News last week that 'a lot of brothers are mobilizing there right now in the West, thanks to Allah.' Shirdon, who was declared dead in widespread news reports in August, said the ultimate goal of the militant Islamic group is to fly the black ISIS flag above the White House. Scroll down for video . Iraqi calling: Canadian-Somali Farah Mohamed Shirdon left his home country for Iraq, where the 21-year-old is fighting alongside ISIS terrorists. He says a strike on American soil is imminent .

Vice conducted the interview September 23 via the internet after tracking the terrorist down through social media. 'I know so many people, thousands upon thousands upon thousands, that are living in the West that are ready right now to make an operation in your land,' he said from Iraq. Shirdon, one of many Somali-Canadians believed to have traveled to the Middle East to fight for ISIS, is seen in one YouTube video burning his passport along with other foreign fighters.

'This is a message to Canada and all the American tyrants,' Shirdon said in an April video. 'We are coming and we will destroy you, with permission from Allah the almighty.' In the interview, Shirdon makes clear that it's his beliefs--not the influence of other men--that led him to fight alongside ISIS. 'No one recruited me,' he told Vice. 'All I did, I opened the newspaper, I read the Koran. Very easy.' Shirdon said he was interviewed by Canadian authorities just days before he was able to slip out of the country. 'All their intelligence workers are imbeciles,' he said. Shirdon's interview came as the U.S. and its allies ramped up aerial assaults on Syria cities occupied by ISIS. Shirdon said he's under assault 'day and night,' notes the National Post. 'You attack one of us, we will attack one of you,' he said.

"Law enforcement officials tracking the survivalist charged with ambushing a rural Pennsylvania State Police barracks said Friday that they have found caches of food and other supplies and believe he'll likely start breaking into cabins or searching through trash bins to sustain himself. Police found a campsite recently used by 31-year-old Eric Frein and found tuna fish, ramen noodles and other food and clothing as well as 90 rounds from a rifle of the same type used in the deadly Sept. 12 ambush, Lt. Col. George Bivens said. Police previously said they found two pipe bombs belonging to Frein at the same campsite. 'Because we continue to push Frein, and to seize the items he needs to survive, we believe he will be forced to search for food and shelters in other locations,' said Bivens, who gave an update on the manhunt three weeks after the shooting that killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounded Trooper Alex Douglass. Hundreds of law enforcement officials have been searching for Frein in the woods around his parent's home in Canadensis. Police have spoken with Frein's family about making a public appeal for his surrender, but no decision has been made, Bivens said. DNA testing, meanwhile, was inconclusive on soiled diapers thought to have been left by Frein, the FBI said Friday. Scroll down for video . Wanted: Frein is accused of killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and seriously wounding Trooper Alex Douglass three weeks ago . Campsite: This recent photo and released by Pennsylvania State Police on Friday shows a campsite near Canadensis, Pa., that officials say was used by suspected killer Eric Frein . Search: Members of the Scranton, Pa., Police Special Operations Group, search the woods Thursday looking for Frein . The diapers had been exposed to the elements, so 'you can't say one way or the other' whether Frein wore them, Edward Hanko, special agent in charge of the Philadelphia FBI office, said in a phone interview. State police announced last week they had discovered diapers in the northeastern Pennsylvania woods where Frein is believed to be hiding, and that he might have worn them so he could remain stationary for long periods of time. The diapers might have belonged to Frein, but the testing didn't confirm it or rule it out, Hanko said. Bivens said the diapers are still considered evidence in the case. He declined further comment. The manhunt is concentrated on a heavily forested area in the Pocono Mountains. Authorities believe they have spotted Frein from a distance, but the rough terrain made it impossible to get to him. The last sighting deemed highly credible came earlier in the week, Bivens said. Frein has been described as an anti-law enforcement survivalist and expert marksman at home in the woods. He's considered armed and dangerous. Even as the manhunt wrapped up its third full week, police said they remain confident Frein will be caught. 'It's just a matter of time for him,' said Trooper Ryan Lawrence, who spent five days in the search zone. 'The commissioner down to every road trooper has the same resolve.' Investigation: Authorities believe they have spotted Frein from a distance, but the rough terrain made it impossible to get to him . Frein has been described as an anti-law enforcement survivalist and expert marksman at home in the woods. He's considered armed and dangerous . Have you seen this man? A wanted poster of suspected killer Eric Frein is posted at an entrance to a trail in the woods on Thursday in Barrett Township near Canadensis, Pennyslvania . Lawrence, who worked a 12-hour overnight shift on road and perimeter patrol, said the possibility that Frein was lurking somewhere nearby was never far from his mind. 'You definitely have to stay within a tactical mindset, just so you're not opening yourself up for a possible attack, at least limiting the possibility of making yourself a target,' Lawrence said Friday. The trooper would keep himself out of the glare cast by his car's headlights, for instance, giving him the ability to observe but not easily be observed. Lawrence lives in Lancaster, about 100 miles from the search area. Troopers throughout Pennsylvania are signing up to search for Frein, he said. 'The driving force is obviously for the family of Cpl. Bryon Dickson. It's a commonly spoken thing while there, you are doing it for him and his family,' Lawrence said. 'There's a wife and two sons who aren't able to have their state trooper come home, and that's a driving force for a lot of our guys up there.' Pennsylvania state police have been joined by law enforcement officials from New York and New Jersey state police, the FBI, the U.S. Marshals Service and other federal agencies. The FBI alone has 140 to nearly 200 of its staff in the field each day, Hanko said, including agents, analysts, technicians, three full SWAT teams and members of a hostage rescue team. Frein is not living off the land, Hanko said, but surviving on supplies he brought with him into the woods. 'He'll be located,' Hanko said. 'All our intel, and all of our analysis, and the sightings, and the items we've recovered that have been recently used tell us he's there.'","Police reportedly found a campsite recently used by 31-year-old Eric Frein and found tuna fish, ramen noodles and other food and clothing as well .

"The FA’s International Committee, who used to hire and fire England managers, are now marginalised to such an extent that they don’t even stay in the same hotel as the team on away trips. Much to the upset of the blazers who travelled to Scotland for Tuesday’s friendly, the FA booked them into the Radisson Blu hotel in Glasgow, while manager Roy Hodgson and his backroom staff, plus the players, had rooms at the Hilton some distance away. The blazers want and expect the new separate-hotel policy to be short-lived, but it looks likely to outlast the increasingly irrelevant International Committee. The two-hotel idea stemmed from a post-World Cup presentation given by performance chief Dave Reddin who, together with technical director designate Dan Ashworth, seemingly calls most of the shots on England matters off the field. England manager Roy Hodgson felt that there were too many people mingling with his team on matchdays . Reddin told the FA board that he believed the 80-strong World Cup entourage was far too big and Hodgson felt there were too many people mingling with his players in the hotel at meal-times and on match days — leading to the changes. Meanwhile, Leicester head of football operations Andrew Neville has replaced Sunderland chief Margaret Byrne on the dysfunctional International Committee. Byrne has never been seen anywhere near a senior England match, raising the question why a busy football club executive such as her was ever put on a glad-handing committee in the first place. Former FA chairman David Bernstein’s suggestion that England should boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia, in protest at FIFA’s running of the game, has understandably being given short shrift at Wembley. The FA inside view is that Bernstein would never have recommended such drastic action while in office, where he was very much a consensus-led figure. Former FA chief David Bernstein called for England to boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia . Twickenham’s rampant commercialism saw the QBE sponsors’ logo behind the posts painted on the grass just half a metre from the try line, causing confusion to referee Nigel Owens in the England v All Blacks match. It has now been moved back all of another half-metre. Meanwhile, a £1 deposit on beer glasses has led to kids rummaging in rubbish bins around the concourse in the hope of making a quick buck, but the eco-friendly RFU counter that there has been a 40 per cent drop in wastage. QBE logos painted in the end zone at Twickenham for Autumn internationals caused confusion for officials . The final casualty of England’s World Cup debacle in Brazil looks to be an executive with team sponsors Vauxhall, who were part of the top-heavy travelling circus. Chris Hornbuckle was given his marching orders by the popular FA partners. RFU losing Beeb battle . Even the intervention of RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie doesn’t look like preventing BBC 5 Live from downgrading the autumn international series, despite radio offering the only live coverage of games on the Beeb. Such is the power of football that England v Australia — the struggling home team’s last Test against a southern-hemisphere side before the World Cup — is due to be relegated to 5 Live Sports Extra because it clashes with run-of-the-mill Premier League matches. Ritchie was asked to help by rugby factions within the Beeb, concerned at the way such a showcase occasion was being treated. A BBC spokeswoman said rugby would receive more airtime on Sports Extra but a final scheduling decision would be made next week. The Ofcom investigation into the Premier League’s selling of football rights is not expected to affect the tender for the next three-year deal starting in the first quarter of 2015. But the Ofcom probe is confusing to say the least — acting on Virgin Media’s complaint that the current 41 per cent of matches sold to TV leads to higher subscription costs, while also looking to preserve the 3pm Saturday kick-off fixtures from where extra TV matches would have to be drawn.

"By the look of this Test, both sides are going to have to unearth a formula from somewhere that allows them to take 20 wickets. England came close, and I think they’ll take more out of the match than India. But on this kind of surface, and with the balance both teams have gone for, stalemate was always the likeliest outcome. Cricket deserves a better surface than this. More than grass, England would have craved pace and carry, both because it allows batsmen to play their shots and because the nicks carry to the slips. Scroll down for video... Even Stevens: England and India settled for a draw in the first Test at Trent Bridge . Bowled over: England captain Alastair Cook (C) celebrates taking a rare wicket . It can only be a reflection of how perilous some counties’ finances must be if they’re so desperate to ensure a fifth day that they come up with something like this. And when both sides are packing their teams with batsmen, you’re struggling to look beyond a draw. Those were the tactics I expected from India. They lost here 4-0 three years ago and they haven’t won an away Test since 2011. Duncan Fletcher always liked to fill his England side with batsmen and he wanted to make sure India weren’t going to Lord’s 1-0 down. Saving grace: Stuart Binny's runs got India out of trouble at Trent Bridge . But India may have got their selection wrong. Even though Stuart Binny scored some runs to get them out of trouble on Sunday, they may have looked at the history of Trent Bridge and picked a side in expectation of some swing. Yet the pitch was more suited to a second spinner and Ravichandran Ashwin might have been a more logical option. I don’t think Lord’s will spin big, so India will need something better from Mohammed Shami if they’re going to take 20 wickets — especially if Ben Stokes is batting as low as No 8. Equally, England will have to find a way to knock over India more quickly. Papering over the cracks: Joe Root and James Anderson's late stand masked England's deficiencies . When Liam Plunkett bowled MS Dhoni, they had a sniff, but after that it was pretty slow going.  Overall, I thought they bowled pretty well, apart from operating with too many 7-2 off-side fields in India’s first innings — I felt they should have bowled straighter. Alastair Cook’s captaincy was fine, if a little reactive in the second innings. But they must find a way to stop these batting collapses. The last-wicket stand between Joe Root and Jimmy Anderson was very enjoyable, but it masked the fact that, on the plumbest of pitches, England had lost six wickets from a position of strength.","England drew the first Test in the series against India at Trent Bridge .

"A Las Vegas magician is going out of his way to help one very deserving man in need. Rob Anderson filmed a video earlier this month where he approached homeless veteran Alan McCracken, shockingly tearing up the man's sign asking for help, but then somehow producing wads of cash for the man, a U.S. Army veteran who served for six years before an honorable discharge. And now, he wants to do more. Scroll down for video . For my next trick: Rob Anderon (right) has started a campaign to raise money for homeless veteran Alan McCracken (left) Good man in need: Anderson hopes to raise $15,000 to get McCracken a hotel room for three months so he can work on finding a job . Anderson, after seeing how positive McCracken was, has started a campaign to raise $15,000 so he can get the vet off the streets and into a hotel for three months. The money will also cover new clothes, living expenses, and setting up a bank account for McCracken. 'Alan is just as kind in person as he appears in the video,' Anderson says on his GoFundMe page. 'He can often be seen in downtown Las Vegas with a large sign that says SMILE, just trying to bring a smile to strangers' faces, even if they don't give him any money. If there's anyone who would be deserving of assistance to get back on their feet, it is Alan McCracken.' Already, Anderson has almost reached his goal, and there is more good news as McCracken has found a place to stay in the interim. 'Alan has been able to get assistance in temporarily getting off the streets through the VA here in Las Vegas,' Anderson announced earlier today. 'He is currently sleeping on a bunk bed in a room with 3 other veterans, and has his meals and other basic necessities provided by the VA. When I spoke with him, he had his usual positive attitude about his situation, and is optimistic about his search for a job now that he has temporary housing provided for him.' McCracken still has no idea about the fundraiser, and Anderson plans to surprise him with the news when he reaches his goal.

"Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered a review into claims police are misusing controversial anti-terror powers to uncover journalists’ sources . Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered a review into claims police are misusing controversial anti-terror powers to uncover journalists’ sources. Home Office officials will examine how the powers are being used amid widespread concerns officers are bypassing legal protections designed to safeguard whistle-blowers. The surveillance watchdog also launched an inquiry yesterday. Sir Paul Kennedy, Interception of Communications Commissioner, is to require all police forces to reveal the extent of their use of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (Ripa) against journalists. Sir Paul said he shared the concerns about protecting sources. The Home Office will look at police use of Ripa in relation to journalists as part of a wider review of the powers available under the Act to the police and Security Services which was announced earlier this year. Since then, two police forces have been found using the powers to obtain journalists’ phone records and work out who they were speaking to. A Home Office source said last night: ‘The last thing we want is for Ripa to be used to circumvent laws protecting journalists’ sources or undermining journalistic methods and practices.’ Last month it emerged that the Metropolitan Police used Ripa powers to obtain telephone records from The Sun newspaper’s newsdesk and those of its political editor, Tom Newton Dunn as part of the Plebgate inquiry. The records were used to uncover who told the newspaper about claims Andrew Mitchell, the then chief whip, described officers as ‘plebs’ after they refused to allow him to cycle through the gates of Downing Street. Then, last week, it emerged police investigating the Chris Huhne speeding points scandal secretly obtained the phone records of journalist on the Mail on Sunday – the Daily Mail’s sister paper - and one of his sources for the story, even though a judge had agreed that the source could remain confidential. Kent Police also used Ripa to find out who spoke to David Dillon, the Mail on Sunday news editor working on the story, and his source, freelance journalist Andrew Alderson, who was given the story by Constance Briscoe. The former judge was arrested after police discovered she lied to officers by claiming she had not discussed the case with any reporters. The Guardian media commentator Roy Greenslade has likened officers’ actions in such cases to those of a ‘police state’. Ripa requires only that the request be approved by a police officer of Superintendent rank or above – effectively giving forces the right to sign off their own warrants. Scroll down for video . It is claimed officers used Ripa because other laws governing their investigations require officers to go before a judge to make the case for seizing journalistic material. Announcing his inquiry, Sir Paul said: ‘I fully understand and share the concerns raised about the protection of journalistic sources so as to enable a free press.’ He has been deluged with more than 1,000 complaints since details of Scotland Yard’s actions in relation to The Sun became public. The 'RIPA' powers enable police forces and other public authorities to obtain telephone data without judicial approval and were used in the Plebgate affair involving former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell (above) Scotland Yard used snooping powers – contained in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers act – to obtain a Sun journalist Tom Newton Dunn's phone records to uncover a whistleblower in the Plebgate affair . He said his office would report all findings to the Prime Minister, and publicly, to develop ‘clarity in relation to the scope and compliance of this activity’. The Sun made an official complaint about the Met’s actions, and has called for a public hearing at the Investigatory PowersTribunal into the way the Met accessed its journalists’ records. The newspaper’s managing editor Stig Abell said the use of Ripa posed a ‘really serious risk to the freedom of the press’. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: ‘If you are going to seek to access information about journalists’ sources you should be doing it in front of a judge, where the publisher or the broadcaster or the journalist themselves can make an argument and be aware of what is going on. ‘What we have learned over the last few weeks is that it is potentially the case that police forces across the country have the ability, through merely the permission of a superintendent, to access the phone records of journalists and thereby identify sources.’","Theresa May has ordered review into claims officers are misusing powers .

Subs not used: Alnwick. Goal: Perez (66). Geordie Gary Madine was playing for Wednesday, and he blazed the game's first real chance over the bar after 17 minutes. Madine was the home side's most dangerous player, forcing a brilliant reaction save from Newcastle goalkeeper Rob Elliot on the half-hour mark as Wednesday started the brighter of the two sides. The Geordie striker chipped on to the roof of the net before Sam Hutchinson smashed a long-range shot against the bar as Wednesday continued to pepper Newcastle's goal, but to no avail. Emmanuel Riviere, Alan Pardew's summer signing from Monaco, almost broke the deadlock after 24 minutes when his stinging shot grazed past the post. After the break the away side started the sharpest, with young Geordie striker Adam Armstrong firing a shot just wide of Chris Kirkland's goal.

Paceman Gabriel Obertan threaded through the young striker, who calmly slotted past Kirkland to give Newcastle the lead. Wednesday should have equalised with 12 minutes remaining but substitute Franck Betra smashed wide from six yards. But Newcastle held on to grab another victory.

"Unpacking their Waitrose delivery earlier this month, one family from South London found a rather unwelcome addition to their order: a lethal spider. The Brazilian Wandering Spider — the world’s most venomous species of arachnid — was nestling in a bunch of bananas and sparked a terrifying game of hide-and-seek before it was eventually captured by a pest control expert. While autumn is a time when spiders traditionally come into homes as temperatures fall outside, at least in Britain we’ve always been able to console ourselves with the fact they will be harmless. Scroll down for video . Scare: South London couple Lisa and Tim found a Brazilian Wandering Spider, right, in their bananas . But thanks to our growing desire to eat imported organic food, this may no longer be the case. Whereas in the past the animals would be killed off by chemicals used in the growing process, or cold temperatures, it is thought the trend for pesticide-free food — combined with unseasonably warm weather this summer and autumn — has been behind a recent acceleration in cases of Brazilian Wandering Spiders being found in our homes. Britain has already seen an increase in False Widow spiders (native species and those accidentally brought in with imported items), which also pack a painful bite, for the same reasons. Worryingly, no statistics are kept; the Government’s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said this week that responsibility lay with the retailers bringing in the deadly creatures with their produce. Yet sightings of the Brazilian Wandering Spider — whose scientific name is Phoneutria, Greek for ‘murderess’ — have exploded in recent years. In the past two months alone, there have been two incidents involving potentially lethal spiders. In both cases, egg sacs containing thousands of spiderlings were found. Caught: The Brazilian Wandering Spider, which arrived in a bunch of bananas that were part of a Waitrose delivery, sparked a terrifying game of hide-and-seek before it was eventually captured by a pest control expert . Families who suspect the species has invaded their home are encouraged to evacuate so it can be thoroughly fumigated. Worse still, the large arachnids — which can have a 6in legspan and are also known as banana spiders because of their penchant for nesting among the fruit — are extraordinarily aggressive. Jake Willers, the naturalist and television presenter, said this week: ‘Most spiders won’t jump out and attack you. They only tend to bite as a last resort, when they are cornered and threatened. But Brazilian Wandering Spiders can be extremely aggressive and they will bite you repeatedly, injecting more venom every time. ‘For about 10 per cent of the population, particularly the very young, the elderly and those who suffer allergies, there is a genuine risk of death from the venom.’ Guinness World Records lists the Brazilian Wandering Spider as the most toxic on earth. Its venom is 30 times more powerful than that of a rattlesnake, leading humans to suffer an irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, vomiting and eventual death. Despite an antidote being developed in the Nineties, there is currently no anti-venom stored in Britain. In homes, the Brazilian Wandering Spider will usually search for cover and dark places to lurk during daytime, favouring clothes, shoes, boxes and log piles. If disturbed, it rears up and attacks. This was the risk facing the family in South London with their Waitrose delivery. As the father put it: ‘Although people might think these things are funny, the spider could have killed me or my son if he’d gone to get a banana.’ Fortunately for them, the spider was caught by a pest control expert sent by Waitrose and its sac of hundreds of spiderlings was placed in the freezer to kill them. Not everyone is so lucky, however. Matthew Stevens, 32, was working as a chef in a Somerset pub when, while wiping down a surface, he felt a pricking sensation in his hand. He dropped the cloth and a large spider fell out. When he tried to move it, the spider bit him again. Thinking fast, he took a photograph of the arachnid with his mobile phone and a colleague drove Matthew to hospital. But with no major symptoms showing, he was sent home. Surge: Britain has already seen an increase in False Widow spiders (native species and those accidentally brought in with imported items), which also pack a painful bite. Above, file image of a False Widow spider . ‘Within ten minutes of getting home I was practically paralysed down one side, my hand swelled up like a balloon,’ he said. He promptly collapsed, with his heart beating so hard ‘I thought it was going to come out of my chest’. He was taken by ambulance to a different hospital where the image on his phone was sent to a specialist centre and identified as a Brazilian Wandering Spider. Matthew was put on a saline drip to clear the poison out of his system and gradually recovered. Had he been a young child, he might not have been so lucky. With the long list of incidents which have unfolded since his experience in 2005, many pest control experts believe it is only a matter of time before there is a tragedy. Poisoned: Matthew Stevens, 32, was working as a chef in a Somerset pub when he was bitten by a Brazilian Wandering Spider in 2005 . Last month Abby Woodgate, 30, of Essex, was told to incinerate her vacuum cleaner after using it to collect hundreds of Brazilian Wandering spiders which had fallen off a bunch of bananas. In March, Jamie Roberts, his wife and two young children were ordered to evacuate their Staffordshire home for the same reason, until it had been fumigated. Consi Taylor, 29, bought some Colombian Fairtrade bananas at Sainsbury’s in Hampton, South-West London, and had eaten about half when she spotted a white nest at the bottom of the fruit. As she bit into a banana the tiny black dots she assumed were bruises fell to the floor and scuttled away. Pest control experts identified Brazilian Wandering spiders and the house was evacuated. Supermarket staff are also in danger. Some Co-op and Tesco stores have had to close temporarily after these spiders were spotted. Tesco warehouse worker lan Harbidge, from Cardiff, spent almost a month in a coma after a suspected spider bite last year. He came home from work complaining of groin pains and discovered a rash. Soon his fingers swelled up ‘like sausages’ and he was taken to hospital, where he suffered kidney and liver failure. Yesterday, he told the Mail: ‘There has been no definitive answer to what caused it, but a spider bite is one of the most likely. ‘I didn’t handle any fresh produce in that warehouse but there were containers from all around the world. I don’t blame anyone for what happened. But this is a global market now and these things can happen.’ A spokesman for DEFRA said responsibility for dealing with imported venomous spiders lay with regional councils: ‘It should be reported to the local authority, who would get an environmental health officer to look at it, as this is related to food safety.’ But Matt Shardlow, chief executive of invertebrate protection charity Buglife, says: ‘People don’t need to worry about finding spider eggs on bananas. The spiderlings would have to be an awful lot bigger to pose any threat. ‘In their native environment, hardly any survive to adulthood; in Britain they’ve got no chance. It’s too dry for them to survive indoors and too cold outdoors. ‘Frankly there is no need for homes to be fumigated. That only happens because of the corporate need for supermarkets to be seen as taking action.’ There is also a trend for keeping spiders as pets, one of the most popular in this country being the Phoneutria Nigriventer, part of the Brazilian Wandering family. ‘That’s the most likely environment in which we’ll see someone bitten by one of these spiders,’ concedes Mr Shardlow. Whether this reassures arachnophobes is another matter.","The Brazilian Wandering Spider was found nestled in bunch of bananas .

"James Taylor has been made to sweat to earn his place in England’s faltering one-day side. On Sunday in Colombo, as he improvised his way to 90 in an innings that should guarantee him a World Cup place, the point was made literally. Six times Taylor was forced by unsparing 40-degree heat and 90 per cent humidity to change his drenched gloves. And on Monday morning his left forearm, which cramped up moments before he miscued Ajantha Mendis into the covers, sported a bruise unwittingly inflicted by the England physio as he tried to restore the limb to full working order. James Taylor shows he is feeling the heat after being dismissed for 90 in Colombo on Sunday . Taylor pulls the ball through mid-wicket during his impressive innings against Sri Lanka . Taylor, with bruises on his arms, poses for a picture before his press conference . It would be wrong to call the purple splodge a war wound. But Taylor’s arrival at a place where he can begin to think in terms of an international career has been something of a battle. ‘It has been a frustrating couple of years waiting for my chance,’ he said after what was only his third one-day international since his debut in Ireland in 2011. ‘It was nice to prove a point to a lot of people, but I knew I could do it. ‘I have scored plenty of runs in county cricket, but every time I have stepped out in the Lions shirt I scored runs against international attacks too, so I knew I could do it against international teams. ‘It was just actually stepping up and doing it on the big stage – which I managed to do.’ On a tour where so far only Moeen Ali, to a lesser extent Chris Woakes, and now indisputably Taylor have enhanced their one-day credentials, England are crying out for good-news stories. Some may be wondering why this one took so long to be told. Taylor’s average in List A one-day cricket now stands at 53 from 102 matches. Among batsmen to have played a minimum of 50 innings, that places him third on the all-time list – behind only Australia’s finisher extraordinaire Michael Bevan (57) and India’s Cheteshwar Pujara (54). He has also made 12 centuries and hit 56 sixes – not bad for a player mocked for his size in Kevin Pietersen’s autobiography. ‘I am pretty sure there have been a lot of small batsmen,’ he said. ‘Some of the greatest players have been small, and I am definitely not the smallest guy to play cricket. ‘As you saw yesterday, I can hit the ball over the ropes – and if you can do that then height doesn’t matter.’ The middle-order batsman launches a six down the ground off Ajantha Mendis . The six he launched off seamer Thisara Perera over midwicket from somewhere around off stump calmed his nerves after he had taken 29 balls to reach 11. And the one he hit later down the ground off the so-called mystery spin of Mendis confirmed it was no fluke. Just as pertinently, Taylor’s innings has left the one-day selectors with an unusual complaint: a nice headache. With Alastair Cook set to return for Wednesday’s fifth one-dayer at Pallekele following his one-match ban for slow over-rates, England must leave out a batsman. For now, though, Taylor is determined to turn Sunday’s innings into the start of something special. ‘I wanted to get a few more runs, but I showed people glimpses of what I can do,’ he said. A piece may just have been slotted into England’s World Cup jigsaw. Taylor acknowledges reaching his half-century in sweltering conditions .","James Taylor top scored with 90 in England's fourth ODI loss to Sri Lanka .

"The daughter of a murdered California porn mogul has been sentenced to two years in prison for credit card fraud and identity theft. Jasmine Mitchell learned her fate Wednesday at San Francisco federal court. The 34-year-old Mitchell was arrested in February outside a Tiburon hotel on suspicion of obtaining cash advances in someone else's name. Off to jail: Jasmine Mitchell, 34, pictured in past mugshots, was sentenced to 27 months in prison after pleading guilty to credit card fraud and identity theft charges . Dark family history: Jasmine's father Artie Mitchell (left) and her uncle Jim Mitchell (right) were pioneers in the production of pornographic films in San Francisco. But in late February 1991, Jim shot his brother to death . A search revealed that Ms Mitchell was in possession of numerous fake credit cards. Three months after her arrest, Jasmine Mitchell skipped bail and ran away with her boyfriend, sparking a nationwide manhunt, which culminated on May 2 when sheriff's deputies cornered her in San Pablo. Mitchell managed to slip away on that occasion by ramming a deputy's car with her Mercedes-Benz, but police tracked her down six days later in Tiburon, San Jose Mercury News reported. She was indicted on fraud charges in May and entered a guilty plea in August, setting the stage for her sentencing this week. The woman is the daughter of Bay Area porn magnate Artie Mitchell, who was fatally shot by his brother and business partner in 1991 during a fight. As part of her plea deal, Mitchell will spend 27 months behind bars, followed by three years' probation. The 34-year-old former porn heiress also must pay more than $1million in restitution to two banks, Citibank and CIBC. Evidence: A detective points out the equipment seized from San Pablo apartment of Jasmine Mitchell, including an embossing machine (left) and a card press (right) Jasmine Mitchell was the alleged ringleader of a major identity theft operation that claimed thousands of victims . A public defender assigned to Mitchell's case blamed her bad decision-making on her addiction to methamphetamine, which she has been struggling with since 2004. According to the lawyer, Mitchell has been taking part in drug treatment programs and is 'genuinely contrite.' 'Ms. Mitchell very much needed a wake-up call and this case has provided it,' public defender Brandon LeBlanc wrote in a sentencing memorandum. Jasmine Mitchell's uncle, Jim Mitchell, died in 2007 after serving a manslaughter sentence in connection to her father's shooting death. The brothers produced in 1972 one of the first feature-length X-rated films, Behind the Green Door, and co-owned a still popular San Francisco strip club, The O'Farrell Theater. Art imitating life: In 2000, real-life brothers Charles Sheen (left) and Emilio Estevez (right) starred in a made-for-TV movie based on the lives of the Mitchell brothers . Trailblazers: The film focused on the making of the Mitchells' groundbreaking X-rated feature film, Behind the Green Door, released in 1972 . In 2000, their story was dramatized in the movie Rated X starring real life brothers Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez. Jasmine Mitchell's cousin, Jim Mitchell's son James, is currently serving a 35-years-to-life sentence for killing the mother of his young daughter with a baseball bat in Novato in 2009.","Jasmine Mitchell, 34, was sentenced to 27 months behind bars, followed by three years' probation, and she must pay $1million in restitution .

"Clement Grenier has denied reports suggesting he missed a training session in an effort to force a move from Lyon, insisting he is happy to stay with the French side. Newcastle have been linked with a move for the France international midfielder, who has claimed he has a knock and is not seeking a move.

"Hatem Ben Arfa has been ‘humiliated’ by Newcastle United, according to his agent. The French forward has been made to train with the reserves this summer and did not join Alan Pardew’s squad on this month’s tour of New Zealand. Ben Arfa fell out with the United management team towards the end of last season and is not part of their plans entering the new campaign. Au revoir: Hatem Ben Arfa agent says the player feels 'humiliated' by his exile at Newcastle . He was fined on his return to training last month for allegedly being 1.5kg overweight, although he will appeal against that sanction. Ben Arfa has one year to run on his current deal and, while he would prefer a return to France with Lyon, he could also run down the remainder of his contract in the reserves. The 27-year-old’s representative, Michel Ouazine, said: ‘We don’t know what the problem is. Pardew in the past has said Hatem was extraordinary. Lonely: Ben Arfa has trained with Newcastle's reserves this summer after falling out with management . ‘Hatem has done everything for Newcastle, every effort has been made to discuss the problem. We are in a situation where there doesn’t seem to be a solution. ‘He is simply doing his job: he trains well, he enjoys training with the reserves where he has a great coach in Peter Beardsley.’ He went on: ‘It’s unfair and humiliating. We will challenge the fine. We asked Newcastle to give us the player’s physical records. ‘Hatem went on vacation with a personal trainer, he has worked to prepare for this season. That 1.5 kg? Yes, it is a pound of muscle and 500 grams of fat. ‘He lost 2 per cent body fat. We therefore challenge the fine.’ Ben Arfa could even play a waiting game and Ouazine says Pardew could well be gone before his player. ‘Hatem doesn’t have to leave,’ he told SoFoot.com. Happier times: Ben Arfa's (left) soured relationship with Alan Pardew (right) has seen him frozen out . ‘He can go on a free after his contract is over – six months, or a year, this is not a problem. Who knows how long Pardew will be at Newcastle. In two months, he may not be here. Hatem love this club, he is idolised by fans. ‘Hatem will remain professional and is working hard. He prefers a return to Lyon, but it is not economically feasible. Lyon is his first club, so there is a level of attachment. He loves Bernard Lacombe. ‘However, for me, it is very difficult financially – Newcastle want a lot of money for Hatem.’","Hatem Ben Arfa's agent says the player feels humiliated' by his treatment at Newcastle .

"Guilty plea: Labour MP Eric Joyce arrives at Westminster Magistrates Court yesterday . A Labour MP who head-butted fellow politicians in a House of Commons bar brawl was spared jail yesterday. Eric Joyce, 51, threw punches and 'nutted' two Conservatives after a late-night drinking session, snarling: 'There are too many ******* Tories in here.' Witnesses said the glazed eyes of the former Army major, who had to be restrained by eight police officers, made it 'look like nobody was home'. As the officers dragged him to the cells, Joyce yelled: 'You can't touch me, I am an MP.' Details of the extraordinary incident were revealed for the first time yesterday, as the Falkirk MP admitted carrying out the assault at Westminster Magistrates Court. Joyce now faces expulsion from the Labour Party, but vowed to continue serving as an independent. The brawl broke out in the Commons Strangers' Bar, which is reserved for MPs and their guests, at about 10.30pm on February 22. One of Joyce's friends, Stuart Niven – an amateur opera singer – started to sing loudly, provoking startled glances from a neighbouring table of Conservatives. Joyce, who had drunk a bottle of red wine, stood to warn Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke: 'Don't ever look at my guests in that way again'. When another Conservative MP, Andrew Percy, asked him to sit down, Joyce shoved him up against the wall, shouting: 'This bar is full of ******* Tories.' When Mr Shelbrooke said: 'You can't treat an MP like that in a place like this,' Joyce swung for the Tory, who ducked the blow. Joyce then punched Conservative councillor Luke Mackenzie, splitting his lip, before head-butting another, Ben Maney. Labour whip Phillip Wilson then put a hand on Joyce's shoulder and said: 'Calm down Eric – what's going on?' Joyce responded by punching him in the face. Police arrived to find Joyce smelling 'strongly of alcohol' with 'glazed' eyes. He continued his assault as the officers tried to restrain him, swearing at them before head-butting Tory MP Stuart Andrew, giving him a bloody nose and concussion. Andrew Percy (left) was shoved during the brawl in Strangers Bar while Alec Shelbrooke (right) was threatened and ducked out of the way of a punch . Joyce, described as drunker than one . witness 'had ever seen anyone', furiously kicked at doors as he was . dragged away by police, breaking a glass pane as he continued to abuse . officers. The MP even managed to snatch a . constable's notebook and scrawl: 'We are a Tory nation, that cannot be . forever …good cops unite…It's surely …to hate the Tories.' He claimed at . Belgravia police station that someone else had started the fight, . telling officers: 'I think he was a silly fat Tory MP. 'He was pushing . like a girl and giving me a bear-hug. I nutted a guy. It was a wee . scuffly thing…If people said I was hammered, that was probably true.' Jeremy Dein QC, defending, said his . client had little recollection of the events as he had not eaten all day . and had been 'working intently' since 8.30am. 'What accompanies his . apology is an overriding sense of shame and embarrassment,' he added. The court heard that the MP, who . recently split from his headmistress wife Rosemary, had a previous . conviction for refusing to give police a urine sample when he was . stopped in his car in 2010. Guilty plea: Tory MP Stuart Andrew (left) was headbutted by Eric Joyce (right) during the fight . Smashed window: The Strangers Bar was damaged during the fracas . Joyce, while sobering up in the cells, told police of one of his victims: 'I think he was a silly fat Tory MP. He was pushing like a girl and giving me a bearhug.' A barman had told officers there was a 'happy and friendly' atmosphere before Joyce 'flipped' on February 22. Prosecutor Ms Martin said: 'Mr Joyce started to sing very loudly... 'That was noticed by several people in the bar. Nobody seemed bothered by it.' Joyce then approached Tory MP Alec Shelbrooke, saying: 'Don't look at any of my guests like that again.' MP Andrew Percy walked past and asked Joyce to move. Joyce replied: 'No, you f****** can't', Ms Martin said. Witnesses said Joyce then shouted: 'There are too many Tories in this bar' and later: 'The bar was full of f****** Tories.' Mr Andrews protested, saying: 'You can't behave in that way' before Joyce launched into a string of attacks. Mr Riddle told Joyce: 'What you have done has not only brought physical harm (and) shame on yourself... But it has also damaged the place where you work, the place where laws are made.' He took into account Joyce's previous conviction for drink-driving but gave the defendant credit for his early pleas. Speaking afterwards, Joyce said he was 'deeply apologetic' for his actions. Outside court, he said: 'Clearly it's a matter of considerable personal shame. 'I've been duly punished today. I've been lucky to avoid prison. I'm very ashamed, of course.' He said he wanted to apologise to a 'long list' of people he had let down, including his constituents and fellow MPs. But he said he did not intend to stand down as an MP before the next election. 'It would be easy but I was elected in 2000 and I will continue serving,' he said. Asked if he thought he had a problem with alcohol, he said: 'I . think drink was an aggravating factor, that's something I have to deal . with personally. Not everyone who drinks gets involved in fights.' Labour Party sources indicated that any decision on Joyce's future in the party would not be made until after he was sentenced. Joyce's guilty plea does not necessarily mark an end to his career as an MP. Under the Representation of the People Act 1981, MPs are disqualified . from the House of Commons only if they are convicted of a criminal . offence and sentenced to 12 months or more in jail. Joyce has already said that he will stand down from Parliament at the next general election, expected in 2015. Chief magistrate Howard Riddle said . Joyce would have faced jail, with a maximum sentence of 26 weeks, had . the matter gone to trial. Giving credit for Joyce's early guilty . plea to four charges of common assault, he handed him a 12-month . community punishment instead. Joyce was also barred from all pubs . for three months, banned from travelling abroad unless on Parliamentary . business, and ordered to pay a £3,000 fine and £1,400 in compensation to . his victims. Joyce said outside court: 'Clearly . it's a matter of considerable personal shame. I've been duly punished . today. I've been lucky to avoid prison. I'm very ashamed, of course.' The MP was also given a curfew – the . start of which was delayed by 24 hours so he could honour a promise to . meet journalism students. In an interview with Sam Holden at the . University of Bedfordshire, Joyce said: 'Have I undermined my authority . by fighting in a bar punching people? I might have done.' MPs in the 'rowdy' Strangers Bar in the Commons.

"Ever since Madonna began wearing a piece of red string around her wrist  in the Nineties, Kabbalah - a mystical offshoot of Judaism - has attracted an impressive list of celebrity devotees. Actress Demi Moore and former husband Ashton Kutcher are Kabbalists, while there has been speculation that Gwyneth Paltrow's interest in Kabbalah hastened the end of her marriage to Chris Martin. And One Direction's Harry Styles is reported to be one of the most-recent A-list converts. Now the stars are set to have a new spiritual home. The Kabbalah Centre, a grand, Georgian building just moments from Oxford Circus in central London, has been given planning permission to double in size after witnessing a boom in the number of people turning to Kabbalah for spiritual guidance. Sanctuary: Plans for the expansion to the building in central London apparently show a new roof garden with glass panels, above . Light and airy: One of the rooms, as shown in this artist's impression, boasts a number of large sky lights and a curved, modern ceiling . Spiritual guidance: Gwyneth Paltrow and Madonna are among a number of A-listers who follow Kabbalah . View from above: Westminster Council has just granted the Centre planning permission to double the size of the central London site . But while it might be the rich and famous that transformed Kabbalah into a household name, it is the surging number of 'ordinary' devotees following in their footsteps that has prompted the expansion of its British base. Attendance at the Centre has reached a tipping point. More than 1,000 students - from City CEOs to teachers - now flock to join in a number of spiritual classes every week. The surge in demand prompted the expansion project, dubbed 'the Ark', to be undertaken. It has now received the go-ahead from Westminster Council. Digital imaging of the centre's expansion reveal that the roof will be transformed with a modern, glass-pannelled extension - with long grass planted outside ensuring the privacy of the A-list visitors. Though it is not clear what the new rooms will be used for, it appears that many have been designed as multi-function spaces that can be transformed depending on the occasion. There is a theme of lightness and brightness throughout - with large windows and glass panels inside creating the illusion of more space. Modern touch: The Centre, a grand, Georgian building just moments from Oxford Circus, will have an all-glass extension on the roof . Central location: The site, outlined in red, has been visited by a host of A-list celebrities - and a growing number of 'ordinary' devotees . Sleek finishes: In this digital image of what the Centre will look like, materials including glass, wood and mirrored surfaces are used . The spiritual mentor of the London Kabbalists is Marcus Weston, 41, a former investment banker who is now senior teacher and trustee at the Kabbalah Centre. Mr Weston grew apathetic toward City life, becoming increasingly frustrated until he had an epiphany on the way to work 16 years ago. He ended up taking a course under Rabbi Philip Berg, the founder of modern Kabbalah, and now devotes his life to teaching, proselytising and charitable works. He has since held talks about the religion at Buckingham Palace and the UN. Speaking earlier this year, he said that when he first got into Kabbalah, he would often be the only one in his class. Now, he said, the Centre has a footfall of about 1,000-a-week. Ambitious: Plans for the expansion, entitled 'The Ark', reveal that the central London location has a number of meeting rooms . Meeting point: A large multi-function hall, seen in blue, allows for large numbers of Kabbalists to gather . Accommodation: Floor plans for the expansion reveal that there will be self-contained living quarters included in the Centre . And while teachers and nurses are among those attending the central London centre, many of the devotees are well-known personalities in business, sports and politics. He stresses that Kabbalah is a spiritual wisdom, not a religious one, and some claim that this could explain why uptake is mushrooming. It is a practical system of ideas and insights designed to help individuals gain more from life that can sit alongside any religious faith, or alongside none. Students of Kabbalah learn to harness their full potential through various classes that over time, teaching them to feel more in control, realise the best version of themselves and reach a broader understanding of how life, business and relationships work, according to the website.","Celebrities including Madonna, Demi Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow turn to Kabbalah for spiritual guidance .

It came as it emerged 2 million people watched the Bellingham's final interview on Loose Women - double the show's usual audience. Scroll down for video . Prince Charles (pictured today at the launch of a report about the economic challenges facing over 50s) paid tribute to the work of actress Lynda Bellingham, who died this week after a long battle with cancer . Bellingham, best known for her long-running role as a mother in the Oxo TV adverts and as presenter on Loose Women, had been fighting colon cancer, which later spread to her lungs and liver, after being diagnosed in July last year. For two years she had been an ambassador for the Prince's Initiative for Mature Enterprise (Prime) which helps the over-50s start their own companies. The organisation is now part of Charles's charity Business In The Community. Charles reflected on her work at the launch of a report that found Britain must make better use of older workers, for the benefit of the country and their own financial well-being. He told delegates attending the launch seminar in central London: 'Before referring to the work of Prime, I did just want to pay, if I may, a special tribute to Lynda Bellingham, who was, as many of you know, a wonderful ambassador for Prime. 'Personally I was greatly saddened to learn that she had passed away this week. As you know, she was not only a marvellous actress but also someone who worked tirelessly for others. So she really will be hugely missed.' The Prince of Wales (pictured again today) said he was 'greatly saddened' by her death from cancer this week, praising her 'tireless' work for other people . Bellingham's final appearance on Loose Women, screened yesterday, was watched by 2million people, as she spoke to Janet Street Porter and Coleen Nolan about her illness . Bellingham's final appearance on ITV's Loose Women was screened yesterday, three days after her death. The programme recorded a peak audience of 2 million, a million more than usual, according to ratings figures. Viewers saw her describing her hopes for the Christmas she would never see. She assured her friends and colleagues that all would be 'fine' and said she longed to be remembered for her honesty. Bellingham died in the arms of her husband, Michael Pattemore, at the age of 66 after cancer spread from her colon to other parts of her body. She recorded her last interview earlier this month, saying she was 'obsessed' with Christmas and was determined to see one more. 'Bloody right I am! I am. I AM,' she insisted, during the interview with Janet Street Porter and Coleen Nolan in front of a studio audience, which included Mr Pattemore. Bellingham had been invited to attend today's event with Prince Charles some time ago but had declined due to her illness. Bellingham was an ambassador for the Prince of Wales' Prime campaign to encourage more older people into the workforce . The study, co-produced by Prime and the International Longevity Centre UK, claims a 'missing million' of ageing workers who have unwillingly left employment had the potential to offer invaluable skills and experience. It said up to 1.5 million people aged 50-69 had left work over the last eight years due to a combination of redundancy, ill health or forced early retirement and of these, 1.1 million people wanted a job. Older workers could be an important resource for the nation as the report predicts there could be a shortfall in the jobs market, with 13.5 million vacancies needing to be filled over the next 10 years and only seven million young people projected to leave school and college over the same period. Charles told delegates: 'For what it's worth, to me one key fact revealed by this research is that employing older people does not mean younger people are crowded out of the labour market. 'The number of jobs in the economy is not set. There is room to employ younger people and older people in a mix of skills and experience that creates better business. 'This research makes it clear that older workers are not a burden but a valuable asset.'","Prince of Wales hails Oxo mum actress for 'tireless work' for other people .

"Military finance officer Paul Ridgway stole £20,000 of travellers' cheques from the SAS camp where he worked and blew the cash on a lads' holiday to Las Vegas . An army staff sergeant who snatched £20,000 of travellers' cheques from the SAS base and used them to fund a lads' holiday to Las Vegas has been spared jail. Paul Ridgway was working as a military finance officer for the elite fighting force when he pocketed the currency notes from the camp. The 34-year-old and two friends used the cash to partially fund the trip to Las Vegas in April 2012 . Ridgway splashed £5,000 ($8,000) in just one night of the eight-day holiday after cashing in 77 of the stolen travellers' cheques. He was handed a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months after he admitted theft and converting or attempting to convert criminal property at Worcester Crown Court. The court heard Ridgway was on secondment with the finance office at the SAS Headquarters in Stirling Lines, Hereford, between December 2010 and May 2013 when he came across the bundle of cheques. Prosecutor Michael Conry said Ridgway took the bills home on December 27, 2010 before telling his friends about them. The court heard he gave cheques to four friends; Kevin Jinks, 36, Jamie Barber, 37, Andrew Morris, 32, and Garry Meir, 32. Jinks also used some of the cheques to clear his debts with a sixth defendant, Anthony McQuaid, 36. In April 2012 Ridgway, Morris and Meir went to Las Vegas on holiday. When Meir was quizzed by police he admitted he carried a 1cm thick wad of the cheques with him and cashed £500 worth. Morris cashed 129 cheques while Ridgway cashed in 77 cheques. Mark Connor, defending, said Ridgway had given the cheques out in a 'grave error of judgement.' He said when he returned to the UK he realised what he had done and put the cash in a bank account 'ready for the day he knew he would have to pay it back.' But Ridgway 'effectively buried his head in the sand' when he received a promotion and was posted to Colombia until he received an email from his superiors regarding the cheques. Mr Connor said: 'At that point he came clean straight away and told his commanding officer what had happened. Co-defendant Kevin Jinks, 36, was handed a nine month suspended prison sentence  after he used some of the stolen cheques to clear a debt. Pictured right stock image of the SAS badge . 'He was in a position of trust because of his employment. 'Mr Ridgway is described as an outstanding soldier. This was clearly completely out of character and he is genuinely remorseful.' The six defendants all admitted  theft and converting or attempting to convert criminal property at the hearing on Friday. On sentencing Ridgway Recorder Martin Jackson told him: “You are the origin of the offending that has led to the other five being in the dock with you. “The offence is serious enough to warrant imprisonment but if you are sent straight to custody your employer would be deprived of a contribution of a man who is well thought of.” As well as the suspended prison sentence Ridgway, who now works at St John Moore Barracks in Folkestone, Kent, was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay back £16,779. Paul Ridgway, who was a finance officer at the SAS Headquarters in Hereford, blew a massive £5,000 of the stolen cash in one night in Las Vegas . Jinks, of Worcester, was handed a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, ordered to carry out 180 hours of unpaid work and told to pay back £3,000. Barber, of Crewe, Cheshire, was given an electronic tag for four months and ordered to pay back £500. Morris, of Crewe, was handed a six-month prison sentence, suspended for 12 months and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Meir, of Crewe, was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay back £310. McQuaid, of Hereford, who was given some cheques by Jinks who owed him money, was ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid work and ordered to pay back £700. Ridgway did not comment outside court.","Paul Ridgway was working  in finance office for the elite military force .

"A toddler born with a rare defect has made a miraculous recovery after surgeons were forced to break open her skull and piece it back together like a jigsaw. Laurie Jones was born with craniosynostosis, a condition which causes the skull plates to fuse together in the womb. It caused Laurie to have a twisted head, with one side bulging. And as well as causing the deformity, the condition threatened to create fatal pressure on her developing brain. Laurie Jones was born with craniosynostosis, a condition which causes the skull plates to fuse together in the womb. It left the newborn with a twisted head, one side bulging and her parents were warned it could cause pressure on her developing brain . But after a nine-hour life-saving operation at Birmingham's Children's Hospital the now two-year-old is back at home with her parents Sadie Roberts and Steve Jones, and her sisters Hollie and Jess . But, after a nine-hour life-saving operation, which involved a full blood transfusion, Laurie, now two, is back home with her parents Sadie Roberts and Steve Jones, and her sisters Hollie and Jess. Her mother Ms Roberts, 38, said: 'Laurie really is our jigsaw baby. 'The front of her skull was taken off, broken into pieces and then put back together. 'She was cut from ear to ear across the top of her head - it was really difficult to see. 'She had a full head-bandage and her eyes were swollen - she was very poorly. 'We were told at any time it could put pressure on her brain. 'One doctor was concerned there was not enough room for her brain to grow and it could have ended with us losing her.' Craniosynostosis is a rare condition affecting affects one in 2,500 babies. It causes babies to develop an irregularly shaped skull. It caused Laurie's head to grow abnormally, and meant she didn't have an eyebrow on one side. After the live-saving surgery at Birmingham Children's Hospital, she is just like a normal two-year-old, but she may need further surgery on her eye in later life. Ms Roberts, 38, said: 'Laurie really is our jigsaw baby. The front of her skull was taken off, broken into pieces and then put back together. She was cut from ear to ear across the top of her head' Craniosynostosis is a rare condition affecting affects one in 2,500 babies. It causes babies to develop an irregularly shaped skull. Laurie has been left with a large 'jigsaw' scar stretching from ear to ear, right . She will have checks on her head for the next 10 years, but her mother Ms Roberts added: 'It will take two years for her head to completely enclose and be like a normal child's, so we will have to be careful with her' Craniosynostosis is a rare condition, which causes babies to develop an irregularly shaped skull. The abnormal shape of a child's head can cause persistent headaches, learning difficulties, problems with vision. Symptoms of craniosynostosis result from increased pressure in the skull, called intracranial pressure. The condition causes a baby's skull to prematurely fuse, leaving it unable to grow in certain areas. Where one area is fused the skull is prevented from growing. It causes other parts of the skull to 'overgrow' to compensate and limit the pressure devleoping around the brain. The lack of growth in some areas, and 'overgrowth' in others causes the irregular head shape. Saggital synostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis, accounting for around half of all cases. It occurs when the suture - the elastic tissues connecting the plates of bone in the skull - at the top of the head fuses. It leads to a lack of growth in width and compensatory growth in length, resulting in a long, narrow skull. Source: NHS Choices . Ms Roberts, from Richards Castle, Shropshire, said: 'Laurie is incredibly bright and mischievous as you'd expect a two-year-old to be, but it has been really hard. 'We always said if it was just for cosmetic reasons we wouldn't put ourselves through that, but if her condition compromised her future we'd have to go ahead. 'It's been really stressful on all of us, really. 'It will take two years for her head to completely enclose and be like a normal child's, so we will have to be careful with her.' Laurie will continue to have checks on her head for the next 10 years, but now she has recovered from her life-changing operation, the family have agreed to speak out to raise awareness of the condition. Ms Roberts said she is indebted to Cranio Ribbons, a support network of parents who have seen their children go through similar operations, who have a Facebook page. She said: 'I want to show other families going through the same thing there is light at the end of the tunnel, to show what it's like on the other side. 'The parents on there have been an absolute Godsend. 'You can go on there and vent any feelings you've got and there are people there who know exactly how you feel.' She said another Facebook group called Lucy's Head Start aimed to raise money for parents whose children need craniosynostosis operations.","Laurie Jones was born with craniosynostosis, which causes the skull plates to fuse together in the womb and can put pressure on the brain .

"While it is widely believed that caffeine will enhance concentration levels during exam preparation for students, over-consumption of the stimulant drug can have quite the opposite desired effect. Dr Brian Morton, the Chair of the Australian Medical Association Council of General Practice, says excess intake of caffeinated drinks can decline a student's academic performance and also cause severe health-related consequences. Serious cases include tremulous sensations, anxiety, heart palpitations and memory loss - all of which will interfere with the student's studies, the doctor said. Scroll down for video . Dr Brian Morton says it's dangerous for students to drink more than four cups of coffee or caffeinated drinks a day . Excess amounts of caffeine can cause headaches, lightheadedness, tremulousness sensations, anxiety and heart palpitations . It is widely believed that caffeine will enhance concentration levels during exam preparation for students . With more than 75,000 Higher School Certificate students preparing to sit their first English paper on Monday, and with university exams fast approaching, Dr Morton says caffeine consumption increases this time of year. But Dr Morton, who's been in the industry for more than 35 years, warns it is dangerous to drink more than four cups of coffee or caffeinated drinks a day. If four standard caffeinated drinks must be consumed, each of about 120ml, he recommends to split them between the morning and afternoon - ensuring the last is consumed before 4pm. 'Students should use their common sense when consuming caffeine,' Dr Morton told Daily Mail Australia. Australian Medical Association's Dr Brian Morton . 'Sensible doses should be taken which can help students to stay alert and concentrate.' Dr Morton stressed the importance of sleep, a recommended seven to eight hours, which will also help enhance a student's performance. 'But while caffeine is known as a mild stimulant but it can also cause disturb sleep,' he said. 'Sleep deprivation can be detrimental to exam preparation and dare I say more so than knowing the subject for an exam.' In severe cases of caffeine over-consumption, students put themselves at risk of serious health issues. 'The side-effects include headaches, lightheadedness, tremulous sensations in hands and body, anxiety, agitation and heart palpitations,' Dr Morton said. 'There can also be serious neurological effects including memory loss while caffeine toxicity can also cause seizures.' Consequently, the physical symptoms can distract the student's concentration level whilst sitting an exam. Dr Morton urges students to avoid taking other stimulants like No Doz as it could have serious effects on students . As for other stimulants such as No Doz, popular caffeine tablets, Dr Morton advises students against these particular drugs. 'There's no good reason to take these [No Doz] as it has different chemicals in it and can react in different ways,' he said. 'Individuals have different tolerance levels so it can have a dangerous effect which can include landing a student in hospital.'","Dr Brian Morton says it's dangerous for students to drink more than four cups of coffee or caffeinated drinks a day .

"Public Health England forecasts that 63 per cent of men in their fifties will be obese by 2034 (file picture) Two thirds of middle-aged men will be obese within 20 years if current trends continue, a new report predicts. Public Health England (PHE) forecasts that 63 per cent of men in their fifties will be obese by 2034, and 38 per cent of women of the same age will also be overweight. Its latest report, which gives a long-term projection into the lifestyle choices which affect the nation’s health, also predicts that one in three people will be obese by 2034. At present, 62 per cent of adults in Britain are overweight or obese. The number of children who are obese doubles from reception age to Year Six. According to the report, one in ten people will develop type two diabetes due to their weight within the next two decades if current trends continue. However, if obesity levels were reduced to what they were in 1993, more than five million cases of disease could be prevented, the body said. According to the report, the nation will be 35 per cent less active in 2030 than in 1961, putting people at increased risk of type two diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and other weight-related diseases. The report also states that alcohol-related deaths have doubled over the last 20 years and alcohol and obesity are now the leading causes of liver disease - the only major disease in the UK for which mortality is still increasing. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE said: ‘We have an ambition: for people of this country to live as well as possible, for as long as possible. ‘But on current trends, we are going to fall short because we face an epidemic of largely preventable long-term diseases. ‘We may be living longer, but we – and future generations – risk spending many of these extra years in poor health unless we do a better job of tackling major risks such as obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption.’ The report comes after PHE warned that the UK is now even worse than America for inactivity – with half of women and a third of men moving so little in their daily lives that they are exposing themselves to diseases earlier in life. Scroll down for video . If obesity levels continue to rise at the same rate, PHE predicts one in three will be obese by 2034 (file picture) Earlier this week, PHE confirmed that one in six deaths every year in Britain are directly due to inactivity. It equates to about 84,500 in England and Wales – a very similar number to the number of deaths attributed to smoking. It also said that 63 per cent of adults do not take the recommended amount of exercise of two and a half hours over the course of a week. This compares to 18 per cent in the Netherlands, 28 per cent in Germany, 33 per cent in France and 41 per cent in the U.S. Figures show the UK's average levels of exercise are a fifth lower than in the 1960s and the worst in the Western world.","63 per cent of men in their fifties will be obese by 2034, new report predicts .

"A council has been slammed for advising children how to take pills, snort cocaine and smoke cannabis in a controversial booklet. The leaflet, which targets pupils as young as 13, gives 'safety tips' on how to take illegal substances and was produced by Edinburgh council and the city's Drug and Alcohol Project. The booklet includes street names for drugs, the 'effects and risks' of taking them and finally 'safety tips' for those 'determined to use' drugs. Pupils are advised to 'sleep well' before and after using cocaine, avoiding mixing with alcohol, to 'wash out your nose after each session' and to 'avoid sharing rolled-up bank notes or straws'. When taking MDMA or ecstasy, children are told to 'start with a half a pill and wait at least two hours before re-dosing' and to 'sip water regularly' but no more than 'one pint an hour'. They are also advised to 'take regular breaks from dancing to cool down.' In the advice pack, children are given 'safety tips' on how to take cocaine, as well as its street names . The booklet tells youngsters to 'take regular breaks from dancing' when taking ecstasy . Elsewhere, they are advised to only take 'short puffs' of cannabis if inhaling and to use 'low strength tobacco and unprinted roaches if smoking'. The 'Snapfacts' book is aimed at 13 to 25-year-olds and was launched yesterday for S4 pupils, aged either 15 or 16, at James Gillespie's High School, in Edinburgh, with other schools expected to follow in the coming months. The controversial approach has been criticised by anti-drug campaigners. Graeme Pearson, MSP for the Labour Party and a former police officer, told MailOnline: 'I don't believe that such publications are helpful. 'The minds of young people are inexperienced and this sort of thing will only help to confirm in their view that taking drugs is an OK past time. 'I would much prefer it if the authorities tried to get people away from drug abuse, as young people will use any excuse they can to justify their behaviour.' Mr Pearson, who is also Director General of the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency, added: 'The levels of drug abuse in Scotland and the number of drug deaths is still at a very high level and this year it was at its second highest level recorded. 'It would be better to give young people a future and a hope of employment than giving this sort of advice, which is misplaced.' The controversial booklet has been slammed by critics who say it will make youngsters think drugs are OK . When taking ecstasy, children are told to 'start with a half a pill and wait at least two hours before re-dosing' Agnes Morrison of the Maxie Richards Foundation, an anti-drugs charity said: 'I don't know why anybody would put out a leaflet telling teenagers the safe way of taking drugs. 'There is no safe way to take drugs. Drugs destroy people so why would you want to put together a leaflet? 'I've never come across anything like this. I know they are putting them in schools and that there is other educational information in there. 'But a lot of kids who do not know anything about drugs might read it and get the impression that there is a safe way to take drugs. 'It's like saying ""here are 10 easy ways to take drugs"". The only safe guidance against drugs is not to take them at all.' Cameron Rose, Edinburgh Conservative leader, said he understood there was a need to issue advice on drug abuse, but questioned the distribution of the leaflet to all youngsters. He said: 'I do understand the need to give important advice to people who are vulnerable to illegal behaviour, but for something to be distributed to all young people is perhaps not the right way. 'There are a lot of complicated issues there, but it raises questions about legitimising inappropriate behaviour. 'It seems inappropriate to be highlighting unwise behaviour.' But Gael Cochrane, a development officer for the Edinburgh Drug and Alcohol Project which is leading the project, said it was the best way to keep teenagers safe. She said: 'Some young people will look things up on the internet but many will not. Without all the facts they are in a more dangerous situation. 'We completely accept there are going to be young people who don't take drugs or drinks or have sex, and we would support them in that. 'But they are a small group, as are the ones who are taking lots of drugs. It's the majority who are undecided.'","Edinburgh council and city's Drug and Alcohol Project issued booklet .

"A convicted paedophile who raped a 12-year-old girl has been taken on as one of Jamie Oliver's apprentice chefs. David Mason, 24, from Feltham, Middlesex, was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution after admitting raping the child as they played computer games together. He served two years of his sentence before spending another two years doing probationary work and now he is six weeks into the celebrity chef's year-long apprentice programme, working in Jamie Oliver's central London restaurant, Fifteen. Convicted paedophile David Mason, 24, left, has been taken on as one of Jamie Oliver's Fifteen apprentices . A spokesman for Oliver confirmed that Mason was working as a trainee at Fifteen restaurant in London, right . Friends of Mason's are said to be enraged that the convicted paedophile has been boasting on Facebook, where he is said to have posted a picture of himself with Oliver with the caption 'Top of the pile where I belong'. One told the Sun: 'It's disgusting that a lad who raped a 12-year-old girl can be gifted the kind of opportunity that honest, hard-working youngsters across the country are crying out for. 'I know he served his time but everyone is sickened he's got a golden opportunity ahead of people who haven't committed a horrible crime, and the way he is showing off on Facebook.' Mason was 19 when he raped the girl, then 12, after sitting next to her as they played computer games. Isleworth Crown Court heard how the girl rejected him when he said he liked her, telling him she 'did not want to know'. Mason then 'pushed her down and sexual intercourse took place', the prosecutor said. Mason initially tried to say that the sex was consensual but admitted the charge. His lawyer told the court that Mason was young and immature and unaware of the consequence of his actions, but Judge Richard McGregor Johnson said to him: 'The law exists to protect young and vulnerable children and she was both of those things, as you well knew. 'You knew very well that having sex with such a young girl was wrong.' The apprentices attend college and work shifts at the Fifteen restaurant in Islington, pictured above . He was sentenced to four years in a young offenders' institution and put on the sex offenders' register. Today a spokesman for Jamie Oliver confirmed Mason had been selected as one of the chef's Fifteen apprentices on a year-long programme. He told MailOnline: 'He was completely honest about his past when he applied for the course and we decided that, as he'd served his sentence, he should be allowed a place on the programme. 'It is not unusual for us to work with people who want to try to turn their lives around.  David spent two years in prison and two years doing probationary work with the Prince's Trust, so four years of punishment. 'He applied to us.  We took great care deciding whether he was appropriate and decided that he deserved his chance and he is doing extremely well at the moment - he is six weeks into the course and doing very well.' Set up in 2002, Oliver's Fifteen apprentice programme is designed to 'help young people stay out of trouble and make something of their lives.' The apprentices, who go through a rigorous and competitive selection programme, attend college one day a week but work mostly in the Fifteen restaurant kitchen, learning the skills needed to be a top chef.  They are paid £130 a week, given four weeks' paid holiday, and travel expenses are covered. Today Andrew Neilson, director of campaigns at the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: 'If we expect people who commit crimes to never do it again, then we have to accept that once someone has served their sentence, they deserve a chance to become a safe and productive citizen. 'Jamie Oliver and his Fifteen restaurant should be commended for the opportunities they provide to young people who are trying to change their lives.' One of Jamie Oliver's first Fifteen apprentices was Kevin Boyle, a 26-year-old Crystal Palace supporter from Purley, Surrey. A keen and talented chef, he worked for Vinoteca restaurant in London and cooked for the Prince of Wales and former Prime Minister, Tony Blair, after finishing Oliver's scheme. But in October 2011, the Lancaster University graduate, then 26, was reported missing from his home.  In January 2012, he was found dead in a garden in nearby Coulsdon, and his mother, Patti, 54, said he had committed suicide with a kit he had bought for £44 over the internet. After Mr Boyle's death Jamie Oliver said: 'I'm deeply saddened by this tragic news. I am proud to have been able to call Kevin a friend for ten years, and he was also a constant supporter of Fifteen and all the apprentices and graduates who came after him through the course.' It was the second tragic death to hit the chef's trainee scheme. In 2008, Christopher Pethick, 20, was found hanged a few miles from the Fifteen restaurant in Watergate Bay, Cornwall. He dropped out of the course in 2006 after two months with severe depression. Fifteen trainee chef Tom Baisden, left, with Jamie Oliver, admitted being involved in a £3million gem heist . Crime has touched the Fifteen trainee scheme, too. Five years ago, a former apprentice on Jamie Oliver's Fifteen scheme was sent to prison after admitting taking part in a £3million jewellery heist in Southend Airport. Former drug addict Tom Baisden, then 28, from Thundersley, Essex, admitted theft, conspiracy to steal, and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by plotting to steal gems, Cartier watches and designer handbags. He told the court he was inspired by his celebrity chef mentor to confess to his crimes, after Oliver told him : 'You can't run away from things or hide from them.'","Chef David Mason, 24, from Feltham, Surrey, was convicted of raping a child .

"Rumours about Apple’s bending iPhone 6 Plus show no signs of dying down. Now two teenagers have decided to take reports about the phone’s alleged flaw into their own hands. In a five-minute video, two 15-year-old boys step into an Apple store to try to bend a gold iPhone 6 Plus. Scroll down for video . Hands-on: In a five-minute video, two 15-year-old boys step into an Apple store to try to bend a gold iPhone 6 Plus. They use so much pressure that the screen on the phone pops out . They use so much pressure that the screen on the phone pops out, causing the teenagers to say they have to run away or ‘they would have ended up paying for it’. The boys, thought to be from Norfolk, then ask a shop worker whether or not an iPhone 6 Plus could bend. It is believed that the thinner model, as well as the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the frame to deform. But the Apple employee denies the claims saying it’s an ‘internet rumour.’ Under pressure: It is believed that the thinner model, in addition to the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the frame to deform. But the Apple employee denies the claims saying it’s an ‘internet rumour’ This chart reveals how much force each handset could withstand. 'Deformation' refers to the point at which the phone began to bend. 'Case separation' was the point at which the display became disconnected from the case. One of the teenagers involved in the video said: ‘The reason why we were laughing was because it was really funny. ‘We were in the Apple store bending and breaking their iPhone, which I guess is criminal damage but I don’t even care, to be honest. ‘It’s Apple’s fault – they are false advertising, saying it’s the best iPhone but clearly it’s not if it can bend in your hands or your pocket. It’s just ridiculous.’ The duo aren’t the only ones attempting to bend the iPhone 6 Plus, with reports suggesting damaged iPhone can be seen throughout Apple’s stores. Some customers have even attempted to bend the allegedly less prone iPhone 6. Apple has yet to comment on the matter. Apple has acknowledged there are issues with new iPhones bending under some circumstances, but it added that it has only received nine official complaints. Experts from Consumer Reports recently suggested some of these claims may have been exaggerated. During their own stress tests, they found the iPhone 6 Plus can withstand more force than has been previously claimed - and that it is more sturdy than the HTC One (M8) and the smaller iPhone 6. The first reports of bendy iPhones began on Wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape. YouTube user Lewis Hilsenteger then posted a video showing the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers, which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times . The controversy was dubbed 'BendGate'. It led to internet jokers posting photos, mocking the unintended new feature (pictured). A number of these images went viral on social media . The first reports of bendy iPhones began on Wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape. YouTube user Lewis Hilsenteger then posted a video showing the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers, which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times. To put these claims to the test, Consumer Reports used a so-called ‘three-point flexural test.’ This involved supporting the phone at two points on either end before applying a force on the top of the device. In addition to the iPhone 6 Plus, the researchers tested the iPhone 6, HTC One (M8), LG G3, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and the iPhone 5. According to Consumer Reports, the HTC One (M8) (pictured) was the weakest of the handsets tested. It started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs (31.75kg) of force was applied. This was on par with the iPhone 6. The HTC handset separated from its case when a force of 90lbs (40kg) was applied . Despite the claims, the HTC One (M8) and iPhone 6 were the weakest devices. They started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs (31.75kg) of force was applied. The iPhone 6 Plus came third, at 90lbs (40kg), followed by the LG G3 and iPhone 5 on 130lbs (59kg), and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 on 150lbs (68kg). The iPhone 6 Plus results show the handset can withstand 15lbs (6.8kg) more force than the initial reports suggested. Consumer Reports claimed this is more than a quarter more force than is needed to break three pencils. Apple also faced criticism and complaints last week about its iOS 8.0.1 update, after it caused problems with the new phones’ TouchID sensors and data services. The update was pulled, and the problems should now be solved by updating to iOS 8.0.2. Following the reports, and #bendgate controversy on Twitter, Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus,' Apple shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $97.87 (£60.26) Thursday, wiping out nearly $23billion (£14.1billion) in market value. Further tests, by AnandTech, revealed the performance of the new phones isn’t as poor as customers have made out, either. During initial benchmark tests, the iPhone 6 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device, just ahead of the iPhone 6 Plus (graph pictured)","Video shows teenagers in Apple's Norwich store bending the phone .

"A teenager on trial for murder told a court he believed he was defeating an army of goblins with a sword and a brick while he beat his five-year-old foster brother and drowned him. Cody Metzker-Madsen bludgeoned Dominic Elkins to death in the garden of their foster home in Logan, Iowa, last year while the pair were playing. The 18-year-old then drowned him  in a pool of water at the bottom of a ravine and dumped the body. The pair had only been in the house for a couple of weeks, both being removed from their biological parents, before the attack took place. During harrowing testimony on the first day of his murder trial, he told the judge that he was playing a game based on Roman mythology with the youngster and was transported to 'his own world' before he is suspected of killing him. Harrowing: Cody Metzker-Madsen, 18, bludgeoned his five-year-old foster brother Dominic Elkins to death in the garden of their foster home in Logan, Iowa, last year while the pair were playing . Fantasy: Testifying in court, Metzker Madsen said he was in his 'own world' during the attack and thought Dominic (pictured) was a goblin attacking him . Metzker Madsen then claims he saw 'green, ugly little creatures' that were fighting people he knew. The scene was similar to something from Skylanders, a video game the teen played, he said. During the harrowing account Metzer Madsen said he 'fought the goblin's commander' and pushed him into ravine. 'I remember attacking him with it and smashing it into his face,' Metzker-Madsen said. 'At that very moment did you realize it was Dominic?' the teen's attorney Michael Williams asked. 'No, I did not,' the teen responded. 'I started pushing his head into the water as I was hitting him with a brick.' The teen said he wanted to keep the goblin to make sure it wouldn't come back to life and fight him. Goblins are 'kind of tricky little creatures,' he said. However, talking about Dominic, he said: 'I loved the little guy, I would never hurt him. Not even a hair on his fricken' little head.' Fantasy: Metzker Madsen (mugshot taken last year) claims he saw 'green, ugly little creatures' that were fighting people he knew and remembers smashing the brick into Dominic's face - but didn't realize it was him . Devastated: Barbara Kunch, Dominic's biological mother, left the courtroom as Metzker-Madsen described the attack on her son . After killing the goblin commander, Metzker-Madsen said he was called out of the ravine by a screaming ally who needed his help. His 'vision' ended after he helped the other person. He then went to tell his teenage foster sister that he couldn't find Dominic. The biological mothers of Metzker-Madsen and Dominic sat in the courtroom and cried as the teen testified. The boys were both in the care of Julie and Don Coolman at the time who were also raising their own children. They haven't spoken publicly about the death. Barbara Kunch, Dominic's mother, left the courtroom as Metzker-Madsen described the attack on her son. She put her son into foster care because he had behavioral problems and did not know how to handle him. The five-year-old would throw uncontrollable tantrums and physically abuse others. That aggressive behavior had apparently come under control in recent days after he received months of therapy at a local treatment center before he was put into the Coolman's care. Metzker-Madsen said that he only realized he was involved in Dominic's death when he was in a car a short time later. He also got frustrated during cross-examination by assistant attorney general Denise Timmins. Witnesses to tragedy: Don Coolman pictured with his twin 12-year-old daughters, who discovered their foster brother dead in a ravine . Prosecutors noted that Metzker-Madsen provided more than one story for why Dominic died and was able to lead his foster family to his body. On cross-examination, Metzker-Madsen said he told different people varying versions of the stories depending on a symbol that only he could see on top of people's heads. 'You don't really believe me, do you?' the teen asked Timmins at one point. Metzker-Madsen's biological mother, Peggy Madsen, also took to the stand. She told the court how she would use $20 of crystal meth a day for three months while she was pregnant with him. She had custody of him until he was seven and claimed that he grew up having imaginary friends and likened himself to a Power Ranger. The teenager has been kept isolated in prison since last year and his attorney is using an insanity defense.","Cody Metzker-Madsen, 18, bludgeoned Dominic Elkins to death last year .

"As controversy grows over the regrading of SAT examinations, thousands of people have started sharing their own scores on social networks to put future generations at ease. Well-known figures have been conspicuously quiet about their results, however, but with the likes of Ke$ha, James Woods and Natalie Portman reportedly getting close to a perfect 1600, perhaps they felt they'd only add pressure rather than ease it. Famous faces with far lower SAT scores include Bill Cosby, who got a score lower than 500, Sopranos actress Drea De Matteo, believed to have scored around 800, and even former US President Bill Clinton, whose 1020 puts him a few hundred points below successor George W Bush. Brains: Scarlett Johansson (left) admitted to 'feeling like a big dummy' with her score of 1080, but that result actually puts her above the US average. Natalie Portman (right) reportedly got close to a perfect 1600 . Awkward: Even former US President Bill Clinton scored fairly low - with results of 1020 puts him more than 200 points below successor George W Bush's 1206 . Scarlett Johansson admitted to 'feeling like a big dummy' when she confirmed her score of 1080, but that result actually puts her above the US average. With rumoured scores of 1579, 1500 and 1150, actor James Woods, singer Ke$ha and actress Courtney Cox would also be placed far above average. As you'd probably expect, Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen got sky-high 1590 and a perfect 1600 respectively, with Apple's Steve Wozniak also scoring a perfect 800 on the maths section of the examination. Will Smith and James Franco have both admitted getting 'very high' SAT scores in the past but neither has revealed the exact number, while the New York Times has previously reported that actor Ben Affleck 'had near perfect SAT scores in high school'. Talent: Will Smith has admitted getting 'very high' SAT scores in the past but hasn't revealed the exact number. It has previously been reported that actor Ben Affleck 'had near perfect SAT scores in high school' Numbers: With 1100, actress Courtney Cox (left)  would also be placed far above average. Sadly for Sopranos star Drea De Matteo (right), her rumoured score of only 800 would see her fall short of that mark . Star: Singer and songwriter Ke$ha is believed to have received a score of around 1500 on her SAT exams . Meanwhile talk show host Rush Limbaugh, political commentator Bill O'Reilly and actor and economist Ben Stein picked up near-perfect scores of 1530, 1585 and 1573 respectively. It's not just conservatives with high scores though: Al Gore kept the tally high for the Democrat camp with a score of 1355. US president Barack Obama, on the other hand, has repeatedly refused to release his education records. Not all celebrities fared brilliantly however, with presenter Howard Stern rumoured to have picked up a low 870, and baseball star Alex Rodriguez reaching just 910. Meanwhile stand-up comedian Janeane Garofalo is thought to have scored around 950. As part of the sweeping changes with the SAT examinations, essays will become optional and there will no longer be penalties for wrong answers.. Changes in the annual test that millions of students take will also do away with some vocabulary words such as 'prevaricator' and 'sagacious' in favor of words more commonly used in school and on the job. College Board officials said Wednesday the update — the first since 2005 — is needed to make the exam better representative of what students study in high school and the skills they need to succeed in college and afterward. The test should offer 'worthy challenges, not artificial obstacles,' said College Board President David Coleman at an announcement event in Austin, Texas. Smart: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak scored a perfect 800 on the maths section of the examination . Intelligent: As you'd probably expect, Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen got sky-high 1590 and a perfect 1600 respectively . The new exam will be rolled out in 2016, so this year's ninth graders will be the first to take it, in their junior year. The new SAT will continue to test reading, writing and math skills, with an emphasis on analysis. Scoring will return to a 1,600-point scale last used in 2004, with a separate score for the optional essay. For the first time, students will have the option of taking the test on computers. One of the biggest changes is that the extra penalty for wrong answers, which discouraged guessing, will be eliminated. And some vocabulary words will be replaced with words such as 'synthesis' and 'empirical' that are used more widely in classrooms and in work settings. Coleman said many students who are terrified they will be tested on lots of SAT words currently have one recourse:  drilling with flashcards. He said educators know that flashcards are not the best way to build real word knowledge that lasts, but 'when the SAT rolls around they become the royal road. Students stop reading and start flipping.' The essay will be changed in other ways, too. It will measure students' ability to analyze and explain how an author builds an argument, instead of measuring the coherence of the writing but not the quality or accuracy of the reasoning. It will be up to school districts and colleges the students apply to as to whether the essay will be required. Each exam will include a passage drawn from 'founding documents' such as the Declaration of Independence or from discussions they've inspired. New measurement: Essays will no longer be compulsory and wrong answers will not be penalized in the exams . Instead of testing a wide range of math concepts, the new exam will focus on a few areas, like algebra, deemed most needed for college and life afterward. A calculator will be allowed only on certain math questions, instead of on the entire math portion. A longstanding criticism of the SAT is that students from wealthier households do better on the exam because they can afford expensive test preparation classes. The College Board seeks to defuse that by saying it will partner with the nonprofit Khan Academy to provide free test preparation materials for the redesigned SAT. It also says every income-eligible student who takes the SAT will receive four fee waivers to apply for college, which continues an effort the College Board has had to assist low-income students. These are the first SAT upgrades since 2005 when the essay portion was added and analogy questions were removed. There have been other notable changes to the test, such as in 1994 when antonym questions were removed and calculators were allowed for the first time. The test was first used in 1926. The SAT was taken last year by 1.7 million students. It has historically been more popular on the coasts, while the other popular standardized college entrance exam, the ACT, dominated the central U.S. But the ACT overtook the SAT in overall use in 2012, in part because it is taken by almost every junior in 13 states as part of the states' testing regimen. Last year, the ACT said it would begin offering computer-based testing in 2015.","Celebrities' SAT scores revealed as anger grows over exam changes .

"Residents in a tower block have been left baffled by a mysterious 'urine' liquid which is seeping through their ceilings. The bright yellow substance has been dripping through the ceilings into the corridors of the flat complex in Southampton, Hants. Householders in the 15-storey building, are forced to leave buckets out to catch what they call is a 'disgusting' liquid. Resident Angela Chicken says children could be potentially harmed by the substance seeping in Albion Towers . Residents in Albion Towers say they have contacted the local council but the issue still hasn't been resolved. One resident in the Albion Towers complex says she has put out two containers for the mysterious liquid which she says 'smells of the zoo'. Angela Chicken, 52, said: 'We have had water coming through the ceiling before. 'But when I came out and saw it was yellow, I wondered what it was - it looks like urine.' The mother-of-one added: 'It is disgusting and the smell reminds me of the zoo. 'We need the council to come and work out exactly what it is, as there are children who run up and down the corridor.' The local council said residents in one of Southampton's biggest tower blocks should have insurance in place . Another resident, Sandy Smith, said the mysterious liquid was a danger to children in the tower block. Ms Smith, 69, said: 'It's not on. The kids run up and down here – they could potentially touch whatever it is.' Residents have contacted the council but say the issue still hasn't been resolved. Councillor John Noon said: 'I was aware there's some leaking there, I'm not aware of a yellow substance though. 'I'm sure the council will get someone out there to look at it as soon as possible, and I shall look into it myself.' A council spokesman said: 'Naturally we will do everything we can to ensure that the situation is rectified as soon and safely as possible.

"The Boy Scouts of America fired its first openly-gay Scoutmaster this week since voting to allow homosexual youth to join the organization in January. Geoff McGrath, a 49-year-old Eagle Scout, was asked to start a new troop by a reverend at his inclusive Methodist church in Seattle last year and says he didn't conceal his sexual orientation from scouts, their parents or organization officials. While the BSA's recent decision allows openly-gay youth to join their ranks, it still bars homosexual men from being leaders. So when the BSA's national headquarters found out about McGraths sexual-orientation earlier this week in the midst of a report by NBC News, his position as a the leader of Troop 98 was 'revoked'. Mr McGarth was invited to set up Troop 98 in Seattle last year by the pastor of an inclusive Methodist church and says he was open about his sexuality with both members and officials . No gay leaders: The Boy Scouts of America voted to allow gay youth into their ranks starting this year but that rule does not pertain to adult leaders. Above, McGrath addresses his troop at a parade . BSA Spokesman Deron Smith says it was only until reporters contacted the organization about McGrath for a story that they found out he was gay. 'Our policy is that we do not ask people about their sexual orientation, and it’s not an issue until they deliberately inject it into Scouting in an inappropriate fashion,' Smith said in an email to NBC. Before his sacking, McGrath believes he was the only openly-gay troop leader in the country. 'It’s extremely disappointing to not be fully supported and defended in my membership,' McGrath said. 'They are complaining that the problem [his status as an openly gay man] is a distraction to Scouting and they don’t seem to understand that the distraction is self-inflicted.' McGrath started leading Troop 98 last fall after he was asked by Reverand Monica Corsaro of Rainier Beach United Methodist Church. Rev Corsaro wanted to start an inclusive troop for local youth, and reached out to McGrath who attends the church with his husband of 20 years. McGrath agreed to start the troop when asked by the reverend at his inclusive Methodist church. He attends the Rainier Beach United Methodist Church with his husband of more than 20 years (pictured together above) McGrath was hesitant to start the group at first because he had his own troubled history with the BSA. When he was 22-years-old, McGrath was offered the position of Assistant Scoutmaster but that was job was rescinded once his troop leaders figured out he was day. The troop was also sponsored by his Mormon church, and he was additionally excommunicated from the religion. He agreed to start the program, in part inspired by the work of his straight twin-brother Dave who has publicly championed for gays to be admitted into to the scouts. Won't stop: McGrath says he will continue to lead the troop until relieved by his church's reverend . 'If you don’t participate, you're not part of the conversation,' McGrath, a software engineer, said.  'Yelling from the outside is not conversing. So we're on the inside doing good work. Talking about the gay and lesbian issue is not the biggest part of what we do—it's the smallest part.' But McGrath makes clear that his decision to lead the troop was not part of a publicity stunt, but because he genuinely wanted to help out the local kids. And his troop at Rainier Beach, including their parents, thank him for his work. 'Anyone who is willing to step forward and provide an opportunity for our youth should be supported, and Geoff has done an excellent job,' said Denise Mimura, whose son, 14-year-old son Jonathan is in the troop. 'If anyone has an issue with this, then where are they?' The troop currently consists of all straight boys, but gay high-schooler Koyle Kendrick, 17, says he plans to join the troops after the end of the school year. Kendrick left another troop last year because it didn't feel gay-friendly. 'I'll be more comfortable going back into Scouting and being in an inclusive troop,' he said, adding that McGrath will 'understand where I'm coming from.' Proud to be a Scoutmaster: McGrath waves a pride flag during an outing with his troop . McGrath certainly understands Kendrick's perspective, having experienced a similar isolation growing up and feeling like he was the only gay person around. 'One of the things that’s different now with our troop from when I was a youth in the Scouts, was there were no identifiable gay or lesbian adults,' McGrath said. For his part, McGrath hopes that 'cooler minds will prevail' and he will be allowed to continue as Scoutmaster. 'That's what I believe. If it doesn't happen today, that will be disappointing. But it doesn't mean it won't ever happen,' he said. In a message on Facebook, McGrath said he hasn't received an official notification from the BSA that he is no longer a Scoutmaster and says he will continue to lead the group until told otherwise by his church's revered. The BSA says it has no plans to review its membership policy to allow gay leaders at this time.","Geoff McGrath started Troop 98 last fall but had his position as Scoutmaster 'revoked' this week .

"Devastating consequences of mistakes by NHS staff are exposed today. An official report reveals how basic errors left a baby brain-damaged and a woman unable to have children, and in some cases resulted in needless deaths. It highlights a snapshot of 126 cases investigated by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman last year, warning that mistakes affect patients of all ages in hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries. Scroll down for video . Blunders: A report highlights a snapshot of 126 cases investigated by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman last year, warning mistakes affect patients of all ages in hospitals, care homes and GP surgeries . Dame Julie Mellor, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, said: ‘These investigations highlight the devastating impact failures in public services can have on the lives of individuals and their families. We are increasingly concerned about patients being discharged unsafely from hospital. ‘Unplanned admissions and re-admissions are a massive cost to the NHS.’ The report will renew fears that the NHS is struggling to provide safe care for the rising numbers of patients. Only last week senior NHS officials warned that the health service needed an extra £8billion a year to meet the demands of a growing and ageing population. 'Devastating': Dame Julie Mellor, the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman, whose role is to investigate complaints against the NHS . They said that unless more funding was provided – and services run more efficiently – patient safety could be jeopardised. Officials hope that exposing the failings will encourage NHS staff to learn from the mistakes. Dame Julie said that last year her office investigated 424 cases of patients, mostly the elderly, being discharged too soon. Such patients often have to be re-admitted after developing infections or suffering falls because they have not fully recovered. It also looked into 20 cases of cancer misdiagnosis whereby lifesaving treatment had been delayed because symptoms had been missed by doctors. The ombudsman’s role is to investigate complaints against the NHS which have allegedly not been properly dealt with. This is the first time the ombudsman has published such detailed information on NHS failings. Previous reports have been more general, with only a few cases highlighted. It now plans to release similar reports on a regular basis to improve transparency. A spokesman for NHS England said: ‘Where someone wants to raise a concern, it is important that they can do this easily and that it is quickly acted on. ‘This report lays out an important challenge to services to learn from complaints.’ A woman admitted to hospital for an operation to remove an ovary was mistakenly given a full hysterectomy. The unnamed patient had her uterus and appendix unnecessarily removed by doctors at University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. Following the surgery the woman's wound reopened but doctors failed to treat it properly. The patient had to have a restorative operation and was forced to take long periods of time off work recovering from the ordeal. She made a complaint to the trust and received £11,000 compensation. The case was investigated by the NHS watchdog, who concluded that doctors failed to carry out adequate assessments and that the woman's postoperative care fell below the required standards. Helen Morgan, deputy chief nurse for UH Bristol, said: 'We always strive to resolve complaints from patients and their families, as respond to their questions, as quickly as possible. 'Unfortunately on these occasions our response did not satisfy these patients and their families. 'The trust has apologised and we do once again publicly.' It was one of three mistakes in the West Country that have been investigated by the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. In another Bristol case another woman, who subsequently died, was found to have been discharged while she was still unwell and was readmitted the following day. The watchdog ruled the decision to discharge her was not based on complete information, but found it did not find the failings led to her death. The ombudsman also found Weston Area Health NHS Trust in Somerset failed to alert a patient to the potential risks of an operation on his wrist which left him with nerve damage. A trust spokesman said: 'We take complaints very seriously and always learn from them, to make changes to do things differently so as to ultimately benefit our patients.'","More than 125 medical blunders with catastrophic effects investigated .

"A judge ruled that a severely anorexic and alcoholic woman should not be force fed and kept alive after she wrote to him saying: 'I am prepared to die'. The woman, suffering an 'unusual' combination of anorexia nervosa and alcohol dependency, wrote to Mr Justice Cobb to tell him she wanted to spend whatever time she had left 'doing nice things'. In the moving letter, presented to the Court of Protection, she said; 'Whatever time I have left I just want to live each day alongside my granddad and (siblings), who are my world. 'I want them to know ""me"" rather than this illness and to have some nice memories of our time together.' In a moving letter, presented to the Court of Protection, an anorexic and alcoholic woman has begged not to be force fed, saying: 'Whatever time I have left I just want to live each day alongside my granddad and (siblings), who are my world' Mr Justice Cobb, who described the case as 'unusual and desperately sad', said no one involved could be identified to protect the woman's privacy. The woman told him that she was 'fully aware' of what was wrong with her and what the 'effects of my wish to refuse treatments' would be. The judge, who was told that the woman's life was in 'imminent danger', ruled last month that she should not be force-fed or forced to have treatment following a hearing in the Court of Protection - where cases involving sick and vulnerable people are analysed - in London. But detail of her letter did not emerge until today, when Mr Justice Cobb published a written analysis of the case. The judge, who described the woman as 'young', said anorexia nervosa had dominated her life for the past 14 years. He said a 'psychological dependence' on alcohol had caused 'end stage' irreversible liver disease. She had been trapped in an 'increasingly destructive revolving door of treatment and recurrent illness' and had been admitted to hospital more than 45 times in 11 years - sometimes being detained under the provisions of mental health legislation. An NHS trust had asked the judge to make rulings on what was in the woman's best interests. Doctors said they thought it was in her best interests not to be force-fed or forced to have treatment. The judge reproduced the letter the woman had written to him in his ruling. Mr Justice Cobb described the case as 'unusual and desperately sad' 'I understand the professionals concerns and the effect that this has had on all of them and I do recognise that everyone wants for the best,' the woman wrote in it. 'However I feel I have had enough of the continual pressure of mental health staff and services ... and that rather than helping me, it is actually making me worse. 'It is hard for everyone but there is a lot I can't deal with concerning therapy - it's just not something I have found able to be involved in, it's just too hard. 'But I am also fully aware that there is support and treatment still available if ever I want it. 'I am fully aware of what is wrong with my health and the effects of my wish to refuse treatments will have upon it. 'Whatever time I have left I just want to live each day alongside my granddad and (siblings), who are my world. 'I want them to know 'me' rather than this illness and to have some nice memories of our time together. 'I want to be able to look forward each day to doing 'nice' things.' She added: 'The whole journey is mentally and emotionally horrible for everyone. 'I've got support from my nearest and dearest and that is really all the support I want now and in the future. 'I can only hope that you really hear what I am saying and what I truly hope can happen.' Mr Justice Cobb said evidence showed the woman had suffered a 'range of harmful childhood experiences'. He said the woman's childhood traumas had left 'deep wounds' and manifested themselves through her 'psychological disturbance'. She had used her eating disorder and alcohol as 'props to enable her to function'. 'This is an unusual and desperately sad case,' said the judge. 'So far as I can do so, I have endeavoured to put myself in the place of (the woman) and guided by what she has directly told me and others.' He added: 'I have reached the clear conclusion that I should not compel treatment for (her) anorexia.'","The unnamed woman wrote to Mr Justice Cobb to tell him she wanted to spend whatever time she had left 'doing nice things' with her family .

"A one-year-old child has been rescued and returned safely to the arms of her mother on the New South Wales' Central Coast. NSW Police officers had to smash the window of a Holden Captiva SUV after the young girl became trapped about 10am on Tuesday. Emergency crews were on the Lakedge Avenue scene in Berkeley Vale five minutes after they received a triple-0 call from the child's distressed mother. Scroll down for video . Emergency services received a call from a distressed mother on Lakedge Avenue in Berkeley Vale . NSW Central Coast police rescued the child by smashing in a window as she started getting distressed . Tuggerah Lakes Area Command duty officer Tim Winmill said police could not wait for NRMA to free the child from the car as soaring temperatures made her tearful. Mr Winmill said officers also had to hose down the car with water to cool it down as the mercury rose to 27 degrees in the area on Tuesday. 'Police arrived at the scene in five minutes [after the triple-0 call] and had to wait for NRMA to get into the car as the child was not distressed at the time,' Mr Winmill told Daily Mail Australia. 'But due to the heat, the child became distressed and started crying and police had to smash the window of the car. Police received the call at 10am on Tuesday and saved her within 10 minutes . They also had to start hosing down the car to cool the black Holden Captiva down . A NSW Ambulance spokeswoman said the child was not taken to hospital but treated at the scene . 'All the windows were up so they were more concerned for the child’s well being. '[The mother] was upset, she was very supportive of police of smashing window of the car to get her little one out.' Mr Winmill also cautioned parents to look out for their child as the hot weather sets in. 'This time of the year people should be vigilant about leaving their child in the car because of the heat,' he said. 'Cars can very hot, very quickly.' The child was rescued from the car within 10 minutes and Mr Winmill said the one-year-old did not suffer any injuries during the incident.

This comes as state roadside assistance bodies around Australia have revealed they are called to save thousands of children from locked cars each year, issuing a warning to parents and passersby to be extra vigilant as we enter the warmer months. Gympie police officer Steve Buchanan tried but could not smash his way into the vehicle with his baton while waiting for roadside assistance from the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) to unlock the car, The Gympie Times reported. He chipped and scratched the car but was unable to get in to the Mazda 3 hatch. After a number of minutes the RACQ arrived and were able to unlock the rear passenger door. The toddler, who was unharmed, jumped into her relieved mother's arms.

"The RSPCA have today issued a grovelling apology for killing an elderly cat against its family's wishes and then making a bungled attempt to prosecute them. Richard Byrnes and his wife Samantha suffered two years of trauma after an RSPCA inspector seized their cat, 16-year-old Claude, in May 2013, claiming that he was too thin and had matted fur. After 24 hours of agonising negotiations Claude was put to sleep by a local vet against the wishes of Mr and Mrs Byrnes - who were threatened with prison and fines if they refused to sign the release form. Traumatic: Samantha and Richard Byrnes and their two teenage children, Dominic, 15, and Eloise, 13, had their pet cat Claude taken away and put down by the RSPCA in May 2013 . The RSPCA put the animal to sleep before the distraught family could even say goodbye. The couple were then individually charged with cruelty and taken to court and the case hung over them for 15 months. The charges were eventually overruled by the Crown Prosecution Service in August 2014 - but only after the family had been wrongly condemned by the RSPCA for ill-treating their beloved cat. Claude, who they adopted as a six-month-old kitten, always had extremely thick hair and spent his life trying to avoid being groomed. He hated it so much that a vet would have to place him under anaesthetic before attempting a trim. Hated grooming: Claude had a lifelong aversion to being combed or trimmed meaning his coat frequently became matted. The RSPCA saw this as a sign of animal cruelty . The couple's daughter Eloise Byrnes (pictured with Claude) was not allowed to say her final goodbyes to the cat . The vet, who advised the RSPCA, said she had no concrete evidence Claude was suffering and claimed his matted hair and thin frame were not valid reasons for putting him down. However, an RSPCA inspector insisted Claude should be put to sleep immediately. A postr-mortem examination later revealed Claude was in relatively good health. The RSPCA publicly apologised to Mr and Mrs Byrnes today over the 'upset and deep distress caused both to them and their children'. It said: 'The RSPCA acknowledges that the way in which it intervened in taking Claude from his home and the subsequent treatment of Mr and Mrs Byrnes at that time was disproportionate and insensitive and fell short of the standards of compassion the public are entitled to expect of the RSPCA. Distressing: The couple were individually charged with cruelty and taken to court and the case hung over them for 15 months until it was overruled by the Crown Prosecution Service in August 2014 . 'Specifically, the RSPCA accepts that its decision not to defer euthanasia so that Mr and Mrs Byrnes' children could say goodbye to the pet cat they had known their entire lives caused great and unnecessary distress to the whole family.' The RSPCA also admitted making a number of public responses which presented Mr and Mrs Byrnes 'in an unfavourable light to the public'. Mr and Mrs Byrnes, from Tring, Hertfordshire, adopted Claude from a friend as a six-month-old kitten when they moved to the rural town in the late nineties. They have two children, Dominic, 15, and Eloise, 13, who were devastated at losing Claude, who was regarded as 'the original member of the family'. Angry: Accountant Richard Byrnes said: 'I'll never forget having to stand in a dock and plead not guilty on my birthday' The family had accepted that Claude was nearing the end of his life when the incident took place and he would probably be put to sleep within months. However, they wanted to have one last summer with their beloved animal. A plea to allow the children to see their pet one last time was ignored. Accountant Mr Byrnes, 53, today condemned the RSPCA for treating his family like criminals and called on the Attorney General to look at its role. He said: 'I am glad they have made the apology public but it has taken a long time to get it out there. 'It doesn't get Claude back and we are not happy, but we do feel vindicated. Every contact with them has been damaging. 'I haven't considered any financial action, but that is something to discuss with my lawyer. 'Our children haven't been involved in this since Claude was put down as we have tried to keep them away from everything. 'But I don't think my daughter will ever get over not saying goodbye to Claude and not seeing him again.' He added: 'The RSPCA has been shocking from start to finish, treating us like criminals when all we've done is care for our cat. 'I will not forget having to stand in a dock and plead not guilty on my birthday. 'They released statements which were full of lies and I have nothing but contempt for them. 'The Attorney General should look at the RSPCA and see if it is fit to conduct these private prosecutions. From our view they are not fit for purpose.'","Richard and Samantha Byrnes, of Hertfordshire, were 'treated like criminals'

"An immigration judge has dismissed the case against a 19-year-old Oregon woman who faced possible deportation to Mexico after she drove an SUV into a leaf pile, accidentally killing two young girls playing in it. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Tuesday that Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros was released from a Tacoma, Washington, immigration detention center Aug. 14. She was in removal proceedings and had been held at the facility since February. An ICE spokesman declined to say why the case was dropped, citing privacy issues. Earlier this year, Garcia-Cisneros was sentenced to three years' probation and 250 hours of community service. A jury found her guilty of two counts of felony hit-and-run. Released: Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros, seen in a March 2014 file photo, was was released from a Washington state immigration detention center Aug. 14 . Victims:  Stepsisters 6-year-old Anna Dieter-Eckerdt, left,  and 11-year-old Abigail Robinson, right, died after Garcia-Cisneros drove through a pile of leaves . Prosecutors say the Oct. 20 crash in Forest Grove, 25 miles west of Portland, was an accident. But they say the young woman failed to come forward after learning she might have struck the children in the leaf pile, which was on the street. Police found her the following day. Authorities said the two girls — later identified as stepsisters, 6-year-old Anna Dieter-Eckerdt and 11-year-old Abigail Robinson — likely were concealed by the leaves and not visible to Garcia-Cisneros. Minutes after Garcia-Cisneros drove through the leaves on her way home, her brother returned to the scene and saw a man standing over the pile, screaming. The man spoke to him briefly. The boy went home and told his sister she might have hit two children. Defense attorney Ethan Levi previously said Garcia-Cisneros was in a state of shock and denial after learning of the children and fixated on the possibility she wasn't the driver who struck them. At her sentencing hearing, she told the girls' parents, Tom Robinson and Susan Dieter-Robinson, that she deeply regretted not going back. The parents offered her their forgiveness. Another chance: The girls' parents, Tom Robinson and Susan Dieter-Robinson, ioffered their forgiveness to Garcia-Cisneros for killing Abigail, left, and Anna, right . Guilty: Earlier this year, Garcia-Cisneros was sentenced to three years' probation and 250 hours of community service. A jury found her guilty of two counts of felony hit-and-run . Garcia-Cisneros was brought to the U.S. from Mexico as a 4-year-old. She has temporary permission to be in the country legally under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, meaning she has a work permit, a driver's license and a Social Security number. Immigration attorney Courtney Carter, who represented the teen, was not immediately available for a comment. Neither was Garcia-Cisneros. 'Today is like any other day without our girls,' said Dieter-Robinson, Anna and Abigail's mother. 'Through our grief we have chosen to love and celebrate the joy that they have brought into our lives and the lives of so many others.'","Cinthya Garcia-Cisneros, 19, drove an SUV into a leaf pile last October, accidentally killing two young girls playing in it .

"Brenda Leyland was accused of trolling Madeleine McCann's parents on Twitter . An inquest into the death of a woman accused of trolling Madeleine McCann's parents has been adjourned after a post-mortem examination yesterday failed to establish a cause of death. An inquest at Leicester Coroner's Court was told the post-mortem examination conducted yesterday had failed to establish the cause of 63-year-old Brenda Leyland's death. A few days earlier she had been confronted by Sky News reporter Martin Brunt about trolling the McCanns on Twitter. During the exchange, Mrs Leyland initially refused to speak but then replied: ‘I’m entitled to do that.’ Opening the inquest, Leicester Coroner Catherine Mason was told there was no evidence of foul play or third party involvement in the death. Police Sergeant Kevin Taylor told the coroner he was informed that Mrs Leyland was dead after being sent to the Marriott Hotel in Enderby. The officer said: 'At the scene I was joined by another officer and a county ambulance first responder unit. 'I was then informed by the paramedic and the other officer that there was a deceased female within the room.' Sgt Taylor added that officers were awaiting the results of additional post-mortem tests and were still undertaking inquiries into the death. Adjourning the inquest until December 18, Mrs Mason said: 'It's quite clear from the evidence before me that I am not in a position to conclude (the inquest) today. 'The cause of death is still not known and police inquiries are rightly ongoing. 'Therefore, with the sergeant still tasked to complete the police inquiries and the pathologist still to provide a cause of death, I am adjourning the inquest.' Officers from Leicestershire Police, who are not treating the death as suspicious, were alerted to the discovery of Ms Leyland's body at 1.42pm on Saturday. Mrs Leyland, from Burton Overy, Leicestershire, is reported to have posted thousands of messages on Twitter attacking the McCanns, whose daughter Madeleine disappeared in Portugal in 2007. The 63-year-old tweeted that she ‘hated’ Kate and Gerry McCann and launched online diatribes about their behaviour in the aftermath of their daughter’s disappearance. But unlike other ‘internet trolls’, she did not appear to have made threats against the couple. The Marriot Hotel in Enderby, where Mrs Leyland's body was found by police on Saturday afternoon . Mrs Leyland lived in the town of Burton Overy (pictured). Her home is not pictured here .

"An Indian father has been charged with murder after he invited his 14-year-old daughter's alleged rapist to dinner before torturing him to death. Jamil Gupta, 36, told police that he strangled Omkar Singh until he passed out before tying him up and burning his genitals with hot tongs. Singh, 45, had allegedly raped and impregnated Gupta's daughter before boasting that he was too well-connected to local police to ever be prosecuted. Jamil Gupta told police that he killed Omkar Singh, his daughter's alleged rapist, in the Khajuri Khas district of north-eastern Delhi (file picture) by strangling him, tying him up and burning his genitals with hot tongs . The father invited Singh, his neighbour, round to his house on Saturday and cooked him dinner before launching the attack. After killing the man, he walked to a police station in the Khajuri Khas district of north-eastern Delhi and handed himself in, giving officers a detailed account of what he had done. According to the Indian Express, the father told police: 'I burned his genitals once, he screamed. I did it again, he shuddered. 'When I did it the third time he did not move - he was dead. I did not want to kill him.' Police confirmed they found the dead man lying in the courtyard outside the Gupta's house with bruising marks to his neck. Officers added that his genitals were completely burned away. In Gupta's statement, he told officers that two months earlier, when he had been working in his shop, Singh, a medicine supplier, had called round his house. Singh found the 14-year-old girl home alone and allegedly raped her. She told her father, who did not inform the police for fear that family and neighbours would blame her. The girl has been examined by doctors who confirmed she was pregnant from a sexual assault.","Jamil Gupta charged with murder after killing his daughter's alleged rapist .

"The BTK serial killer is helping to write a book about his heinous crimes because he believes people need to know how a criminal mind works. Dennis Rader, 69, is currently serving 10 consecutive life sentences for 10 murders in Wichita, Kansas, between 1974 and 1991. He earned the moniker BTK killer as details emerged that he consistently 'bound', 'tortured', then 'killed' his victims - none of which his wife knew about until he was charged. Book deal: BTK killer Dennis Rader, 69, revealed he has been working on a book with a professor about his mind. He was dubbed BTK because he bound, tortured and killed his 10 murder victims from 1974 to 1991 . Letter: In a handwritten message dated 29 September, Rader revealed the news himself . Now, the father-of-two and former church leader has vowed to claims he plans to help the families monetarily by assisting a University of Pennsylvania professor on a book studying his mind. In a handwritten open letter from his cell in El Dorado Correctional Facility, Kansas, Rader revealed the news. 'The main reason for the book idea, is to help the VF's (Victims Fund) monetarily wise; something I had hoped for years, to help them and in a way to pay my debt to them,' Rader wrote, according to Kansas News. 'I can never replace their love ones, my deeds too 'dark' to understand, the book or movies, etc. is the only way to help them. 'I mean to burn no bridges and hope some day to open up. 'People like me, need to be under stood, so the criminal professional field, can better under stand, the criminal mind. That would be my way helping debt to society.' He adds that he cannot say very much because he is barred from making or fueling profits from his crimes, but he knows the book is 'close to a deal'. Inspired: The new movie A Good Marriage that hit theaters yesterday was inspired by Rader lying to his wife . Victims: These pictures show eight of his victims, ranging in age from 21 to 62, in Wichita, Kansas . Following his arrest, several of the victims' relatives sued Rader, and secured a settlement that agreed he can never profit from his crimes or coverage of them. The non-fiction book will not be sensationalist, author Katherine Ramsland insists, and Rader will not profit from it. 'I'm trying to make this a serious effort that will have some benefit for people who study this kind of crime,' she said. That work involved correspondence with Rader, she explained. His words come after his daughter broke the family's nine-year silence to condemn a film by Stephen King allegedly inspired by Rader's secrets, as his wife never knew about the murders. Kerri Rawson, has said King is 'exploiting' the people her father killed and her own family with his new film, A Good Marriage. Dispute: Rader's 36-year-old daughter Kerri Rawson (right) broke the family's nine-year silence to condemn author Stephen King (left) for his book and film that she claims exploits the victims' families and her family . The movie, which hit theaters on October 3, is about a woman who is unaware her husband is a serial killer. It is based on a short story the author wrote in 2010, which he then adapted for the screen. While promoting the film, King has said on programs like The View that he was inspired by the BTK killer when he came up with the idea for the story, about a man whose own family was unaware of the horrible atrocities he had committed. Rawson, 36, and her family were also unaware her father was a killer. 'He’s exploiting my father’s 10 victims and their families,' Rawson told the The Kansas City Star. She then said of her father, 'He is not worth all the books and the news stories and all the attention.' Rader responded in his letter: 'I'm sorry my daughter is upset, I would be too.' He added that his wife Paula did not know about the crimes, adding: 'The family knew nothing about my ‘Dark Deeds.’ I carried that secret until the day I was arrested.'","Dennis Rader, 69, is collaborating with professor on study of his mind .

"US authorities searched luggage and pulled passengers off a plane in New York after a bag sparked a security scare because it had a logo that is similar to ISIS insignia. Stunned passengers pulled out their cameras or mobile phones to film the unsettling moment when law enforcement personnel boarded the Sun Country Airlines aircraft on the tarmac at JFK International Airport on Thursday. Travellers said local and federal officers went through luggage with a bomb-sniffing dog and detained around ten people before the flight was allowed to leave for Minneapolis around 90 minutes behind schedule. Scroll down for video . Security scare: Authorities searched luggage with a bomb-sniffing dog and removed around ten passengers . The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said the search occurred after someone noticed a logo that was similar to the insignia of the terror group ISIS. It turns out the logo belongs to a travel agency that had given the bags to a tourist group, KARE 11 reported. A federal source told WNBC that a passenger on the plane had a duffel bag that had the word 'ISIS' on it. Passenger Nathan Tylutki, of St Paul, Minnesota, filmed part of the incident and told the TV station he became concerned when he saw authorities questioning a specific group of travellers. He said: ‘For me, there seemed to be some profiling going on. They say ""a word on luggage"", and I am getting this second-hand. 'I didn’t see luggage but there did seem to be some profiling going on because the people detained were wearing hijabs and clothing you see in the Middle East.’ The incident occurred on a Sun Country Airlines plane on the tarmac at JFK International Airport in New York . Nothing was found during the search and the passengers were allowed to continue their journey. Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo said the passengers who were removed from the plane were questioned by police and FBI agents, KARE 11 reported. He confirmed they booked their trip through an agency who provided bags with a logo that is similar to ISIS’ logo. A Transportation Security Administration spokesperson said: ‘Upon landing at JFK, the flight crew requested that the airplane be screened for explosives. An explosive detection canine cleared the aircraft for continued operation.’","Incident occurred aboard a Sun Country Airlines flight at JFK airport .

"Most people couldn't recall what row they were sitting in on a plane they boarded three years ago but a Brisbane couple have very good reason to remember every detail of the flight. Holly and Tim Moffitt sat next to each other in row 4 on a Virgin flight from Brisbane to Canberra on April 7 in 2011. During the two-hour trip, the strangers talked endlessly and exchanged contact details to meet again and the rest, as they say, is history. Holly's stepfather, Dean White, thought it would be a fitting gesture to ask Virgin Australia to write a letter congratulating them on their wedding day on October 25 this year - but the airline company went above and beyond this special request. Scroll down for video . Holly and Tim met on a plane from Brisbane to Canberra three years ago and the rest is history .

The couple were overwhelmed by the video which was shown at their reception in Tweed Heads in NSW . The blissfully happy couple when Tim popped the question to an ecstatic Holly in Thailand 12 months ago . A thoughtful video was produced with staff members from all departments getting involved to congratulate the Brisbane couple. Staff members, Louise and Sarah, start the string of touching messages with Sarah saying: . 'Who would’ve thought all of those years ago when you sat in row 4 as complete strangers that it was meant to be – have a great day.' Then the video goes into the cockpit of the plane with Captain Chris Hartley who was joined by Officer Daniel Lloyd. 'We hope the fastened seat belt isn’t switched on or too often for any turbulence throughout your relationship – we wish you a smooth and enjoyable ride,' Officer Lloyd said. Baggage handlers, Andrew and Nathan, gave their own piece of advice: 'Whilst we deal with baggage every day - to avoid that baggage make sure you clearly communicate to one another and have a fantastic and loving and long marriage.' The video ends with Louise and Sarah toasting their glasses of bubbles to the happy couple.

Mr White said the footage received an rousing response at the wedding reception at Tweed Heads in Northern NSW - particularly from the overwhelmed couple. 'They were blown away, and really appreciated the efforts of those involved,' he said. 'Everyone at the reception cheered and applauded.' Even though Mr white had discussed the video with Virgin in the week and a half leading up to the wedding, he did no expect great footage, . 'We were really impressed by the extra distance mile that Virgin Australia had gone to, especially as it started out as a reasonably small request for a congratulation letter to read out at the reception,' he said. 'When we watched it we knew that everyone would love it.' During the two-hour trip, the strangers talked endlessly and exchanged contact details to meet again . The couple could never have known stepping onto that plane all those years ago - when Holly was jetting off to visit her parents while Tim was heading to a family wedding - that their lives would be changed forever. Mr White said when his daughter arrived in Canberra she was clearly smitten with the stranger she had been chatting to for the past couple of hours. 'She could not stop telling us about the great guy she had met on the flight,' he said. The couple's starkly different personalities made them a compatible match. 'Let’s just say they were keen on each other from the start,' Mr White said. 'They are polar opposites which completely complement each other.

"New DNA evidence has cast doubt on the murder conviction of the retired teacher jailed for the 'Lady in the Lake' murder. In 2005, Gordon Park was found guilty of murdering his wife Carol with an ice axe and dumping her body in Coniston Water in Cumbria 30 years earlier. Her badly beaten, weighted-down body was found at the bottom of the lake 21 years after her death in 1976, and Park's eventual conviction ended what had been one of Britain's most notorious unsolved cases. The family of Gordon Park (pictured left with third wife Jenny in 2005) say new DNA evidence has cast doubt over his murder conviction for killing first wife Carol (right), who became known as the Lady of the Lake . Park had always denied killing his 30-year-old wife, and was found hanged in his cell at HMP Garth, Lancashire, on January 25, 2010 - the morning of his 66th birthday. Now the case is again under scrutiny, and Park's family have reportedly found new DNA evidence that they say may clear his name and open the door for a new investigation into Mrs Park's death. The evidence will be presented to independent watchdog the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which reviews alleged miscarriages of justice and has confirmed it is 'actively investigating' the case. It is understood that the CCRC is due to visit Coniston as part of the investigation, although it has not commented on this. Denial: Park had always denied killing his 30-year-old wife, pictured with him on their wedding day in 1967 . Accused: Park, pictured with Carol on her 21st birthday in 1966, was accused of bludgeoning her to death with an ice axe, and dumping her body in Coniston Water . The retired schoolmaster was accused of bludgeoning Mrs Park to death with an ice axe in July 1976 and dumping her body in the lake near the family home in Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness. He claimed he had taken their children on a trip to Blackpool on the day she vanished, and that she had gone to live with another man. Her body had come to rest on an underwater ledge and was found by amateur divers 21 years later. The case became known as ‘Lady in the Lake’ after the Raymond Chandler novel of the same name. Mrs Park was found wearing her blue baby doll night-dress, arms bound tightly and with tape over her eyes. Probe: Police investigate boats at Coniston Water after the discovery of Mrs Park's body in 1997 . Weighed down: Mrs Park's decomposed body was found with these lead weights and ropes . Dress: She was found wearing her blue baby doll night-dress, arms bound tightly and with tape over her eyes . Scene: Legal teams from the 2005 trial are shown the spot on Coniston where Mrs Park's body was recovered . After the grim discovery, Park was arrested and charged with her murder but the case against him was dropped in January 1998 when the Crown Prosecution Service said it did not have enough evidence against him. A second police investigation uncovered fresh evidence by linking him to the killing with the knots meticulously used to tie up the body and a piece of Westmorland green slate used to weigh it down, which matched the stone used to build the family home. In 2005, Park was found guilty of murder at Manchester Crown Court and jailed for life as he was told he would serve a minimum of 15 years. Suicide: Park was found hanged in his cell at HMP Garth, Lancashire, on January 25, 2010 - the morning of his 66th birthday . However, he had always maintained his innocence and wrote letters to the media from jail. His family, including third wife Jenny and his children Jeremy and Rachel have continued campaigned for his conviction to be overturned posthumously. Jeremy Park, who is leading the campaign to clear his father's name, said the DNA evidence had been uncovered by the family's lawyers, but has not given further details. 'This test may shed some serious new light on this whole thing,' he told The Telegraph's Bill Gardner. 'This will all come out very soon.' It is also believed that the watchdog may be re-examining evidence from a woman who said she saw Park push something into Coniston Water in 1976, coming forward to give her account in 2004. Joan Young's testimony was challenged during the trial, when it was argued that she was too far away to identify the person in the boat, and that it couldn't have been Mrs Park's body that was being dumped as Mrs Young was positioned in a way that the place where the body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. Mrs Park's nieces, Kay Washford, 50, and Claire Gardener, 45, both from Barrow, who now live in Preston, say they both think the correct verdict was given at the time. Park's family launched a fresh bid to clear his name in 2010 - nine months after he was found dead in his prison cell on his 66th birthday. In 2013 an inquest jury in Preston ruled that Park, of Barrow, had killed himself. For the last four years, the CCRC has been examining evidence and police files to see if the case should go before the Court of Appeal. The CCRC investigates miscarriages of justice in the UK and rarely considers cases when the person has died. Such a probe can take up to six years to fully investigate, in some cases. Many claimed that much of the evidence against Park could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Park from prison and to clear his name. Husband: Park is pictured at Lake Ullswater after charges brought against him in 1997 were dropped the following year by the Crown Prosecution Service due to a lack of evidence . Son: Jeremy Park (pictured at the family home in 1997), who is leading the campaign to clear his father's name, said the DNA evidence had been uncovered by the family's lawyers . The case featured prominently in the book, No Smoke - The Shocking Truth About British Justice, which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder. A spokesman for the watchdog refused to confirm or deny a site visit, only saying: 'The CCRC is actively investigating this case.' Mrs Washford, the daughter of Carol Park's now deceased brother, Ivor Price said: 'The Park family will not accept the evidence that was put to the courts to help convict Gordon. 'I really think they are clutching at straws and hoping to find an answer that isn't there. Myself and Claire still feel the correct verdict was given. 'Gordon went to the High Court of Appeal and lost, so what makes them think after all this time they could find any information that could overturn the court's decision? And we will carry on fighting for justice.' Murdered: School teacher Carol Park, pictured in 1963, vanished from her home in Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria during the drought-hit summer of 1976 . School teacher Carol Park vanished from her home in Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria during the drought-hit summer of 1976. She was 30 and suspicion immediately fell on her husband - with whom she had an 'open' marriage. Mrs Park's body remained missing until August 1997, when it was discovered, weighted down, by two amateur divers on an underwater ledge in Coniston Water. Police nicknamed her the Lady in the Lake after the Raymond Chandler crime novel of the same name. Father-of-three Park was arrested and charged with murder but the charges were dropped in January 1998 due to lack of evidence. However, he was re-arrested in 2004 and, at the end of a two-month trial at Manchester Crown Court, the jury found him guilty of murder. The trial became notorious as the courtroom heard the couple had had a tempestuous relationship. They were involved in wife-swapping parties and Mrs Park had embarked on affairs with several men. In December 1974, Mrs Park moved to Middlesbrough to live with policeman David Brearley, whom she had met at an Open University summer school. She planned to marry him, but after failing to win custody of the couple's three children in 1975, she reluctantly returned to the marital home. Meanwhile, Park had relationships with at least two women before agreeing to give his marriage a second chance. However, the arguments and accusations of infidelity continued and it was against this background that Park was found to have murdered his wife. The court case was told that he had smashed her in the face with a climber's ice-axe, and kept her body in the freezer until deciding to dispose of it. Her skeletal remains were dressed in a faded blue baby-doll nightdress when they were found in the lake. The retired schoolmaster was on holiday in France with his third wife when he was told the body had been found, and is said to have uttered the words 'Oh dear,' in a phone call after being informed of the discovery. He had claimed that on the day of his first wife's disappearance, he had left her in bed while he took the children to Blackpool for the day, and that she was gone when they returned. However, he did not report her missing for six weeks. Park, said to be a control freak, was said to have become frustrated and jealous, and was unable to control his wife. Police believe Mrs Park was preparing to press for a divorce but was determined to keep the family bungalow and custody of the children, and it may have been this that sparked Park's anger. While in prison on remand in October 1997, he admitted the killing, telling fellow inmates 'she deserved it' after he discovered her in bed with another man. Family members, however, never stopped believing in his innocence and campaigned for a retrial. His children Jeremy, Rachael and Vanessa, and third wife Jenny, have campaigned tirelessly to prove his innocence since he was jailed.","Gordon Park was convicted of killing wife Carol and dumping her body .

Chief Deputy Heath Velliquette said the search is continuing for Miss Bruck, from Maybee. They have interviewed multiple people and investigated hundreds of tips. A witness reported seeing Miss Bruck walking about 3am with a man as the party was winding down.The sheriff's office published a sketch of the man she was seen with in a parking lot. The dark-haired man had thin stubble and wore glasses with a black hoodie. The man has not been identified and police have not named him as a suspect. Monroe Police also singled out four men who were wearing orange security shirts at the party to talk to. There have been no updates on whether they are connected to the case, NBC reported. In a missing person appeal, Chelsea Bruck is described as 5'7' tall, 140lbs, blonde, with a small anchor tattoo behind her right ear. She was last seen wearing black yoga pants, a black wig and a leaf-covered vest.

"Thousands of people due to buy and sell their homes faced delays and the risk of putting lengthy property chains in jeopardy today after the system used to electronically transfer money failed. The Bank of England said the mechanism it uses to transfer payments between commercial banks - which includes that used to purchase houses - was hit by technical problems and was suspended at 6am today. It is unable to give an indication when the system will be running again. The Bank of England said it could guarantee all payments would be processed but was unable to confirm whether these would all be done today. The Bank of England announced that a system used to make computerised payments went down at 6am today . This means some property transactions, particularly those involving long chains, could be put at risk. The Bank of England said computerised payments on the Real Time Gross Settlement Payment System (RTGS) were suspended this morning because of a technical issue, which has also affected its Chaps (Clearing House Automated Payment System) system. Chaps is used to carry out same-day electronic payments for house purchases and is used in the majority of property transactions. The system handles on average 138,245 transactions per day, worth around £277bn. These transactions include short term lending between financial institutions, foreign exchange and house purchases. The failure of the Chaps system, which processes 5,000 property transactions a day, could risk chains . Chaps is used by 5,000 financial institutions. A spokeswoman for the Bank of England said the issues were caused by a 'manual update' over the weekend. Mark Carney is the Governor of the Bank of England . She said that the bank could guarantee it would process all transactions but could not say when these would all be completed, as it would depend on when the system was back online. The Bank said it has a number of options open to it to ensure payments made today will be cleared, such as an extending the working day. Chaps is a separate organisation to the Bank, funded by lenders who pay fees to use its services. However, Chaps does use the Bank’s RTGS network to run its system. The Chaps service usually closes at 4pm each day but Phil Kenworthy, CHAPS Managing Director confirmed it will stay open longer today to process payments. He advised anyone due to make payments using Chaps to contact their bank. A spokeswoman for Chaps said that while the system handles a lot of house purchases, people who wanted to pay a deposit could do so using the faster payments system as long as the payment was below £100,000. Faster payments and direct debits have not been affected by the issue. Andrew Montlake, from mortgage broker Coreco, told the Guardian: 'If there are going to be Chaps issues then we won't know yet – transfers usually need to be done by 3pm if someone is to complete on that day. It's worth adding that Monday is not the biggest completion day – Fridays tend to be the most popular day.' The Bank of England said the most important payments in the wider RTGS system are being handled manually. It added that it was working to resolve the issue. In a statement it said: 'The Bank of England has identified a technical issue related to some routine maintenance of the RTGS payment system and has paused settlement while we resolve it. 'We are working to address this issue as quickly as possible, and restart the RTGS payment system in a controlled manner.' The system was restored at 4pm, and the Bank of England said opening hours would be extended until 8pm to deal with the backlog of payments. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, confirmed he would be carrying out an independent review into the cause of the problems and the effectiveness of the bank's response. A statement from Chaps said: 'We are pleased to report that the problem was resolved mid-afternoon and, following an extension to the CHAPS processing day, just under 143,000 payments were settled - in line with the normal average day's volumes.'","Bank of England system for transferring money  went down at 6am .

"A car used as a Halloween prop - complete with a zombie driver - has been clamped by DVLA jobsworths. The blue Vauxhall Astra estate was part of a gruesome mocked-up car crash on private land outside The Anchor, Darwen, Lancashire. It had no engine, only one front wheel and a model zombie covered in fake blood in the passengers seat. The Halloween prop was clamped by 'embarrassed' DVLA workers on Monday morning . House of horrors: The Anchor goes to great lengths to transform itself for Halloween . Not a treat: Melissa and Lance Montgomery have been left dumbstruck by the DVLA's Halloween trick . Licensees Melissa and Lance Montgomery and their regulars were surprised to see the car being clamped by workmen from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The yellow immobilising device was put in place on Monday morning - but Lance said the wheel was not properly attached to the specially modified car. The car was part of Melissa and Lance's typically elaborate Halloween display, which also featured boarded-up windows and a host of scary goings-on inside the pub. Melissa, who has been at the pub for two years, said she was amazed when DVLA workmen turned up to put on the clamp. She said: 'They seemed a bit embarrassed to be honest and I felt quite sorry for them. 'I offered to make them a cup of tea!' A spokesman for the DVLA said the car was parked on public land . Licensee Melissa Montgomery said she offered the 'embarrassed' workers a cup of tea . Stunned regulars could not believe their eyes and took to Facebook to voice their shock at what had gone on. Martin Ainsworth said: 'I have just been to The Anchor to say hi to my friends Mel and Lance and see how they got on with their Halloween weekend and the DVLA have clamped the prop zombie car outside! 'They say it has no MOT. It has also got no engine and half the front is missing, because it's a Halloween prop on private property. 'Are these people actually serious?' The Halloween prop has no engine, yet it was clamped by the DVLA on Monday morning . Paul Fisher said: 'Can't believe what I witnessed this morning while waiting for the bus outside The Anchor. 'Some jobsworth clamping the Halloween car. Shocking.' A spokesman for the DVLA said the car did not have Statutory Off Road Notification and had been stickered three days previously. Cars that have Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) do not need annual MOT tests. All cars that do not have SORN need to be taxed and insured. A SORN can be lodged if an owner does not use or keep their vehicle on public land. A SORN is valid until a vehicle is sold or scrapped, or it is taxed. He said DVLA agents are not allowed to lift a car's bonnet and there was no way of knowing the prop did not have an engine. 'The car was parked on public land and there was no sign or sticker to tell us it was a prop,' he said. 'On the face of it it was an intact vehicle. We've done nothing wrong.' But Lance Montgomery said it was obvious that the car was a prop and that the clamped wheel was not properly attached to the car.

"Tablets are now more important to children than their TVs, with more than one-third of young people aged five to 15 owning their own device. Around 34 per cent of children in this category own their own tablet, which is up from 19 per cent last year, according to official figures. And six in ten children use a tablet at home - a 50 per cent increase on 2013 - while the number of children with televisions in their rooms has fallen by a third in five years. Tablets are now more important to children than their TVs, with more than one-third of children aged five to 15 owning their own device, according to research from Ofcom . The rapid increase means that some preschoolers are using a tablet to surf the web, play games and watch video clips. The report by UK regulator Ofcom found that 11 per cent of children aged three and four have their own tablet, up from three per cent last year. The number of five to 15-year-olds who use a tablet to go online has doubled to 42 per cent since last year, while the proportion of children using the internet via a PC or laptop fell for the first time, by three per cent, to 88 per cent. As well as replacing TVs, fewer children also have games consoles in their bedrooms as tablets take over the role. The report also revealed girls prefer more 'sociable' media, sending more texts and making more mobile calls than boys in a typical week. Almost half of older girls claim that a mobile phone is the device they would most miss, compared to 29 per cent of older boys . The number who have radios in the bedroom has halved from 32 per cent in 2009. Meanwhile, 20 per cent of children are watching TV on a tablet 33 per cent watch on-demand TV. The report also revealed that girls prefer more 'sociable' media, sending more texts and making more mobile calls than boys, during a typical week. Teens have abandoned Facebook in favour of Instagram and Twitter, researchers have found. A survey by investment bank Piper Jaffray found that more than 9 out of 10 teenagers regularly use social media. It reveals Facebook's fall from grace has been sudden - from being used by 72 per cent of teens in the spring, to just 45 per cent now. In the survey, analysts examined how children's social media preferences have changed over the last six months. Instagram has become even more popular, with 76 percent of teens currently saying they use it - up 7 percent since last spring. Twitter ranked second, used by 59 per cent of teens. Facebook came in third. Pinterest and Tumblr each claimed a little over 20 per cent. Another 20 per cent of teens said they use 'other' social networks, not named in the survey but likely to include the disappearing-message app Snapchat. Almost half of older girls claim that a mobile phone is the device they would most miss, compared to 29 per cent of older boys. But girls and boys aged 12 to 15 are equally active on social media, with 71 per cent having a profile. That said, girls are more likely to use Instagram, Snapchat and Tumblr. Just one social media site - YouTube - attracts more boys, who are nearly twice as likely as girls aged 12 to 15 to use it. Ofcom said nine in 10 parents whose children go online were taking steps to help their children manage risks when using the internet. The most popular methods included supervising their children online, talking to children about managing online risks and having rules in place about use of the internet. Separate research earlier this week found that the iPad has now overtaken household names such as McDonalds and Disney to become the number one brand among American 6 and 12-year-olds. The annual study, conducted by  research firm Smarty Pants, ranks more than 250 brands each year. 'iPad's number one status among kids represents the culmination of the 'tablet takeover' - a movement from shared screens and TV network dominance to curated content on personal devices,' said Wynne Tyree, president of Smarty Pants. 'Kids increasingly turn to iPad for games, TV shows, videos, books, homework help and communicating with friends and family.' Around 34 per cent of children own their own tablet, up from 19 per cent last year, according to a recent report.

"A waiter faces being split up from his civil partner and family and deported to South Africa after government officials claim he does not earn enough to live in the UK. Couple Matt Mallinson, 24, and Brett Rice, 28, who entered into a civil partnership in 2012, are currently battling a Home Office order which could see Mr Rice deported to South Africa or his birthplace of Zimbabwe. The Home Office claim Mr Rice falls short of earning brackets by just £300, under rules designed to make sure foreign migrants and their partners do not rely on taxpayers to support them. But the couple say their forms were filled in while Mr Rice was still a student at the University of Huddersfield, and only able to work part time. Couple Matt Mallinson (right), 24, and Brett Rice (left), 28, who entered into a civil partnership in 2012, are currently battling a Home Office order which could see Mr Rice deported to South Africa or his birthplace of Zimbabwe . He now has a full-time job as a waiter, which takes him well past the earnings threshold. If Mr Rice is deported he will not only be split from his partner but from his own parents, Len and Cynthia, who have lived in Huddersfield for five years after moving from South Africa. The couple also fear what will happen if Mr Rice is sent back to South Africa or Zimbabwe, due to their tough stance regarding homosexuality. Mr Mallinson, who is from Sittingbourne in Kent, currently lives with Mr Rice and his parents in Huddersfield. Mr Rice (left) with Mr Mallinson celebrating their civil partnership in 2012. The Home Office claim Mr Rice falls short of earning brackets by just £300, under rules designed to make sure foreign migrants and their partners do not rely on taxpayers to support them . 'It is a very worrying time as it was my understanding that we could appeal the decision,' said Mr Rice. 'Now we have been surprised by the case going straight to court and I have to await legal consultation as my lawyer has had to hand my case over. 'I'm not sure what is going to happen or where I might be going. 'The Home Office say we have to alert them to any changes such as losing a job but they now refuse to accept that my circumstances have changed considerably since the application.' The couple awaited the Home Office response but had heard nothing back until they were presented with a letter stating that they will have to appear in court on November 18. The couple say their forms were filled in while Mr Rice was still a student, and only able to work part time. He now has a full-time job as a waiter, which takes him well past the earnings threshold . The UK Border Agency has also insisted that Mr Rice has spent 26 years in South Africa, even though  he came to the UK in 2009 to study at university. He has only ever returned to South Africa in 2012, in order to apply for his visa. He said: 'It has been very stressful situation for all of us to deal with. We both have been working very hard trying to ensure we reach the earnings requirement. 'Despite the fact we now earning the acceptable amount, we have been told it will not be taken into account. 'It is very upsetting but we are trying to not think too much about the worst possible outcome. It is a really difficult situation for us to face.' The Home Office have insisted that they will only look at figures dating from the time of the application. A spokesman for the Home Office said the family rules were brought in to make sure that foreign spouses and partners do not become reliant on the taxpayer for financial support, and are well enough supported to integrate effectively. He added: 'This is fair to applicants and to the rest of the public, and has been upheld by the Court of Appeal.' An online petition has now been launched to urge Home Secretary Theresa May to put pressure on Home Office officials, which has already attracted more than 2,000 supporters.

"A Russian angler got the surprise of his life when he discovered the mysterious fish he had just caught had human-looking teeth. Bringing a new meaning to the phrase 'getting a bite', Aleks Korobov thought he had caught a simple common bream until a closer inspection revealed the fish had large incisors bearing an uncanny resemblance to those found in a human mouth. The 50-year-old - who lives in Arkhangelsk in north west Russia's Arkhangelsk Oblast region - was so shocked by the site that he immediately dropped the fish - although he quickly regained his composure and rushed off the show his friends at his local pub. Scroll down for video . Shock: Fisherman Aleks Korobov thought he had caught a simple common bream until a closer inspection revealed the fish had large incisors bearing an uncanny resemblance to those found in a human mouth . Mystery: Mr Korobov initially believed the fish to be a common bream and was considering discarding it as the animal was already dead when he caught it . When Mr Korobov's friends heard that the angler had caught a fish with human teeth on the Northern Dvina River, their initial reaction was to assume it was just another one of his many jokes. 'We know Aleks can tell some tall tales but when he came in and said he had a fish with human teeth we thought he'd certainly been drinking,' his friend Ppal Anton Efimov said. 'But then he got it out and we were totally shocked...None of us had ever seen anything like it in our lives,' the 60-year-old added. Mr Korobov initially believed the fish to be a common bream and was considering discarding it as the animal was already dead when he caught it. But as it still smelt fresh, Mr Korobov decided to inspect the fish more closely in the hope of working out how long ago it had died. It was upon doing so that he discovered its unusual teeth. Experts at the Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography believe the fish is some sort of vegetarian piranha . Surprise: Aleks Korobov initially  dropped the fish after spotting its human-like teeth.

Comic: When his friends heard Aleks Korobov (pictured) had caught a fish with human teeth on the Northern Dvina River, their initial reaction was to assume it was just another one of his many jokes . After showing the fish to his friends, Mr Korobov contacted the Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography for their expert opinion on the mysterious creature. Institute expert Gennady Dvorykankin said: 'We had to do an autopsy and carry out a series of examinations to determine the species and an explanation for the teeth. 'We are convinced it is a member of the Piranha family, and that it is a herbivore piranha - not one of the meat eating ones you see in films. 'It is very unlikely that it made its way from its natural tropical waters to our Arctic and then into the river, so we can only assume it was dumped by an owner of exotic fish,' he added. For his part Mr Korobov is simply happy to have proved his cynical friends wrong, saying: 'I don't think people will be doubting my fishing stories again after this.'","Russian Aleks Korobov initially thought he'd caught a simple common bream .

"A group of 'pathetically fat' NYPD cops has been forced to chip in for a room full of exercise equipment to get them back into shape. A number of officers at the Community Affairs Division have seen their weight balloon while being on the job, with some pushing the scales at nearly 300 pounds. This has left them  in no condition to ever chase down a suspect if they are called upon to do so in the course of duty. A number of officers at the Community Affairs Division have seen their weight balloon while being on the job, with some pushing the scales at nearly 300 pounds (file picture) Super-fit Inspector Ellen Chang has ordered the overweight officers to stump up $30 each to kit out their East 12th Street headquarters with gym gear, the New York Post reported. The exercise equipment designed to whip the chunky cops into shape includes a stationary bike, a treadmill, a StairMaster and 350 pounds of free weights, . 'They are mostly all pathetically fat,' a source told the paper. 'They get heavy on the job. 'There's a lot of sitting around and eating Twinkies at your desk.' A New York Post reporter said they spotted an overweight Community Affairs officer entering the building carrying a bag from Dunkin' Donuts . But some heavyset officers appear to be less than happy at the new get-fit plans, with one even labeling them as 'bulls**t'. Sources told the Post that Inspector Chang is cracking the whip, regularly telling the obese officers: 'You guys could stand to work out more' and 'You should really hit a gym.' 'I've done two half-triathlons and run in three marathons here in the city, so I wanted to get the guys and gals here motivated and have some equipment on site for them,' she added. The Community Affairs Division handles police relations with various community groups but it does not demand any physical work from the approximately 30 cops assigned there. On Monday, a Post reporter said they spotted an overweight Community Affairs officer entering the building carrying a bag from Dunkin' Donuts. Inspector Chang also said she thought her weight-loss program was 'going well'. She added: 'I don't think there was any resistance at all.' But one overweight cop insisted that he he hated the fitness plan and was unhappy about having to fund the new gym equipment. 'It's not right that we've gotta pay for something she wants,' he said. 'And if you say, 'No,' you get told. 'You could use the exercise.' ' Inspector Chang denied that cops were being forced to hand over any cash toward her fitness program. She claimed that she used money from the NYPD's 'reserve fund' and received one piece of used equipment from 'the guy who runs the gym at headquarters downtown'. 'I actually kicked in money from my own pocket,' she added.","Inspector Ellen Chang ordered overweight officers to stump up $30 each .

"It’s probably the last thing you feel like doing first thing in the morning - but smiling after being rudely awakened is compulsory with this latest app. Dubbed ‘Smile Clock’, the app requires users to grin into their smartphone camera before its incessant buzzing is turned off. The camera tracks key features on a user’s face and then determines whether that person is happy enough to be allowed out of bed. Scroll down for video . Say Cheese! Dubbed ‘Smile Clock’, the app requires users to grin into their smartphone camera before its incessant buzzing is turned off . It even helps the user crack a genuine smile by showing pre-selected images, or playing songs designed to make someone’s day. Developed by Israel-based developers Appfro, the free app will save a picture of the user smiling in a photo gallery as a reminder. It is currently only available for Android devices, and includes a snooze feature for the days that users don’t feel like smiling. For bearded snoozers, the app may not work as well. ‘Thick facial hair interrupts the smile detection process,’ the company wrote on Google Play. The alarm clock app wakes a person up with the sound of sizzling bacon, while a connected scent device emits a bacon perfume . For many people, a hearty fried breakfast including a couple of rashers of bacon is a desirable way to start the day. But as cooked breakfast or a bacon sandwich isn’t the healthiest option, a new iPhone app and device that wafts the appealing smell of the cured meat could prove to be a more sensible option. The alarm clock app wakes a person up with the sound of sizzling bacon, while a connected scent device emits a bacon perfume. The ‘wake up and smell the bacon’ app has been developed by Oscar Mayer – a manufacturer of bacon and other meats in the U.S. To set the bacon alarm, a user rotates a frying pan and will be awoken at their chosen time by the sound of sizzling and a picture of the meat cooking. The device which generates the bacon aroma plugs into the iPhone’s headphone jack and releases a spritz of the meaty perfume to coincide with the sizzling alarm. The app also only works in landscape. ‘Great idea, but need to auto detect orientation or be able to set to portrait for phone,’ wrote one reviewer.

"A premature baby survived after his mother twice defied doctors who told her nothing could be done for her baby and it was ‘going to die’. Rachel Crockett, 25, was told she was having a miscarriage when her waters broke at 22 weeks and five days. When scans revealed the baby had a heartbeat, she and her partner, Craig Walkow, said they wanted their baby to be saved. But they were told by hospital staff that it would be treated as a miscarriage - and that if they wanted to save their child, they would need to find a hospital with the facilities to help under-developed babies. Scroll down for video . Rachel Crockett has called for the abortion limit to be lowered from 24 to 20 weeks after her son Connor, with partner Craig Walkow, was born at 23 weeks . Miss Crockett was told she was having a miscarriage when her waters broke at 22 weeks, but scans revealed her baby had a heartbeat. The couple were forced to drive more than 35 miles from Milton Keynes to Oxford after medics said they could not look after a baby born so premature . Miss Crockett, who had been haemorrhaging, then had to lie and say the bleeding had stopped because she was not allowed to transfer to another hospital while it continued. Her determination to fight for her unborn child meant she was moved from Milton Keynes Hospital in Buckinghamshire to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, 35 miles away. Her baby, Connor, was born the following day at 23 weeks and two days, weighing 1lb 2oz. Earlier this month he celebrated his first birthday. Miss Crockett yesterday called on maternity units to do more to save babies routinely considered ‘unviable’. She also made an emotional plea for the abortion limit to be lowered to take into account the development of foetuses inside the womb and advances in medicine that are allowing more to survive when they do not reach full-term. Details of her case come a week after it was revealed another premature baby only survived because he was 0.7 of an ounce over the cut-off point at which medics would fight to save his life. Miss Crockett, from Wing, Buckinghamshire, said: ‘If I had listened to staff at Milton Keynes I would have given up hope and potentially accepted that I would miscarry. ‘Had I not been transferred because I insisted then he would have died,’ said Miss Crockett . ‘It’s always right to be honest with patients but there does need to be more hope and babies need to be given a chance to try and survive.’ She added: ‘I think the abortion limit should be lowered to 20 weeks – especially considering what happened with Connor. By then, you can see their sex – they are a person.’ Connor, was born at 23 weeks and two days, weighing 1lb 2oz on October 8, last year. The tiny baby was slipped into something similar to a freezer bag to help regulate his temperature . The youngster has just celebrated his first birthday after spending the first 75 days of his life on a ventilator . Miss Crockett, a carer for the elderly who is currently on maternity leave, and Mr Walkow, a 38-year-old groundworker, were in a restaurant when her waters broke. An ambulance took her to hospital in Milton Keynes where she was told she was about to miscarry. She says she was informed: ‘Your baby is going to die’. ‘We were told to say goodbye to Connor. It felt like the end of the world. We were numb,’ said Miss Crockett. ‘But when we kept going for scans we were told there was still a heartbeat and I was saying if there is still a heartbeat there is still a chance he could live. ‘They said they couldn’t do anything if he was to come. We thought we would never get the baby we always wanted but Craig and I pushed them to ring other hospitals. ‘We were so relieved when John Radcliffe Hospital said they would take us. But I was told I could only be transferred if I stopped haemorrhaging so I had to lie and told them I had. ‘If I hadn’t lied, Connor wouldn’t be here as he came just the next day.’ The tiny baby was slipped into something similar to a freezer bag to help regulate his temperature when he was born on October 8 last year. He was then placed in an incubator and spent the first 75 days of his life on a ventilator while his lungs developed. Overall, he spent seven months in hospital, during which he had a bleed on the brain which, fortunately, mended itself. He also had fungal meningitis which was treated with antibiotics and three operations for a perforated bowel. Connor is pictured last Christmas with his parents while he was still being cared for at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford . And laser eye surgery was needed to treat a condition caused by the oxygen being pumped into his lungs which meant the retinas were starting to detach from his eyes. Connor spent a further two weeks in Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Aylesbury, near his home, before finally being allowed home. His lungs are still developing and he remains permanently on oxygen for the time being but is expected to grow up with no mental or physical disabilities. Milton Keynes hospital says it has a neonatal unit for babies born after 27 weeks and a neonatal intensive care unit for those born before that. A spokesman said: 'When a mother has any complications that may necessitate delivery at 23 or 24 weeks, decision around her care are tailored according to her needs and made by consultants. 'These decisions are based around balancing the risk to the baby being born outside (the intensive care unit), against the risk of the baby being born en-route to another hospital and the likelihood of survival.' The British Association of Perinatal Medicine advises hospitals it is best practice for 'resuscitation not be carried out' if a baby is born with complications before they get to 23 weeks. Details of Connor's case came a week after it emerged Lucas Moore, one, who was born at 23 weeks and two days, was only given medical care because he weighed 520g – 20g over the cut-off point at Coventry University Hospital. His parents were then told to consider switching off his life-support because he had a bleed on the brain. Lucas suffered a number of other complications and spent 109 days in hospital but is now perfectly healthy.","Rachel Crockett, 25, was told she was having a miscarriage when her waters broke at 22 weeks - two weeks before the abortion limit .

'Being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day. 'It’s made me more empathetic, which has led to a richer life.' He added: 'If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is, or bring comfort to anyone who feels alone, or inspire people to insist on their equality, then it’s worth the trade-off with my own privacy.' Part of social progress, Mr Cook explained, is understanding that a person is not defined by singular characteristics like their sexuality, and urged readers to remember that he is also engineer, an uncle, a nature lover, a fitness nut, a son of the South, a sports fanatic, and many other things. But he conceded that he is part of a minority that could greatly benefit from his support. Throughout the 800-word essay, Mr Cook describes a 'tough and uncomfortable' existence at times from his 'humble roots' in Alabama to global success in Silicon Valley. America, he said, 'has changed so much since I was a kid' and is moving towards equality, something helped by brave public figures that had come out and changed public perceptions. Mr Cook, pictured at Pride on June 29, said coming out wasn't 'an easy choice' because he guarded his privacy but 'if hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone, then it's worth the trade-off with my own privacy' A tweet from Mr Cook on June 29 congratulating his thousands of employees who part in the gay pride parade . Nonetheless, with laws still in place across the U.S. that make sexuality a sack-able offense, he said being gay has given him a 'deeper understanding' of what it means to be a minority. It had also made him more confident in his own identity, helped him 'rise above adversity and bigotry' and to develop the 'skin of a rhinoceros' that it takes to run a company like Apple. The motivation to write this article was inspired by the pictures on his office wall of Robert F Kennedy and Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who said: 'Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ""What are you doing for others?""' While not considering himself an 'activist', Mr Cook said he realizes how much he had benefited from the 'sacrifice of others' so knew he needed to speak out. He said Apple had long advocated for human rights and equality. For example, he lists Apple's support of a workplace equality bill before Congress, and of marriage equality in California. In February, the company issued a public appeal to the state of Arizona urging them to abandon an anti-gay bill that would permit discrimination on religious grounds. The company, he said, holds up Dr King and Kennedy as icons for that ideal. Mr Cook wrote: 'I don’t pretend that writing this puts me in their league. 'All it does is allow me to look at those pictures and know that I’m doing my part, however small, to help others. 'We pave the sunlit path toward justice together, brick by brick. This is my brick.' In June, shortly before Mr Cook attended San Francisco's 44th annual Gay Pride Parade, he was accidentally outed on a CNBC current affairs show live on-air. Mr Cook was outed live on air during CNBC's Friday night edition of Squawk in June by Simon Hobbs . After Mr Hobbs made the remark the studio went silent as he tried and failed to recover from the comment . Simon Hobbs was one of several co-hosts when New York Times columnist Jim Stewart appeared on CNBC's Friday edition of Squawk on the Street to talk about an article he'd written that explores the dearth of openly gay CEOs. Speaking about how former CEO of BP Lord Browne became the first person at a Fortune 500 company to publicly acknowledge that he is gay, Mr Stewart said there's a 'corporate culture that prevents powerful gay men from going public.' He said: 'You’d think CEOs especially are measured by objective criteria, financial performance. Mr Stewart then went on to say that he had contacted a number of CEOs for a comment for his story and received a 'very cool reception'. Then co-host Mr Hobbs piped up, saying, 'I think Tim Cook is fairly open about the fact he’s gay at the head of Apple, isn’t he?' For a moment, a deafening silence filled the studio as the hosts looked awkwardly from one to the other before Mr Stewart, shaking his head in disapproval, responds with a succinct, 'No.' Hobbs tried to recover, 'Oh, dear, was that an error? I thought he was open about it.' Tim Cook was born in Alabama and attended Auburn University. After graduating he spent 12 years at IBM, rising to become director of North American Fulfillment. He then served as Chief Operating Officer of the computer re-seller division of Intelligent Electronics and was Vice President for Corporate Materials at Compaq for six months. Mr Cook joined Apple in 1998 - two years after being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Despite being advised to stay with Compaq, Mr Cook said he wanted to join Apple within five minutes of meeting Steve Jobs. Mr Cook later said the offer was a 'once in a lifetime opportunity' to work with a 'creative genius'. Mr Cook's first job was as Senior Vice President for Worldwide Operations. He also worked as Executive Vice President of Worldwide Sales and Operations and was Chief Operating Officer until he was named the CEO on August 24, 2011, when he succeeded Mr Jobs . Since taking over as CEO, Mr Cook has overseen the introduction and launch of five new iPhones, including the current iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, as well as 7 new iPads, including the iPad mini. The company will also introduce its first smartwatch in early 2015; The Apple Watch. Under Mr Cook, Apple also purchased Beats Audio, the headphones and music firm owned by rapper Dr Dre, in a multi-billion dollar deal concluded earlier this year. According to the Interbrand Best Global Brands report, Apple is currently the world's most valuable brand, with a valuation of $118.9 billion. Earlier this month the firm announced record iPhone sales as part of their quarterly results. The record-breaking launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus - with 10 million units sold in the first weekend, meant the technology giant reported net profit of $8.5 billion for the final quarter of 2014. Up to the time of the announcement, 40 million iPhones had been sold in Q4. Since then, the new iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 have also gone on sale. Mr Cook also serves on the board of directors of Nike, Inc.and the National Football Foundation.","Tim Cook said he had never denied his sexuality and his colleagues knew .

"The United States is holding on to a stockpile of enriched uranium for use in nuclear warheads to destroy asteroids in 'planetary defense,' the Wall Street Journal reports. Auditors were examining how the National Nuclear Security Administration was progressing in removing excess capacity, when the agency gave them a unique reason for extra material. A stockpile of components called canned subassemblies, the steel capsule within a nuclear bomb that contains the highly enriched uranium,.were slated to be decommissioned in 2015. Scroll down for video . Destruction: The meteor that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, destroyed buildings and shattered glass, injuring more than a 1,000 people . The NNSA told investigators that they'd be holding onto them indefinitely. 'CSAs associated with a certain warhead indicated as excess in the 2012 Production and Planning Directive are being retained in an indeterminate state,' read a report by investigators, 'pending a senior-level government evaluation of their use in planetary defense against earthbound asteroids.' Quartz writes that the 'pending' evaluation means there is contingency planning for an asteroid striking Earth happening in the highest levels of government. Jay Melos, a geophysicist at Purdue University who studies impact cratering, theorized that the plan may be 'an excuse for keeping the nuclear arsenal together.' Melos and other researchers believe more effective tools can be developed that redirect asteroids. In 2005, NASA's Deep Impact spacecraft launched an impactor that successfully collided with the Tempel I comet and knocked it slightly off course. Explosion: Witness accounts reported a long, loud blast and extreme heat from the meteor exploding in the atmosphere . Crater: The rock finally crashed through the frozen surface of Lake Chebarkul, near the city center, averting more destruction . As for earthbound asteroids, nuclear scientists may be looking to use nuclear weapons to destroy small-sized asteroids like the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia, in 2013, before they enter Earth's atmosphere. The 65-foot-diameter asteroid became a meteor once it entered Earth's atmosphere and crashed through the frozen surface of Lake Chebarkul. More than 1,000 people were injured by the blast, mostly due to glass shattering in the explosion.","Researchers at the National Nuclear Security Administration said that uranium slated to be decommissioned in 2015 would be held indefinitely while plans for planetary defense are considered .

"The company behind the popular Thermomix kitchen appliance have responded to fierce criticism of their alleged 'shonky' antics with a lemonade recipe. Thermomix caused controversy last month when they surprised customers with the release of the first new model in seven years. Many so-called 'Thermo fans', who had only recently purchased the older TM31 model, were furious. Some said the company had told them there was not going to be a new Thermomix. After consumer group CHOICE awarded them a Shonky Award yesterday, Thermomix Australia released a Facebook statement featuring the lemonade recipe. Sunny side up: Thermomix in Australia posted this lemonade recipe among a pledge to regain customers' trust . The Thermomix, pictured, has an enormous following. But many customers were furious when the company sprung an expensive new model on them without warning . 'As the old saying goes: When life gives you lemons, make lemonade,' Thermomix said in the post, which featured a picture of a jug of lemon juice. The statement went on to note the device had scored well in CHOICE kitchen tests in the past, before providing a link to the citrus recipe. 'We are working hard to win back the support of all of our customers and hope we will again be voted a Top Scorer in the Choice Test in the future. 'Please enjoy this recipe for Thermomix lemonade,' the statement said, before promising more lemonade recipes would be available shortly. While many customers came to the defence of Thermomix's product, Facebook user Tanya Wilks said: 'Tackling the issue by posting a recipe about turning lemons into lemonade is insulting to say the very least.' The Thermomix is extraordinarily popular and has received positive reviews from CHOICE. But the company's behaviour has been the target of scathing criticism . A cook, surrounded by all of the products she has made with a Thermomix . 'How disgusting Thermomix Australia,' Julie Calleja wrote. 'Making fun of customers who are disappointed in your product by offering a... lemon recipe.' Christi Britt, who labelled the move 'condescending', said: 'I am offended that Thermomix Australia thinks that a lemonade recipe might somehow make customers overlook the deceit.' CHOICE has stepped up its demands for consumers to be compensated in the washup from yesterday's awards. The consumer organisation is calling on Thermomix to provide customers who purchased the TM31 in the three months before the new TM5 model was released with either: a full refund, a $250 discount or an upgrade to the new machine for $50. Customers were vocal in their anger after the latest device was released last month. A Change.org petition garnered more than 2500 signatures. 'I have only had my thermomix for just over a month when the new one was launched,' signatory Kim Burgess wrote. 'This has left a bitter taste to what was to be an exciting purchase.' Andrew Dickson wrote: 'My wife just bought one after wanting one for 2 years. Even asked the consultant if there was a new one coming out and was told no.' Consumers and CHOICE have threatened to bring the apparent deception to the attention of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). An ACCC spokesman said it does not comment on whether it is conducting particular investigations.","Thermomix respond to latest barrage of criticism with recipe .

"President Barack Obama cast his vote early for the 2014 midterm elections in a bid to get voters to go to the polls  ahead of election day. The president voted in a community center in Chicago - named after the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., - near his family's home on Chicago's South Side. 'The most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen,' the president told reporters at the Center, as he took advantage of the first day of early voting in Illinois. Scroll down for video . Paperwork: President Barack Obama is handed his ballot as he arrives to vote early at Dr. Martin Luther King Community Service Center in Chicago on Monday . Vote:  Obama, left, cast his ballot alongside an unidentified woman, right, in Chicago . Symbolic: President Obama's gesture was widely seen as being symbolic as he explained that the most 'important job in a democracy is the job of citizen' to vote . 'I’m so glad I can early vote. It’s so exciting. I love voting,' the president said, in a not-so-subtle way. Adding: 'Everybody in Illinois [should] vote early. It’s a wonderful opportunity.' Before he was handed his ballot, a poll worker asked if he was Barack Obama, according to Politico. 'That’s me,' he said. However, his gesture was widely seen as being symbolic as he explained that the most 'important job in a democracy is the job of citizen.' Obama also delivered doughnuts and pastries to Democratic campaign volunteers in Chicago to boost moral on Monday. He carried  the boxes of pastries into a Pat Quinn campaign office as Governor Pat Quinn and Senator Dick Durbin stood alongside him. 'The way we win any election is making sure we turn out,' he told the room full of volunteers. And on Sunday night, the president did not shy away from saying exactly who he was likely to cast his vote for at a rally for Illinois Governor Pat Quinn. The governor is running for re-election in Obama's home state. A fired up Obama told a crowd at Chicago State University, that he would vote early for Quinn and Sen. Dick Durbin. 'The first thing I'm gonna do tomorrow is cast my vote to re-elect Dick Durbin and give my friend Pat Quinn four more years as governor of the great state of Illinois,' Obama said.

Votes: The president stands with Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn, left, and U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, right, Obama said that he plans to vote for both in the elections . Obama described Durbin as a mentor who took him under his wing when he first became a senator in 2005. He said: 'Durbin helped make sure that I didn't get into too much trouble.' However, another stop made by the president on the campaign trail Sunday was marred by a steady stream of crowd members leaving early and even a yelling heckler. The president was at the Democratic rally in Upper Marlboro, Maryland, near Washington, to support Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, who is running for governor. But as Obama's approval levels drop to record lows, many candidates from his party have been reluctant to appear with the president during their election races because of his waning popularity. Rare appearance:  President Obama looks on in Maryland on Sunday night to support Lieutenant Governor Anthony Brown, right, but his speech was marred with people walking out . Crowd control: A campaign worker, center, attempts to encourage people to stop leaving while President Obama was speaking on Sunday . Rally: Many Democrats have been wary of appearing with the president during their election races . Obama and other Democrats have been urging their supporters to vote early this year instead of waiting until Election Day. His party is hoping to turn out Democratic-leaning voters, including minorities and young people, who frequently skip voting in midterm years. In 2012, Democrats proved that they could use early voting as a tactic against the Republicans to give them a head start. The strong turnout for early voting is widely seen as one of the things which helped Obama beat Mitt Romney in battleground states like Iowa. At least 33 states will offer early voting this year, which has led both parties to encourage voters to take to the polls early. Republicans have even decided to invest in early voting in states where there are tight Senate contests this year.","The President cast his vote at a community center named after Dr Martin Luther King .

"Joan Lunden bravely appeared bald on this week's cover of People magazine, and now she's revealed why she decided to make her battle with breast cancer public. 'Sometimes, you just want to give voice to other people,' she told Today's Hoda Kotb and Matt Lauer Tuesday morning. The former Good Morning America host, 64, has undergone chemotherapy and a lumpectomy since her diagnosis with triple negative breast cancer in June. Scroll down for video . Brave: Joan Lunden appeared on the Today show Tuesday morning to discuss her public battle with breast cancer . 'You want to put a face that says ""All right, I'm going through this, but I'm still me."" And I think women are incredibly tied up in their hair,' she said. She continued: 'Twenty years ago, women didn't talk about this. In fact, women wouldn't go and get a breast exam because they were so afraid of losing their hair or losing their breast. And that's still going on today. But what's the alternative? It's losing your life.' She also said she feels a responsibility to encourage other women to have regular breast exams. New outlook: 'It's a shame you have to go through something that almost takes life away to appreciate it more,' Ms Lunden said during an interview at her home . 'By assuming this role and trying to be a voice for women and trying to make a difference, and to try to get women out there to realize that early detection is everything ... Don't think that it's okay to wait another year for the mammogram, and don't wait till you're 40 - if you have a lot [of breast cancer] in your family, maybe you need to get it earlier - because that is going to depend on your survival. And in a way, it makes the whole fight better because it turns it into something very meaningful.' Ms Lunden said that the 'very complicated battle' with the disease has given her a new outlook. 'It's a shame you have to go through something that almost takes life away to appreciate it more. But it certainly does do it to you,' she told Ms Kotb in an interview at her Connecticut home last week that aired today. Bold move: Ms Lunden discussed her decision to shave off all her hair in a recent interview with People . The veteran journalist publicly announced her diagnosis to fellow cancer survivor Robin Roberts on GMA in July. 'Robin told me waiting for your hair to fall out is excruciating, so I didn't want to wait,' she told People of her decision to shave off her hair one week after finishing her first chemotherapy treatment. She added: 'You know it's going to happen one of these days and you are wondering how and when, so I just owned it.'","The former Good Morning America host, 64, has undergone chemotherapy and a lumpectomy since her diagnosis with triple negative breast cancer in June .

"A sister of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pleaded guilty Tuesday to misleading a police detective during a counterfeiting investigation, avoiding jail time in an agreement with prosecutors. Ailina Tsarnaeva, 24, entered the plea in South Boston Municipal Court. If she avoids further legal trouble for 30 days, she will be free of any court supervision. If she does get into trouble, the judge could sentence her up to two and a half years in jail. Prosecutors said Tsarnaeva failed to cooperate with a police officer investigating the passing of a counterfeit bill by a group of people eating at an Applebee's restaurant in the South Bay Center, a mall in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood, on April 16, 2010. A server saw the group leaving and wrote down their license plate number. Scroll down for video . Ailina Tsarnaeva pictured in the courtroom on Tuesday in Boston, where she pleaded guilty to misleading a police detective during a counterfeiting investigation . Police traced the car to Tsarnaeva at her family's Cambridge home. When questioned, Tsarnaeva said she did not know the names of the people she picked up from the restaurant, according to the police report. She also told police that she had not lied but 'did not want to be a snitch,' according to the report. In court Tuesday, Tsarnaeva's lawyer, George Gormley, acknowledged that Tsarnaeva had misled police but said her motivation was to protect a female friend, not the person who allegedly passed the counterfeit bill. Gormley said he obtained the name of that person from Tsarnaeva's friend and gave it to prosecutors. Assistant District Attorney William Champlin IV said the disposition was appropriate because of the age of the case and Tsarnaeva's acceptance of responsibility by pleading guilty. Ailina (pictured today left) in court and her brother Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev pictured right . Jake Wark, a spokesman for Suffolk District Attorney Daniel Conley, said prosecutors also considered separate charges pending against Tsarnaeva in New York, where she is accused of threatening to 'put a bomb' on a perceived romantic rival. 'The most effective way of handling this and not interfering with her other pending case is to place this conviction on file, which allows the judge to re-sentence her if she re-offends at any time during the next 30 days and also prevents any appellate challenges to the conviction,' Wark said. Tsarnaeva left the courthouse without commenting, carrying an infant and covering her head with the hood of a fur coat. Tsarnaeva's brother could be sentenced to death if he's found guilty in the marathon bombing, which killed three people and injured more than 260 others. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial in January. Federal prosecutors say Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, planted two bombs near the 2013 marathon finish line. Tamerlan Tsarnaev later was killed in a shootout with police.

"Tom Magliozzi, who hosted National Public Radio's beloved Car Talk show with his brother, has died from Alzheimer's Disease aged 77. The on-air personality, who ran the call-in show with his younger brother Ray from 1977 to 2012, died today from complications related to the brain disease today, NPR confirmed. In his 35-year radio career, the network said his 'dominant, positive personality' had helped inject a lightheartedness into an arena which was 'formal' and 'cautious' before. Car Talk was NPR's most popular entertainment program for years, reaching more than 4million people a week on more than 600 radio stations across the country at its peak. Scroll down for video . Much-loved: Tom Magliozzi (pictured right in 2008), co-hosted National Public Radio's Car Talk for 35 years alongside his brother Ray (left). He died today of Alzheimer's-related complications . Stalwarts: Tom, left, and Ray, right, Magliozzi were on air for three and a half decades with Car Talk . It continued to be a top-rated show even after the brothers stopped taping live shows in 2012 and the network began airing reruns and archived materials. Car Talk Executive Producer Doug Berman, in a statement posted on NPR's website, said Magliozzi's 'dominant, positive personality' will be missed. 'He and his brother changed public broadcasting forever,' he said. 'Before Car Talk, NPR was formal, polite, cautious..even stiff.' The duo, which called themselves 'Click and Clack, the Tappet Brothers,' mixed sound advice about repairing cars with sharp one-liners, self-deprecating humor and off-topic digressions on philosophy and the mysteries of life. 'I like to drive with the windows open. I mean, before you know it, you're going to spend plenty of time sealed up in a box anyway, right?' Tom once quipped on-air. The brothers always ended their shows with a catchphrase - 'Don't drive like my brother' - delivered in their signature Boston accents. Popular: The Magliozzi brothers brought in NPR's highest ratings for years on end with Car Talk . Ray Magliozzi affectionately teased his late brother, who was 12 years his senior, in a statement posted on Car Talk's website: 'Turns out he wasn't kidding...He really couldn't remember last week's puzzler.' The Cambridge, Massachusetts, brothers were an unlikely radio duo. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduates opened a car repair shop in the early 1970s. As the story goes, Tom was invited to a radio round-table discussion with other local auto mechanics on Boston's NPR affiliate, but was the only one to actually show up. He impressed the station's producers, however, and was invited back the following week. Tom brought along Ray, and Car Talk was born. The weekly Boston-produced program began airing in 1977 and became nationally-broadcast starting in 1987. Experience: Magliozzi, born in 1937, ran a car repair business when he was invited on the radio to discuss the vehicles - spawning a decades-long broadcasting career . Magliozzi was born June 28, 1937, in a largely Italian-American section of East Cambridge. According to NPR, he was the first in his family to attend college, earning a chemical engineering degree.

"A super speedy teenager from Tasmania is well on his way to becoming Australia's next big hope at the Olympics after smashing the country's 100m under-18 record. Jack Hale, 16, set the track alight at a race meet in Hobart where he ran an incredible 10.44 seconds in the 100m sprint yesterday. The crowd watched on in amazement as a star was born on the track when he also broke the Tasmanian men's open 100 metres record. Scroll down for video . Jack Hale is only 16 and has become Australia's fastest 100m runner after performing in Hobart . The teenager from Tasmania says he hopes to build on his success and get a gold medal at the Olympics . Hale surprised his trainers who described his performance so early in the season as 'sensational' Hale also broke the Tasmanian men's open 100 metres record at the race meet in Hobart . Hale, who was until recently a long jump specialist, says he has set his sights high in the sprinting arena. 'At the moment I'm not extremely serious about it, but in the future if I keep improving I'll definitely want to take it to the Olympics with a gold medal,' he told ABC. Hale revealed the secret to his success is a new training regime of adding weighted box jumps into his routine. 'I've started doing them about three months ago and I've been doing them three times a week, weighted box jumps I think they have really helped me,' 'Also, I've stopped doing heavy weights training and stuck to a bit of power exercises,' ABC reported. Hale's trainers were also impressed with his amazing performance calling it 'sensational' and 'beyond what we were expecting'. Hale revealed the secret to his success has been adding weighted box jumps into his routine . He says he has stopped doing heavy weighted training and is sticking to power exercises . Brian Rowe, from Athletics Tasmania, told ABC Hale was already 'very talented' for achieving such a great time so early on in the season. 'A young fellow, 16-year-old, comes out of the winter, does a bit of winter training for the first time, already very talented, and is more than capable, although 10:44 is a bit beyond what everyone was expecting. 'To achieve that so early in the season, at what many would say were the school sports, is absolutely astounding, and an outstanding performance by a young man who has only been known as a long jumper. Hale recovers from the amazing achievement and lets the shock settle in with his friends after the race . Hale is part of a new crop of talent, some of whom recently returned from the world junior championships in Oregon, USA . 'All the interschool carnivals here are permit meets and today's meet was run with fully electronic timing with a fully accredited national official with a wind gauge in operation,' Mr Rowe said. Hale is part of a new crop of talent, some of whom recently returned from the world junior championships in Oregon. The Tasmanian Institute of Sport had supported young athletes who were able to access training tracks around the clock. Mr Rowe added: 'We've got a really talented group of young sprinters at the moment and these things are cyclical, but... if you are talented here you've really got the springboard to go ahead.'","Jack Hale from Tasmania is setting his sights on Olympic gold .

"A British tourist found dead in a hotel car park in eastern France is thought to have been murdered, police said today. The body of the unnamed victim, who was in his 50s, was lying in a pool of blood and had a large head wound. He was found next to a budget Formule 1 hotel in the Epenottes industrial estate in Dole, a town in the Jura department of the Franche-Comte region. A British tourist found dead in a hotel car park in eastern France is thought to have been murdered (file picture) The British trio had enjoyed drinks together at tables outside the hotel on Saturday night, according to staff, but detectives said the man had then gone out ‘to meet someone’. ‘He did not return,’ said a local police spokesman, who said an ‘initial theory was that he had been murdered’. The man’s wife called police on Sunday morning, and began looking for him with the help of hotel staff. His body was found in a car park in front of an adjacent discount clothing store. The police spokesman said: ‘The call to police was logged at around 9am. The victim’s wife was concerned about his whereabouts, as he had not been seen since Saturday night.’ Scene: The man's wife called police on Sunday morning when she realised he was missing . Some 25 people have so far been interviewed in connection with the suspected crime, including hotel staff. No weapons has been found, and police do not know how the head wound was caused. CCTV has also been examined, but it is not thought to contain any important clues. The couple were on their way back to the UK from Italy, with the friend, and had stopped off for the night in Dole, which is a short distance from the Swiss and Italian borders. It is used as a stopover for numerous drivers using the major motorways which link southern and northern France. The hotel - which charges £25 a night - was closed today, along with the car park, as forensics experts searched for clues. An autopsy was due to be held today. The British Embassy in Paris has been informed about the incident, and is liaising with the dead man’s family. It is common practice for the French authorities to retain the names of accident or murder victims for operational reasons, but this practice has been criticised in the past by British police working on joint enquiries. There is often a fear that vital information can be lost in the early days of an investigation if people do not know the name of the deceased, or what he looked like.

"A neo-classical masterpiece, Thomas Jefferson's Monticello estate is one of the most revered pieces of architecture in the United States. And now there are two. Replicating the 1772 plantation brick-for-brick, a designer has painstakingly created his own version. He even used identical materials. Take two: This is a brick-for-brick replica in Somers, Connecticut, of Thomas Jefferson's neoclassical Monticello plantation . Original: Jefferson started work on the Charlottesville, Virginia, residence in 1772 when he was just 26 years old after inheriting land . Work of art: Throughout his presidency, Jefferson adapted the property to feature different trends of 18th century Europe . S Prestley Blake, co-founder of Friendly's ice cream parlor and an amateur architect, undertook the project as his 'swan song' in the run-up to his 100th birthday. Construction began on the Somers, Connecticut, replica in the summer of 2013 after Blake purchased the ten-acre property, which connects to his own 80-acre property by a wooded horse trail. He tore down the church and home that existed on the land, which had been owned by Big Y supermarket co-founder Gerald D'Amour. He then decided to use the property to build a reproduction of the Charlottesville, Virginia, home he has referred to as 'the country's most architecturally beautiful residence.' Architect S Prestley Blake referred to the Charlottesville, Virginia, home  as 'the country's most architecturally beautiful residence' Construction began on the Somers, Connecticut, replica in the summer of 2013 after Blake purchased the ten-acre property . Adapted: He allowed for more modern interiors to be installed in the 10,000-square-foot home which is now on the market . Tribute: Homages exist throughout including the blue sky ceiling mural in the hall that recalls the skylight in Jefferson’s dome room . Inspired:  Jefferson's design was inspired by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio and he adapted it throughout his life . And now, it is on sale for $6,500,000 with William Pitt Sotheby's. Jefferson, America's third president, started building Monticello - which means 'little mount' in Italian - when he was 26 years old after inheriting the land from his father. Slaves worked the 5,000 acres of land farming tobacco and other crops. Vast: This is one of the 11 rooms in the home, which also boasts acres of land, which would have been farmed on in Jefferson's day . Historic: Despite relaxing his rules, Blake still wanted to give the interior a historic feel with oak-paneled walls and chandeliers . Idyllic views: Like the third president, would-be buyers will be treated to views of sprawling countryside out of floor-to-ceiling windows . His design was inspired by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, widely considered the most influential individual in the history of Western architecture. Throughout his presidency, he adapted the property to feature different trends of 18th century Europe. Jefferson was buried on the grounds, which is now owned by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Live like a ruler: The domed ceiling stands over two sweeping staircases reminiscent of architecture in the deep south . Domesticated: The property, though a novelty, is fully equipped with kitchen appliances for the new owners to enjoy . Grandeur: Guests will be able to enjoy breakfast atop this vast marble breakfast bar in the extended kitchen area . Winding: The 10-acre property connects to Blake's own 80-acre residence by a wooded horse trail . With nearly 10,000 square feet of living space, the replica has a total of 11 rooms with five bedrooms and five bathrooms and four en suites. The replication did not extend to the interior, which was built to accommodate a more modern lifestyle. However, homages exist throughout including the blue sky ceiling mural in the entryway that recalls the skylight in Jefferson's dome room. Revered: The property appears on five-cent coins and is widely recognized as the most beautiful building in America .","Thomas Jefferson started building his 5,000-acre Monticello plantation in Charlottesville, VA, at the age of 26 in 1776 .

"Hundreds of thousands of savers, frustrated with banking scandals and rock-bottom interest rates, have switched their current accounts in the last year, figures show. More than 1.2million current account holders have moved to a new provider in the first year of an initiative aimed at taking the hassle out of swapping banks. Since the scheme was launched in September 2013, there has been a 22 per cent increase in customers switching, according to the Payments Council, which is overseeing the service. Scroll down for video . Halifax, Santander (above) and Nationwide Building Society made some of the strongest customer gains . Halifax, Santander and Nationwide Building Society made some of the strongest customer gains, while those suffering net losses in customers include NatWest, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, RBS and the Co-operative. Experts said banks such as Santander and Halifax had successfully lured savers who were fed up with poor interest rates by offering higher-rate current accounts. These so-called ‘pseudo-savings’ accounts are attracting thousands of customers at a time when the UK is enduring the worst interest rates on record. Challenger banks such as Marks & Spencer, Tesco and Metro, which were not included in the data, are also believed to have made significant gains in response to a general distrust in the larger banks. Those suffering net losses in customers include NatWest (above left), Barclays (above right), HSBC, Lloyds Bank, RBS and the Co-operative . The industry has been hit with a series of high-profile scandals in recent years which has seen trust in larger lenders plummet. These have included the widespread mis-selling of payment protection insurance, the rigging of the Libor interest rate, and sky-high bankers’ bonuses. The data covering which banks people are moving to is released voluntarily and with a six-month delay, and does not include all brands. Of the banks which agreed to release the data, Halifax made the strongest net gain in current account customers between January and March this year, recording a 41,558 upswing. It was followed by Santander, which had a net 37,316 rise, while NatWest had the largest net loss, shedding 18,258 customers, followed by Barclays with 16,467. Experts said Santander and Halifax had successfully lured savers from banks like HSBC (above) by offering higher-rate current accounts. Co-operative Bank recorded a net decrease of 7,852 customers between January and March. It was embroiled in a scandal in which its former chairman, ex-Methodist minister Paul Flowers, was accused of drug abuse. Campaigners said the switching figures were still ‘low’ and that changes to make the process quicker were not enough. Richard Lloyd, of Which?, said: ‘It is clear from today’s low switching figures that the big banks’ stranglehold on the market continues and that quicker switching alone will not solve the lack of competition or trust in banking.’ Sylvia Walcot of website Moneyfacts said that many who switched sometimes did so because of factors such as convenient car parking near their branch, rather than sound financial reasons. ‘It is great that people can switch easily but the interest displayed so far in doing so may be more to do with reasons far removed from the products themselves,’ she added. Under the switching service, the length of time it takes to swap banks has been cut from up to 30 working days to seven. Outgoing and incoming payments are also automatically swapped over and if anything goes wrong the consumer is guaranteed not to be left out of pocket. If you're fed up with your bank there are plenty of reasons why now is a good time to switch to another provider.

"When: Saturday November 8, 2.30pm . Where: Twickenham Stadium, London . What: QBE Series opener . England have named Semesa Rokoduguni on the right wing for Saturday's QBE Series opener against New Zealand at Twickenham. The uncapped Rokoduguni, a serving soldier in the British Army with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards who has seen action in Afghanistan's Helmand Province as a tank driver, has been rewarded for an outstanding start to the season at Bath. Rokoduguni will become the first serving soldier to win an international cap for England since Tim Rodber 15 years ago. His Test debut will complete an epic journey from his Fijian village, Naselai, where he couldn’t break into the rugby team because his uncle was a better winger. Uncapped wing Semesa Rokoduguni will start for England against New Zealand at Twickenham on Saturday . Rokoduguni is a serving soldier in the British Army and has seen action in Afghanistan's Helmand Province . The 27-year-old will become the first serving soldier to win an international cap for England since Tim Rodber .

Replacements: R Webber (Bath), M Mullan (Wasps), K Brookes (Newcastle), G Kruis (Saracens), B Morgan (Gloucester), B Youngs (Leicester), G Ford (Bath), A Watson (Bath). New Zealand: I Dagg; B Smith, C Smith, S B Williams, J Savea; A Cruden, A Smith; W Crockett, D Coles, O Franks, B Retallick, S Whitelock, J Kaino, R McCaw (capt), K Read. Replacements: K Mealamu, B Franks, C Faumuina, P Tuiipulotu, L Messam, T J Perenara, B Barrett, R Crotty . 'I'm delighted for Roko. Wing is an extremely competitive position, but he has pushed himself forward with his form this season and it's great to be able to give him this opportunity,' head coach Stuart Lancaster said. Rokoduguni is one of three uncapped players in the 23 with Bath team-mate Anthony Watson offering back-three cover from the bench and George Kruis of Saracens the second-row replacement. Dave Attwood, one of seven Bath players in the matchday squad, starts at lock after his fiancee gave birth to their first child on Tuesday. 'I'm sure Anthony and George will contribute should they come off the bench. Dave Attwood has had an eventful week with the birth of his first child. He's back with us now and will be ready to go for Saturday,' Lancaster said. England have selected a previously untried centre pairing of Kyle Eastmond - the Aviva Premiership's form player - and Brad Barritt. Eastmond experienced mixed fortunes during the summer tour to New Zealand, excelling in the first Test only to be replaced at half-time of the third when his defensive frailties were exposed. Barritt's inclusion at outside centre provides England with an insurance policy as Lancaster views the Saracens midfielder as best defensive back in the Premiership. Jonny May of Gloucester fills the left wing slot despite a disappointing tour of New Zealand which placed his international future in doubt.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster believes Rokoduguni has 'pushed himself forward with his form' Danny Care and Owen Farrell form the half-backs with Farrell chosen despite being restricted to only two starts for Saracens this season because of a thigh strain. England's pack, which has been decimated by injuries to the tight five, picked itself once the respective calf and thigh injuries carried by props David Wilson and Joe Marler cleared up. Attwood was the next in line to partner Courtney Lawes in the second row after Joe Launchbury was ruled out of the entire autumn schedule with a neck problem.

Cruden, full-back Israel Dagg, centre Sonny Bill Williams and No 8 Kieran Read are the only players retained on starting duty from five days ago. Hansen's team and replacements boast a combined total of more than 1,000 caps. Among those who return to the starting XV are prolific try-scoring wing Julian Savea, centre Conrad Smith, lock Sam Whitelock and skipper Richie McCaw. 'This Test match is a great opportunity to once again experience the atmosphere of Twickenham and to lay down a marker of where we are currently at in relation to our opponents, England,' Hansen said. Conrad Smith, pictured playing a pass in training, will start for New Zealand against England . Wing Julian Savea returns to New Zealand's XV for the clash at Twickenham on Saturday . 'We are extremely excited about this challenge and looking forward to it immensely.

"Accused: Sanford Rubenstein allegedly raped a 42-year-old official at the National Action Network after coming home from Rev Al Sharpton's birthday party . Attorneys representing the woman who accused prominent civil rights attorney Sanford Rubenstein of raping her after Reverend Al Sharpton's birthday party said Monday they have 'devastating' information about the alleged crime. Sources familiar with the case have claimed that the 42-year-old woman, who works for Sharpton’s National Action Network, went home with the 70-year-old attorney willingly last week, and even had sex with him a second time the following morning. But attorney Keith White who represents the alleged victim has challenged these assertions, insisting that a crime had been committed. ‘There’s a lot of new information that will be devastating to Mr. Rubenstein,’ White told New York Daily News. ‘We want to give the district attorney a chance to take this information and do the right thing.‘ . White's partner, Kenneth Montgomery, accused Rubenstein and his legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman of trying to 'demonize' his client. Describing the 42-year-old as a mother and a pillar of the community, Montgomery said her 'world has been turned upside down.' Investigators suspect Rubenstein may have used an object to penetrate the 42-year-old woman during the alleged attack in his $7million Manhattan penthouse, making her bleed, sources told the New York Daily News. The anonymous accusation, which emerged Sunday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed in the morning. The claims came as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side for evidence. On Monday afternoon, police removed a dozen evidence bags, among them one marked 'biological evidence.' They also carried a mattress out of Rubenstein's apartment. Evidence: An NYPD officer carries out a bag of material from Rubenstein's Upper East Side penthouse apartment . Close: The Rev Al Sharpton, center with Rubenstein to the left, has said there is no place for the alleged behavior - but avoided jumping to the conclusion that he is guilty . As part of the investigation, police reportedly set up a call between the alleged victim and Rubenstein, during which the woman asked the 70-year-old attorney, 'What happened last night?' The lawyer replied that they had sex but did not incriminate himself, a police source told the paper. He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement  sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported. He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn’t mean you’re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain’t no place for that in our community.' Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left. Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee. A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter. Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters . But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex. Rubenstein hit back at the claims Monday through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman. Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'. The media-savvy Rubenstein currently represents the family of Eric Garner, who died after a police chokehold during an arrest in July. The case sparked protests and calls for change within the police department. He also represented the family of Sean Bell, killed in 2008 in a hail of police bullets. The city eventually settled with Bell's family for $7.5million. High-profile case: Rev. Herbert Daughtry, far left, Rev. Al Sharpton, second from left, and attorney Sanford Rubenstein, far right, escort Esaw Garner, second from right, the wife of fatal police chokehold victim Eric Garner, after a press conference August  21, 2014 . Rubenstein is a member of the National Action Network and has often stood arm-in-arm with Sharpton at protests. On Monday, Sharpton met with Garner's family and said he would discuss the Garner investigation at a rally on Saturday. Sharpton issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of the allegations. 'National Action Network and Rev. Al Sharpton has not been notified or advised by any official investigating authorities,' the statement read. 'The allegations as reported occurred at a private residence after a NAN event and had nothing to do with NAN nor Rev. Al Sharpton, therefore we have no comment at this time.'","Sanford Rubenstein, 70, accused of raping 42-year-old last week .

"British pop star Phil Collins has handed over his vast collection of artifacts related to the Battle of the Alamo and the Texas Revolution to the state of Texas. Collins was in San Antonio on Tuesday to donate what's considered the world's largest private collection of Alamo artifacts. It includes a fringed leather pouch and a gun used by Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie's legendary knife and letters from garrison commander William B. Travis. 'There's things in there that will make your mouth drop,' Collins said. Phil Collins handed over his vast collection of artifacts related to the Battle of the Alamo and the Texas Revolution to the state of Texas on Tuesday . The 1980s pop artist and Genesis singer-drummer has joked that he spent all the money he made from music on artifacts related to the 1836 battle in which 1,500 Mexican troops laid siege to 200 Texans. The collection was given to Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, the state steward of the Alamo who is pushing for a new historical center that would house Collins' collection. 'Texans are deeply indebted to Phil Collins,' Patterson said. 'He is giving us back our heritage. Now these Texas treasures need a home where all can see them and study from them and learn about how Texans won our liberty.' Phil Collins holds a Bowie knife that belonged to Jesse Robinson who fought under Jim Bowie at the Battle of Concepcion and the Siege of Bexar  in San Antonio . Crockett's Bullet Pouch from around 1836 is displayed during a news conference on Tuesday in San Antonio. Phil Collins has donated what's considered the world's largest private collection of Alamo artifacts . Grammy and Academy Award winner Collins has donated a collection of more than 200 items for display. Five crates full of artifacts were unloaded from a cargo truck on Tuesday. 'This completes the journey for me. I'm 64. When I was 5 or 6 years old, this thing began,' Collins said of his fascination with the Alamo. Collins said he became fascinated by the Alamo while watching Fess Parker star as 'Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier,' while he was a small child growing up in suburban London. 'My 9-year-old son was saying, ""Why are you going to give it all away, Dad? I thought I was going to have it,'"" he said with a laugh. Patterson said it will likely take at least five years to raise the millions of dollars needed to design and build a center to house and display the collection. The collection includes this brass back Bowie knife, an original that Jim Bowie had in his possession during the battle . Collins poses alongside a Mexican Army helmet that formed part of his collection . Collins gained global fame in the 1980s with huge hits including In The Air Tonight, Take Me Home and Another Day In Paradise . The location of the center will be decided in about two weeks, Patterson said, and will likely charge for admission. The 4.2-acre Alamo grounds are free to the public. 'This collection is coming home and it's going to be very interesting for people to come and see and learn,' Collins said. 'And this is what it's all about.' Collins first became known as drummer and lead vocalist for the rock group Genesis, later winning global fame as a solo artist with huge hits in the 1980s including In The Air Tonight, Take Me Home and Another Day In Paradise. Collins is donating the bullet pouch, powder flask and musket balls . that Davy Crockett carried from his home in Tennessee into Texas, then a part of the Republic of Mexico, and the Alamo . Last stand: The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna (pictured: a painting of the battle which hangs at the museum) For 178 years, the Battle of the Alamo has been one of America's most cherished historical events. Celebrated in song, story and cinema, the story of heroism against all the odds helped define the young nation's pursuit of liberty. The 'last stand' at the Alamo on March 6, 1836 came after a small band of Americans held out for 13 days against the army of Mexican dictator General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna. The leaders of the group included Davy Crockett, already famous as a frontiersman, storyteller and crack shot, and James Bowie, known for his distinctive knife. It has long been part of the Alamo legend that Crockett died fighting. News of the resistance helped garner support among the rebels, who defeated Santa Anna's army at the Battle of San Jacinto amid cries of 'Remember the Alamo!' The historic victory cemented the status of the newly formed Republic of Texas. The legend was firmly established by the 1955 Disney TV show in which the hero was seen swinging an empty rifle as the hordes of Mexican soldiers closed in for the kill. It has since been the subject of a host of Hollywood movies, including a 1960 John Wayne epic and a 2004 version with Dennis Quaid and Billy Bob Thornton. Collins' collection includes this cannon ball as well as a fringed leather pouch and a gun used by Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie's legendary knife .","The singer has spent years amassing the what's considered the world's largest private collection of Alamo artifacts .

"A vicious brawl involving players, substitutes and riot police forced an Argentine lower division match to be called off midway through the second half after 12 players were red carded. Deportivo Roca's match at home to Cipolletti in Group One of the Torneo Federal A, the Argentine third tier, erupted into chaos after two players were sent off following a seemingly innocuous clash. Following the melee, the referee handed out 12 red cards and the game was cancelled, Argentine media reported. Scroll down for video . The fight broke out after two players were sent off following a seemingly innocuous clash . The red cards escalated into a free for all brawl, with players from both teams throwing kicks and punches . Riot police also stormed the field in an attempt to quell the violence which broke out at a far end of the pitch . The fight erupted 22 minutes into the second half between players from Deportivo Roca and Cipolletti . Cipolletti defender Marcos Lamolla was initially given a yellow card for a foul on Fernando Fernandez, who protested and was sent off. This led to more protests, a scuffle and Lamolla was given another yellow and dismissed. Video footage of the game posted online showed the livid Lamolla running the entire length of the pitch to square up to Fernandez, who was already on his way to the dressing room, but then being intercepted by a player. The pair lashed out at each other which quickly led to a free-for-all in which players lunged at each other with flying kicks and punches, before Cipolletti players fled down the inflatable tunnel. Referee Facundo Espinosa told Argentine media that he had sent off 10 further players in the chaos and they would be named in his official report. 'Both teams' players were disgraceful, they didn't behave like professionals,' said Deportivo Roca coach Diego Landeiro. 'It was a disgrace and it means lots of work down the drain. I'm very bitter.' Pictured is the in-game incident that led to two red cards being issued, which in turn sparked the brawl . Video footage showed a Cipolletti player running the full length of the pitch to square up to another player . It comes just days after a game between Serbia and Albania was called off due to a mass brawl that erupted between players when a drone carrying a politically insensitive flag flew over the players. UEFA has charged both countries with a number of offences following the Euro 2016 qualifier, which saw a melee erupt on the pitch after a mini unmanned drone trailed a pro-Albania flag over the stadium. The politically-charged Euro 2016 qualifier was halted after defender Stefan Mitrovic pulled down the flag - leading to fights between players and officials and havoc in the Partizan Stadium’s stands . Serbia have claimed the incident had been a 'scenario of a terrorist action planned in advance', but the Albania FA has hit back saying the team was targeted even before the game when stones were thrown at the bus, and its delegation and players were hit by a piece of concrete and other missiles during the warm-up. Stefan Mitrovic leaps to grab the flag and pull it and the drone to the ground - leading to chaos . Albanian players scuffle with a spectator as the referee tries in vain to halt the violence . Tension boiled over as fans and officials spilled onto the pitch after the flag was pulled down . Albanian fans had been warned against attending the game between the two Balkan rival nations that have had turbulent relations - mainly over the former ethnic Albanian-dominated Serbian province of Kosovo that declared independence in 2008. Nato waged a 78-day air war in 1999 to halt the killing and expulsion of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian forces fighting a two-year counter-insurgency war. Serbia does not recognise Kosovo as independent. After a delay of around half an hour, English referee Martin Atkinson abandoned the game, with the score at 0-0.","Mass brawl breaks out during second half of game in Argentine third tier .

"It is estimated that around 8,000 people are killed by landslides every year, while many others narrowly escape the terrifying ordeal. But now a new way of predicting landslides has been developed – and it uses a system of fibre optic sensors to act as the ‘nervous system’ of slopes. The technology can detect small shifts in soil slopes and could be used over large areas to detect potential landslides before they threaten people’s lives and livelihoods. A new way of predicting landslides has been developed – and it uses a system of fibre optic sensors to act as the ‘nervous system’ of slopes. Here, mud surrounds a building after a fatal mudslide in the western Indian state of Maharashtra on July 30, which was caused by torrential rain . Optical fibre sensors are commonly used to monitor the condition of infrastructure such as the exterior walls of tunnels, dams, pipelines and railways in remote rural areas, which are difficult for humans to observe. In this case they can be used as the sensing element, but can also be used as a means of relaying signals from a remote sensor to the electronics that process the signals. The fibres can measure strain, temperature or pressure so that the quality being measured - movement for example, - varies the intensity, wavelength or transit time of the light in the fibre. Now, Italian researchers have embedded optical fibre sensors in shallow trenches within slopes to detect and monitor both large landslides and slow slope movements. Landslides are a collapse of a mass of earth or rock from a mountain or cliff and are always preceded by ‘pre-failure strains, the researchers from the Second University of Naples said. Optical fibre sensors are used to monitor the condition of infrastructure such as the exterior walls of tunnels, dams and pipelines,  which are difficult for humans to observe. They have now been proved to be effective when embedded in slopes, where they can monitor movement of soil. A stock images of fibre is shown . Landslides are described as the mass movement of rock, soil or debris down a slope of land. They can destroy houses and bury people in seconds with little or no warning. Landslides are thought to have increased in frequency because of human activity, which causes the 'failure' of soil or rock that make up a hillside. Earthquakes: Plate tectonics move the soil that covers them, so when earthquakes strike on or near steep slopes, it is common for soil to slip and trigger landslides, according to the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire. Natural disasters: Volcanic eruptions and tsunamis are among the natural events that can cause landslides. Heavy rainfall: Slopes can become saturated with rainfall, causing landslides. This risk increases if trees have been cleared because there is no network of roots to support the soil, which simply washes away. Earlier this month, a landslide in Maharashtra state, India was caused by monsoons, leaving 17 people dead and many more trapped. In August, more than 40 people were killed when huge landslides in Hiroshima, Japan, destroyed homes when mountainsides collapsed in wet weather and tonnes of mud buried people living in the suburban neighbourhoods below. Mining: Blasting techniques can cause vibrations under the soil, which can trigger landslides. The Gyama Mine Landslide occurred in 2013 and trapped 83 people in China. It was one-and-a-half miles (3km) long. While the magnitude of pre-failure strains depends on the rock or soil involved, they are measurable. The new technology can detect small shifts in soil slopes, and can therefore detect the onset of landslides. Electrical sensors have been used for monitoring landslides, but they are easily damaged, unlike optical fibre sensors which are more robust, economical and sensitive. Professor Luigi Zeni, of the university, said: ‘Distributed optical fibre sensors can act as a “nervous system” of slopes by measuring the tensile strain of the soil they’re embedded within.’ He explained that his team have combined several types of optical fibre sensors housed in a plastic tube, which can move under the force of pre-failure strains. Using the technology, experts will be able to monitor the movement and bending of the optical fibre remotely to determine if a landslide is imminent. Professor Zeni said that the use of the fibre optic sensors overcomes limitations of other types of sensor because they have no moving parts and ‘can withstand larger soil deformations’. ‘These sensors can be used to cover very large areas - several square kilometres - and interrogated in a time-continuous way to pinpoint any critical zones,’ he added. He believes that based on tests so far, the technology has the potential to be developed into a new tool to monitor areas at risk of landslides and to develop early warning systems sensitive to small movements of earth or rock. A major landslide can completely erase houses within seconds, as well as wiping out families and communities. The researchers hope that their invention will prevent loss of life just as hurricane tracking can prompt coastal evacuations and save lives. The findings of the initial test will be presented at The Optical Society’s annual meeting, Frontiers in Optics, in California next month. A major landslide can completely erase houses within seconds, as well as wiping out families and communities. The researchers hope that their invention will prevent loss of life just as hurricane tracking can prompt coastal evacuations and save lives. Here,the remains of a house can be seen after a mudslide near Oso in Washington State this March, when 43 people lost their lives when a portion of an unstable hill collapsed . Based on tests so far, the reseracers behind the technology think ithas the potential to be developed into a new tool to monitor areas at risk of landslides and to create early warning systems sensitive to small movements of earth or rock.

"They are the most celebrated Home Guard platoon in history, a band of men who changed the course of television comedy, if not actually the course of the war. But here they are as we never saw them at the time – Dad’s Army, out on manoeuvres in the wilds of Walmington-on-Sea. In a rare photographic record, cast members of the legendary series are shown mixing with locals in the fictional seaside town as they record episodes that will later delight audiences around the globe. But the backdrop is not exactly the coastal front line against Hitler’s planned invasion during World War II. Don’t tell ‘em, Pike, but it’s the countryside around Thetford in Norfolk, where most of the filming took place. And as these images suggest (to borrow a phrase from Corporal Jones) the natives certainly seem to like it up ‘em. Scroll down for video . Left to right: John Le Mesurier, who played Sergeant Arthur Wilson, Arthur Lowe, who played captain Mainwaring and James Beck, who played Private Joe Walker are pictured between shoots with Eric Burroughes, the owner of the farm where filming was taking place . Ian Lavender, who was made famous by his portrayal of the gormless Private Pike, is pictured on Walnut Tree Farm, Bressingham . Arthur Lowe has a stretch while standing next to Tim Ball, who appeared in the episode Come In, Your Time Is Up, as a boy scout . James Beck poses with extras from the Thetford Am Dram Society. Keith Eldred, the leader of the society, was often called on to provide extras for scenes and recalls that his actors were usually paid £10 per day . They posed for pictures with the cast, went to parties with them, enjoyed dinner dates together after appearing as extras in dozens of episodes – and occasionally kept the stars supplied with liberal quantities of alcohol. Now, as filming is about to start elsewhere on a big-screen remake of the comedy classic, the Dad’s Army Appreciation Society – membership 1,400 and rising – has turned the clock back nearly half a century to the days when Captain Mainwaring and his fearless men first invaded the inland market town. David Croft, who co-wrote the series with Jimmy Perry and lived in neighbouring Suffolk, asked the chairman of the local amateur dramatic society in the late 1960s to assemble extras for the series. ‘I quickly became very popular,’ Keith Eldred, now president of the Thetford Players, told the Daily Mail yesterday. ‘When we started to be paid, I became even more popular. 'I drafted in extras from all sorts of places – the drama society, the golf club, friends, my wife… even my parents featured in one episode.’ In total, hundreds of people were involved, including an entire Scout troop and the local Women’s Institute. Taking it easy: John Le Mesurier has a cigarette break between shots at Walnut Tree Farm . Clive Dunn, who played Lance-Corporal Jack Jones, relaxes in a chair in Nether Row, Thetford. While the series was set in the fictional coastal town of Walmington-on-Sea, most of the filming took place in Norfolk . Arnold Ridley, who played Private Charles Godfrey, is pictured on set. Michael Gambon will take on his part in a new film adaptation . Arnold Ridley, wearing what appears to be a fireman's uniform, sits on a bench in Thetford. These images are all that survives to document the Thetford filming, as the BBC either ditched or lost the other records . Mr Eldred, now 79, entertained the cast one day at a party in his house, which appeared in some of the backdrops. (The retired chartered surveyor’s wife Margot recalled: ‘They drunk us out of whisky and gin and everything else, but we didn’t mind.’) Mr Eldred continued: ‘They all signed our visitors’ book. They were charming company but they didn’t pull punches. John Le Mesurier was playing my piano and complained it was a rotten piano and was out of tune. It seemed to get better after a couple of gin and tonics though.’ 'James Beck [who played spivvy Private Joe Walker in the first series] was constantly chatting up all the girls. Clive Dunn [Corporal Jones] had what Mr Eldred described as ‘a rather cracking wife who used to insist on sunbathing in bikinis’. He added: ‘They were all lovely people. Most of the days involved us sitting around for long periods while they set up a shot, so some days were long and boring. But it was great fun, and quite an exciting time for our little community in Thetford.’ Virtually all the best loved episodes feature Norfolk extras in non-speaking parts or background scenes. In ‘The Test’, the platoon is challenged to a cricket match by the ARP wardens, who have recruited a top class bowler to their ranks (played by England cricketer Fred Trueman). Mr Eldred played short leg to Capt Mainwaring. ‘Trueman bowled one ball, which was all he was required to do,’ said Mr Eldred. ‘He then spent the rest of the day regaling us with some very doubtful stories about his career in Yorkshire cricket.’ At ease, soldier: John Laurie, who played Private James Frazer, is pictured during filming for the Battle Of The Giants episode at Frog Hill on the MOD Training Area in Norfolk . Expert camouflage: Bill Pertwee, dressed as Chief Warden Hodges, plays around on set during filming in Wacton. The crew used Rosalyn Barrett's house (pictured) for filming, and while she was only paid £10, Mr Pertwee agreed to take her and her husband out for dinner . Keith Eldred, the head of a Am Dram society near to where filming took place, became a popular fixture on set. He recalled that James Beck (pictured) 'was constantly chatting up all the girls' Arthur Lowe, in full Captain Mainwaring uniform but with a cigarette dangling uncharacteristically from his lips, signs his name for two young autograph hunters . In ‘Round and Round Went the Great Big Wheel’, the platoon is chosen to help test the War Office’s latest secret weapon. Some of the filming took place in Rosalyn Barrett’s garden in Wacton, a small village south of Norwich. ‘There wasn’t much happening in Wacton in the 1970s so it was quite something,’ she said yesterday. ‘I think we got paid £10 for a day’s filming, which didn’t exactly change our lives. But Bill Pertwee [Warden Hodges] came round to take me and my husband out for a meal, which was lovely. They were such pleasant people to be with, not uppity at all.’ Mrs Barrett, 65, still has a Kodak Brownie snapshot of herself with cast members, including one that shows her arm in arm with the ‘delightful’ John Le Mesurier. And her house is firmly on the Dad’s Army map – ‘Every now and then we get a coachload of fans coming by on tour,’ she said. The series ran for nine years from 1968 and pulled in 18million viewers at its peak. It is still being shown on mainstream TV and attracts new generations of followers every year. The photographs are the only known record of the Thetford days, however – the BBC is said either to have ditched or lost any it might have had in its archives, along with the list of filming locations.

The images were collected by the Dad’s Army Appreciation Society secretary Tony Pritchard, who went to locations where the series was filmed and asked for snapshots . They were obtained by Dad’s Army Appreciation Society secretary Tony Pritchard, who spent nine years researching precise locations for a companion guide to the series. He traced many of those who allowed TV crews to use their land, property or services, and collected snapshots they took at the time. The prints are now part of the society’s display of recreated sets, vehicles and memorabilia at Bressingham Steam Museum in Diss, Norfolk. One shows Arthur Lowe, in full Captain Mainwaring uniform but with a cigarette dangling uncharacteristically from his lips, signing his name for two young autograph hunters. Another shows actor James Beck in 1970s civvies as he relaxes with two clearly delighted am-dram stars in the making. Thetford being 50 miles from the sea, Great Yarmouth, Wisbeach and Lowestoft were used for some locations (how else might a German U-Boat crew get to Walmington?); and Thetford station became Walmington-on-Sea station whenever required. The closest the cast got to the heavily guarded wartime English Channel was Brighton, where filming was relocated during a 1973 BBC strike.

John Laurie and Ian Lavender would see who could finish the word puzzle first . John Laurie takes on another crossword in while sitting in Nether Row, Thetford, during filming for Time On My Hands . ‘The appeal of Dad’s Army is that it’s simple fun,’ Mr Pritchard said. ‘It’ s not vulgar or nasty – it’s just clever, straightforward, timeless humour… with brilliant writing and a magical cast that just came together so naturally.’ Only Ian Lavender – immortalised as ‘stupid boy’ Private Pike – survives as one of the seven main platoon characters. But reinforcements are on hand. As revealed in the Mail last week, seven new actors are lined up for a big screen remake of Dad’s Army, with Toby Jones, from Hunger Games, playing Capt Mainwaring, and filming is expected to start soon in Bridlington, Yorkshire. The proposal has provoked anger from some fans. Perhaps surprisingly, Mr Pritchard, who has met the directors, is not among the dissenters. ‘They know what they’re dealing with,’ he said. ‘They fully understand that it’s a national treasure.’ Of the original cast, only Ian Lavender (second right) survives today, as filming begins on a movie re-make of the television series .

"Tanya Miller, 30, from Carlisle, took her eight-month-old baby with her on an armed robbery in Silloth . A mother-of-four who took her eight-month-old baby with her as she acted as getaway driver in an armed robbery has been jailed. Tanya Miller, 30, had the baby girl with her in a car seat as she drove from her home in Carlisle to the Cumbrian town of Silloth for the knifepoint raid at a branch of the Cumberland Building Society. A judge described this as one of the 'most troubling' aspects of the case as Miller appeared in court to answer for her role in the hold-up, which left a member of staff 'absolutely traumatised'. Carlisle Crown Court heard that Miller, of Harraby, was the 'wheels' in the raid while her boyfriend Barry Doswell, 26, also of Harraby, was 'back-up'. The pair were due to stand trial for robbery on Wednesday but both pleaded guilty before their trial got underway. Yesterday Miller and Doswell were both sentenced to six years in jail for robbery. The court heard that their accomplice Kevin Docherty, 34, of no fixed address, went into the building society in the quiet town overlooking the Solway Firth armed with a knife and stole nearly £3,000. Docherty entered the branch wearing a white jacket, with most of his face covered by a hood, carrying the 12 inch blade. He walked up to the till and demanded money from the cashier, threatening to kill her. The cashier then handed the man over £2900 in cash and subsequently left the branch. Witnesses then saw a blue Ford Focus park up in a lane which runs between Station Road and Eden Street. Miller with her boyfriend Barry Doswell, who the court heard acted as 'back-up' during the raid on the building society . A male matching the description got out of the vehicle then entered the Building Society. A short time later the witness saw the man return to the vehicle and enter the boot of the car and the vehicle then drove off towards Eden Street, with the baby still in the car seat. The raid, in April, sparked a huge police manhunt operation involving road blocks and a helicopter, though no-one was injured. Judge Paul Batty QC said a female employee at the building society was left 'absolutely traumatised' by the raid. The judge also noted that Miller had her eight-month-old child with her, who is believed to be Miller and Doswell's daughter. Addressing Doswell and Miller - Docherty was not in court for the hearing - Judge Batty said: 'Each of you played an integral part. Yesterday Miller, was jailed for six years at Carlisle Crown Court after admitting robbery. She drove the getaway car and took her eight-month-old daughter with her . Barry Doswell, left, was jailed for six years while Kevin Docherty, right, was sentenced to seven years in prison . 'A custodial sentence of considerable length is quite inevitable.' Docherty was also sentenced to seven years for robbery and possesing an offensive weapon in a public place. Speaking after the sentence was passed, Detective Inspector Ian Harwood said: 'Kevin Docherty subjected the cashiers to a horrendous and needless ordeal whilst making threats brandishing a knife. 'The courts have shown that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated in this county and should be taken as a stern warning to any criminal contemplating committing such a crime. 'I’d like to pay tribute to the both the victims and the witnesses to the robbery for their bravery and tenacity in assisting police put these three in prison. 'Understandably this incident caused great distress to innocent members of the public and we are happy that justice has been served and these three people are being removed from society.' In the last post on their joint Facebook page, Doswell wrote to Miller: 'My baby u so so sexy so proud ta say your my wifey 2b cant wait 2be your husband n make u mrs doswell youve made me a proud dad and give me 4 beautiful kids i lvs them so so much my girl you mean the world 2me beautiful lvs ya millions 4eva xxx.

"A man accused of masterminding the theft of a $5million Stradivarius violin pleaded guilty to robbery robbery Friday. The plea deal for Salah Salahadyn comes nearly eight months after the 300-year-old instrument was snatched from a musician who was attacked with a stun gun following a performance in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Salahadyn, 41, was taken into custody after changing his plea during a hearing in Milwaukee County Circuit Court. He could face up to 10 years in prison when sentenced November 10. Music man: Salah Salahadyn, 41, of Milwaukee, has pleaded guilty to masterminding the theft of a Stradivarius violin from a concertmaster in January . Masterpiece recovered: The stolen $5million Stradivarius violin is displayed at the Milwaukee Police Department February 6, 2014, a day after police recovered the instrument in good condition in an attic . The instrument was missing for nine days before police found it, in good condition, in a suitcase at the Milwaukee home of Salahadyn's acquaintances. Police said the homeowner did not know what was in the suitcase, which was recovered in the attic. Court documents allege that Salahadyn told a friend that such a robbery would be his dream crime because of the instrument's value and the ease of grabbing it from Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Frank Almond  walking down the street. It wasn't his first being involved in such a crime: He pleaded guilty in 2000 to trying to resell a $25,000 statue to the owner of an art gallery in the Pfister Hotel, from whom it had been stolen in 1995. Salahadyn's ex-girlfriend told investigators that while he had not stolen the artwork himself, he did orchestrate the heist. Brazen heist: Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Frank Almond (left) was walking with home in January when he was Tasered and had his 300-year-old violin, pictured right, stolen by his assailants . The other man charged in the violin case, Universal Knowledge Allah, 36, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after pleading guilty in May to being party to felony robbery, the same charge to which Salahadyn pleaded guilty. Prosecutors said Allah provided the stun gun used to attack Frank Almond. Accomplice: Universal Knowledge Allah, 36, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison after pleading guilty to being party to felony robbery . Almond was ambushed January 27 in a parking lot after leaving a performance at Wisconsin Lutheran College in Milwaukee. The musician has said he was lucky he didn't suffer a career-ending arm or wrist injury when he crumpled to the icy pavement that night. Stradivarius violins were crafted by legendary Italian luthier Antonio Stradivari. Many are owned by private collectors who lend them to top violinists to be played in symphonies. Experts say a Stradivarius violin deteriorates if it's not used but remains in good condition when played regularly. The owner of the stolen violin has remained anonymous. But she filed a victim-impact statement when Allah was sentenced, extolling the virtues of the Stradivarius, calling it a direct link to history. 'It is, after all, an amazing work of craftsmanship that in the right hands is capable of producing matchless, exquisite sound that expresses every emotion,' her statement said. Experts estimate that about 600 to 650 Stradivarius instruments remain, or about half of what the master produced. Although they can be worth millions of dollars, they are rarely stolen because they're cataloged so well that a thief would have a hard time selling one.","Salah Salahadyn, 41, could face up to 10 years in prison for the violin theft .

"Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said in an interview released Monday morning that Americans should prepare themselves for the country to be at war with the Islamic State and other terrorist groups for decades to come. 'I think we're looking at kind of a 30-year war,' he told USA Today in an interview to promote his new book, Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace, which comes out on Tuesday. Threats posed by emerging terrorist networks in Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and other countries will keep the U.S. military engaged for the foreseeable future, he forewarned. The fight will not end when the U.S. defeats ISIS in Iraq and Syria, the former Pentagon official said. Former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said in an interview released Monday morning that Americans should prepare themselves for the country to be at war with the Islamic State and other terrorist groups for decades to come . In his upcoming memoir Panetta, who also served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, rehashes the foreign policy decisions made President Barack Obama during his four-year tenor in his administration, including Obama's judgement call not to leave troops in Iraq after the conclusion of the U.S. occupation of the country. That 'created a vacuum in terms of the ability of that country to better protect itself, and it's out of that vacuum that ISIS began to breed,' Panetta told USA Today. Obama's decision not to confront Syrian President Bashar al-Assad with military force after previously warning that he would face consequences if he crossed a 'red line' by using chemical weapons on his citizens was also a mistake, Panetta said. The former Obama administration official told USA Today the backtrack harmed Obama's credibility internationally. Standing up to Islamic extremists now could give Obama a chance to 'repair the damage,' Panetta said, after having 'lost his way.' Panetta's criticism of the Commander in Chief comes as allies of the president on Capitol Hill have begun to call his handling of the situations in Iraq and Syria, as well other terrorist hot spots, into question, as well. On Sunday Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat eyeing a 2016 presidential run, argued that no president, including Obama, has 'had a clear articulation of what American foreign policy is basically since the end of the Cold War. 'Looking at places like Iraq and Syria, you’re seeing policies that can’t be clearly articulated,' Webb said on NBC's Meet the Press. 'It’s not just about ISIS,' Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey said Sunday during an interview on New York radio station 970 AM. 'This is a global jihad with many locations ... Nigeria, Somalia and elsewhere where organizations have sworn themselves to kill as many Muslims, Christians and Jews as they can to establish their religious order,' the Democratic senator said, according to The Hill. Kerrey argued that the United States 'underestimated the threat of a global jihad.' 'ISIS is just a part of it,' he said. 'This is a global jihad that comes out of the Muslim religion. Our intelligence underestimated the threat, and the president did as well.' Panetta is speaking out about his views on world affairs to promote his memoir, which comes out on Tuesday . Republicans joined their Democratic colleagues in questioning the wisdom of President Obama's policies in a barrage of attacks on the Sunday morning news shows. Referencing Obama's repeated claims that he will not send American combat forces into Iraq, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said, 'I don't think we should ever sit back and tell our enemies what we will and will not do. 'If we need special forces there - if that's what the generals say- then we need to do it,' McCarthy said on CBS' Face the Nation. 'If we engage in a conflict that we know this is a threat to America, we should make it so one-sided that it gets over very quickly. So, we should have everything on the table to make sure we win this.' South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham argued on CNN's State of the Union that he too thought Obama erred in promising not to put boots on the ground. 'There is no way I can see how we’re going to fix the problem in Iraq in Syria without American ground troops,' Graham said, according to Politico. 'This mythical Arab army we’re trying to get up to go in on the ground in Syria will need a lot of American hand-holding.' Both men were referring to comments made by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, suggesting that the U.S. may not be able to defeat ISIS without using its own ground troops because the Iraqi army is ill equipped to fight the terrorist group. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, another Republican, expressed worry on Sunday that the president isn't planning on destroying the the violent extremist group at all, even though he's assured the public that he will. 'I’m fearful that as we look at the current military strategy that it is surrounding the November elections and that he won’t have the resolve to follow through with what needs to be done in a sustained effort to destroy ISIS,' she said. Despite his negative assessment of Obama's recent choices, Panetta told USA Today he still believes the president can still turn the situation around, not just for the country, but for himself during his remaining time in office. 'He may have found himself again with regards to this ISIS crisis. I hope that's the case,' Panetta said. 'And if he's willing to roll up his sleeves and engage with Congress in taking on some of these other issues, as I said I think he can establish a very strong legacy as president. 'I think these next 2 1/2 years will tell us an awful lot about what history has to say about the Obama administration,' he concluded.","Threats posed by emerging terrorist groups in Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, Libya and other countries will keep the U.S. military engaged .

"A deaf and mute woman who was trafficked from Pakistan when she was nine could win £200,000 in compensation from a couple who kept her locked in a cellar as a sex slave for a decade. The orphan had been brought into the UK in June 2000, when she was aged just nine or ten, by Ilyas Ashar, 84 who beat her and forced her to sleep in the basement of his home in Eccles, Salford. Ashar and his wife Tallat Ashar, 68, were both jailed last year for their treatment of the victim, but were today at the centre of a landmark court case seeking to win compensation for the girl. Payout: A deaf and mute woman who was trafficked from Pakistan when she was nine could win £200,000 in compensation from Ilyas (right) and Tallat Ashar (left) who kept her locked in a cellar as a sex slave . Orphan: The girl, pictured with her face muzzed in a court drawing, wanted to return to her family in Pakistan almost from the moment she arrived in the UK - but the Ashars would not allow it . Greater Manchester Police and crown lawyers will start the action today under the Proceeds of Crime Act, hoping to win £200,000 in loss of earnings for the victim's paid domestic servitude. Ashar was jailed for 13 years after he was found guilty of trafficking and repeatedly raping the girl, while his wife received a five year sentence for trafficking. This year Solicitor General Oliver Heald referred the cases to the Court of Appeal as ‘possibly unduly lenient’, meaning the couple’s sentences could be increased. Home: Ashar beat the victim, who is profoundly deaf and cannot speak, used her to satisfy his sexual desires and forced her to sleep and work in the cellar of his five bedroom family home in Eccles, Salford . 'Sub human': The cellar at the Ashars' home in Eccles where the girl was made to sleep for a decade . As a result Ilyas’ sentence was increased to 15 years and his wife’s to six years. The couple were also convicted of benefit fraud relating to the girl, who never went to school in Pakistan or Britain, but was taught by the Ashars to sign her name to claim benefits. The civil hearing at Manchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court, will also be seeking to recover a further £40,000 from the couple in relation to the benefit fraud. A judge said the girl, who can not be named because she is a victim of sexual offences, had been treated as a ‘sub human’ following the conclusion of their trial in October last year. Prison: Ashar (left) was jailed for 13 years after he was found guilty of trafficking and repeatedly raping the girl, while his wife (right) received a five year sentence for trafficking . Ilyas Ashar, who is serving a 15 year prison term . June 2000 The girl, then aged nine or ten, is brought to the UK from Pakistan by Ilyas Ashar. For the next decade she is used as a sex slave, and forced to sleep and work in the cellar of his home in Eccles, Salford. July 2005 The girl is given leave to remain in the UK indefinitely, and within two weeks the Ashars began claiming housing, council tax and income support for her. June 2009 Police and trading standards officers raided the Ashar family home on a separate matter and were 'shocked' to discover the girl asleep in the cold and dark cellar. October 2013 Ashar and his wife are convicted over the trafficking of the girl. Ashar is also found guilty of rape. Ashar was jailed for 13 years after he was found guilty of trafficking and repeatedly raping the girl, while his wife received a five year sentence for trafficking. Passing sentence Judge Peter Lakin says: 'You Ilyas Ashar and you Tallat Ashar did not treat this girl as a human being. 'To you she was merely an object to be used, abused and cast aside at will. You took full advantage of her extreme vulnerability.' February 2014 Ashar has his sentence extended from 13 years to 15 years by the Court of Appeal. His wife has her sentence increased from five years to six years. October 2014 Proceeds of crime hearing in which £200,000 is being sought for the victim in loss of earnings. Police and prosecutors are also seeking to recover a further £40,000 from the couple in relation to benefit fraud . Ashar beat the victim, who is profoundly deaf and cannot speak, used her to satisfy his sexual desires and forced her to sleep and work in the cellar of his five bedroom family home in Eccles, Salford. She was also used to steal more than £30,000 in benefits,and had to cook, clean, sew and wash cars for the family and their friends. The girl wanted to return to her family in Pakistan almost from the moment she arrived in the UK on a passport claiming she was 19 - but the Ashars would not allow it. After coming to the UK, despite her apparent young age, as a domestic servant she was allowed to remain on an annual basis on condition that she did not make a claim on public funds. But by July 2005 she was given leave to remain indefinitely - and within two weeks the Ashars began claiming housing, council tax and income support for the girl. She was never paid for the work she did for the Ashar family but also never received a penny of the £36,045 in benefits they claimed for her. Crime: Ashar beat the victim, who is profoundly deaf and cannot speak, used her to satisfy his sexual desires and forced her to sleep and work in the cellar of his five bedroom family home in Eccles, Salford . Court appearance: Tallat and Ilyas Ashar (far left and far right) appear before the jury charged with keeping the girl as a prisoner in a court drawing. In the middle is their interpreter . For nearly 10 years she had to work for the Ashars who are understood to have a number of business interests and rental properties. The exact age of the victim is not known, but Minshull Street Crown Court heard how she was sexually abused by Ilyas Ashar from pre-puberty. He would routinely rape the girl in the cellar and other houses the family owned - though she would try to fight him off. When police and local trading standards raided the Ashar family home on the morning of June 8, 2009 on a separate matter, officers were 'shocked' to discover the girl asleep in the cold and dark cellar. They noted something was 'amiss' when she got up, went upstairs and, instead of sitting on a chair in the kitchen, sat on a plastic stool. One officer likened her behaviour to that of an 'animal' - not allowed to sit on the furniture - and an indication of her status in the house. She was taken from the house and is now doing well with the help of social services, the sentencing court heard. She was only able to detail the extent of her abuse to police after she was taught basic sign language by experts. The girl was brought by the couple from a rural Pakistani village near Lahore in 2000 aged around nine or 10, although her exact birthdate is unknown. The couple denied the charges they faced but were found guilty after a re-trial. The victim gave evidence to the jury using sign language she had been taught after her release from servitude.","Orphan girl was brought to UK by Ilyas Ashar in June 2000 .

"A father and daughter who were separated for 43 years reunited earlier this month, only for him to die two days later. Mary Garcia flew 4,600 miles from Texas to Kirkcaldy, Fiife, to meet her father who she had not seen since her parents split up in 1971. By then Jim McKelvie, 66, was dying of cancer and passed away holding his daughter's hand 48 hours after she arrived. Jim McKelvie kept this picture of himself and his daughter, Maria Garcia, with him from the moment they separated 43 years ago up until their reunion two days before his death . Mr McKelvie and Mrs Garcia last saw each other in 1971 when she and her mother moved to the US . The pair were reunited two days before his death, with Mrs Garcia (left) holding her father's hand as he died . Mr McKelvie, a former soldier, split up with Mrs Garcia's mother when her daughter was two years old and she moved to live in the US. The pair then went without contact for 43 years, but Mr McKelvie kept a picture of him and his daughter with him at all times. His ex-wife, Maria, finally got back in touch on social media six months ago. But just a few months later, the devastating news came through that Mr McKelvie was terminally ill. The father and daughter saw each other for the first time for more than four decades during a video call, after which Mrs Garcia dropped everything and flew to Scotland. Jim's granddaughter, Claire Houston, from Dunfermline, Fife, said: 'In September he took very ill and was taken into hospital where he was for two weeks, then we got the heartbreaking news that he had terminal cancer. 'I immediately contacted Mary and told her the sad news and we agreed to stay in touch to keep her up to date on his progress. 'I then asked her if she would be willing to visit as it would be the greatest gift I could give to him - and she told me she would think about it as it was a huge decision. Holding hands: Although he was too weak to speak, Mr McKelvie was said to be delighted when his daughter arrived in hospital, holding his hand until he died . Claire Houston, pictured with Mr McKelvie - her grandfather - on her wedding day, said it was 'so wonderful' that the pair were able to meet again . 'The following week I took my iPad into the hospital and we FaceTimed Mary in America - it was a beautiful and emotional day. 'That night Mary told me that she was going to come over and we booked her on a flight for the next day. 'She arrived just in time on October 2. It was just wonderful and we connected straight away.' Mrs Garcia's surprise visit delighted Mr McKelvie, who was too weak too talk by the time his daughter arrived. Ms Houston, 36, who is Jim's granddaughter from another marriage, said: 'By this time my grandfather wasn't able to talk, walk, eat or drink and he opened his eyes only rarely, but he held Mary's hand and knew she was there. 'Myself, my mum and Mary were holding his hands when he passed away on the Saturday. 'I will miss him terribly but I am glad he was part of my life. He would have been so proud of Mary and I. 'Sometimes when you meet someone for the first time it can be a bit awkward, but it wasn't and we connected immediately. We are definitely going to keep in touch as much as we can and I am hopefully going to visit her in Texas and she hopes to visit again. 'It's just so wonderful that they were able to meet again after so long.'","Jim McKelvie and daughter Mary Garcia were separated when she was two .

"The average fee for using an ATM that is not on your bank's network has soared by 23 per cent over the past five years, a survey has revealed. Bankrate.com said the average charge for using an out-of-network ATM has reached a new high of $4.35 per transaction, with the penalty fee going up five per cent over the last year alone. Overdraft fees have also surged, rising on average over the past 12 months to $32.74, reaching a 16th consecutive record high. Rising rates: The average fee for using an ATM that is not on your bank's network has soared by 23 per cent over the past five years, according to a survey by Bankrate.com . Account fees have been increasing as lenders adjust to federal banking laws and regulations enacted after the 2008 financial crisis. The changes include limits on when banks can charge overdraft fees on ATM and debit card transactions, and a reduction in the fees that banks charge merchants for each customer who uses credit or debit cards for their purchases. Lenders have responded by hiking overdraft and ATM fees, as well as increasing how much money customers must maintain in the bank to avoid checking account fees. 'I expect fees to continue increasing in years to come, but at a modest pace consistent with what we saw this year, just as was the case prior to the onset of these regulations,' said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. Using another bank's ATM will usually lead to two fees. One is charged by your lender; the other is charged by the owner of the ATM. That's the fee that's risen most consistently and at a faster rate, McBride said. The personal finance firm surveyed the 10 largest banks and thrifts in 25 large U.S. markets. The average ATM fees vary across the markets in Bankrate's survey. Phoenix had the highest average fee for users of ATMs outside their bank's network at $4.96 per transaction. Cincinnati had the lowest average at $3.75. Philadelphia had the highest average overdraft fee at $35.80, while San Francisco had the lowest at $26.74. The largest U.S. banks all offered free checking with no strings attached until 2009, when the share of all non-interest checking accounts that were free peaked at 76 per cent, according to Bankrate. It's now at 38 per cent -unchanged from last year and only slightly lower than 39 per cent in 2012. Even so, consumers looking for checking accounts without monthly fees have plenty of options. Many credit unions, smaller community banks and online banks offer no-strings checking accounts. Many banks that do charge a monthly fee will often waive it if the account holder has their paycheck deposited directly into the account. Not all bank fees rose this year. The average monthly service fee for a non-interest checking account fell five per cent to $5.26 over the past 12 months, Bankrate said. Despite the increased fees, there are ways savvy bank customers can avoid them altogether. Use your bank's website to find fee-free ATMs or, if available, get cash back at the register when using a debit card to shop. Avoiding overdrafts is a matter of keeping tabs on your available checking account balance, something that's easier than ever with mobile banking apps. You can also sign up for email or text alerts if your balance gets below a certain level.","Penalty for using a machine not affiliated with your bank went up 5% last year .

"A gutsy girl group with a difference have unveiled their first music video which aims to challenge the way intellectually disabled people are often treated like ‘little kids’. The five stars of The Sisters Of Invention all have learning disabilities, ranging from Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, Cerebral Palsy, blindness, a mild intellectual disability and Williams Syndrome. They also all have fantastic voices – with Annika, who is blind, possessing pitch-perfectness, a skill envied by  musicians around the world and singer Aimee’s Williams Syndrome working in her favour, with hyper-musicality an attribute of her disability. Scroll down for video . The Sisters Of Invention have released their first professional music video called This Isn't Disneyland . Aimee, dressed as Snow White, has Williams Syndrome which gives her hyper-musicality . In their first professionally produced release called This Isn’t Disneyland, Aimee, 28, is dressed as Snow White, Annika, 28, is Cinderella, Caroline, 29, is Tinkerbell, Jackie, 25, is Pocahontas and Michelle, 24, is Rapunzel – but it is no fairy-tale dress up competition, they are making a clever point. In the catchy electro-pop tune the Adelaide-based band sing: 'This isn't Disneyland I'm not a novelty this is a real as it gets.' ‘Sometimes people treat us like we are little kids. We wanted to say we are not; we are more than disabled people. The video goes to show we are not novelties,’ Aimee told Daily Mail Australia. ‘We are here to change opinions of disabled people in general,’ she added. The band’s producer Michael Ross, who worked with the five women to write the songs on their upcoming album, said people have been surprised by the video. Annika is Cinderella (far left),  Aimee is dressed as Snow White (second left), Michelle is Rapunzel (centre), Caroline is Tinkerbell (first right) and Jackie is Pocahontas (far right) Jackie, 25, who is dressed as Pocahontas in the video, has Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. She wrote a brave song about heartbreak for the band's album after her cousin committed suicide . Annika, who is blind with a mild intellectual disability, is pitch-perfect and can identify any note she hears . Caroline, who has Cerebral Palsy and a mild intellectual disability, is Tinkerbell in the video . Michelle, who has Cerebral Palsy with a mild intellectual disability, is Rapunzel. In the video she cuts off the Disney character's famous long blonde locks . ‘When people think about a girl group with learning disabilities they paint a picture in their mind straight away. ‘But when they watch it they see it is not “second class”, they see it’s not “s**t” and they are surprised and they are like “oh my god I actually like this.”, he explained. Producer Michael Ross worked with the band to write the songs and create an album . ‘We want people to really like it and get something out of it.’ Michael has been working with the band for four years, to get them to the point where their natural musical talents have created broadcast standard records. The Sisters Of Invention describe their music as alternative pop and they write all of their songs from personal experience – both the happy and the heartbreaking. One of the brave stories of how they wrote their songs comes from Jackie, who has Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder. During the writing of their tenth song, she came into the studio with the heartbreaking news that her cousin who was ‘as close as a sister to her’ had committed suicide. She was just 14-years-old. ‘Heidi had lived with us since she was a baby and committed suicide. We weren’t expecting it. So we wrote a song about Heidi, it’s called Tsunami Of Kites,’ Jackie said. ‘For a singer-songwriter to sit down and be brave enough to use that story and that experience in a song is incredible. ‘To put your ultimate truth and honesty directly in to those lyrics, there is nothing childish about it,’ Michael explained. Meanwhile, Annika used the time when her school principal told her parents she would never be able to learn anything as the basis of another song. Michael said when people talk about intellectual disability they start saying words like ‘retard’ and ‘infantile’. ‘They think that  you will forever be a child. So for these girls to actually be singing gutsy, blatantly honest, emotionally mature songs and to sign them so beautifully that in itself is enough to make people go “oh”.’ The Sisters Of Invention describe their music as alternative pop and they write all of their songs from personal experience . They perform around 20-30 paid gigs every year and are set to release their first album in February . The women have all been singing separately for years but got together as a group three years ago . He hopes that next time people talk to someone with a learning disability they instead think ‘I have no idea what your are capable of, you might be able to do something just as amazing as The Sisters Of Invention’. ‘Here are five women who actually have a career as singer song-writers,’ he added. The women have all been singing separately for years but got together as a group three years ago and named their band The Sisters of Invention ‘because we are all sisters and support each other and that’s what friends do,’ Aimee explained. Annika added: ‘We are reinventing the rules of how people see us and so people can see us for what we are capable of instead of what we are not.’ The Sisters of Invention are from an Adelaide-based arts organisation called TUTTI, which gave them a chance to develop themselves professionally. Follow The Sisters Of Invention on Facebook and download their first single on iTunes.","The Sisters Of Invention are a girl group from Adelaide .

"When Staff Sergeant Thomas Baysore, 31, deployed to Afghanistan, he told his son Darren, that he could leave messages to him by talking to the moon. Then, 12 months ago, Staff Sgt Baysore was killed in action, the six-year-old boy said he wanted to leave his porch light on so his father could always see his house. Then on the first anniversary of his father's death, the youngster, through social media, got thousands of his neighbours in Clarksville, Tennessee to leave their lights on in remembrance of Sgt Baysore. Sgt Baysore was shot in the neck by a terrorist wearing an Afghan National Army Uniform in Paktya Province, Afghanistan on September 26, 2013. Darren Baysore, left, with his parents Thomas and Jamie, wanted to leave a light on so his father could see his way home from the moon. When Mrs Baysore published the request on Facebook, the story went viral, right . Darren, pictured hugging his mother Jamie has struggled to cope since his father's death in Afghanistan . But since his campaign, Darren has regained some of the happiness in his life because of the support . Darren's mother Jamie helped with the plan establishing a heartwarming Facebook page outlining the details of the story. As a result of the campaign page, which has so far attracted more than 35,000 'likes', people from around the world posted images of their porches. When Darren was told of his father's death, his mother told him that Sgt Baysore would split his time between heaven and the moon so they would still be able to talk. As a result of that, Darren developed his idea to light up his area on the anniversary of his father's death so he would be able to see home. Mrs Baysore said she fully expected the people of Fort Campbell, such as this,  to get behind the campaign . But as soon as the campaign went viral on the internet the family received support from around the globe . Members of various emergency services sent photographs to show Darren they remembered his father . According to The Tennessean, Mrs Baysore has been stunned by the reaction to her son's campaign. She said: 'We really had no idea Darren's request would go much beyond Clarksville and Fort Campbell. I mean, we expected a response for sure, but nothing like what happened.' Mrs Baysore said the response to the campaign has even increased her son's faith in God. She wrote on the Shining Light Facebook page: 'Since my husband has been killed, Darren has not been to church but a few times because he is still upset about it and I choose as a mother to let him join on his own terms rather then forcing him and taking the chance of losing his faith forever. So with that being said, since this remembrance porch light has started and going around for the first time in about a year tonight Darren asked as I was walking out the room, ""Mommy, can we pray?"" 'My heart melted and tears were about to come out. But I pulled it together and we prayed. As we prayed all I could do was thank God for answering my prayers and helping Darren to start finding his light again. I just needed to share this joy that I am feeling inside.' Thousands of houses across the globe shone a light in memory of Staff Sgt Baysore who died in Afghanistan . Staff Sergeant Thomas Baysore was shot dead by a terrorist wearing an Afghan army uniform .

"David Blunkett, the former Home Secretary, said Miliband needed to highlight to voters that he was heading up a team . David Blunkett suggested last night that Labour should underplay the fact that Ed Miliband is their leader during the election. As doubts grow over Mr Miliband’s stewardship of the party, the former Home Secretary said he needed to highlight to voters that he was heading up a team – and not to concentrate campaigning on him alone. ‘The offer is a Labour government, not a Labour presidency,’ he said. And he suggested that Mr Miliband was not exciting, saying that former leader John Smith had once told him: ‘If you want excitement, go to the races.’ The suggestion that Labour should campaign for victory without drawing attention to their leader will not be seen as helpful to the beleagured Mr Miliband. Concern about his performance has dramatically deepened after Ukip finished a close second – just 617 votes from victory – in Thursday’s by-election in the Labour heartland of Heywood and Middleton. As doubts grow over his leadership, Ed Miliband will address a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party this afternoon. One MP said: ‘He will face some tough questions. But there is such disillusionment in the party that many people might just not turn up.’ Yesterday Harriet Harman was forced to deny that Mr Miliband will be ditched for a more popular leader before the election. She said in a TV interview that there would ‘absolutely not’ be a change of leader - and claimed there was no ‘wobble in the ranks’ of the Labour party over his future. Former Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay became the first party figure to openly call for Mr Miliband to go - saying the beleaguered leader was a ‘complete disaster’ and should quit to ‘make way for an election winner’. Mr MacKinlay was the MP for the seat of Thurrock in Essex - which was a top target for Labour at the next election, but which Ukip are now predicted to win amid deep concerns about immigration. The senior ex-MP said the party’s performance in the Heywood by-election was not that of a ‘government in waiting’ and described Mr Miliband’s leadership as ‘a complete disaster’. As doubts grow over his leadership, Ed Miliband will address a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party this afternoon . But Alan Johnson, the charismatic former postman who was home secretary under Gordon Brown, dashed the hopes of Labour MPs who want to see him return as leader by ruling it out. Mr Johnson said he ‘hated’ being on the front bench in opposition – serving briefly as shadow chancellor - and said he had made it ‘perfectly clear’ to Mr Miliband that ‘I left and I’m not coming back.’ In an interview with the Guardian, Mr Blunkett said he was determined to do no harm to the Labour leadership. ‘I am doing and saying nothing that in any way would damage the chances of electing a Labour government,’ he said. But, in comments which were seen as admitting there is an Ed problem, he said: ‘There is no point in Ed Miliband being something he is not. New UKIP MP Douglas Carswell claims a Labour MP could be next to defect . ‘I think he needs to build on two strengths: one is the idea of having a conversation with people rather than performing in front of them in a kind of parade; and secondly building a team, as he has been doing, so this is a team approach. ‘Of course, led by him. But actually the offer is a Labour government, not a Labour presidency.’ He added: ‘It is perfectly feasible for someone to have a different style of leadership and be able to deliver. ‘If people want something that is just a performance, then they will be taken in by Nigel Farage. John Smith once said to me, ‘If you want excitement, go to the races.’ Ukip’s best ever result in a Labour-held seat, on the day they won their first MP from the Tories in Clacton, has triggered criticism that Labour has failed to confront voters’ concerns about immigration. It follows a lacklustre performance by Mr Miliband in the Scottish referendum campaign, which had to be salvaged by Gordon Brown, and a widely panned party conference speech. Miss Harman yesterday insisted: ‘There is not a wobble in the ranks and nor should there be. ‘I think what is absolutely evident is that the anger and concern there is amongst people when they’re being told that a recovery has arrived and yet they’ re not getting better off and feeling disconnected from politics. ‘That is being picked up on by Ukip. ‘But actually Ukip, although they’re tapping into that sense of despair, they don’t provide the answers. ‘It provides a very big responsibility on us as the Labour party when people see the economy not delivering for them, they’re worried about the health service, it is our responsibility to listen to those concerns and work together to make sure that we get rid of this government and address those concerns.’ Another current MP Graham Stringer said the party could not stand up to the ‘street fighting’ skills of Nigel Farage and should never have come so close to losing a safe seat. Mr Miliband penned an article for a Sunday newspaper setting out how he would deal with immigration, and saying people’s concerns needed to be addressed. He reiterated his party’s two policies on the issue– to somehow better control who is coming in and out of Britain’s borders and to enforce the minimum wage so firms cannot undercut British workers by hiring deeper foreign Labour. Yesterday Harriet Harman was forced to deny that Mr Miliband will be ditched for a more popular leader before the election . Miss Harman said Mr Miliband’s article on immigration yesterday was ‘about a new approach which is saying ‘we do want to talk about immigration, we do have these policies, and that these will actually solve the problems’ not just set out a number like the Tories did’, referring to the target to reduce net migration to tens of thousands which the coalition has failed to meet. But he faces another potential crisis in the coming months as Tories signalled they are determined to force a Commons vote on the issue of English votes for English laws. Mr Miliband has so far refused to accept David Cameron’s suggestion for a divide, which would mean Labour’s 41 MPs North of the Border would not be able to vote on English-only issues. But he faced criticism of this from former Labour home secretary Charles Clarke who said he could no longer avoid the issue, and must come up with proposals ‘very quickly’. He claimed Mr Miliband’s stance on the issue – promising to hold a constitutional convention in a years’ time was ‘hopeless’ and ‘foolish’ and suggested Labour did not care about England. Miss Harman denied the Labour party was like a ‘latte-sipping Liberal north London intelligentsia’ as put forward by one unnamed Labour MP. She told The Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 (keep) ‘That is not the reality, that is not the Labour party. There are people like myself from professional middle-class backgrounds representing a seat in London. But there are people representing the north east, labour MPs from the north west, west midlands, from Wales and Scotland. ‘Actually, we have people in the Labour party from all walks of life, from all different backgrounds and from different parts of the country. And it’s working together, that broad-based team that listens and understands all parts of the country. That is how we’re going to make the way forward under Ed Miliband’s leadership.’","He said: 'The offer is a Labour government, not a Labour presidency'

His leadership has been shaken by narrow victory over Ukip in by-election ."
"Pictured is Chris Stimson of Well-Lit who claims to have come up with the 'holy grail' of lighting . A Yorkshire company has beaten global giants to invent the ‘holy grail’ of light bulbs: a low energy unit which is as bright as a traditional bulb. Well-Lit claims it has solved the shortcomings of LED lightbulbs, which have so far been unable to match the brightness of old-style incandescent bulbs. The new bulbs use 85 per cent less energy and will last up to nine years, according to the firm which is based in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire. It has done this using a new type of chip that improves phosphor conversion, which is the process by which light particles from an LED chip are converted to a different colour. Well-Lit’s founder and managing director Chris Stimson, 36, said: ‘We’re excited to get our revolutionary bulbs out the public. ‘When someone says “they are as bright as a normal bulb”, that’s what I want to hear. It’s like the holy grail of the LED world.’ The brightness of bulbs is measured by the Colour Rendering Index (CRI), which gives a score out of 100 to determine how vivid a light source makes the true colours appear. Almost every single LED lamp currently on sale in the UK only has a CRI rating of around 80 - that is 20 per cent less than the traditional incandescent bulbs, according to Well-Lit. But Well-Lit’s new units, which start at around £10 (£16), claim to have pushed that number up to 97. Pictured are the LED lightbulbs that are a direct replacement for a GU10 and standard lightbulb. The bulbs use 85 per cent less energy and will last up to nine years, according to Well-Lit which is based in Huddersfield . ‘To achieve our market leading Colour Rendering levels we produced a “sunlight white” performance LED device,’ said Mr Stimson. He added that they used a series of unique quality control methods in the LED production process to make the bulb shine as bright as possible. ‘Our method for producing white light using a new type of chip and multiple phosphor conversion achieved a day light white LED light that is far superior to the light emitted by other LED Lamps,’ he said. Pictured is Chris Stimson (right) being presented with an award from Dragonsí Den star Theo Paphitis (centre) for his SBS Award for small businesses . LED bulbs last for 100,000 hours compared with 10,000 hours for fluorescent tubes and 1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs. They also use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs. However, up until now, they have struggle to maintain the same level of brightness.

Their technology uses blue LEDs, which last week landed three Japanese-born scientists the Nobel Prize in physics after they invented it in the 1990s. Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Japan and U.S. scientist Shuji Nakamura won the award for their invention, which has led to the use of environmentally-friendly light sources worldwide.
