Paula Deen is scheduled to appear on the Today Show Wednesday, less than a week after she cancelled an interview amid the scandal over her use of racial slurs. Following her dismissal from the Food Network, meat producer Smithfield announced that they will be dropping Deen as their company spokeswoman and will be ending their partnership. The company also sells a line of Paula Deen-branded hams. The company released a statement saying it 'condemns the use of offensive and discriminatory language and behavior of any kind. Therefore, we are terminating our partnership with Paula Deen.' Scroll down for videos . Shilling no more: Paula Deen had long served as the spokeswoman for Smithfield hams, and even had her own brand of ham, but now they have sacked her over the racial slur scandal . Try again: The show announced the the disgraced chef would be appearing on Wednesday . Awkward: Lauer was forced to explain on-air that Deen was meant to show up on Friday but simply didn't come . The Food Network had featured the butter-loving chef on their cable channel since 2001 but they were the first ones to drop her as soon as the extent of her racist language became clear. Home shopping network QVC issued a carefully-worded statement saying they do not tolerate discrimination, but were reticent to drop Deen until the litigation was finalized. They sell a line of cookware designed by the 66-year-old TV chef. On Monday, meat producer Smithfield announced that they would be cutting ties with Deen in light of the scandal. It is unclear how much she earned from her multi-year contract with the meat firm, but she is estimated to have a net worth of $17million. Another blow came when it was announced over the weekend that she will not be appearing on home shopping network QVC as litigation continues in the discrimination lawsuit. The . 66-year-old cook became embroiled in the racial controversy when a . former employee testified that she heard Deen repeatedly use the n-word . and talk of how she wanted to have a plantation themed wedding for her . brother with an all-black serving staff to emulate slaves. After the testimony was released . publicly, both Deen and her career have spiraled out of control in a . public relations nightmare. First she released a heavily-edited video on Friday where she spoke directly to her fans, asking for their forgiveness. She was due to follow that up with an appearance on the Today Show that same morning, but cancelled at the last minute leaving co-anchor Matt Lauer to explain on air. After the initial video was released another, longer one was then posted on YouTube and was taken down soon after. In this one she explains her absence from the Today show and apologizes 'to those that I have hurt'. Financial loss: Deen was dropped by Smithfield in the wake of the scandal, and the thing happened with the Food Network partnership . Previous appearance: Paula Deen was to appear on the Today show on Friday morning to answer questions from Matt Lauer about her past use of racial slurs - but she pulled out just before the show started . She says: 'I was invited to speak to Matt Lauer about a subject that has been very hurtful for a lot of people. 'Matt I was physically not able this . morning, the pain has been tremendous that I have caused to myself and . to others so I am taking this opportunity, now that i have pulled myself . together and am able to speak, to offer an apology for those I've . hurt.' The controversial chef and her . handlers must have kissed-and-made-up with the Today Show as Lauer . announced on Monday morning that Deen will now be coming on the show . Wednesday, lest she change her mind again. Over the weekend, her loyal fans have . shown their support by lining up in droves to eat at her Savannah, . Georgia restaurant, and bash the Food Network on social media. 'Everyone in this nation has used a . racist comment at one time or another. She grew up in the South,' Facebook user Maria O'Donnell wrote on the channel's page. Over the weekend, more stories about . the chef's alleged racism as a former employee alleged that Deen and her . brother regularly called him 'my little monkey'.

Another told how as an oyster cook at one of her restaurants the black waitstaff were regularly forced to work at her private parties held at her Savannah, Georgia estate without pay. 'Paula and Bubba just gave us beer and alcohol and I don’t even drink. It was insulting and unfair. I was like, ""Pay me!""' Sheldon J. Ervin told Radar. While the Network cut ties to the . chef, who headlined three shows on the channel that she has worked with . for the past 11 years, QVC has waited to make any final moves. 'QVC shares the concerns being raised . around the unfortunate Paula Deen situation. QVC does not tolerate . discriminatory behavior,' vice president Paul Capelli said in a . statement.

Famed sci-fi and fantasy writer Richard Matheson has died at the age of 87. Matheson was best known for his stories 'I Am Legend' and 'The Shrinking Man.' Matheson's daughter Ali announced his death on Sunday, saying he died 'surrounded by the people and things he loved.' Matheson passed away on June 23. Matheson was a prolific writer, and many of his works and were turned into films. 'I Am Legend' the story about the last man alive after an apocalypse, spawned three film adaptations - 1964's 'The Last Man on Earth' starring Vincent Price, 1971's 'Omega Man' starring Charlton Heston and the most recent 2007 version 'I Am Legend' starring Will Smith. Other stories turned into films include 1953's 'Hell House,' 1956's 'The Shrinking Man,' 1958's 'A Stir of Echoes,' and 1978's 'What Dreams May Come.' He also penned a few episodes of 'The Twilight Zone' including a popular episode called 'The Nightmare at 20,000 Feet' which starred William Shatner . Matheson also helped inspire a new generation of storytellers. Anne Rice said his short story 'A Dress of white Silk' was part of what got her interested in vampires. When writing Cell, Stephen King drew heavily upon Matheson's work and Steven Spielberg's first film was based on a Matheson story. The thing that set Matheson apart from other writers in his genre was that he kept his stories grounded in a recognizable world. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Matheson said: 'I wrote about real people and real circumstances and real neighborhoods. There was no crypts or castles or H.P. Lovecraft-type environments. They were just about normal people who had something bizarre happening to them in the neighborhood. I could never write about strange kingdoms. I could never do Harry Potter or anything like that. Even when I did science-fiction I didn’t write about foreign planets and distant futures. I certainly never did fantasies about trolls living under bridges. I had to write about realistic circumstances. That’s the way my brain works. And I think that gave me a sort of place in the field.' Legendary: One of Matheson's stories 'I Am Legend' was turned into a film three times, most recently starring Will Smith . Honorable: Matheson was scheduled to receive a visionary award at the Academy of Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Film's Saturn Awards this Wednesday . Tragically, Matheson was going to receive a visionary award this Wednesday at the Academy of Science Fiction, Horror and Fantasy Films' Saturn Awards. Their 39th annual ceremony will be dedicated to Matheson, and his award presented posthumously. 'We are heartbroken to lose a writer of towering talent, unlimited imagination and unparalleled inspiration,' Robert Holguin, the academy's president told the AP. 'Richard was a genius whose visions helped bring legitimacy and critical acclaim to science fiction and fantasy.' Matheson was born in 1926 in New Jersey and raised in Brooklyn, New York. He published his first short story in 1950 and moved to Los Angeles in 1951. The following year he married his wife Ruth Ann Woodson and together they had four children, three of which became writers themselves. Matheson is survived by his wife and children.","Writer of 'I Am Legend,' 'The Shrinking Man,' and episodes of 'The Twilight Zone'

An astronaut currently orbiting 220 miles above the earth didn’t let a lack of gravity stop her from attending her high school reunion over the weekend. Karen Nyberg is an American aboard the International Space Station. She’s been there since May. So when the Henning High School class of 1988 reunion met this past weekend, Nyberg enlisted the help of NASA and attended the gathering via video link from outer space. Flying high: Dr. Karen Nyberg, seen here aboard the space shuttle Discovery, is now aboard the International Space Station. But she didn't let that stop her from attending her high school reunion . ‘Hello Karen,’ said classmate Andrea Rogers, as a smiling blond woman hovered on a screen before her. ‘Welcome to your 25th high school class reunion!’ From the space station to Henning, Minnesota, Nyberg, 43, said hello back and proceeded to become the most jealousy-inducing, ego-shrinking high school reunion attendee of all time. If there were doctors, lawyers, or self-made millionaires in attendance, even they must have shriveled as their classmate-turned-astronaut spun 360 degrees in zero gravity. ‘This is my favorite part of the job,’ she smiled, while upside down. Overachiever: Nyberg graduated from Henning High School in Henning, Minnesota in 1988 and her career has been skyrocketing ever since . What have you been up to? Via video link, Dr. Nyberg was able to visit her 25th high school reunion in Henning, Minnesota from 220 miles above the earth . Showing off: Nyberg was able to give her old classmates a tour of the International Space Station and even turned the camera back on themselves, showing them Earth from outer space . For a group of her old high school chums and their kids, Dr. Nyberg gave a tour of the International Space Station as well as a Q&A. She even gave them a view of themselves, turning the camera towards Earth from about a million feet up. But the meeting wasn’t one-sided. Say hello, honey: Nyberg's classmates brought their kids in for a Q&A with the astronaut . As the group caught up with their high achieving friend, they got to share what they’d been up to as well. Even if it seemed a little underwhelming by comparison. ‘Hi Karen, this is Tracy and my fiance, Jeff,’ said a proud classmate. ‘Tracy and fiancé,’ replied the doctor of mechanical engineering. ‘Congratulations, I guess I didn't know that.’ 'This is my favorite part of the job': Nyberg displays her zero gravity skills . ‘They kind of become your extended brothers and sisters,’ Rogers said of Nyberg and her other classmates to WDAY. ‘So, for her to be able to join us sort of completes our family reunion as much as it is a class reunion.’ Like a lot of her high school friends, Karen is also married and has a 3-year-old son back on Earth and says she swaps videos with them every day. Nyberg's mission launched via Soyuz rocket May 28 and is scheduled to last around five more months. Shove off: Nyberg (left, with Fyodor Yurchikhin and Luca Parmitano) on her way to launch in the Soyuz rocket in Kazakhstan May 28. Her mission lasts another five months.

One Ukrainian developer has taken the concept of keeping tabs on his pet one step further and incorporated robotic controls into a camera so he can watch, talk to and play with his dog when he's out of the house. Petcube is a robotic camera and laser created by Alex Neskin after he moved to a new apartment and heard from neighbors that his dog, Rocky, was making a lot of noise when Alex had left the house. Alex set up a controlled web cam to see what Rocky was up to in his absence. Scroll down for video . Prototype: Alex has 'always been interested in robotics' and created this camera and laser set-up to keep his dog Rocky entertained while Alex was out . 'What I saw wasn't so pleasant,' says Alex, describing the dog barking at the front door of his apartment for hours on end. 'Then I understood that I needed some kind of interaction with Rocky,' Alex says. 'The solution came out of Rocky's favorite toy - laser stick [laser pointer].' Alex attached a laser pointer to the controlled webcam, 'And every time I moved the camera, the laser moved too,' he says, which sent Rocky off in wild pursuit and kept him away from the front door. Creator: Petcube creator Alex Neskin and his girlfriend moved to a new apartment with their dog Rocky and quickly discovered Rocky was making a lot of noise when they were out . Alex says the device meant he could play . with Rocky when he wasn't at home, just like they would if they were . together. But it wasn't just Alex playing with Rocky - he made a website . so that his friends could go and play with Rocky too. 'All of them wanted to have such a robot to play with their pets,' says Alex. That's when Alex had the idea to develop Petcube on a larger scale, and gathered a small team about him to put the concept into production. Petcube: This is the Petcube that's going into production, which is made of aluminum and glass and has changeable 'skins' to match your decor . 'Our goal is to develop a really nice looking robot that can fit any interior,' he says. The prototype is a sleek aluminum and glass box that need only be connected to WiFi and it's ready to go. Users simply go to the Petcube website or connect through iOS or Android to begin playing with their pets, meaning they can be entertaining Fido from virtually anywhere. Puppy project: Alex developed the Petcube for his dog Rocky but quickly realized that all pet owners want to check up on their pets and keep them company while they're out of the house . According to the Petcube website, the first Petcubes will be ready to ship by fall. The Petcube has a 160-degree wide-angle camera that streams 720 pixel video, a low-intensity laser pointer on a moveable platform, a microphone and speakers. Users can share access to their Petcube with family and friends, and even make it public so that anyone can play with their pets. People without a Petcube can go online and play with pets whose owners have made their Petcube public.","The Petcube has a camera, microphone, speaker and moveable laser pointer .

Almost half a million healthy women at high risk of breast cancer could be offered a daily pill to help prevent the disease. Tamoxifen should be given to those women who have a history of the disease in the family, according to NHS guidance. Taking the drug for five years – costing just £120 in total – would cut the risk by more than a third.And the protection could last 20 years, according to clinical trials. New NHS guidance says tamoxifen will give women at high risk an alternative to having their breasts removed as chosen by celebrities including Angelina Jolie and Sharon Osbourne . It will provide women with an alternative to having their breasts removed, as chosen by Angelina Jolie and Sharon Osbourne. Tamoxifen has been used for almost 40 . years to treat breast cancer. But now the National Institute for Health . and Care Excellence says it and another drug called raloxifene should . be used for prevention. It says they are cost effective and likely to save the NHS money by cutting cases of the disease. Trials show tamoxifen can prevent 35 . to 45 per cent of breast cancers, with a similar reduction from . raloxifene, which is used to treat osteoporosis in women who have gone . through the menopause. It is the first time any health . service has issued such widespread guidance, which could affect 3 per . cent of women aged 35 and older – around 488,000 – in England and Wales. Sharon Osbourne also opted for a mastectomy. But instead women could take the drug Tamoxifen for five years - costing just £120 in total - and cut their risk by more than a third . They will be eligible if they have a . family history that puts them at high risk, with a lifetime chance of . developing breast cancer that exceeds 30 per cent, or ‘moderate’ risk of . between 17 and 30 per cent. Currently high-risk women can be . offered annual MRI scans from the age of 40. Under the revised guidance, . which also covers 400 men diagnosed with breast cancer each year, women . with some genetic mutations will be offered annual scans from the age . of 20 to 49. The new guidance says women at higher than average risk should be offered surveillance at younger ages to detect the disease earlier . Women at moderate risk could get . annual X-ray scans from the age of 40, while others could get annual . checks after 50 instead of every three years with the routine NHS . screening programme. But the most controversial plan is for the drugs to be prescribed as . preventive therapy, as they are not licensed for such use here, although . they are in the US. The lifetime risk of breast cancer is . one in eight, and almost 50,000 women a year are diagnosed with breast . cancer. Of these, around 2,400 patients have inherited faults in known . breast cancer genes, while a further 5,000 to 7,000 women are affected . by genes not yet identified. The guidance, which supersedes advice . issued in 2004, says people with a 10 per cent risk of developing the . cancer should be offered genetic testing – the current threshold is 20 . per cent – which should double the numbers eligible for a blood test. Professor Gareth Evans from St Mary’s . Hospital in Manchester, who helped develop the guidelines, said: ‘This . treatment is potentially not just cost-effective but cost saving to the . NHS and more importantly for women they don’t have to go through the . stress and trauma of a diagnosis, radiotherapy, potentially . chemotherapy.’ Prof Evans said women whose risk of . breast cancer was 80 per cent or above may still opt for surgery, which . virtually eliminates the risk. Menopause-like side-effects such as . hot flushes usually stop after the first six months, and more serious . problems are rarer, he added. Baroness Delyth Morgan, chief . executive of the Breast Cancer Campaign, said the guidelines represented . a ‘truly historic moment’. Susan Heard, an NHS nurse specialising in breast care, said today that the drug could be a viable alternative to preventive mastectomy, which many women are wary of 'for lots of medical reasons but also for psychological reasons'. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, 'We will never be able to tell women exactly on an individual basis whether or not they're going to develop breast cancer,' but added: 'Research is going on all the time to hone in on the people who will develop breast cancer.' Ms Heard also said that some local NHS trusts were already offering tamoxifen as a preventive measure, which will now be available to women no matter where they live.","NHS guidance says tamoxifen will give women at high risk of cancer .

She told the court that she was forced to change her phone number because of the constant harrassment, and testified that Barton turned up at her mother's house and told her the pair were planning to get married. The 29-year-old spy denies sexual assault, two physical assaults and harassing the woman, referred to as '2363', between August and December 2011. Trial: Southwark Crown Court heard that an MI5 spy rolled around on the floor when his ex-girlfriend refused to get back together with him . The pair had begun seeing each other in July 2010, but the woman ended it within a year because Barton had not told his parents about her and had made her feel 'like a dirty secret', Southwark Crown Court has heard. 2363 told the court that Barton followed her after she left a work party in August 2011 and forced her to go to his flat as he lifted her off the Tube in a 'bear hug'. He wanted to try and save their relationship, she said, even though she told him that their romance was permanently over. 'His behaviour continued to be out of control,' she told the court. 'He would roll around on the floor. 'He said he didn't understand why I am doing it, and can't we just talk like adults? 'I just shut off. I tried to reason but it didn't work. He was back rolling around the floor and thumping the floor.' She said that she tried to leave but Barton held her back and threw her into a cupboard, forcing her to seek refuge in the bathroom. Office romance: The MI5 headquarters in central London where the couple both worked . Five days later, jurors heard, 2363 reluctantly agreed to meet Baron at a cafe, where he began acting extremely erratically. She said he was shaking his coffee cup and 'repeatedly saying the word ""latte""', as well as banging on the table and shouting. 'I started to feel threatened and frightened and wondered what I could do to sort the situation out,' 2363 told the court. 'I began to feel like this might not stop. His behaviour was unpredictable.' The man's ex also testified that one weekend he called her so many times that she had to change her phone number. 'He was constantly ringing me,' she said. 'I turned my phone off because I was worried I would accidentally answer it. 'When I turned it back on in the morning it was still going, so I decided to change my number.'Barton allegedly visited her mother's house and told her the pair had got back together and would probably marry 'within two years'. 2363 said she thought her former boyfried had 'lost it a little bit', adding: 'Mark had never met my parents. 'I felt vulnerable and wide open because he'd got hold of my mother's address. I was shocked and a little bit violated. And I knew it had made my mum feel uncomfortable.' She told jurors that after Barton was on the same train to London as her she decided to report him to managers at work, even though she 'felt guilty' about the possibility of getting him in trouble. The next day, she said, she received a bouquet of flowers from him with a card attached and the note: 'I chose this card because I thought the dogs looked as sad as I feel.' Despite being warned by MI5 bosses not to talk to each other, 2363 said she allowed him to stay friends with her and they went out together three times a week. On October 8 the pair had dinner at her flat and kissed before going into her bedroom 'as if more was going to happen' before they had an argument because she changed her mind. He stayed the night but did not have sex. Ten days later they went for dinner and drinks, 2363 hoping the defendant would understand they were nothing more than friends, she said. She said he forced a kiss on her at a Tube station. 'I was frustrated with myself and felt I had got myself into trouble again,' said 2363, who said she was embarrassed about kissing him and trying to be friends. Barton is accused of sexually assaulting 2363 five days later by forcing his way into her flat and aggressively kissing her on the lips. 'He lunged at me and punched the sofa at the side of my head,' she said. 'He was acting like he was really really angry with me.' Barton's trial is being conducted amid tight security, with the defendant and witnesses screened off from the public and all witnesses from MI5 assigned numbers to preserve their anonymity.

The Mayor of London’s appeal stretches beyond the capital, recognised by 94 per cent of people. It means he was as well-known as the Foreign Secretary, Health Secretary and the Defence Secretary put together.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg was less well known than Mr Miliband, despite spending three years as Deputy Prime Minister.

Fraudster: Peter Stead, 50, who has been jailed for two years posing as comedian Peter Kay's brother in several scams . A man who posed as the brother of comedian Peter Kay in order to defraud pub landlords has been jailed for two years. Peter Stead used his made-up family connection to the famous funnyman to set up comedy nights for charity. The 50-year-old fraudster took deposits from pub landlords to hold fundraising events in aid of a young child suffering from cancer. On one occasion Mr Stead, posing as ‘Danny Kay’ told a landlord he was raising money for the Lewis Mighty Fund, a charity set up via a local hospital in aid of a young boy with Neuroblastoma, and that his brother would be making an appearance, Derby Crown Court heard. In August 2009 Mr Stead, of no fixes address, visited a pub in Friargate, Derby, and after purporting to be Danny Kay promised that he would put on some comedy shows. Ms Ahya said: ‘He said he would do a couple of comedy shows at the complainant’s public house. ‘These shows would be done to raise funds for the Lewis Mighty Fund. ‘That particular charity was to raise money for a young boy who was very unwell in Derby. ‘The complainant gave the defendant a £75 deposit to in due course undertake the shows.’ Mr Stead, who has a long list of previous convictions for dishonesty offences, failed to put on any shows. On another occasion, he said Peter Kay would be turning up at his charitable function, after which a good-hearted publican offered him the venue for free and gave him £45 so that he could process his application for a charity licence, the court heard. Jailing him for a total of two years Recorder Adrienne Lucking said Stead’s offences that played on people’s kindness where they thought they were helping the Lewis Mighty charitable cause were of a particularly mean nature. ‘You invoked the name of a charity which would inevitably and rightly tug on people’s heart strings because it was about a young man, a child, who was unfortunately someone who had a dreadful disease,’ she told him. Fake claims: Mr Stead promised his 'brother' Peter Kay would be turning up at a made-up charity function - using the name of a charity in aid of a cancer-stricken child - to scam a pub landlord out of money . ‘You played on people’s sympathy and their empathy and their wish to help others and they gave you their money. ‘They thought they were helping a fund or providing charitable support to a young man who needed it. ‘It’s difficult to think of a meaner kind of confidence fraud.’ Broken trust: Mr Stead was blasted for his 'confidence fraud' by posing as Peter Kay's brother . She added that he carried out his offending with ‘great enthusiasm’ over the years and was an experienced and practised confidence fraudster. On other occasions Stead posed as the comedian’s brother and promised he could get a man a television for £50. On another he said he could get tickets for a Peter Kay show but needed a £10 charitable donation. In total he is thought to have made £540 from a series of frauds. In mitigation Dean Bower said a lot of Stead’s offending stemmed from heavy drinking and he had that morning asked his lawyer to pass on an apology. Mr Bower told the court: ‘He said: ""To anybody I’ve upset I apologise. I want to say that no matter what I say I can’t undo what I’ve done.""' Mr Bower said Stead was particularly regretful about using the name of the Lewis Mighty Fund. The Lewis Mighty Fund aids children being treated for cancer at Nottingham University Hospitals and to help them and their families in the community. It is named after Lewis Paul who was diagnosed with Stage 4 High Risk Neuroblastoma aged four and passed away before his eight birthday. ‘In particular the defendant offers his apology to the parents of that boy, the wider family and friends who would have been undoubtedly upset and grossly offended when they found out what he had done.’ Mr Stead admitted five counts of fraud between 2008 and 2012.","Peter Stead, 50, pretended to be Peter Kay's brother in series of cons .

Action: Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said spending a bit more in the short-term can secure big savings . Officials are to turn up at the homes of 400,000 of Britain’s most disruptive families to get them out of bed for job interviews and make sure their children go to school. Alcoholics and drug addicts will also be made to go to rehab under the plan which hugely extends a project already targeting 120,000 families. Money to widen the scheme has been found in the Government’s spending review for 2015-16 which is due to be announced tomorrow. Chancellor George Osborne is to say that £4,500 will be spent targeting each of 400,000 high-risk families who dominate the work of the police, social workers and NHS staff. They cost taxpayers billions because of worklessness, anti-social behaviour and truancy. The average annual cost to the state of such a family is £15,000, but ministers say the worst cost as much as £330,000 a year. However, 84 per cent of the spending is used to react to their problems, rather than trying to turn around their lives. As many as 20 arms of the state are involved in dealing with these households at present. A more co-ordinated approach, which will see one dedicated official take responsibility for ensuring that children go to school, adults attend job interviews and the whole family stays out of trouble, will be more effective, ministers argue. The riots in the summer of 2011 convinced the Government that drastic steps are required to tackle a hardcore of neighbourhoods where few have a proper job. The coalition says Labour’s welfare legacy means there are parts of Britain where three generations of families have never worked and live on state benefits. Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander said yesterday that an extra £200million had been found for 2015-16 to help problem families, despite spending cuts worth £11.5billion across Whitehall due to be confirmed in tomorrow’s review. Government departments will provide 40 per cent of the cost of working with each family. Problems: More joined up work between the police, social workers and NHS staff should stop their time being dominated by a hardcore of problem families . Councils and other agencies that will . benefit from savings which come from preventing crime and social . breakdown will have to find the other 60 per cent. Mr Alexander said: ‘The troubled . families programme is a radical example of how, by spending a bit more . in certain areas, we can save much more in others, and by doing so . create a stronger economy and a fairer society. ‘Extending this intensive help to . 400,000 more families will enable us to tackle problems such as truancy, . anti-social behaviour and crime. ‘The Government is committing . £200million in funding in 2015-16, and for every £4,500 spent on a . family we can reduce the annual £15,000 cost of dealing with their . problems by reducing the burden on the police, health and social . services.’ Communities Secretary Eric Pickles . said: ‘The programme is on track to turn around the lives of 120,000 . families by 2015. I am delighted that we will be able to continue the . progress we have begun after 2015.’ Louise Casey, the former anti-social behaviour ‘tsar’ who advised Tony . Blair’s government and now heads the troubled families programme, said: . ‘It is great news that the momentum we have built up can continue by . extending the approach to a wider group of families.’ Labour, which had some success giving . a small number of families intensive supervision, admitted that a . minority of ‘Shameless’ households were causing the majority of crime . and anti-social behaviour. That was a reference to the Channel 4 . drama Shameless which features a dysfunctional family living on an . estate of  benefit claimants and cheats.","Treasury minister Danny Alexander announces funding for 2015-16 .

A police force spent more than £300,000 trying to stop an officer coming back to work after he was jailed for dragging a woman prisoner across a floor and throwing her headfirst into a cell. Mark Andrews was jailed for six months in 2010 for assaulting Pamela Somerville, 60, at Melksham Police Station but had his conviction quashed following an appeal. Today it emerged that Wiltshire Police spent the six-figure sum trying to keep him out of the force - a battle that ended in failure when he was reinstated in his £36,000-a-year job at the same police station. Scroll down for video . Sergeant Mark Andrews, 40, is back in a £36,000-a-year job despite Wiltshire Police spending more than £300,000 trying to keep him out after he threw Pamela Somerville, 60, right, headfirst into a cell, injuring her . Ms Somerville was arrested in July 2008 after she was found asleep in her car near her home in Colerne, Wiltshire, following a row with her partner. She was detained after failing to provide a sample for a breath test, but the charges were later dropped.

'If such a case was to arise in the future, a key factor in reaching a decision would be to determine what was in the best interests of the public.

Warning: Labour leader Ed Miliband last week raised doubts that safeguards could work to prevent arms falling into the hands of extremist groups . Ed Miliband has been invited to a secret security meeting today in an apparent attempt to persuade him to soften his opposition to arming Syrian rebels. The Labour leader will be briefed by spy chiefs and military top brass at the Government’s National Security Council (NSC), which is chaired by David Cameron. The pair have clashed over the idea of sending weapons to help end the civil war and Mr Miliband is expected to repeat concerns that arms could find their way to extremists, while backing moves for a peace conference. Labour sources denied his hands would be ‘dipped in blood’ by accepting the invitation and suggested the meeting was routine. Downing Street also played down his role, saying it ‘makes sense’ for opposition leaders to discuss foreign policy issues. Mr Miliband attended an NSC meeting just once before – during the Libyan crisis in 2011. It comes after Mr Miliband warned the Prime Minister he must ‘build the greatest possible consensus’ across political parties before intervening in Syria. The NSC is chaired by the Prime Minister to oversee all aspects of Britain’s security. The head of the armed forces and the intelligence agencies attend to brief ministers on the biggest threats at home and overseas. Permanent members include Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, Chancellor George Osborne, Foreign Secretary William Hague and Home Secretary Theresa May. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, International Development Secretary Justine Greening and security minister James Brokenshire are also expected to attend. Mr Cameron’s official spokesman said Mr Miliband would be expected to ‘contribute fully’ to the talks. Fire power: A Free Syrian Army fighter is seen carrying his weapon near the frontline in the Al-Sakhour neighborhood of Aleppo last week, as the row grows over the UK providing lethal support . ‘They will be talking about a number of issues including Afghanistan, Iran and Syria. ‘It makes sense to discuss major issues of foreign policy and that’s what is happening tomorrow.’ However, the policy differences are most stark over the issue of Syria. Mr Miliband has accused the Prime . Minister of spending too much ‘political capital and energy’ on lifting . the EU arms embargo to supply weapons to the rebels, without securing a . major breakthrough at last week’s G8 summit. There . are growing fears that any move by Britain to arm opposition forces . could see weapons falling into the hands of extremist groups with links . to Al Qaeda. The Labour leader has questioned what safeguards the government believes could work in practice to stop this happening.

Talks: The G8 summit in Northern Ireland, hosted by David Cameron, was dominated last week by global divisions over how to end the bloody conflict . The Prime Minister appeared to signal a change in approach, and suggested he wanted to reach cross-party agreement. ‘I appreciate the fact that [Mr Miliband] has tried to provide consensus on issues of foreign policy - we should always try to do that, and I hope we can re-forge that consensus in the months ahead.’ But he defended the decision to push for the lifting of the EU arms embargo. ‘ It sent a powerful signal that there is not a moral equivalence between Assad on the one hand and the official opposition, who want a democratic Syria, on the other. ‘That has helped to add to the pressure. There is a huge danger that people will fall into the trap of believing Assad’s argument, which is that the only alternative to him is terrorism and extremism. ‘We should stand for something else in the House and in this country - we should stand up for people who want democracy, freedom and the sorts of things we take for granted right here.’","Labour leader to attend Downing Street talks with senior ministers .

Two women claimed they were raped by child killer Mick Philpott as they gave evidence to police about the fire in which six of his children died. The 56-year-old is currently serving a life sentence in Wakefield prison for manslaughter after the blaze at a house fire in Derby last year. A woman who was being interviewed as a witness as part of the original investigation told detectives she had been raped by Philpott in his caravan after he drugged her tea in 2005. Officers took a separate statement from the alleged victim at the time. She told the Daily Mirror: 'It was rape. He makes my flesh crawl.' And now it has emerged a second woman also made a rape allegation against Philpott as she was speaking to officers investigating the fire. The woman told the Daily Mirror, Philpott forced himself on her as they slept in the downstairs bedroom of a relative's home in Derby in March, 1996. The two women will now be formally interviewed about the rape allegations. If detectives believe the claims warrant a new investigation they plan to interview Philpott in Wakefield prison. Philpott started the blaze with the help of wife Mairead and friend Paul Mosley while their six children were sleeping upstairs in May last year. They had hatched an elaborate plot in which Mick would save the children and the fire would be blamed on his estranged partner.

The assurance comes amid a growing rebellion by backbenchers over the tax break, which had been promised by David Cameron. Tim Loughton, a former Children’s Minister, tabled an amendment to the Chancellor’s Finance Bill, demanding that the tax break be written into law now to show voters that the Tories are serious about supporting the family. An alliance of rebel MPs  had also tabled a separate Private Members’ Bill to introduce the  tax break. Many within the party have been troubled by Liberal Democrat opposition and foot-dragging from the Chancellor over the Conservatives’ flagship family policy – but a letter to Tory MPs from Mr Gauke states: ‘The Prime Minister has always been clear that it is important to recognise marriage in the tax system, and this firm commitment remains.’ He points out that ‘the Conservative manifesto at the last general election set out our policy to  introduce a transferable tax allowance of £750 between spouses and civil partners’. He also reminds MPs that ‘our commitment to a transferable tax allowance was restated’ in the Coalition Agreement. ‘The Prime Minister and Chancellor have consistently made clear that we remain committed to recognising marriage in the tax system,’ Mr Gauke wrote. ‘I know that many of you will have heard . the Chancellor set out his commitment to deliver on this during the . course of this Parliament. Making promises: Both Prime Minister David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have pledged that the tax allowance for spouses will be written into law, but it has yet to emerge . Couples benefit: The 'marriage tax break' which also covers civil partners, would see a transferable tax allowance of £750 between spouses . ‘An announcement on details of how we will legislate for this in this Parliament will be made by the Chancellor in due course.’ The development suggests that ministers are growing jittery over fury in Tory ranks that the pledge to recognise marriage in the tax system has taken a back seat, while Mr Cameron has pushed through gay marriage against the wishes of grassroots members. Head rebel: Tory MP Tim Loughton demands the 'marriage tax law' be written before the election . Tory whips have already urged Mr Loughton and his fellow rebels to back down. The former minister dismissed Mr . Gauke’s attempt to mollify backbenchers, saying they are ‘tired of . waiting’ for the policy to become law. ‘The phrase “in due course” is meaningless,’ he added. ‘The letter doesn’t say anything that hasn’t been said before. There are only so many times the Treasury can peddle this line. ‘This was a clear manifesto pledge. There is absolutely no  reason why we shouldn’t get on with it. ‘It is what people expect from this government and there’s absolutely no reason why we have this continual foot-dragging.’ Many Tory MPs blame Mr Osborne for the delay, even though he has repeatedly told Right-wingers in private that he will go ahead with the plans. Peter Bone, who tabled the Private Members’ Bill, pointed the  finger at the Lib Dems, who are allowed to abstain in any vote on a marriage tax break. He said: ‘Obviously the Lib Dems have been blocking it. It’s about time we stopped kow-towing to them and do things that Conservatives want. ‘This is something that goes to the heart of conservatism and we shouldn’t worry about what Cleggy and Co say.’","Transferable tax allowance for spouses to be introduced before 2015 .

Devendra Singh, 33, will serve at least 16 years in prison after he was convicted of murdering his 41-year-old wife Charlotte Smith. He repeatedly ‘smashed and shattered’ her skull after she demanded a divorce, using force described by a pathologist as ‘beyond the scale’. Murder: Charlotte Smith, right, was bludgeoned to death by her husband Devendra Singh, left, in September . After the attack Singh left the body lying on the lounge floor. He then threw evidence – including . the 4lb wooden elephant – over their garden fence into a field before . fleeing the home near Leek, Staffordshire. Stafford Crown Court heard Singh . travelled to London, but put his wife’s SIM card into his phone so he . could pose as her, sending reassuring text messages to her family and . friends. However her family discovered her body three days after she was killed last September. Singh later handed himself in to . police and admitted killing his wife, but denied murder on the basis . that he suffered a ‘loss of control’. Weapon: The killer picked up this ornamental elephant and used it to attack his estranged wife . During the five-day trial pathologist . Olaf Biedrzycki said Miss Smith’s injuries were among the worst he had . seen during his 20-year career. He told the jury: ‘There were an . awful lot of fractures to the front of the skull, and I could feel a lot . of fractures to the face. The degree of force used to inflict the . injuries is of an extreme nature. ‘It is one of the most severe head injury cases I have come across.’ Detective Inspector Glyn Pattinson, . who led the inquiry for Staffordshire Police, said: ‘There is no doubt . that Singh’s attack was brutal and sustained.’ Miss Smith, who worked as a health . and safety manager, met Singh during a family holiday to Goa in 2008. They decided to get married in December 2010 and, after waiting for a . visa, Singh moved from India to the UK. Sigh, who was found guilty of murder today, left his wife's body at their home in Leek (pictured) When he struggled to find work, the Smith family even opened a shop in the town centre for him to run. But prosecutors said by last summer the relationship was failing, and Singh had become prone to heavy drinking and aggression. Miss Smith, who was known as Charlie, . told work colleagues her husband had grabbed her around the neck during . an argument just four months before she died. Speaking after the sentencing, her . parents, Irene Cork and Peter Smith, said: ‘No matter what length of . sentence is served to him nothing will compensate for our loss. ‘Some years from now he will leave prison and be free to continue with his life. For Charlie there is nothing. ‘Losing Charlie will continue to affect us for the rest of our lives.'

President Francois Hollande’s popularity in France is back down to a record low, according to a new opinion poll published today. The Ifop survey in the Journal du Dimanche newspaper reveals that just 26 per cent of the country is 'satisified with his dismal record.' This figure is down three percentage points on Hollande’s popularity in May, and is further confirmation that the Socialist head of state is by far the most unpopular in modern French history. French President Francois Hollande's popularity is down to a record low of 26 per cent approval . It come as a crucial by-election was contested by the conservative UMP party and the Far-Right National Front (FN). Etienne Bousquet-Cassagne, 23, was hoping to clinch a third parliamentary seat for the FN after already knocking out a Socialist. Mr Bousquet-Cassange is trying to appeal to those disillusioned with the economic decline and corruption which has become endemic during Mr Hollande’s presidency. He faces a second round run-off against Jean-Louis Costes, from former President Nicolas Sarkozy’s UMP party in Villeneuve-sur-Lot. Etienne Bousquet-Cassange is trying to appeal to those disillusioned with the economic decline and corruption which has become endemic during Mr Hollande's presidency . The constituency was previously held by Jerome Cahuzac, Mr Hollande’s disgraced budget minister and tax tsar who turned out to have a secret Swiss bank account. Mr Cahuzac’s Socialist successor, Bernard Barral, was knocked out in the first round last Sunday, in which Mr Costes won 28.7 per cent of the vote and Mr Bousquet-Cassagne 26 per cent. The FN was already buoyed by reaching the second round of another by-election in March in the Oise department, north of Paris, in which the UMP candidate won by a wafer-thin margin. But the Socialists have called on their voters to form a ‘Republic front’ against the far-right candidate by voting for his conservative rival. Whatever happens, the by-election will reduce the Socialists’ parliamentary majority to just three – down from eight last year. French Jean-Louis Costes, from former President Nicolas Sarkozy¿s UMP party, faces a second round run-off for the by-election . This steady decline has also been reflected in record low popularity ratings for Mr Hollande as he battles historically high unemployment while seeking to rein in the public deficit.   The Ifop poll showed the proportion of people satisfied with Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault also declined 2 points to 31 percent. The Socialist government has been struggling with rising unemployment, stalled economic growth, muddled Europe policy, and a large public deficit, while Mr Hollande’s same-sex marriage law also prompted huge protests. The poll on the popularity of Mr Hollande, who was elected in May last year, was based on the views of 1,865 people aged 18 or over contacted by telephone between June 14 and June 22.","Francois Hollande’s popularity in France is back down to a record low .

Barclays was accused of treating customers as ‘cash cows’ yesterday over controversial plans to sell their personal data. Some 13.2million current and savings account holders will be affected by the move, buried in the small print of a letter sent to them last week. It insists customers must agree to let Barclays share information about their transactions – the only way to opt out is to close their accounts. Intrusion: Barclays bank has controversial plans to turn its customers into 'cash cows' by selling their data . Barclays’ letter said changes to its terms were being brought in from October to make them ‘clearer’, ‘simpler’, and ‘easier’. But it admitted it will trawl accounts for information which it could then sell to other firms, government departments or MPs. In a further intrusion, Barclays will also use ‘location data derived from any mobile device details you have given us’. Many customers are likely to have thrown the letter in the bin without realising that it says: ‘We can combine information about you with information about other Barclays customers to create reports which we may share with companies outside Barclays.’ Monitoring: Barclays will not allow its customers to be identified to third parties, but it will look through accounts for spending trends and other habits . It adds that it ‘can use information about the transactions on your account to increase our understanding of services and products that you may wish to use’, although customers can opt out of this part of the changes. The banking giant insists the information will not allow any customer to be identified but will look for spending trends and other habits. Barclays will also monitor a customer’s mobile phone to find out which country they are in – without their knowledge. The bank says this will prevent fraud, allowing them to find out whether a cash withdrawal in a foreign country is bogus, and the account holder’s exact location will not be identified. Bad year for Barclays: Chief Executive Bob Diamond had to quit with immediate effect following a market-rigging scandal . Barclays insists its customers could benefit from their plans, as it could, for example, contact them to point out the amount they spend on their energy bill is much higher than other people in their postcode. Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘This is yet more evidence of an arms race between big companies who are intent on selling out their customers’ privacy for their own profit. ‘Barclays is following in the footsteps of a host of companies who no longer see their customers as people to provide a service to but instead a cash cow for personal data, to be monitored and sold on to advertisers with little regard for asking people’s permission.’ Barclays said: ‘We only use information in a numerical, anonymised and aggregated way as is standard practice at many companies. It is not about providing information for sales or marketing use and does not include any personal data. ‘Personal data will never be passed on to anybody else without their explicit consent.’ Rival HSBC insisted yesterday  that it does not use customers’ information in this way. Sources at RBS said it does not sell its data and Lloyds Banking Group also denied the practice. The controversy comes after a humiliating year for Barclays. It was fined £290million for its part in the rigging of interest rates and chief executive Bob Diamond was forced to resign.","Barclays will share customers' transaction information with third parties .

The mountaineers were killed near the base camp for Nanga Parbat mountain. The gunmen are said to have stormed into the hotel where the tourists were staying, according to Sky News. The remote area of northerm Pakistan where the group was gunned down, which is home to the Nanga Parbat mountains (pictured here), has been the site of recent attacks from militants targeting Shi'ite minorities . 'Unknown people entered a hotel where foreign tourists were staying last night and opened fire,' said Ali Sher, a police officer in the Gilgit-Baltistan province, the news outlet reported. No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. The perpetrators have not been identified, but are known to have fled the scene of the crime.

The Apprentice star Karren Brady has revealed the scale of her political ambitions, claiming Britain would not be in such a mess with more people like her in power. The businesswoman and West Ham vie-chairman suggested the country’s never-ending economic woes could have been avoided with more successful business leaders in the government. And she burnished her credentials as a future Conservative high-flier, taking a swipe at Lib Dem Vince Cable who has grumbled about her smash hit TV show. Success: Karren Brady, West Ham United vice-chairman, called for more business people to go into politics . Ms Brady has long been tipped as a future MP – and even Tory leader – since she suggested she wanted to do her duty to the country. In an interview published today she set out her alternative economic plan, with extra support for business and young people to find work. ‘I love politics. I love Britain. I want to get involved,’ she said. But she rejected the idea of being parachuted into a safe Conservative seat, instead preferring to defeat a Lib Dem or Labour MP on the path to power. ‘I would never accept a safe seat. I would always want a difficult seat. Being fast–tracked is not something that appeals to me. ‘I do so want to contribute to making this a better place.’ Television: Ms Brady defended BBC1's The Apprentice, where she acts as an adviser to Lord Sugar (centre) against claims it was unrepresentative of business life . Earlier this month Business Secretary Mr Cable said he feared BBC1’s The Apprentice gives a ‘completely false impression’ of what real on the job training involves. He dismissed Lord Sugar’s hunt for a business partner as ‘TV theatre’ which could deter young people from seeking a career in business. But Ms Brady, who acts as a key observer and adviser Lord Sugar, dismissed the criticism with a thinly-veiled swipe at the Lib Dem Cabinet minister. Swipe: Business Secretary Vince Cable complained that The Apprentice could put young people off business training . ‘People who work recognise that The Apprentice shows the real pressure, the hard slog, the teamwork and how dogged you need to be to get things done,’ she told The Daily Telegraph. ‘Maybe people who are not working…or haven't worked for a while, won't recognise this.’ She suggested that the country’s sluggish growth and grim future prospects were in part because too many career politicians in the Westminster bubble have no experience of the cut and thrust of business. ‘You need people who are right at the cutting edge. I wish a lot more business people did get into politics. We'd be in a much better place now.’ Ms Brady backed David Cameron ahead of the 2010 general election for having ‘more empathy with the country and some of the issues that are facing us’ than Gordon Brown. Since the coalition was formed she claims the government has done a lot to help new businesses, but they struggle to find the support available. ‘If it were me, I'd have one place to go – it would be like GoCompare. You'd type in what your business is, how much money you've got to invest, and what kind of help you need to get started.’ She also complained that the biggest barrier to women progressing in their career is the cost of childcare.","West Ham vice-chairman reveals ambition - but does not want safe seat .

Some 1.7million UK passengers took to the waves last year and spent nearly £2.5billion, a report reveals today. The growing passenger numbers mean Britain is Europe’s biggest cruise market with a 27.7 per cent share, compared to 22.5 per cent in Germany and 14.9 per cent  in Italy. Popular trip: Brits cruise more than any nation in Europe and make up more than a quarter of the market on the continent (file photo) The report released by the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) says: ‘The British cruise industry continued to grow strongly in 2012 creating more employment opportunities and increasing its economic contribution to the UK.’ The cruise industry’s direct expenditure in the UK last year was £2.49 billion - an increase of 3.7 per cent on 2011. Cruising was given a boost earlier this month when the Duchess of Cambridge launched the Royal Princess cruise liner in Southampton on her last solo public appearance before the birth of her first child next month. The fair wind comes despite the bad publicity generated by the partial sinking of the Costa Concordia in 2012 and several outbreaks of norovirus. Boost for business: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge smiles after naming a Princess Cruises ship 'Royal Princess' earlier this month . Royal approval: The Duchess of Cambridge's 'seal of approval' has seen an increase in cruise sales . European passenger numbers totalled 6.1 million and the global figure was 20.9 million passengers. Southampton’s importance to the European cruise market also increased with more than 1.5 million passengers passing through, making it Europe’s largest embarkation and disembarkation port. More than 11,000 jobs across the South-East of England are supported by the port and each cruise ship turnaround is estimated to contribute around £2.5 million to the local economy. Southampton is one of 19 ports in the UK and Ireland that now offer cruise ship departures. High numbers: About 1.7million Britons went on a cruise last year, spending nearly £2.5billion . The number of British jobs supported by the cruise industry continued to grow too with 66,059 people employed – an increase of 2,000 jobs or 3.5 per cent, and now representing 20 per cent of the total number of jobs the industry provides Europe-wide. The industry’s contribution to the economies of Europe was also up - 3.4 per cent to £13.15 billion - with the UK economy one of the top three recipients, after Italy and Germany. The overall contribution of the cruise industry, including indirect expenditure, to the European economy grew 2.9 per cent to £32.19 billion. Andy Harmer, director of CLIA UK & Ireland, said: ‘These figures demonstrate the continued and growing strength of the British cruise market. ‘The cruise industry is a significant growth vehicle for the UK economy.’","Britons cruise more than any other European country spending £2.25bn .

Cpl Robinson, 33, who has served in Afghanistan, was seen last week coming in and out of Downing Street in his 'civvies' after taking photographs of Mr Cameron meeting foreign dignitaries . It means the Prime Minister has effectively got round what appeared to be a self-imposed ban on having a so-called vanity photographer. Downing Street last night defended the decision on the grounds that its use of Cpl Robinson as an in-house photographer has not cost the taxpayer a penny because he is already employed by the MoD. Andrew Parsons, the photographer who lost his job in the November 2010 row, was paid £35,000 a year from the Downing Street payroll. How do I look? The Prime Minister has effectively got round what appeared to be a self-imposed ban on having a so-called vanity photographer . Earlier this month, nearly 4,500 Army personnel were told they were being made redundant, and Labour MP Michael Dugher said last night: ‘At a time when soldiers are being sacked, it is scandalous that David Cameron thinks it is more important to have a vanity photographer.’ Mr Dugher, MP for Barnsley East, South Yorkshire, added: ‘He should spend more time mending the economy and less on his ego.’ However, friends of Mr Cameron dismissed the criticism. ‘Every other major political leader has their own photographer and it is ridiculous to criticise the PM for this,’ said one. ‘It is nothing to do with vanity, but about having  an official photographic record of what the PM  is doing. These photographs are widely used all around the world. Downing Street is run on a shoestring compared  with every other prime minister or  president’s office.’ One official challenged claims  that taking Cpl Robinson away  from the MoD undermined Mr  Cameron’s demand for big defence cuts in the run-up to this week’s spending review by Chancellor George Osborne. The official said: ‘The MoD has dozens of photographers and 400 press officers, so they should do something about that before whingeing about losing one photographer to No 10.’ Cpl Robinson, a combat photographer, has been in the Army for  ten years and was in the thick of  the action on a tour of Afghanistan in 2010, filming soldiers fighting  the Taliban. His footage of David Beckham visiting the British base  at Camp Bastion was shown around the world.","Corporal Tom Robinson has been seconded from the MoD as Mr Cameron’s personal photographer at No 10 .

"'You have no idea, she is just very intimidating,' says one witness giving evidence at Leeds Crown Court today . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 16:20 EST, 24 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:20 EST, 24 June 2013 . 'Vile': Jeanne Wilding, 64, arriving at Leeds Crown Court today to face charges of seven counts of breaching a five-year ASBO she was given in 2008 . A 'vile' pensioner breached her ASBO when she allegedly terrorised staff at two different charity shops, a jury was told today. Jeanne Wilding, 64, breached the order when she entered the premises of Emmaus and St Vincents charity shops in Leeds and caused 'harassment, alarm or distress', Leeds Crown Court heard. Chloe Fairley, prosecuting, told how throughout last year Wilding was going into the shops and shouting at staff, refusing to leave or stay away when asked, and trying to leave without paying for items. In some cases her behaviour was so 'alarming and distressing to staff' that police were called. On one occasion, when she refused to leave, she was led away in handcuffs. Wilding faces seven counts of breaching an ASBO she was given in 2008. One count relates to David Kirk, a member of staff who had been working for Emmaus, a charity providing accommodation and work for the homeless, for about three years. Mr Kirk had moved out from the charity housing and into a flat beside Wilding. The pair went on holiday together, and she allegedly said she would find him work. The jury were told that Wilding 'was constantly making David work for free' and if he refused to do some work she launched into 'a torrent of abuse'. They heard that she 'flew into a rage' when he refused to do some work he was not comfortable with. 'The Crown say the behaviour towards him caused him harassment, alarm and distress,' said Miss Fairley. On another occasion in July 2012, this time at the the St Vincents shop, Wilding allegedly used another person to hand a letter to a staff member - which when opened was seen to be from Wilding and was derogatory. Just weeks after this Wilding again entered the St Vincents store and caused alarm to staff, and she was later arrested by police. 'These are two entirely independent stores and the prosecution say the defendant has deliberately ignored bans in the stores and engaged in behaviour likely to cause harassment, alarm, or distress to staff in the stores,' Miss Fairley told the jury. Giving evidence today the general . manager of Emmaus, Alison Ward, said the homeless people who work there . live above the shop, which sells items such as furniture, clothes and . books and has a coffee shop. 'Harassment': The St Vincents charity shop on Lincoln Green Road in Leeds, where on occasion in July 2012 Wilding allegedly used another person to hand a letter full of derogatory language to a staff member . Ms Ward told the jury that she has known Wilding for about 18 months. On May 4 she had a run-in with her regarding a letter the charity was to write to the bank on behalf of Mr Kirk, as he was leaving their accommodation. Due to a delay the letter wasn’t written right away, something the court heard that David accepted. But when Mr Kirk returned with . Wilding, she put her foot in the door to get into Ms Ward’s office, . allegedly calling her and her colleague bullies. 'She was making a scene': The Emmaus charity furniture shop on St Mary's Street in Leeds, where Wilding was arrested for refusing to leave . Ms Ward said that Wilding 'called me and Katrina bullies, said it was unacceptable of me not to do the letter for Dave, we had ruined his life.' After getting Wilding to leave the office Alison said they spoke to Dave and wrote out the letter for him but still felt intimidated by Wilding’s manner. 'I didn’t take her words to heart, I had known Dave, I’ve known him along time but it wasn’t nice to be called a bully,' Ms Ward said. 'It is very difficult to have a conversation with someone who is continually shouting over the top of you. 'Standing so close to you and acting vile, [that] is the only word I can use.' On May 25, the day after Wilding had been issued with a harassment order by police banning her from entering any of the Emmaus branches, she was back in the building. The court heard that she was refused service from the coffee shop and then tried to leave the premises without paying for something, but Ms Ward stopped her and was shouted at for her troubles. 'You have no idea, she is just very intimidating,' said Ms Ward. The police were called again and found Wilding in the coffee shop having a cup of tea. She raised her voice and told them 'it was an absolute waste of police time' but they put her in handcuffs. 'She told them she was a little old lady and it wasn’t right,' said Ms Ward. 'She was making a scene and being loud.' The court heard that before leaving, Wilding shouted at Alison, telling her it was all her fault and she 'was the subject of a serious complaint'. 'I think it is the first time we’ve had to have somebody arrested from the shop in the six years I’ve been there,' added Ms Ward . The trial continues.

Russian media magnate Alexander Lebedev faces up to five years in prison if convicted of hooliganism motivated by 'political hatred' after clashing with Sergei Polonsky on television . Supermodel Natalia Vodianova has called on a Russian judge to reach a fair verdict in Alexander Lebedev’s controversial trial in Moscow. This comes as Sergei Polonsky, whose evidence could jail billionaire Lebedev for up to five years, has himself admitted that he was unhurt by two punches thrown by the media tycoon, a court heard today. A complaint by Polonsky, 40, about the alleged blows was seized upon by prosecutors in Moscow who charged Lebedev, a former KGB spy, with hooliganism motivated by 'political hatred'. In a statement by Ms Vodianova read to court from the rags-to-riches beauty nicknamed Supernova, she spoke of her friendship with the media tycoon and his 'exceptional human decency and solid attitude to injustice'. The clash happened during a television talk show about the Russian economy when the discussion became heated. However, 53-year-old Lebedev's Moscow trial today heard that ex-paratrooper Polonsky, now a property mogul, openly admitted on another show that he was unhurt by the attack. 'I am professionally trained to a sufficient level,' he said. 'I managed to avoid it, otherwise I would have ended up with a broken jaw.' Another witness - a martial arts experts who has trained Russian special forces troops - today claimed that the punches did not touch Polonsky. The court case is seen as a litmus test of the use of state power to gag Lebedev, owner of a major Moscow investigative newspaper. Alexander Lebedev apparently lashing out at Polonsky during a Russian TV debate - but a martial arts expert told court today that the punches did not hit Polonsky . His family also owns The Independent titles and the London Evening Standard in Britain. A judge overruled state prosecutors and Polonsky's lawyers to show a video with Polonsky's apparent confession in court. In the footage, Polonsky also said that Lebedev struck out twice. Natalia Vodianova pleaded with the judge to give Lebedev a fair judgement due to his good character . If . that claim is accepted by the court, it would be significant because . the politically-motivated hooliganism charge depends on at least three . strikes being landed. Supermodel Natalia Vodianova, 31, . told of Lebedev’s unpublicised commitment to her charity Naked Hearts . Foundation which aims to provide playgrounds for deprived children . across Russia. ‘Alexander Lebedev is my long term friend, and also a friend and donor of the Foundation Naked Hearts,’ she said. ‘Knowing . Lebedev for a long time, I have had numerous chances to make sure of . his fidelity to his principles, exceptional human decency and solid . attitude to injustice. ‘This man can support you with wise advice or with action. ‘Naked . Hearts Foundation is very lucky to have Alexander Lebedev among its . donors. He has not only seen the true value of our charity, but kept . supporting us for seven years.’ She . appealed to the judge:  ‘I am asking to do all what you can to make . sure the investigation is appropriate and impersonal and is carried out . according to the law of Russia.’ Martial . arts expert Igor Zaichokov told the court that the only physical . contact between Lebedev and Polonsky was when the media magnate pushed . away the property mogul's hand in a defensive gesture before the . so-called 'punch-up'. The expert denied Lebedev's two strikes had actually touched Polonsky. He also contradicted earlier evidence and said there was nothing 'professional' about the way the ex-spy had struck out in Polonsky's direction. The court was shown a video of Polonsky apparently admitting he was unhurt by the alleged blows . 'If Lebedev's punches reached Polonsky's head, his head would have pulled away in unnatural way,' he said. 'This . is how boxing judges make their decisions about punches. They do not . need to witness the moment of the punch, they just follow the way the . body part pulls away. 'For me it is clear that Lebedev's punches did not reach Polonsky.' He . told the judge: 'I made this conclusion based on my experience in . martial arts and on a number of books devoted mainly to psychological . aspects of body conflict.' Other . witnesses have said that Polonsky instinctively moved backwards as . Lebedev approached him, causing his chair to fall backwards off the . stage. Zaichokov, a qualified coach and author of two books on martial arts, has trained special forces troops from Russia's Interior Ministry. Polonsky has not given evidence in person at the trial. He is on Russia's wanted list over a £121million alleged property fraud in Moscow. Film footage suggests he is hiding in a bolt hole in Tel Aviv, Israel, even though the judge in Lebedev's case accepts he is in Cambodia, where he is on bail pending a kidnapping and assault probe. A verdict in the Lebedev trial - which critics say has political motives - is expected next month.

Victim: Sandra Edwards has been left blind in one eye after being knocked from her moped by a teenager . A teenager who left a grandmother fighting for life in a coma after he smashed into her moped with his car has walked free from court with a fine of just £280. Ryan Matticks, 19, was yesterday given five penalty points on his licence after admitting careless driving at South-East Suffok magistrates' court. His victim, widow Sandra Edwards, described his sentence as 'ridiculous' as she spoke out about her horrific injuries which confined her to hospital for three months. The 57-year-old has been left blind . in one eye and confined to a wheelchair after the crash, in which nearly . all her teeth were knocked out and her hand was broken. She now fears she could lose her job as a carer, as she is unable to drive to her patient's homes. Matticks, . an apprentice engineer and father of one, knocked Mrs Edwards off her . Piaggio moped in Ipswich on the evening of April 9 as he made a right . turn while pulling in to his girlfriend's driveway in his Vauxhall . Corsa. Harriet . Johnson, defending, said that the teenager had suffered a 'momentary . lapse of concentration', making a mistake which 'any driver is capable . of'. She added that Matticks had been 'devastated' by the crash, and had had difficulty sleeping ever since. But . Mrs Edwards said that the accident had destroyed her life, as doctors . at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge twice told her that she was . unlikely to survive. She returned home to Ipswich yesterday after three months in hospital, with her treatment including a 10-hour operation. Fury: The widowed grandmother described the driver's sentence of a fine and penalty points as 'ridiculous' 'I think it's a ridiculous . sentence,' the victim said. 'It has ruined my life. I love my job but I . can't work because I won't be able to drive for at least another year - . and probably never again. 'I can't see out of my left eye - I can't open my eyelid. The hospital said it is unlikely it will fully recover. 'I . lost all my teeth except one. I broke my hand, my kneecap was smashed . in, I can't even bend my fingers. I've lost two stone and need to eat . liquidised foods.' She . added: 'Everything has changed now. He needs to learn from this - he . needs to learn to be more responsible for his own actions.' Mrs . Edwards was put into an induced coma for three weeks after first . arriving at Addenbrooke's as doctors battled to save her life. Happier times: Mrs Edwards, left, at the wedding of her daughter Nicola to Andy Tuck in 2005 . 'I woke up three weeks later in a hospital bed and had no idea where I was,' she said. 'I couldn't remember anything about what happened. 'I didn't know who I was - I even thought my late husband David was still alive. I was told to say goodbye to my family twice.' She will now receive daily visits from a carer from Suffolk County Council as she seeks to recover from her injuries. Her daughter Nicola Tuck, who lives with her, said: 'It has devastated our lives. We will not have the freedom we used to. 'Young drivers must check and check again on the roads.'","Ryan Matticks crashed into Sandra Edwards' moped in Ipswich in April .

A fast food worker who has been on the run from police for nearly a year after he was accused of spying on female colleagues has been warned detectives are on his tail after he posted clips of himself singing pop songs on YouTube. Dominik Selchert, 27, was due to stand trial accused of voyeurism after an iPhone was found hidden in female staff toilets at the Bromley branch of KFC where he was assistant manager. He failed to appear at Croydon Crown Court last July and has not been seen since - until these clips of him singing hits by One Direction and Michael Jackson appeared on the net. Scroll down for video . Dominik Selchert, 27, is accused of spying on female colleagues but did not turn up for his trial last July . A mobile phone was found in the female staff toilets of this KFC branch in Bromley where Selchert worked . Today a police source said they were aware of the new videos and were 'on the case'. The videos, which were uploaded to YouTube on May 30 this year, apparently by Selchert himself, show him singing into the camera. In one, filmed in what appears to be an attic room, Selchert, formerly of Lewisham, south London, sings the One Direction hit What Makes You Beautiful. Dressed in baggy grey tracksuit bottoms and a white t-shirt, and wearing a silver chain around his neck, Selchert gives the camera a thumbs up before closing his eyes and singing the boyband's hit. In the second clip, he sings 58 seconds of Michael Jackson's Man In The Mirror and accompanies himself on the guitar. Selchert has also tweeted about wanting to appear on X Factor, although his Twitter account has been inactive since last November. On the run: Would-be singer Selchert closed his eyes and gestured with his hands in his YouTube video clip . Young pin-ups: Selchert filmed himself crooning the One Direction hit What Makes You Beautiful for YouTube . His last court appearance was on March 5 last year, when he pleaded not guilty to voyeurism, but he failed to appear at court for his trial on July 9 last year. The court case came after allegations that female staff had been filmed getting dressed for work in the fried chicken restaurant in High Street, Bromley, in August 2011. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We are still seeking to trace Mr Selchert as he failed to appear at court last year to answer the charge against him. 'He has certainly helped us by posting these videos of himself singing online, so it should not be long before he is back before the courts. Selchert appeared in court last March to plead not guilty but did not attend for his trial in July last year . 'We have passed the details of these videos to officers looking for Mr Selchert.' He said it was possible to trace where the videos were uploaded and that officers were working on apprehending the suspect.

Senior doctors say it is ‘utter folly’ for patients to be able to get routine appointments and surgery on the NHS seven days a week. They say running the health service ‘like Tesco’ – which has many stores open 24 hours a day – is unaffordable. The expense would be further ‘magnified’, one doctor said, because staff working on Sundays would expect a ‘premium rate of pay’. Senior doctors say that it is unaffordable to open surgeries seven days a week, like a Tesco . The Government wants to improve staffing levels and the availability of NHS services at weekends following concerns that patients are dying because current standards are poor. Last month a study revealed that patients undergoing routine surgery at the weekend were 82 per cent more likely to die compared with on a Monday – partly because fewer consultants were on duty. The British Medical Association, which represents senior doctors, said the NHS cannot afford to provide the same tests and treatments at weekends as it does during the week. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, a member of the BMA’s GP committee, said: ‘It’s utter folly to compare the NHS therefore with a seven days a week supermarket. ‘Tesco opens for seven days for commercial reasons alone.’ Dr Chaand Nagpaulsaid that Tesco opens seven days a week for commercial reasons, and it is unrealistic to compare the supermarket with a GP . Addressing the association’s annual conference yesterday, he said: ‘Nurses and physios in hospital and community, health visitors, social workers, pharmacists will all need to be funded and open seven days a week or it would be a nonsense to claim a routine NHS service if it is only partial and piecemeal. ‘And of course staff working on Sundays will expect a premium rate of pay magnifying the expense.’ Joyce Robins, co-director of Patient Concern, said doctors simply did not want to work out-of-hours and were putting their ‘own interests before the patients’. She said: ‘When you are ill it doesn’t matter what time it is, you need the appropriate care.’ GPs can opt out of working evenings and weekends under a contract negotiated under Labour which also led to their salaries doubling. Last month a study revealed that patients undergoing routine surgery at the weekend were 82 per cent more likely to die compared with on a Monday . A similar contract for hospital consultants in 2003 allowed them to work fewer evenings and weekends. The chairman of the BMA, Dr Mark Porter, said ‘we all want’ weekend care to be at the same standard as that provided during the week. But he added: ‘The calls we sometimes hear for a Tesco NHS, full service, 24/7, are just ridiculous when the health service can barely afford its current model.’ Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients’ Association said the ‘NHS should be an organisation that puts the patient at the centre of everything that it does’. She said: ‘It is time for all professionals to accept that the NHS must be a 24 hours a day, seven day a week service.’","Senior doctors say it is ‘utter folly’ to expect appointments seven days .

Two young children were fighting for their lives today after two of their friends died alongside them in an urban pond on the outskirts of Paris. The horrific drama unfolded on Saturday when a total of five boys and girls aged between three and eight entered the water in Saint-Ouen-l’Aumone, in the Val d’Oise department, north of the French capital. All of the victims, the sons and daughters of single mothers, were found floating in the unsupervised pond near a local council-run hotel close to hotel where they all lived. The pond at Saint-Ouen-l'Aumone, where the five children fell in yesterday . The pond is in an industrial area of Saint-Ouen-l'Aumone, on the outskirts of Paris . Policemen arrived to examine the pond where it is believed one child initially fell in, then the others tried unsuccessfully to rescue him . Police believe they all entered the water while playing alone, with their mothers unaware of where they were. The hotel where all the children were living hosts poor families who are considered particularly vulnerable. The two youngsters who died were believed to be aged three and five, while the two still in intensive care are both eight. According to preliminary reports compiled by detectives, one child fell into the pond, while the others tried to rescue him. Emergency services arrived on the outskirts of Paris where the children were found unconscious in the water . Police were called to the scene by a hotel employee who was alerted to the tragedy by another child . 'In the later afternoon we received . information that five children were struggling to survive in a pond in a . business park and close to a hotel,’ said a local police spokesman. 'It appears that one had fallen in, and the others were trying to get him out. But they all got into difficulty, especially as there was no adult supervising them.' However, Eric Maurel, the Pontoise prosecutor who is leading the investigation, said: ‘The enquiry has just begun – not all of the facts are available to us.’ Manuel Valls, France’s Interior Minister, expressed its ‘sympathy and sadness over this tragedy’ in a statement to AFP, France national news agency. Resident Mickael Flour, who lives with his family in a caravan close to the pond, said children often played by the water . The children who were playing unattended reportedly lived in a hotel which housed vulnerable families . He said he 'fully supports the young . victims and their families’ and wanted to 'pay tribute to all' those . involved in the rescue of 'these children in distress'. Mickael Flour, a father-of-four who lives in a trailer near the scene of the tragedy, said : 'You often see kids throwing sticks and stones into the water.' Sylviana Ternus, who also lives in a caravan nearby, said 'the children were often alone, without an adult with them.'","Five children were playing unattended by a pond on the outskirts of Paris .

I understand that the Western Force split into two teams before Monday's training session. A 1st team to play the Waratahs on Saturday, and a 2nd team to play the Lions today. That is totally pathetic. Read more here in our live text commentary of the game . The last time the Lions won a Test series, 16 years ago, a prolific Welsh kicker was the heart of their success. At Patersons Stadium, Neil Jenkins watched at close quarters as his protege proved he is ready to  emulate that feat. What Leigh Halfpenny achieved in the course of this routine rout of modest opposition was simply  staggering. By dispatching all 11 shots at goal — most of them from absurdly acute angles — he reduced the art he practises so diligently into a mere formality. That is also what he did to the question of who will start at full back in the Test series. Scroll down for video . On form: Leigh Halfpenny's stellar performance drew comparisons to Neil Jenkins . For all the free-spirit running of . Stuart Hogg and Rob Kearney, who is recovering from a hamstring injury, . Halfpenny has apparently elevated himself to a parallel  universe of . sporting perfection. The 24-year-old worked his magic in . the shadow of his mentor, the former master of the art. Jenkins was at . the heart of the 1997 Lions’ triumph in South Africa and he has passed . on all his accumulated  wisdom to another Welshman with a deadly right . foot. As kicking coach here, he will come on . to the field with a tee, offer some water and a few choice words, then . stand behind the kicker, as a reassuring presence. He is one of the men who provided the . inspiration for Halfpenny, when he would spend countless hours, day . after day, year after year,  practising in Gorseinon with his . grandfather. Now the young Cardiff Blues phenomenon is living up to . those he once looked up to. ‘You watch the likes of Neil Jenkins, Jonny Wilkinson and Dan Carter, and you want to be like them,’ said the Lions No 15. He is certainly fulfilling that . target. But there is more to it — a specific desire within him to seize . this chance after 2009, when he joined the tour late, played one game . against the Cheetahs, and had to return home injured. Power runner: Ireland No 8 Jamie Heaslip in bulldozing form for the Lions . Leading by example: O'Driscoll was a key link man . Kicking masterclass: Full back Leigh Halfpenny . ‘Ever since I was on the plane back . from South Africa, I have been dreaming of this moment, of pulling on a . Lions jersey again,’ said Halfpenny, in the aftermath of his . masterclass. ... but the Lions scored more points than the Australian cricket team, who were skittled for just 65 by India in a Champions Trophy warm-up. Click here for the match report . ‘I got the opportunity tonight and it was a pretty special . feeling. I think that’s up there with the best I’ve kicked, there’s no . doubt about that. I’ve had some games where I’ve managed a few but . nowhere near as many as that. ‘To kick all 11 was incredible from a personal point of view. ‘I suppose some days you just find . that sweet spot early on. I felt it could be one of those days, but I . came off the pitch not knowing how many I’d kicked because I try and . stay focused. I’m so pleased with how it went. ‘The pressure is a real privilege. To . be kicking for Wales was a dream of mine, never mind kicking for the . Lions. I never thought I would be doing it, and I’m enjoying every . second of it. I always enjoyed goal-kicking as a kid and I’ve tried to . work hard at it. Trapped: Connor Murray has nowhere to go after he is grappled by rival scrum-half Brett Sheehan .

I always try to hit the middle of the goal and . there’s a lot of work that goes in with Neil Jenkins and the other . kickers. ‘I do what works for me and I was pleased with how it went.’ While Halfpenny described himself as a . proud man, the same could be said of Jenkins, who told his compatriot . on  Monday that he would be the kicker, ahead of Ireland fly-half Johnny . Sexton. The man who delivered 24 of the points . in this thrashing of the feeble Force was glad to have his mentor on . hand, adding: ‘I certainly notice he’s there. I can’t think of a better . guy to have bringing on the tee for me and to have alongside me in games . and in training. I’m lucky to have Jenks around.’ Bowe selector: Ireland wing Tommy tries to play his way into the Test team with some pacy runs . Down and out: Healy is treated for a leg injury during the tour match . Job done: Lions coach Warren Gatland . While the goal-kicking was supreme, . the fact that there were so many conversions to line up stemmed from the . Lions’ ability to tear through the opposition defence at will, . particularly after half-time. Jamie Heaslip delivered a  rampaging . display of ball-carrying class to show he has raised his game again at . just the right time after a mid-season slump. And he was matched in the gain-line busting and off-loading stakes by his Leinster and Ireland team-mate, flanker Sean O’Brien. Both men did enough to challenge the prevailing view that the Test back row will be all-Welsh. Celebration: Manu Tuilagi and Brian O'Driscoll celebrate after the convincing win . Behind a less-than-dominant scrum, . Sexton showed the variety of his playmaking repertoire with delayed . inside passes and cross-kicks proving especially effective. The giant frames of George North and . Manu Tuilagi understandably caught the eye of home coach Michael Foley, . with the latter playing a key part in a superbly drilled routine . instigated by Sexton and finished by Brian O’Driscoll, for the . captain’s second try. Sexton himself scored the first, while . Tom Croft, Heaslip, Mako Vunipola, Tommy Bowe, Owen  Farrell and Geoff . Parling all touched down as the Lions cut loose. So many of these Lions and  others made strong, initial Test cases, but the strongest of all came from Halfpenny. ‘Hopefully, if I’m selected, I can step up to the plate like that against Australia,’ he said. Barring injury, he will be selected and on this evidence, the Wallabies should be very afraid. On the charge: George North (top) takes on Corey Brown .

Revoked: Maddy Paige was doing great as first string defensive end for her Georgia middle school's football team but was recently told she would not be allowed to play next season . ‘I was told that the reasons behind it were one, that the boys were going to start lusting after her and have impure thoughts about her and that the locker room talk was not appropriate for a female to hear even though she had a separate locker room from the boys,’ Blythe told 11Alive. But things didn’t always seem so unfair. When Maddy first started on the team, she said she felt completely accepted. ‘I was put at defensive tackle, first string, the coaches were really proud. My teammates, a pat on the back every time,’ she said. Unfair: Maddy, top left, made four sacks last season and all it got her was sacked from the team and her school claims it's because the boys will lust after her and have impure thoughts . And she deserved those pats on the back. The young girl was first string for a reason. ‘The first sack I made,’ Maddy said, ‘all the parents in the stands thought it was one of their boys...but they looked at the roster and saw it was me and I got amazing whoops and hollers.’ Then, as quickly as it had been given to her, the gift of getting to play with the boys like she’d always wanted was taken away. Crushed: 'It's like taking my dream and throwing it in the trash,' Maddy said . ‘It's like taking my dream and throwing it in the trash,’ she said. Blythe agrees. ‘They let her have that cake,’ Blythe said, ‘and then they took it from her and they smashed it.’ Throwback: Maddy's mother Cassy Blythe calls the decision anachronistic and has appealed . 11Alive contacted the school’s athletic director Phil Roberts, who responded in an email: ‘Our official policy is that middle school girls play girl sports and middle school boys play boy sports.’ Blythe believes that sort of policy sends the wrong message and is appealing the decision. ‘What we want her to learn is that her hard work and dedication pays off,’ said Blythe. ‘And in this case, her hard work and dedication got her kicked off a football team.’","Maddy Paige got four sacks last season as her middle school's first-string defensive end, then Strong Rock Christian School in Locust Grove, Georgia sacked her back ."

Whistleblower: Former SDS officer Peter Francis has lifted the lid on the murky practices of the unit which targeted political groups . The Met police used undercover officers to spy on political groups who campaigned against police mistreatment and corruption, it has been alleged. It is believed at least three officers were sent by Scotland Yard to infiltrate London-based activist groups in the latest allegations to be made against the secretive Special Demonstrations Squad (SDS). One was Mark Jenner who used the alias 'Mark Cassidy' to join the Colin Roach Centre - a group set up in the 1990s in memory of a 21--year-old black British man who died in police custody in Hackney, the Guardian reports. A second spy targeted the Newham Monitory Project - another north east London group which campaigned for victims of police brutality and racist attacks. Jenner, who was married with children, is said to have had a a four-year relationship with one of the women he was investigating. The latest revelations come in the wake of allegations, revealed yesterday in a TV documentary, that undercover officers from the SDS unit were told to try and get 'dirt' on the family of Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager murdered in a racist attack in 1993. Trust in police is at a worrying low after the smear claims into Stephen Lawrence's family. Pictured (l-r), Neville, Doreen and Stuart Lawrence .

Scotland Yard officers withheld details of his role from the Macpherson . Inquiry into the bungled police investigation into 18-year-old Stephen’s . killing. The allegations have provoked widespread condemnation from politicians and anger from the Lawrence family. Stephen's father Neville last night demanded a judge-led inquiry into an apparent police smear campaign against his family. Mr Lawrence, 71, said it was an ‘unthinkable betrayal’ that Scotland Yard . would mount a dirty tricks operation following his son’s racist murder. But he said he had always suspected his family was ‘under greater investigation’ than the gang that killed Stephen in 1993. Theresa . May said yesterday the extraordinary allegations should be examined by . two existing inquiries into police wrongdoing. Mr Lawrence said the Home . Secretary’s plan was ‘completely unsatisfactory’. Peter Francis lived a double life as he spent years infiltrating radical anti-racists groups . Home Secretary Theresa May said a probe into the units may not be completed until 2016 .

The latest timepiece from watchmaker Tokyoflash Japan comes with a built-in breathalyser and 'sobriety game' to test how drunk you are. When the wearer blows into a sensor hidden in a side panel of the Kisai Intoxicated watch the screen changes colour depending on the level of alcohol detected - green means you're sober, yellow means you're 'buzzing' or tipsy and red means you're drunk. The sobriety game also tests your reaction times to a onscreen challenge to see if you're over the limit. Scroll down for video . Japanese firm Tokyoflash Japan has designed a digital watch with a built-in breathalyser. The Kisai Intoxicated, pictured, can measure blood alcohol content using a sensor built into the right-hand panel. It also comes with a sobriety game designed to test the wearer's reaction times . The alcohol sensor on the Kisai Intoxicated is built-into the stainless steel frame. A wearer will need to unscrew the cap, pictured, to reveal the sensor and blow into it for five seconds to test their breath . To test your blood alcohol content (BAC), open the sensor cap on the right-hand side of the watch. Press . the alcohol button to start the test and blow into it for five seconds. The display on the right of the screen shows 10 different levels of . blood alcohol content. A green display showing 0.00‰ means you're sober. A yellow display showing between 0.41 and 0.60‰ means you're buzzing. And a . red display showing 0.61‰ or above means you're drunk. Readings are based on the blood alcohol content (BAC) detected in the wearer's breath. To use the sensor, press the alcohol button on the right-hand side of the watch. An on-screen prompt will tell you when the sensor is ready. Blow into the sensor below the alcohol button for five seconds and your reading will appear on the digital screen. When the wearer blows into the alcohol sensor the amount of blood alcohol content (BAC) is measured on a chart, right. The display will then change colour depending on the levels, left. Green is sober, a yellow reading between 0.41 and 0.61‰ is tipsy and red, showing a level higher than 0.61‰, means the wearer is drunk . A green display showing 0.00‰ means the wearer is sober. A yellow display showing between 0.41 and 0.60‰ means they're 'buzzing'. And a . red display showing 0.61‰ or above means they're drunk. The Japanese company is quick to claim the watch is just for fun and is more of a 'party trick' than a scientific test. To play the sobriety game the wearer must press button B, pictured, to start the test and then press B again to stop the moving onscreen bar as close to the centre as possible. This tests the wearer's reaction times . The built-in sobriety game has a vertical bar that moves from left to right on the display. To pass the test, the wearer must stop the bar when it is in the centre of the screen. The watch is made of stainless steel and weighs around 160g. It is water resistant and comes with a rechargeable battery. In March, a company from San Francisco released the Breathometer - a breathalyser that plugs into a mobile phone to give owners an instant BAC reading. The gadget pugs into the headset jack of an iPhone or Android handset and its makers say it allows owners to check their alcohol level wherever they and - and claim it could even be used to choose who should drive. In April, the BACtrack mobile breathalyser app was released that can automatically post BAC levels to Facebook or Twitter. Critics claimed the mobile breathalyser could encourage drinking games but the firm behind it claims it will help users 'understand how alcohol affects their body'. Users can even create a drink diary of their evening, with pictures of every drink and how it affected their blood alcohol level and users readings are shown on a 'world drinking map'.","The Kisai Intoxicated watch has a built-in breathalyser .

Williams said in the interview,  'Do you think it was fair, what they got? They did something stupid, but I don't know. I'm not blaming the girl, but if you're a 16-year-old and you're drunk . like that, your parents should teach you - don't take drinks from other . people.'

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has ordered that flags in the Garden State be lowered to half-mast on Monday to honor 'Jersey guy' James Gandolfini, the star of the acclaimed HBO drama the Sopranos, and who was found dead in a Rome hotel Wednesday of a heart attack. 'All the people in the state really felt a connection to him, not just his character, but to him,' Christie said Thursday at a ribbon-cutting ceremony in Madison, New Jersey. 'He died much, much too young.' In addition to the comments at the ceremony, Christie's office issued a statement of condolence for the New Jersey native, whom he described as 'Jersey, through and through.' Heart attack: the official cause of James Gandolfini's untimely death has been ruled a heart attack . 'James Gandolfini enjoyed an extraordinarily successful acting career . across television, film and Broadway, including his popularly acclaimed . role as Tony Soprano in ""The Sopranos"" and advocated for United States . service members and veterans in his two documentaries, ""Alive Day . Memories: Home From Iraq"" and ""Wartorn: 1861-2010,'"" the statement says. It also was revealed today that it was, in fact, a heart attack that killed the Sopranos star. Michael Kobold told journalists an autopsy on Friday morning showed Gandolfini had died of natural causes, confirming an earlier report from medical officials. The autopsy had shown 'nothing out of the ordinary ... there was no foul play, there was no substance abuse,' Kobold said. Kobold, who was designated by the family to talk to the media, said Gandolfini, had had a good time with his 13-year-old son Michael and there was no hint anything was wrong.'He had a wonderful day. He visited the Vatican and had dinner at the hotel with his son, awaiting the arrival of his (Gandolfini's) sister,' Kobold said. 'Jersey guy': Governor Chris Christie ordered flags lowered to half-mast on Monday in honor of James Gandolfini . 'He was on vacation with his son, he has an eight-month-old daughter. Everything was going really great. I just spoke to him on Father's Day. He was fine, he was happy. He was a good guy,' Kobold said. The star was found dead in his Rome hotel late on Wednesday. His sister, Leta Gandfolfini, visited his body at the hospital morgue on Friday morning after the autopsy. Asked if Gandolfini had previous heart problems, Kobold said: 'No. He was happy. He was healthy. He was doing really fine.' Gandolfini, whose performance as New Jersey mob boss Tony Soprano made him a household name and helped usher in a new era of American television drama, had been scheduled to attend the closing of the Taormina Film Festival in Sicily on Saturday. 'Too young': Christie says that, at 51, Gandolfini was too young to die . Gandolfini's manager, Mark Armstrong, said in an email the actor's son, Michael, found him collapsed in the bathroom of his Rome hotel room but Kobold refused to comment on that. Claudio Modini, the emergency room chief, told Reuters on Thursday doctors had tried to resuscitate Gandolfini for 40 minutes when he arrived at the hospital. Kobold said Gandolfini's body would be embalmed, which is not a common practice in Italy, ahead of its return to the United States, probably next week. The family hoped to have the funeral in New York City late next week. It normally took up to 10 days to return a body but the family was working with Italian authorities to speed up the procedure, he added. 'We are all devastated by this loss. James was a devoted husband, a loving father of two children and a brother and cousin you could always count on,' he said. Family man: Gandolfini leaves behind his wife, Deborah Lin (left), son Michael, and daughter, Liliana . Since 'The Sopranos' ended its six-season run in June 2007, Gandolfini appeared in a number of big-screen roles, including the crime drama 'Killing Them Softly' and 'Zero Dark Thirty,' a film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Gandolfini had been working on an upcoming HBO series, 'Criminal Justice,' and had two films due out next year. Apart from Michael, his son with his first wife, who he divorced in 2002, Gandolfini is survived by wife, Deborah Lin and baby daughter Liliana, born last year. In the HBO series, the burly, physically imposing Gandolfini created a gangster different from any previously seen in American television or film. Tony Soprano was capable of killing enemies with his own hands but was prone to panic attacks. He regularly saw a therapist to work out his anxiety problems. The 'boss': Gandolfini's death ends the hopes of many Sopranos fans that a movie based on the show might be in the works .","Gandolfini's cause of death officially ruled a heart attack .

But despite her demeanor today, on the BBC documentary broadcast last night called Andy Murray: The Man Behind the Racquet, when asked by Sue Barker if she looked forward to Wimbledon she replied with a laugh: 'No, I used to!' The 25-year-old is usually seen to be on tenterhooks as Murray goes from round to round as the pressure for him to win on home turf is immense. Last year he came painstakingly close to becoming the first Brit to win the title in decades as he made the final and won the first set, only to then be defeated by Roger Federer. He famously choked back tears as he gave a gallant loser speech while Kim was also seen looking tearful in the royal box. Colourful: Kim teamed a blue blazer with a cream and orange blouse .

The authoritarian style of parenting championed by Chinese-American author Amy Chua in her 2011 book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother, may do more harm than good, according to a new study. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, studied more than 250 Chinese-American immigrant families in the San Francisco area, conducting interviews, parent-child interaction activities and academic assessments of the children over two years. The team, led by assistant professor of psychology, Qing Zhou, found that Tiger Parents rear children with 'more . aggression, depression, anxiety and social problems.' Tough love: According to a new study, Tiger Moms - who follow a strict, authoritarian style of parenting - cause their children to be more depressed, anxious and aggressive than their peers . Their research, which looked at how often parents verbally criticized their children or made them do things without explanation, also found that these children had 'poorer social skills' than their peers. Now, according to CBS News, the team conducts workshops to help divorced Chinese-American mothers learn to use 'positive parenting strategies', like one-on-one 'fun time' with their children. Ms Zhou says many mothers are initially unfamiliar with this 'Western' way of parenting, but that they soon find that it leads to 'positive changes in their relationships'. San Francisco-based Chinese-American . writer Kim Wong Keltner says she will raise her children in a more . lenient way, since her own Tiger Mom upbringing was like an 'emotional . jail'. Tiger Mother: Amy Chua's 2011 book championed the high-pressure style of parenting that pushes children to succeed . In her book, Tiger Babies Strike Back, which serves as a rebuttal to Tiger Moms, she explains that Asian-American children are overly-pressured to succeed. Consequently, they are too scared to explore their creative sides or do anything rebellious, which means they often lack certain social skills as they get older. 'You have no outlet to be weird,' she explained. 'By the time you get to college, you don't even know how to be around people. 'You're super smart in your head but you can't navigate a simple social situation.' While Amy Chua's book intimated that all Asian-American children are unemotional math experts and proteges, Mrs Keltner hopes to refute that. 'Asian-Americans are a lot more well-rounded than the stereotypes that are out there,' she said, adding: 'We are emotional.' Mrs Keltner admits that Tiger Parenting does have its advantages, though, like teaching children that there is nothing they cannot achieve. But problems arise when children feel they are never good enough. 'You're going to create a barrier with you and your parent, and you detach,' she explained.","Amy Chua's 2011 book Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother championed a tough, demanding parenting style seen among some Asian-American families ."

Between 0.3 per cent and 38 per cent of the population is addicted to the internet - these addicts experience symptoms such as a declining social life and difficulty coping when they cannot log-on . They say that the addiction is characterised by excessive use, and symptoms include changes in mood, preoccupation, inability to control the amount of time you spend on the internet, and diminishing social life. Changes in mood . Preoccupation with the internet and digital media . Inability to control the amount of time spent using digital technology . The need for more time or a new game to achieve a desired mood . Withdrawal when not engaged with digital technology . Diminishing social life . Adverse work and academic consequences . They add that internet addiction can be difficult to detect, with the problem much more widely diagnosed in Europe and Asia than it is in the U.S. The researchers claim that treatment of internet addiction is also much more advanced in Europe and Asia and that treatment tends to aim to teach people how to use the Internet in moderation, not how to abstain altogether. The American Academy of Paediatrics has also recently published guidelines regarding children using the internet. It says excessive social media use can lead to attention problems, school difficulties, sleep and eating disorders, and obesity. It also encourages parents to help their children learn to use the internet in moderation by having rules including not allowing a computer in the bedroom, and only allowing a certain amount of ‘screen time’. The news comes after experts warned that parents who allow their children access to tablet computers risk encouraging the development of addictions. There were reports recently that a four-year-old girl from South East England is currently being treated for iPad addiction after her parents noticed that she became 'distressed and inconsolable' when the iPad was taken away from her. Dr Richard Graham, who runs a technology addiction programme, told the paper that he thinks there are many addicts of her age. A four-year-old girl from South East England is currently being treated for iPad addiction after her parents noticed that she became 'distressed and inconsolable' when the iPad was taken away from her . He told The Telegraph: 'The child's mother called me and described her symptoms. She told me she had developed an obsession with the device and would ask for it constantly. 'She was using it three to four hours every day and showed increased agitation if it was removed.' The UK's first rehabilitation centre for people with technology addictions opened in London in 2010, run by Dr Graham. It is a private hospital which offers treatment to people with Internet and social networking addictions.","Up to 38 per cent of people are addicted to the internet, say the researchers .

An idiot-proof type wrapping paper has been designed to help men who struggle to present neatly-covered gifts. The 'Man Wrap' does not require scissors or Sellotape, and nor does it involve the user having to make fiddly folds in the ends. Users simply roll it out, place the gift in the middle of it, tear off a strip and twist it around the present to secure it in place. Martin Grix has created 'Man Wrap' to help men who struggle to wrap presents neatly. It does not require scissors, Sellotape or any fiddly folding . It was created by designer Martin Grix, who noticed the sheer number of men who found the wrapping process so difficult that some even resorted to using bin liners. He came up with the 'Man Wrap' as a solution. The tube of decorative paper provides 16ft of gift-wrap with a width of 8ins to coat small presents such as boxes and bottles. Mr Grix, 39, from Clapham, south London, said: ‘Generally, there have always been men moaning about wrapping up presents and women who are more particular about it. ‘My brother actually wrapped my stuff up one year in bin bags and I have heard of other men using kitchen tin foil. ‘I wanted to make something you could quickly wrap and look nice, so I started trying to find a way to make it easier. I initially looked at cling film but it wouldn't work. ‘We settled on using a tin foil style and selected a certain thickness and type before deciding on the blue and silver stars theme.

Progress: The research marks a step towards producing more effective treatment for migraine sufferers. Around 40 per cent of patients do not respond to available medication . Hopes of a migraine cure have been boosted by the discovery of genes linked to the crippling headaches. In the largest study ever to look at . migraines, researchers have identified five more sections of our DNA . associated with their onset. They have also confirmed the importance of seven more of these ‘genetic regions’ which have previously been linked to migraines.

Scientists say the research, which . looked at more than 100,000 genetic samples, offers a fresh . understanding of what triggers migraines. The team uncovered the genetic regions . linked to the illness by comparing the results from 29 health studies, . which involved DNA samples from both migraine patients and healthy . individuals. Some of the regions identified were found to be close to a . network of genes that are sensitive to an imbalance of oxygen.

Mickey Arthur has been sacked as coach of Australia just 16 days before the start of the Ashes, with Darren Lehmann appointed as his replacement. The South African has been the target of criticism in Australia both for the form of the team and the disciplinary issues which have dogged them in India and England. Captain Michael Clarke has also resigned as a selector in the wake of Arthur's dismissal, believed to be as a show of support for the departed coach. Dumped: Mickey Arthur (left) has been axed by Australia just before the Ashes begins . Some believe that Clarke's role as a . selector - and the strain it puts on his relationships with the squad - . has contributed to Australia's bad form. Cricket Australia CEO James . Sutherland said, of Arthur's sacking: 'The timing is far from ideal but we didn’t feel we . could sit back and hope matters would change without addressing issues . critical to a high performing team culture. 'It obviously isn’t the type of . change we want to make three weeks out from the Ashes commencing but we . believe a change is needed.' He continued: 'This has been a . difficult decision to make but one that we feel is necessary. We are . looking to establish a high performing Australian cricket team that is . consistent over a period of time. 'To achieve that, we need all the parts moving in the right direction. Recent on-field results have been too inconsistent. Incoming: Queensland coach and former Australian cricketer Darren Lehmann is set to replace Arthur . 'Discipline, consistency of behaviour and accountability for performance are all key ingredients that need to improve. And we see that the head coach is ultimately responsible for that. 'The Cricket Australia Board decided yesterday that Mickey Arthur should not continue as head coach of the Australian cricket team.  In taking this decision, the Board accepted the recommendation to make an immediate change as being in the best interests of the team.' Arthur said: 'Naturally I’m very . disappointed with how this has all ended.  I certainly wanted to see the . job through but I accept that the team hasn’t been completely . galvanised under my leadership and our performances have been . inconsistent. Yvette Arthur, his wife told Australia's Channel 9 news: 'He's absolutely shattered. 'He's an absolutely shattered man. He never saw it coming for one minute. 'He was so looking forward to the Ashes and working with the Test team again. He's just absolutely devastated.' 'I’m certainly a believer in good . culture and traditions much like all Australians and feel we were . starting to get a shift in the right direction. We certainly need the . team to be absolutely unified if we’re any chance of beating the . English.' Sutherland continued: 'Darren Lehmann has been appointed as the new Australia head coach.  He has had outstanding success in a short time with Queensland Cricket winning the Bupa Sheffield Shield, Ryobi One-Day Cup and KFC T20 Big Bash League all within the last two years. Lehmann will be contracted until June 2015 – post the 2015 Cricket World Cup. The Board considered him the outstanding candidate to drive the cultural change required in the team and to take it to the number one ranking in all formats of the game. 'No-one is underestimating the task at hand but we believe he is the right man for the job. It is up to the players to respond under his leadership and demonstrate their commitment to a successful Australian team.' Sutherland also claimed that Clarke's decision to step down as a selector had been coming since the tour of India. He explained: 'Being a team selector was proving to be a significant drain on Michael’s time and he sees this as distracting from his primary responsibilities as a player and as captain. 'The board unanimously supported Michael's request and believes that given the coaching change now is also the best time to enact this selection change as well.' Clarke will continue to be consulted 'heavily' by the National Selection Panel on all team selection issues. Role relinquished: Captain Michael Clarke (right) has stepped down as a selector . Gone: Arthur has been dismissed . Arthur was appointed as successor to Tim Nielsen in 2011 and was Australia's first overseas coach. His . time in charge has been far from easy as Australia have struggled to . replace retiring stars like Ricky Ponting and Mike Hussey. Perhaps . the nadir of Arthur's tenure came this March on the tour of India when . vice-captain Shane Watson, Mitchell Johnson, James Pattinson and Usman . Khawaja were disciplined for failing to make a presentation on how the . team could improve, an incident which became known as 'homework-gate'. Disciplinary issues continued to haunt . the team in England earlier this month when opener David Warner was . suspended because of an attack on England batsman Joe Root in a bar. To . compound matters, Australia finished bottom of their group in the . Champions Trophy after suffering two defeats, including against Ashes . opponents England. With the first Test of back-to-back Ashes series beginning on July 10, the timing is undoubtedly a surprise. But former Australia bowler Damian Fleming felt Arthur's position had grown tenuous since the tour of India. He . told BBC Sport: 'I'm shocked at the timing [but] I would have thought . he was on thin ice with the performances of the team on the field in the . last six months, particularly that disastrous Indian tour where we lost . 4-0, but also what's been happening off the field. 'It . just shows for me that they're not united and for the leadership within . the Australian team, that's the biggest job, to make sure everyone's . going in the right direction and that hasn't appeared to be happening in . the last six months.' Should Lehmann be named as Arthur's replacement, he will take over at a key moment in Australian cricket, as they attempt to regain the Ashes having lost the last two Test series against England. Lehmann has impressed since being appointed coach of Queensland. Disorder and disarray: Australia have been performing badly and Arthur paid the price . Fleming said: 'Darren Lehmann was a fine Australian player, they love him up in Yorkshire, he's a legend there and he's done some good work for Queensland. He took over a couple of years ago, they've won the Sheffield Shield, the Big Bash. 'He's got the blend of being a fine Australian cricketer in his own right and you don't want to get on the wrong side of Boof (Lehmann). 'The only question for him is when you are coaching a new team you want to bring in your own structures. Is he going to be able to so that 20 days out from the Ashes? I don't think so. 'But I'd like an Australian coach and particularly one who's been a fine player like Darren Lehmann.' Lehmann himself is no stranger to disciplinary breaches. In 2003 he received a five-match ban from the International Cricket Council for a racial outburst after a game against Sri Lanka.","Captain Michael Clarke has resigned as a selector in a show of support .

Firing a giant ash cloud up into the sky and seemingly dispersing surrounding clouds with its powerful force, a dramatic time lapse video shows the moment a giant Mexican volcano explodes into life. Mexico's second highest peak Popocatépetl erupted on Monday and it blew its top to relieve some of the building pressure within. The 30 second clip shows how ash poured from the 17,802ft volcano, which is less than 25 miles from the country's capital Mexico City and its 8.8million residents, over a 12 minute period. Scroll down for video . Calm before the storm: The giant Mexican volcano is pictured moments before a pressure build causes a powerful explosion of ash . Boom: The first plumes of ash are seen coming from the tip of the volcano following the powerful blast . Debris: Rocks are thrown from the top of El Popo and begin to tumble down its slope as the shockwave from the blast first becomes visible . Shockwave: Even the clouds appear to disperse slightly as the volcano almost appears as though it has blown a hole in the sky . The sheer force of the blast is illustrated by a powerful shockwave which can be seen descending the volcano's cone through the video. As if it has blown a hole in the sky, the clouds surrounding the top of the volcano appear to be sent sprawling by the shockwave. The blast is the latest in a series of incidents of activity at the volcano since scientists first noticed a rise in seismic activity around Popocatépetl  last year. Just last month those living in the shadow of the giant volcano, known as El Popo among locals, were put on high alert after scientists detected a dramatic increase in seismic activity. Aftermath: The time lapse video only lasts 30 seconds but shows the effects of the blast for a full 12 minutes . Huge blast: The shockwave and falling debris can be seen tumbling down the slope of El Popo as the ash cloud gets even bigger . Active: Smoke continues to billow from the volcano which suffered its last major eruption back in 1947 . Danger: Scientists first notice an increase in seismic activity around the volcano last year . It was heard to rumble and seen to spew ash, lava and steam over a period of several days and officials imposed an exclusion zone around its base. The threat level was raised to Yellow Phase 3 - the fifth rung on a seven-stage warning scale. Popocatepetl is an Aztec word meaning 'Smoking Mountain'. EL Popo lay dormant for decades until it began putting out small eruptions of ash almost daily in 1994. Sleeping giant: It is not the first time it has been feared that El Popo would erupt - last month disaster planners prepared residents living close to the giant for evacuation after it billowed a cloud of ash and was heard to rumble . Lively: Popocatépetl has erupted more than 15 times since the Spanish arrived in the country in 1519 . Moderate outbursts from El Popo in recent years have seen officials forced to evacuate residents from their homes. The millions of people who have settled in and around the Mexican capital mean experts regard Popocatepetl as one of the most potentially destructive volcanoes in the world. It has erupted more than 15 times since the Spanish arrived in Mexico in 1519 and saw its last major eruption in 1947. The volcano was first scaled by Diego de Order in 1519 and the 16th century monastries built on its slope are a world heritage site.","The explosion was filmed at the peak of Popocatépetl in central Mexico .

Groundwater found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface of Canada may predate the emergence of multicellular life, but it certainly doesn't taste great, a leading scientist has claimed. A joint British and Canadian team discovered the ancient pockets of water, which they say are like 'trapped time capsules' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years. But Barbara Sherwood Lollar, an Earth sciences professor at the University of Toronto, who is studying the water, has described the water as tasting 'terrible' after feeling compelled to take a sip. The water could be some of the oldest on the planet and may even contain life, the researchers claim, as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight. A joint British and Canadian team discovered the ancient pockets of groundwater in Canada, found bubbling up from nearly two miles beneath the surface. They have been described as . like 'trapped time capsules' cut off from the surface for as long as three billion years . More exciting still, the similarity between the rocks that trapped it and those on Mars raises the hope that comparable life sustaining water could be locked deep beneath the surface of the Red Planet. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, she said that what jumps out at you first is the saltiness. She said: 'Because of the reactions between the water and the rock, it is extremely salty. It is more viscous than tap water. It has the consistency of a very light maple syrup. It doesn't have colour when it comes out, but as soon as it comes into contact with oxygen it turns an orangy colour because the minerals in it begin to form — especially the iron.' She added that 'you would definitely not want to drink this stuff'. Professor Lollar explained that scientists are interested in the saltiest waters because they are the oldest, and tasting is the quick-and-dirty way to find which are the most salty. She said she didn't let students indulge in the prehistoric tipple however. Researchers from the universities of Manchester, Lancaster, Toronto and McMaster analysed the water which poured out of boreholes in a mine 7,875ft beneath Ontario, Canada. 'These are like trapped time capsules,' said Professor Lollar. 'They may tell us about the atmosphere 2.7 billion years ago, and about the fluids that formed the valuable ore deposits that are the foundation of Canada’s mineral wealth.' Geochemical reactions with the rocks . means the water contains dissolved hydrogen and methane, as well as . noble gases like helium, neon, argon and xenon, that have been trapped . since early in Earth’s history. The water could be some of the oldest on the planet and may even contain life, the researchers claim, as it contains an abundance of chemicals known to support organisms in the absence of sunlight. These . gases could provide energy for microbes that may not have been exposed . to the sun for billions of years, the researchers say. Project . leader Chris Ballentine, of the University of Manchester, said: 'Our . finding is of huge interest to researchers who want to understand how . microbes evolve in isolation, and is central to the whole question of . the origin of life, the sustainability of life, and life in extreme . environments and on other planets.' Using . ground-breaking techniques developed at the University of Manchester, . the researchers say they have shown that the fluid is at least 1.5 . billion years old, but could be significantly older. It . could even date back to the formation of the crystalline rocks . surrounding the water, which are thought to be around 2.7billion years . old - about half as old as the planet Earth itself. Before . this finding, the only water of this age was found trapped in tiny . bubbles of rock, but the water found in the Canadian mine on the other . hand pours from the rock at a rate of nearly two litres per minute. It . has similar characteristics to far younger water flowing from a mine . 1.7 miles below ground in South Africa that was previously found to . support microbes. Dr Greg Holland of Lancaster University said: 'Our Canadian colleagues are trying to find out if the water contains life right now. 'What we can be sure of is that we have identified a way in which planets can create and preserve an environment friendly to microbial life for billions of years.' Large regions of Mars are made up of terrain like that of the Earth’s Precambrian Shield – billions of years-old rocks with similar mineralogy. Professor Sherwood Lollar said: 'The ancient waters of the Canadian Shield contain abundant chemicals that we know microbes can use as energy in the absence of sunlight-driven photosynthesis. 'This shows that ancient rocks have the potential to support life and this could be the case whether they are three km below the Earth’s surface or below the surface of Mars.' The Canadian Shield discovery pushes the age of water much farther back than the South Africa discovery, identifying a groundwater system isolated from the surface for billions, rather than tens of millions of years. 'Our discovery establishes that ancient fluids, hitherto thought to have survived only in microscopic fluid inclusions trapped in the rocks, may instead still flow from ancient fractures,' said Professor Sherwood Lollar. Professor Ballentine, who is based in Manchester’s School of Earth, Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences, added: 'While the questions about life on Mars raised by our work are incredibly exciting, the ground-breaking techniques we have developed at Manchester to date ancient waters also provide a way to calculate how fast methane gas is produced in ancient rock systems globally. 'The same new techniques can be applied to characterise old, deep groundwater that may be a safe place to inject carbon dioxide.' David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, said: 'This is excellent pioneering research. It gives new insight into our planet. 'It has also developed new technology for carbon capture and storage projects. These have the potential for growth, job creation and our environment.' The findings were published today in the journal Nature.","Professor Barbara Sherwood Lollar admitted to sipping the ancient water and described it as 'exceptionally salty with an orangy colour'

But both are fully certified galaxies which can be found in the constellation Hydra, 326million light years away. This striking image of two galaxies colliding, taken with the NASA Hubble Space Telescope, shows what looks like the profile of a celestial bird, hovering protectively over an egg . The 'penguin' as Nasa experts have likened it to, is the star-forming spiral galaxy NGC 2936 and would normally look very much like the Milky Way - a flat, spiral disk. But the orbits of the galaxy's stars have become scrambled due to gravitational tidal interactions with the other galaxy,  NGC 2937, positioned to the lower left. The egg shaped galaxy has pulled and elongated the spiral with its gravity, forcing the galaxy's shape to completely reform. The penguin is among a number of 'animal inspired' shapes which astronomers have noted int he night skies, including the Cat's Eye Nebula . This image from the Hubble Space Telescope shows the entire Crab Nebula, which was first observed by the Chinese nearly 1000 years ago . Gas and dust drawn from the heart of NGC 2936 becomes compressed during the encounter, which in turn triggers star formation. These bluish knots are visible along the distorted arms that are closest to the companion elliptical. The reddish dust, once within the galaxy, has been thrown out of the galaxy's plane and into dark veins that are silhouetted against the bright starlight from what is left of the nucleus and disk. The companion elliptical, NGC 2937, is a puffball of stars with little gas or dust present. The beautiful, but distorted shapes are usually caused when two or more galaxies venture too close to each other, 'exchanging matter and causing havoc'.","Striking image of galaxies colliding, taken with NASA Hubble .

Scientists have created the world's first high-definition 3D model of a complete human brain dubbed BigBrain. BigBrain shows the anatomy of a brain in microscopic detail for the first time ever - at a spatial resolution of 20 microns. This is smaller than the size of one fine strand of hair and 250,000 times more detailed than current MRI brain scans. Researchers from Germany and Canada took 7,400 individual slices from the brain of a deceased 65-year-old woman and plotted 80 billion neurons during the 10-year project. Scroll down for video . Scientists from German and Canadian neuroscience teams have created the first high-resolution 3D human brain. BigBrain is 250,000 times more detailed than a current MRI scan and the digital images were taken from individual slices of a deceased 65-year-old female's brain . The BigBrain is 250,000 times more detailed than a regular brain scan. 7,400 individual slices from the brain of a deceased 65-year-old woman were used to create BigBrain. 80 billion neurons were captured in the project. Scientists from Canada and Germany spent 1,000 years collecting the data. The total brain reconstruction has taken 10 years to complete. Each individual slice is half the width of a human hair. The brain can be seen in microscopic detail at a spatial resolution of 20 microns. And they have now made the brain available online for free to help other scientists develop the field of neuroscience. Until recently, reference brains did not scan further than the . macroscopic, or visible, parts of the brain. BigBrain . provides a resolution much finer than the typical 1mm resolution from . MRI studies. Senior . author Dr. Alan Evans, a professor at the Montreal Neurological . Institute at McGill University in Montreal, Canada said the project 'has been a tour-de-force to assemble . images of over 7,400 individual histological sections, each with its own . distortions, rips and tears, into a coherent 3-D volume.' 'This dataset allows - . for the first time - a 3D exploration of human cytoarchitectural . anatomy.' The sophisticated modern image processing methods reveal an unprecedented look at the very fine details of the human brain's microstructure, or cellular level. The online tool will allow for 3D cytoarchitectonic mapping of the human brain and can be used as a map for plotting small cellular circuit data. Thin sections of the 65-year-old human female brain were embedded in paraffin wax and cut by the scientists from Research Centre Julich in Germany using a special large-scale tool called a microtome . The 20-micrometer thick histological sections were then mounted on slides and digitised using a high-resolution flatbed scanner. It took the scientists approximately 1,000 hours to collect the data . It can also map single layers or sublayers of the cerebral cortex, explained the researchers.

Because . of the sheer volume of this dataset, the researchers say that there . will be a 'push by those who want to use it to develop new and valuable . tools for visualization, data management and analysis.' 'We plan to repeat this process in a sample of brains so that we can quantify cytoarchitectural variability,' said Dr. Evans. 'We . will also integrate this dataset with high-resolution maps of white . matter connectivity in post-mortem brains. 'This will allow us to explore . the relationship between cortical microanatomy and fiber connectivity,' said Dr. Amunts.

'We will also transfer high-resolution maps of quantitative data on the regional and laminar distribution of native receptor complexes to the BigBrain. 'This will allow us to explore the relationship between cortical microanatomy and key molecules of neurotransmission.' The fine-grained anatomical resolution will also allow scientists to gain insights into the neurobiological basis of cognition, language, emotions and other processes, according to the study. The researchers plan to extract measurements of cortical thickness to gain insights into understanding aging and neurodegenerative disorders; create cortical thickness maps to compare data from in vivo imaging; integrate gene expression data from the Allen Institute; and generate a brain model with a resolution of 1 micron to capture details of single cell morphology.

Children aged 12 run the highest risk of being killed or seriously injured as pedestrians, a major new report to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin reveals today. There is a sharp and alarming peak in casualty rates when youngsters reach this landmark birthday. And the absence from schools and TV of traditional road safety campaigns like the Tufty Club of the 1960s and Green Cross Code man of the 1970s and ‘80s may be to blame, say experts. Protective parents keeping their children close to home for longer and only letting them ‘play out’ when they reach secondary school may be another factor, they add. Shocking: This graph shows a stark spike in road casualties for 12-year-old children . The report called ‘Stepping Out’ also highlights a ‘post-code lottery’ of pedestrian child casualties with up to half of those killed or injured in the worst areas being children. But it also shows that in up to 60 per cent of cases, the pedestrians themselves are wholly or partially to blame by not paying proper attention to the road. The report was commissioned by the respected Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety (PACTS) and written by experts at Banbury-based Road Safety Analysis. It has the approval of  the Institute of Advanced Motorists and the Safer Roads Foundation. The report and its supporters said the Government must do more to tackle pedestrian deaths – particularly child deaths – after years of improvements had stalled. The report concludes bluntly: ‘The age at which pedestrians are most at risk is 12 years old, with one in 651 children of that age reported as a pedestrian casualty.’ Children are not prepared for the walk to school when they reach secondary school age, say road safety campaigners. File picture . Children are more likely to be injured in spring and summer, excluding August, compared to adults where the danger months are between October and January. The report is being presented to the Transport Secretary at a special PACTS conference in London to mark the UN’s Global Road Safety Week. It comes as 25 leading road safety and transport experts have signed  a letter (to The Times) demanding the Government do more to improve road safety and encourage walking. Some 453 pedestrians were killed in Britain in 2011, a quarter (24 per cent) of all road deaths and a rise of 12 per cent on 2010. The letter says one in four British adults is ‘obese’ and this will double by 2050. Yet only a quarter of English primary pupils are allowed to walk to school and back, compared with three-quarters in Germany. PACTS executive director David Davies said that compared to a generation or so ago when Tufty Club and the Green Cross Code were commonplace and repeated regularly on TV, road safety lessons in many schools were now ‘patchy’ and public funding for such campaigns is diminishing. The erosion of road safety campaigns like Tufty the squirrel and the Green X Code may be behind the figures . He said casualties were peaking at 12 because that was when pupils start secondary school and become more independent. He said: 'They may not have had any significant pedestrian or road safety training. 'My impression is that pedestrian safety training used to be routine for years but is being squeezed out because of pressure from the national curriculum.’ Report author Richard Owen, a director of not-for-profit Road Safety Analysis and a father of two children – a son aged five and an eight-year-old daughter – said: ‘I grew up in the 1970s and ‘80s and everyone knew the Green Cross Code from school and TV. That’s not the case today.' He added that protective parents were keeping their children home during primary school years and only letting them out from secondary school age: 'It may be that what road safety lessons there are are aimed at seven, eight and nine-year-olds when maybe it is 11, 12 and 13 year olds who need it today. It’s only when they get to that age at secondary school that parents feel more confident of letting them out on their own. But though they are older, they don’t have the road safety skills.’ Warning: The report and its supporters said the Government must do more to tackle pedestrian deaths - particularly child deaths. File picture . The Riskiest place for children is Blackburn, with Darwen having the highest proportion (50 per cent higher risk of child pedestrian casualties than the national average), followed by Burnley (49 per cent), Oldham (48 per cent), Pendle (48 per cent), Barnsley (46 per cent), Barrow (46 per cent), Hartlepool, North East Lincolnshire, Hyndburn and Mansfield (all 45 per cent). The lowest proportion of child pedestrian casualties are in Westminster (11 per cent), Kensington and Chelsea (12 per cent),  and Camden in London (16 per cent),  followed by West Somerset (16 per cent), Wandsworth (17 per cent), St Albans (18 per cent), City of London (18 per cent), Islington (18 per cent), East Cambridgeshire (19 per cent) and Colchester (19 per cent). The 'Stepping Out' report was presented to Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin . For all pedestrians, Newham in London is the riskiest place with a risk level double that of the national average. It is followed by Hackney, Preston, Haringay, and Blackburn. Lowest risk areas are Daventry where the risk to pedestrians is 60 per cent lower than the national average. It is followed by neighbouring Harborough, South Cambridgeshire,  East Cambridgeshire, the Western Isles and the Vale of the White Horse. Pedestrians ‘failure  to look properly’ is the biggest contributory factor in accidents –representing nearly six out of ten cases -  followed by pedestrians being ‘careless, reckless or in a hurry’ cited in  about a quarter of cases.  Next comes ‘driver failed to look properly’ at about 1 in 5 (20 per cent). Pedestrians killed and seriously injured has fallen significantly in the last 30 years from 19,035 in 1980 to 5,605 in 2010. But the report stresses that pedestrian casualty reduction has slowed and actually increased in 2011. Despite these falls, the percentage of  all killed or seriously injured casualties who were pedestrians has remained remarkably stable (22.9 per cent in 2010 vs 22.4 per cent in 2010.). Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘As this report recognises, the UK has some of the safest roads in the world for pedestrians, with the number killed or seriously injured falling significantly over the last 30 years.  However we cannot afford to be complacent.’ ‘Casualties for children under 15 have fallen considerably.  However, we know that one death is one too many, which is why we are working directly with local authorities and other partners to ensure our road safety messages are reaching children and teenagers in schools. ‘We are also improving the resources  provided to schools - both at primary and secondary level.’ Tragic: Bilal Khazir was killed by a hit-and-run driver in Bradford last October . The death of Bilal Khazir at the age of 12 shows the dangers faced by children after they are first allowed to go out on the streets on their own. Bilal was returning from a friend's birthday party to his Bradford home in October when he was hit by a car as he crossed the road in a scooter. He had used a pedestrian crossing to get to the other side of the main road, but driver Zain Khan did not see him as he was travelling at well over the speed limit. Bilal was thrown more than 50 metres in the collision, and later died of his injuries. After his death, the schoolboy's family described him as 'one in a million', adding: 'For the rest of our lives we will have family occasions, gatherings and celebrations ruined because Bilal is missing and there is an empty chair.' Khan, 21, was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison after being found guilty of killing Bilal, fleeing from the scene of the accident and subsequently lying to police.","Critics say more awareness and education is needed .

As you juggle the yolk back and forth between the halves of the egg, your fingers get stickier and stickier as the white drains away. Then, more often than not, you have to pick stray bits of shell out of the bowl. Now one entrepreneur has come up with a device which he believes will do away with all that. Scroll down for video . An entrepreneur from New Zealand has created the Yolkr - an egg separator that looks like a giant pipette and can hygienically suck the yolk from an egg white without any mess . The contraption is made from plastic which has been approved by the Food Standards Agency. It costs £18, plus £4 shipping costs, and comes in six colours. The Yolkr was launched as a Kickstarter campaign in January and raised more than three times the target amount . Crack an egg gently into a bowl - multiple eggs can be cracked into the same bowl as long as they don't split. Hold the Yolkr above an egg yolk so it is just touching the surface - be careful not to put too much pressure on and cause the yolk to split. Squeeze the coloured flexible plastic part of the Yolkr to such the yolk from the white. The yolk will sit in the plastic holder at the bottom of the gadget. Place the Yolkr over the mixing bowl or plate where you want the yolk to go and squeeze the Yolkr again to release the yolk. After the egg has been cracked into a . bowl the gadget, which works like a pipette, sucks up the yolk into a . wide-mouthed plastic nozzle when the rubber top is squeezed. It then holds the yolk safely until . the cook is ready to use it, when with another squeeze of the top it . plops it back out in one piece. Hamish Dobbie, a mechanical engineer, . came up with the idea last year after watching a friend painstakingly . trying to split eggs – and failing. 'After making a real mess, and having . to dig egg shells out of the bowl, she said that there must be a better . way of doing it,' said Mr Dobbie, 30, from Auckland, New Zealand. 'I did . a little bit of research and came up with a very basic idea for a tool . that sucks the yolk out of the white. 'I thought if I could make something that worked well and looked good I could be on to something.' Ten months later the device, known as the YOLKR, is about to appear on the shelves in Britain, costing £18. Mr Dobbie added: 'The trick was getting the shape of the nozzle right so it didn't break the yolk when it was sucked up. 'There were many, many eggs of all shapes and sizes broken in the testing stages, but we got there in the end. 'The benefits are the cleanliness and . the hygiene. The traditional ways of splitting eggs involve the yolks . and the whites touching hands or the outsides of the shells. YOLKR . eliminates that. It is a lot quicker and you don't run the risk of . breaking the yolk.' Recipes calling for yolks to be separated from whites include meringue, mousse, souffle and creme brulee. Yolks are used to make mayonnaise, custard and sponge cakes. Dobbie claims the Yolkr is so easy to use he successfully tested it on his 90-year-old grandfather. To suck the egg yolk from the white, hold the Yolkr above it and squeeze the coloured plastic top. The yolk will be sucked into the plastic case. Squeeze the Yolkr again to release the yolk . Not only can the yolk be removed from the white without leaving any residue, it can also be popped back out of the device in one piece. Yolks are used for mayonnaise and custard, among other recipes and designer Dobbie plans to release a Yolkr recipe book if his stretch target of £80,000 on Kickstarter is met .

SCROLL DOWN TO WATCH TRAILER . Menacing: He plays a violent ex-mafia member in Kick-Ass 2 but on anti-violence principles has pulled out from promoting the film . The grandfather-of-one wrote on Twitter: . 'I did Kickass a month b4 Sandy Hook and now in all good conscience I . cannot support that level of violence.' He added a few minutes later: 'I . meant to say my apologies to others involved with the film. I am not . ashamed of it but recent events have caused a change in my heart.' The movie will be released in the UK and the US on 16 August. Big pay day: Jim Carrey has announced he will not promote Kick-Ass 2 due to the film's violent content . Twit: The movie star made his proclamations on the social media website on Sunday . Mark Millar, creator of the original comic book and the film's executive producer said he was 'baffled' by Carrey's decision and asked him to reconsider. 'I cannot support that level of violence': Carrey said  Sandy Hook shootings made him think twice about content of Kick-Ass 2 . In a forum on his website Millarworld, he wrote: 'As you may know, Jim is a passionate advocate of gun-control and I respect both his politics and his opinion, but I'm baffled by this sudden announcement as nothing seen in this picture wasn't in the screenplay eighteen months ago. 'Yes, the body-count is very high, but a movie called Kick-Ass 2 really has to do what it says on the tin. 'A sequel to the picture that gave us Hit-Girl was always going to have some blood on the floor and this should have been no shock to a guy who enjoyed the first movie so much... like Jim, I'm horrified by real-life violence (even though I'm Scottish), but Kick-Ass 2 isn't a documentary.' He added: 'Ultimately, this is his decision, but I've never quite bought the notion that violence in fiction leads to violence in real-life any more than Harry Potter casting a spell creates more Boy Wizards in real life.,, Jim, I love ya and I hope you reconsider for all the above points.' Universal Pictures, the film's studio, has yet to comment on Carrey's decision. Principal . photography began on September 7 2012 in Canada, before moving to . London, with the shooting eventually finishing on November 23, 2012. Just a couple of weeks later, the Sandy Hook tragedy, in which 28 people in total were . killed by gunman Adam Lanza, happened. Fans . of the actor seemed split on his proclamation, with one saying, 'can . you explain more? You're basically saying you don't indorse (sic) kick ass . even though you're a big part of it? Seems strange to me.' Another . added, 'It's a movie. A fun, violent movie. If there was no violence on . TV there might be more in real life,' with some even calling on him to . give away his salary to prove his sincerity. However . others supported his stance, with one saying: 'Very brave to come out . with that, I hope you get that support form the film industry, most are . good understanding people.' As . well as being a stanch gun control activist, Jim is also a . anti-vaccination campaigner, and has previously claimed $10m paycheque . he received for his role in Dumb and Dumber proves the validity of The . Law of Attraction. The . script for the first Kick- Ass film was written by Jane Goldman, the . wife of British chat show host Jonathan Ross, however, she did not . return for the second instalment. Kick-Ass 2, which features a new group of villains hellbent on tackling the titular character, is released in the UK on August 14 and the US two days later. The violent nature of the film seems to have left a mark on the Canadian, pictured left last year at the NY Comedy Awards, and right in 2008 at the Yes Man premier,  who will now no longer be promoting the film .

Danniella Westbrook today sobbed as she described how she was subjected to a horrific 48-hour sex attack by a violent drug gang. Speaking with Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on This Morning the former EastEnders star told how the attack, which took place at the height of her drug addiction in 1994, has scarred her forever. Danniella, who owed the gang thousands of pounds after they supplied her with cocaine, was taken captive in a ground floor flat for two days where the gang gave her alcohol and drugs before the multiple rapes took place. Gangraped: Danniella Westbrook spoke of the terrifying ordeal she suffered at the hands of a violent drug gang at the height of her fame . By that stage, Danniella had left . EastEnders and had split up with her boyfriend, a boyband member. 'It was a terrible time,' she confesses. 'I was really heavily into drugs and moved away . from everybody where I grew up and moved to South London. 'I had a few different people that I used to get drugs from and obviously being on TV everybody thinks you're really rich,' she said. 'I'd used that as a drug addict to my . advantage.' But Danniella spiralled into debts of £5,000 with one supplier and could not find the money to pay him back. When she opened her front door to find his henchmen waiting to collect the debt, she says she knew she was in grave danger. 'One of the guys I owed the money to sent their people to get . the money. I just knew the moment I open the front door . and there were these three guys standing there...' Danniella says she assumed the . gang was going to drive her somewhere and beat her up - and says she wishes that had been the case. 'When it was clear that I didn't have . the money, they said ""get ready, you're coming with us"". 'I thought I . was going to get taken somewhere and get beaten up and dumped. I . wished it had been that.""' Captive: The gang of three men took her from her home to a rented flat where they gave her alcohol and Rohypnol before taking in in turns to rape her repeatedly . With three men as her kidnappers Danniella says there was no point in resisting. 'I knew if I shouted out . it was going to make it worse. These people are not scared of the . police or anyone else. They are there to do what they've got to do. 'They took me to a rented flat and gave me vodka and drugs - then what I . thought was ecstasy but it was Rohypnol. 'I was there for nearly three . days. It was a case of them raping me and doing what they wanted to do . with me. 'That was the start of my nightmare.' After the gang released Danniella, she says she returned home - but didn't report the attack. 'I . just went home and thought ""I'm a drug addict. If I tell anybody . they'll just say it was what I deserved"". 'I blocked everything from . that day out. I felt pretty worthless anyway being a drug addict but . from then on my life just got worse. I just had this secret that I . didn't want to tell anyone.' Danniella says that talking about the . attack in recent times after keeping it to herself for so long has been incredibly . hard - but has helped her to move on. 'It was just a difficult time in my life,' she says. Trauma: The incident occurred back in the 90s when she was at the height of her career in EastEnders . 'It's hard to talk about because I hadn't spoken to anyone about it until writing the book. I'd only spoken to my therapist . briefly about it... but to explain certain subjects, I knew I had to . speak about it. And in doing so had to tell my husband and my mum.' 'Telling my husband was really really difficult - he's the closest person to me in the world and always has been - and I just thought that this fantastic man who has gone through every single drama that I'd had in my life would never wanted to be with me and it actually wasn't like that.' Now that she has managed to tell those closest to her, Danniella urges others who have been victim of rape to speak out too. 'I can't stress enough that if anybody had been in this situation then get help and speak out. You can't live with this... it will kill you.' Danniella, a born again Christian, says that finding faith has helped her through the agony of the attack. 'It worked for me,' she says. 'My faith is something that I have personally. It's not my husband's, it's not my children's, it's mine. And it does see me through a lot.' 'I personally have a relationship with God - I feel like I'm his daughter and I feel worth something. And I didn't have that ever in my life.' Talking about being clean of drugs now for twelve years, Daniella said: 'This is all behind me now and this is the last bit of my demons. 'Everything is now out in the open... and that's a huge sense of clarity.' But she admits that she will always suffer from the lure of addiction. 'I do think once an addict, always an addict - and if its not drugs it'll be something else. Especially having bipolar disorder as well. 'It's never easy. I think you just have to watch yourself all the time because one addiction can easily fall into another. 'I have watch myself and I have to be honest.'To see the interview in full visit the This Morning website.","Star was raped by drugs gang in horrific attack lasting nearly three days .

Polygamy might be illegal in Britain but that hasn't stopped Phillip Sharp, 53, dubbed the 'Rampant Rabbi', from pursuing his unusual take on family life. With him, on his East Sussex farm, live his five wives, their 18 children and, overseeing it all, Sharp's mother-in-law, Maureen. Sharp, who is known for his controversial views - among them 'all women need a husband', 'some gay people have demons in them' and 'black people have low self-worth' -  looks set to raise a few more eyebrows when a documentary that focuses on the life of his 10-year-old daughter Ellie is screened this week. Scroll down for video . Unusual: 10-year-old Ellie Sharp is growing up in a polygamous family on a farm in East Sussex . Filmed in the weeks leading up to the defection of two of Sharp's 'wives' - he once had seven - the documentary charts Ellie's communal home life, which includes home schooling with Sharp's Austrian spouse, Hannah, and spending time with all five wives. She even has nicknames for her mothers. Judith, 53, is known as 'Everything Mum', while her biological mother Margo, 42, is referred to as 'Yard Mum' because she looks after the family's horses. 'Daddy had a vision and God told him to have seven wives,' explains fresh-faced Ellie. 'I couldn't bear not living with all my mummies.' Although he refers to them as 'wives', Sharp is not technically married to any of the women but they have all taken vows and do wear wedding rings. Sharp's unusual family began after he separated from his legal wife 15 years ago. He began a relationship with Judith, and shortly after, came his heavenly vision. His harem swiftly expanded to include his former nanny, New Zealander Margo, plus Swiss Vreni, 41, Hannah, 54, Chava, 67, Tracey, 45 and Karyn, 32. Between them, they have 18 children with Sharp, all of whom live according to his often bizarre decisions. Close: Ellie has a loving relationship with her mothers including Judith (second left) and Margo (far right) Daddy's girl: Ellie describes father Phillip Sharp as 'awesome' and says she could be a polygamous wife . One that is likely to prove particularly controversial was his decision to take the three-month-old Ellie from her mother, Margo, and hand her to Judith to raise. 'When I was three months old, daddy decided that Judith should look after me instead of Margo,' says Ellie. When asked why by documentary makers, Margo says: 'It was clear that I didn't have the ability to look after you. Judith stepped in and that was a good thing. It's made me better in lots of ways.' As she finishes speaking, her lip quivers and she promptly bursts into tears. Sharp, meanwhile, has his own controversial take on the issue. 'Margo had a very strong anti-men attitude and it was so strong that it was in Ellie,' he says. 'Ellie did not like me and rejected me. 'The witchcraft of women annihilates children's love and respect for their fathers.' Although Sharp's domineering behaviour has already led to 'wives' Tracey and Karyn leaving the family, it has made no impression on his daughter, who describes him as 'awesome'. Ellie can even see herself replicating the unusual set-up when she grows up. 'I've told my dad that in my future I wouldn't mind having a man with seven wives,' she says. 'I've grown up like that.' The Girl With Seven Mums is on Thursday at 9pm on Channel 5 .","Phillip Sharp, 53, had seven wives although two have now left .

So as this week's offering about why men love women sees ex-athlete and TV presenter Andy Shepherd, 28, take the form of boyfriend, the video has unsurprisingly spurred almost 20,000 views. 'Andy is also a presenter and a really good actor so was a perfect pretend boyfriend. Also he's good looking which always helps,' said Emily. Scroll down for video . This week, why women love men: Emily's hilarious videos get tens of thousands of views . Reason one, penises: Andy looks displeased as 'girlfriend' Emily cuddles up to his crotch instead of him . Emily's first reason that women love men in her video is 'the fact that they have penises'. To illustrate her point with a . sketch, she comes home from work and dismisses Andy's greeting instead . opting to cuddle up to his crotch. 'I've missed you,' she says. Her second reason is, bizarrely, that you can't get angry at men when they borrow your clothes. Viewers are treated to a scene in which Emily walks in on Andy wears a pretty blue dress while watching the television. Her surreal scenes are intended for some 'much needed light entertainment', as her disclaimer reads. 'You might not agree with everything I say and that's fine,' she says. Reason three is when a man smells good 'it is so intoxicating'. 'Sometimes if I walk past a guy on the street, who doesn't even have to be that attractive, if he smells good - that is me turned on,' she says. 'I call myself fairly independent, and I'm not the kind of girl to to rely on a man,' she says, but adds that she finds it sweet when a man tries to protect her and her out of harm's way. You can't get angry when they borrow clothes: A bulky Andy sits open legged with a beer in hand . They want to protect you: Any leaps to Emily's rescue from a spider, even though she is independent . Men are laid back: Unlike highly strung Emily who shouts at Andy when he offers her a cup of tea . Andy is seen shouting at her to get down and leaping to her rescue when she asks him to 'get that spider'. Emily next points to men' take it or leave it approach to life. 'Women can sometimes be highly strung and overreact,' says Emily. She also loves it when 'you talk about how much you love your sisters or you mum in front of us - it really works,' she says. Reason seven is that 'men remind us of our dads,' says Emily. She quickly backtracks, looking around and saying, 'who said that?' 'There's something endearing about men having the ability to solve any problem just by throwing a ball,' she says. This is illustrated with a sketch of Emily complaining about their being nothing on TV and a ball being thrown at her. Next we see Emily walking down the street in a modest buttoned-up shirt when Andy approaches her to compliment her on her 'great rack'. She appreciates his comment and states reason nine that women love men being that they are 'enthusiastic about bodies, even if we sometimes are not'. Finally, her tenth reason is that women love it when men show their emotions. 'If a guy cries in front of you, as a woman you have just won the emotional lottery,' she says, as we see her initiate sex inappropriately as Andy cries over a deceased loved one.

"By . Associated Press Reporter . UPDATED: . 19:24 EST, 6 April 2013 . Troy James Knapp was dodging authorities, again. The fugitive with a fondness for whiskey and a dislike of living near people had been wanted for a string of break-ins for years at cabins in Utah's mountains. With each near miss, each wanted poster and each threatening note left behind for law enforcement, the legend of him only grew. Knapp survived by holing up inside the cabins, sleeping in the owners' beds, eating their food and listening to their AM radio for updates on the manhunt. And then, authorities say, he would take off, stealing items such as guns and high-end camping equipment and vanishing into the woods where he lived off dandelions and wild game. Sanpete Sheriff's Officers escort Troy James Knapp, 45, to the Sanpete County Jail Tuesday, April 2, 2013, in Manti, Utah. Authorities captured Knapp, an elusive survivalist who is suspected of burglarizing Utah cabins . Hideaway: A snowbound cabin at Ferron Reservoir in the mountains of central Utah. Troy James Knapp spent his last three nights as a fugitive in the cabin before his capture April 2 . Over Easter weekend, authorities were on his trail, again. By Tuesday, his life on the lam came . to an end, done in by an educated guess by searchers who had grown to . know his tendencies, the tracks he left with his snowshoes and the . sounds of him chopping wood outside a cabin near a mountain reservoir. A team of 14 officers approached him . on snowshoes - the only way to quietly sneak up on him - and called in . reinforcements to help corner the bearded and camouflage-clad fugitive, a . trim 45-year-old standing 5-foot-8. Now in police custody, Knapp is . telling authorities how he managed to evade them for so long across a . mountainous region stretching for 180 miles. ""He really has a . fascinating story to tell, and right now he's willing to tell it,"" Sanpete County Sheriff Brian Nielson said. Trapped: 'Mountain Man' Troy James Knapp is taken into custody by the Emery County Sheriff's Office on April 2 outside of Ferron in central Utah . Tracked down: The elusive survivalist was captured by police on Tuesday after spending five years allegedly robbing cabins in the wilderness and leaving taunts for officers . Knapp, born in Saginaw, Mich., got . into trouble with the law early. As a teenager, he was convicted of . breaking and entering, passing bad checks and unlawful flight from . authorities, according to court records. His most serious offense, an . arrest for felony assault in Michigan, was reduced in 1994 to a charge . of malicious destruction of property after he agreed to plead guilty. ""He says, `I don't hate people. I just don't like living with them,'"" Sevier County Sheriff Nathan Sheriff Curtis said. With no known occupation, Knapp . drifted across the country and ended up in prison in California for . burglary. He fell off the radar in 2004 when he ""went on the run"" while . on parole, said Bobby Haase, a spokesman for the California Department . of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Finally caught: Troy James Knapp was arrested today, left, after evading cops for years. He was last arrested in 2001, right . In custody: Snow-mobilers pass the sheriff's truck carrying the 45-year-old suspect . By 2007, Utah authorities began . investigating a string of cabin burglaries they believed were tied to . one person. It wasn't until early 2012 that they identified Knapp as the . suspect from cabin surveillance photos and fingerprints lifted from one . cabin. In one photo, he was wearing camouflage, a rifle was slung over . his shoulder and he had purple-colored aluminum snowshoes on his feet. Knapp appears to have aged considerably from a 2001 California mug shot. Tracy Glover, chief deputy sheriff in . Kane County, said it was fairly easy to identify Knapp's cabin habits. Knapp would drink any coffee and alcohol he could find, authorities say. Unlike typical burglars, he never took large or expensive appliances . such as TVs or stereos. He took only what he could carry, mostly camping . gear and weapons he stashed in abundance in the woods. He returned to . burglarize cabins more than once, even swapping one stolen rifle for . another, officials said. A few years ago, investigators found . an abandoned camp they linked to Knapp. It had a doomsday supply of . dehydrated foods, radios, batteries, high-end camping gear, 19 guns and a . copy of Jon Krakauer's ""Into the Wild,"" a book about a young man who . died after wandering into the Alaskan wilderness to live alone off the . land. It was in Kane County, near Zion . National Park, where authorities lifted Knapp's fingerprints from items . in a cabin. The prints matched sets in criminal databases, giving law . enforcement confidence that he was their guy. Knapp is believed to have left that . area in early 2012. He started to make his way north from Kane into . Sevier, Sanpete and Emery counties, where he was occasionally spotted by . hunters. Knapp has told detectives he was feeling stressed trying to . hide from hunters last fall, said Brian Nielson, the sheriff in Sanpete . County. Court records from multiple Utah . counties indicate Knapp regularly spent several days in snowbound . cabins, exhausting the food and firewood before moving on. Authorities . say the signature clue of his presence was an empty bottle of whiskey. In summer, he retreated to makeshift camps deep in the backcountry.

Even authorities have found something . to admire in Knapp's knack for survival and evasion. He stepped on . saplings to avoid leaving discernible boot tracks and changed stolen . footwear often to confuse searchers. He walked alongside trails instead . of on them and kept mostly to backcountry. He used some of those tactics in his . final flight, which started more than a dozen miles away from his . capture site. At Joe's Valley in the Manti-LaSal National Forest, . deputies found boot prints around two burglarized cabins. The tracks led . in no apparent direction, Emery County sheriff's Cpt. Jeff Thomas said. Deputies copied his silent mode of . travel on snowshoes over three days and nights as they tried to track . Knapp across rugged terrain, first losing his size-10 shoe prints, then . regaining his tracks on snowshoe as he ventured higher on the . 10,000-foot Wasatch Plateau.

""They stayed quiet and built no fires - and they were very cold,"" Thomas said. To get this far, deputies had to think . like Knapp. He moved often and swiftly across the backcountry, covering . 20 miles in a day ""and that was nothing for him,"" Curtis said. They had to imagine where Knapp might . have taken off. They guessed it was a collection of cabins a dozen miles . away at a high-altitude reservoir. They believe Knapp had visited there . before.

""We couldn't just go knocking on doors."" By 10 a.m. Tuesday, 40 officers took . positions around the 9,000-foot reservoir.

Admission: Formula 1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone has admitted that he has never experienced happiness . Formula 1 tycoon Bernie Ecclestone has admitted that he has never experienced happiness. The 82-year-old is worth an estimated £3billion, but claims that his fame and fortune have not bought him joy. 'I am not sure what happiness is. What do those feelings mean? I have experienced satisfaction when I have planned something and it has come off. But happiness? I am not so sure,' he said in a Times2 interview. The billionaire gave his daughter Tamara, 28, away earlier this month when she married in South of France. But he told the newspaper that he did not even celebrate her nuptials. 'I didn't go to the celebrations the next day. I went home. I was there for a job and was happy to do that. I didn't want to hang around. The whole thing was a huge affair, too much really. But I didn't pay for it. My ex-wife did.' In 2009 Bernie and his wife of 23 years Slavica split up. Slavica, 55, topped the Sunday Times’ Rich List in the ‘richest divorcees’ category after she was awarded an estimated £740million in 2009 in the divorce - it ended on the grounds of his ‘unreasonable behaviour’. Last year Ecclestone remarried Brazilian marketing director Fabiana Flosi, 35, at Le Lion, his £23million chalet in the exclusive resort of Gstaad. Third wife: Bernie Ecclestone, 82, with his new wife Fabiana Flosi, 35 . Pictured with his daughters Petra (right) and Tamara (left), Bernie Ecclestone says he has experienced satisfaction but not happiness despite having a £3bn fortune . The wedding was the third trip down the aisle for the octogenarian, who vowed to ‘remain single for the rest of his life.' His daughters, remain fiercely loyal to their mother but are at . least partly reconciled to Flosi's arrival. An elusive character, at 5ft 3in tall, Ecclestone is instantly recognisable, mop-haired and squinting slightly behind John Lennon glasses. Ecclestone sleeps six-and-a-half hours a night and works ferociously hard when he is awake. Daddy dearest: Tamara talks to her father and mother outside a London church last week for a christening . Proud day: Petra Ecclestone was joined at her daughter's big day by her husband James Stunt . In the interview Ecclestone touched on the prospect of facing up 10 years in prison -  he has been charged with bribery by German prosecutors. 'If I get sent to jail I will have to deal with it. But I don't think I will like it very much,' he told the newspaper. The charge, and a separate indictment of . breach of fiduciary duty, relates to the sale in 2006 of Formula One by . German bank Bayern LB to CVC Capital partners. Slavica Ecclestone topped the Sunday Times' Rich List in the richest divorcees category after her split with Bernie in 2009 . Bayern’s former chief risk officer, Gerhard Gribkowsky, is serving an eight-and-a-half-year sentence after confessing last June to accepting a £28million bribe. And according to Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung, German authorities allege Ecclestone was responsible for the payment. The suggestion is that the money was . paid to ensure Formula One was sold, without updating its value, to a . company which would retain Ecclestone as the sport’s most powerful . figure. Ecclestone, . denies any wrongdoing, insisting he paid the money after being ‘shaken . down’ by Gribkowsky who he claims had threatened to make trouble for him . with the Inland Revenue. He . currently has one of Germany's top law firms, Thomas Deckers Wehnert . Elsner, and his usual team of lawyers in England working for him on the . case. The . defence sticks to its view that Mr Ecclestone has neither committed . bribery nor played any part in committing a fiduciary breach of trust. Under German law, charging someone does not necessitate the case will immediately go to trial. Once a person is indicted, the case is transferred to the courts where a judge will determine if the evidence warrants a trial. Should . Ecclestone be charged and face a trial, it would likely take place . later this year, and that would immediately draw into question his . position as head of F1. Aware . of the circumstances, in December Ecclestone remarked: 'They (CVC) will . probably be forced to get rid of me if the Germans come after me. It's . pretty obvious if I'm locked up.'

And now, with the number of new mothers attempting to breastfeed falling in England for the first time in almost a decade, one woman wants the Duchess of Cambridge to help reignite the trend. TV and radio presenter Beverley Turner wants Kate to use her position of power to help encourage women to breastfeed their babies. We need you, Kate! Beverley Turner has spoken out about the fall in women breastfeeding and wants the Duchess of Cambridge to set a trend . Writing an outspoken piece for The Telegraph, she said: 'We need women with power and influence to get their milky bosoms out and feed smiling in paparazzi pictures. 'Celebrity is depressingly powerful in dictating trends. 'As if there wasn’t enough pressure on her already, what we really need is The Duchess of Cambridge to get her Royal orbs out to feed our future monarch. And to be applauded – not seethed at – for doing so.' About 5,700 fewer women started breastfeeding their babies in 2012-13 compared to the year before and Beverley, who has a son with Olympic rower James Cracknell, wants to make a change. She believes that breastfeeding is rapidly losing any sense of normality because of powerful cultural forces. Dropping numbers: About 5,700 fewer women started breastfeeding their babies in 2012-13 compared to the year before . She writes that young mothers aren't willing to breastfeed because they don't deem it 'cool' or 'sexy' and think their boyfriends won't like it. It is unclear whether the Duchess of Cambridge will breastfeed but she will move back in with her mother when her baby is born. In a break with royal tradition, Kate, 31, will not employ a maternity nurse after the July birth. Instead, she has told friends, she will live with her parents for at least the first six weeks after leaving hospital. The decision means a future monarch . will be starting life in a commoner’s home in Berkshire rather than in . the splendour of a royal residence. Kate . says she ‘just feels safest and most secure’ with her family and . believes that no one could be better placed to teach her about bringing . up a baby than her mother, who has three children of her own. She . will particularly need her advice and moral support when Prince William . returns to work as a helicopter pilot after taking his paternity leave.

Officials have expressed their fears for the security of top-secret files Edward Snowden is believed to have - and how they worry he may be giving the information to countries helping him escape. Their concerns come as it emerges that Snowden has already given encoded copies to several people in case anything happens to him as he attempts to elude the U.S. government. While these copies of the files are heavily encoded, Snowden has arranged for them to be accessed if he is caught, according to Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who broke Snowden's story. Authorities have said they are worried that the NSA whistleblower could also share the files with the countries - including China and Russia - they believe have helped the whistleblower escape. Power: Officials are concerned over the security of the files Edward Snowden copied from the NSA - and are fearful that he may give them to foreign governments who help him elude the U.S. Snowden, who fled Hong Kong on Sunday and now remains in a transit zone in a Moscow airport, gleaned the sensitive data after specifically taking a job with contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii. Three weeks ago, the Guardian and the Washington Post published details about Prism, which gives the NSA access to data on people via Facebook and Google, among other companies. The NSA is now souring all systems they believe  the 30-year-old systems administrator could have accessed during his three months working for the company, sources told the Washington Post. 'They think he copied so much stuff - . that almost everything that place does, he has,' said a former . government official. 'Everyone's nervous about what the next thing will be, what will be . exposed.' Greenwald has indicated that these fears are justified. 'I know that he has in his possession . thousands of documents, which, if published, would impose crippling . damage on the United States’ surveillance capabilities and systems . around the world,' he told CNN. Search: Snowden is in a transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport, pictured . But he added that Snowden 'has never done any of that' and that he has been selective in choosing what to expose, only wishing to shine a light on government practices, not endanger the country. 'Snowden himself was vehement from the . start that we do engage in that journalistic process and we not . gratuitously publish things,' Greenwald said. 'I do know he was vehement . about that, he was not trying to harm the U.S. Government, he was . trying to shine light on it.'

A spokesperson for WikiLeaks, which . is aiding Snowden's escape and quest for political asylum, . vehemently denied that foreign governments had made copies of the files, . the Post said. Revelations: Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who published select files from Snowden, said the whistleblower has given encoded files to several people in case anything happens to him . Swiped: Snowden took the files while working for contractor Booz Allen Hamilton in Hawaii up until May . Speaking with the Daily Beast, Greenwald added that Snowden handed over encoded files to several people that will be unlocked if anything happens to him. He added that Snowden 'has taken extreme precautions to make . sure many different people around the world have these archives to . insure the stories will inevitably be published'. He said that the people who have the files cannot yet access them, but if anything happens to Snowden 'he has has arranged for them to get access to the full archives', Greenwald said. Greenwald added that he himself has thousands of documents from Snowden which he is continuing to look over - and added he is unsure whether the whistleblower has even more files.

She gave him his first . tennis racket when he was just two and coached him until he was 11. She even sacrificed her marriage to follow him around the world. And as she returns to the All England . Club to watch every one of Andy Murray's matches, it appears that the world number two's mother has better things to do than worry about dying her hair. New do: Andy Murray's mother Judy sported a grey hair do today as she arrived at day one of Wimbledon Tennis Championships 2013 to support her son . 53-year-old Judy Murray showcased a new grey hair do at Wimbledon today, prompting many to question whether eight years of supporting her son courtside is starting to take its toll. Speaking ahead of his match today, Judy said: 'He's . been playing in Wimbledon since 2005, I think he missed just one year . through injury, and you have your own way of dealing with it. 'I've done it many times but it doesn't get any less stressful.' The former British tennis coach usually sports a bobbed brunette or sandy blonde hairstyle, but it seems she has hung up her the hair dye and opted to age more naturally. Fifty shades of grey: Judy has seemingly ditched the hair dye and has opted to age gracefully with her stylish grey style of late . Judy famously loves mothering Andy, once even rushing out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was exactly 37 degrees, as prescribed by his physio. Once, when he didn't have the right shoes for a big match in Miami, she flew out from Britain with a new pair. 'What else could I do?' she said. Sadly, her commitment took its toll on her relationship with husband Willie - the pair split when Andy was just nine. At the time, she said: 'I was away a lot and then you're coaching until quite late in the evening. Your domestic life gets hit for six.' Brunette: Just six months ago Judy was sporting a brunette style as she watched Andy play in the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals . In June 2005, during Andy's Wimbledon debut, she was nicknamed 'Spy Mum' after using a video camera to film Andy's opponent George Bastl for him to analyse. As well as supporting Andy from the . stands as he bids to become the first British champion since Fred Perry . in 1936, Judy will be spending time with her son at his home in Surrey . during the tournament. She said: 'The grass court season is the time when he can actually stay at home. 'He lives about half an hour away from Wimbledon - so he has that luxury of being able to stay at home. Bottle blonde: Judy, who will be spending time with her son at his home in Surrey during the tournament, was sporting a blonde style this time last year . 'It is nice to be able to spend a bit of family time and be hi his own surroundings with his girlfriend and his dogs.' If Murray gets through the early stages . of the tournament, the 26-year-old could come up . against top seeds Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, two-time winner Rafael Nadal or . defending champion Roger Federer. However, Judy would not be drawn on her son's chances at Wimbledon. She said: 'You never look further than the first round. 'There's always an advantage when you've . played somebody recently, in terms of working out your game plan and . tactics, particularly when it's on the same surface.' Redhead: Judy, who watches her sons every match and says it doesn't get any easier, has also sported red hues in the past (pictured here in 2010 and 2009 with Andy's girlfriend Kim Sears) The people of Andy's home town are . fiercely proud of their local hero - packing Dunblane's pubs, hotels and . tennis club to cheer him on. Judy, from Bridge of Allan near Stirling, says her son draws strength from this backing. She said: 'He always has incredible support from the local communities. They really push the boat out at this time of year.' Judy attended the Royal Highland Show in . Edinburgh this weekend to showcase her Set4Sport initiative, which aims . to get children active. The programme centres on homemade games she played with her sons when they were growing up. She explained: 'They're all games we made up when Jamie and Andy were small. Support system: Judy is her son's number one fan and has supported him since day one. Here, she is pictured at his first ever Wimbledon tennis championships in June 2005 . 'I had two boisterous young boys at home . and not much money, so we were always challenging ourselves to find . things that we could do when the weather's bad, often it was things we . could do inside, without spending a lot of money. 'Biscuit tin lid cereal boxes, for example. We played that with cereal boxes for the net, biscuit lids for bats and a ping pong ball. 'It's all simple stuff and you don't need to go out and spend any money or book a pitch to do it.' It was these activities that contributed to Andy and Jamie's success on the court, according to Judy. 'I believe that doing so many fun activities when the kids were small helped to develop good hand-eye coordination. 'Andy, as well as being a really good tennis player, was also an extremely good football player. Doting: Judy famously loves mothering Andy and even used to rush out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was exactly 37 degrees, as prescribed by his physio . 'Up to age 14 he was as much football as . tennis and he opportunity to do something with Rangers when he was 14 - . that's when he made the decision to go into tennis. 'And Jamie was a pre-handicapper at golf when he was 16.' Despite his talents, Andy Murray says he has come to terms with the fact that he may not win Wimbledon - and claims he is now a better player because of it. The Scottish tennis ace said yesterday that his failure to win the championship last year had taught him not to put too much pressure on himself. Speaking on the eve of this year’s games at SW19, the world number two warned fans he could not guarantee a win - and that he was ‘comfortable’ with that. The little things: Judy credits her son's success to the games she used to play with him when he was younger, which she maintains improved his hand-eye coordination . He added that his new attitude would allow him to just ‘go out there and play’ - without worrying about letting anyone down. Last year, when he lost to Roger Federer, his devastation was plain to see on live television when he shed several tears on court. Among the crestfallen crowd on the day were his girlfriend, Kim Sears, and the Duchess of Cambridge - both of whom were also crying. After that disappointment, he went on to beat Federer and win gold at the London Olympics - and also became the champion of the US Open. Jonathan Long, nice’n easy Colour Advisor says: 'Once you start seeing the signs of grey, you might want to embrace your silver tones. 'The key is to keep your hair in great condition by having regular deep conditioning treatments and ensuring your ends are trimmed so hair stays vibrant and glossy. Grey doesn't mean dull. 'Grey hairs are actually colourless hairs within your own hair that soften the overall effect of your colour. 'When covering them, I would always go for a shade or two lighter than your normal hair colour as this will even out the difference between the naturally faded hair and the ""greys"", giving you back the all over intensity and depth of tone that you are used to!'","Normally blonde Judy, 53, showed off grey hair at Wimbledon today .

It is perhaps what John Lennon was referring to when he sang to his ‘little flower princess’. Women in Liverpool are the most pungent in Britain when it comes to dousing themselves in floral perfumes, a study has found. Those in the south prefer a more delicate fruity fragrance, while Mancunians give off a sharp citrusy odour. Women in Liverpool are the most pungent in Britain when it comes to dousing themselves in floral perfumes, a study has found . The findings have emerged as part of a ‘fragrance map of the UK’, compiled by comparing figures for sales of different kinds of perfumes across the country. The results suggest that lifestyle and surroundings have a marked impact on what women choose to smell like. In Merseyside, floral scents are far more popular than across the rest of the UK. Inspired by local WAGs including Coleen Rooney, women in Liverpool buy 66 per cent more of the fragrance than those elsewhere. They also use more of the stuff, with department store bosses saying their ‘high maintenance’ Liverpudlian clientele ‘don’t simply spritz on their perfume, but rather immerse themselves in their chosen scent’. Sales of scented body lotion and shower gel are also very high and coffrets sell at a rate of 31 per cent more in the region compared to the national average. Geordie lasses, meanwhile, spend the most in total on fragrances, with an average transaction for perfumes in the North East coming in at £50. The findings have emerged as part of a 'fragrance map of the UK', compiled by comparing figures for sales of different kinds of perfumes across the country . Visitors to the region are most likely to leave with a lingering whiff of woody scents. Sales of fragrances such as sandalwood and cedarwood are 14 per cent higher in Newcastle, researchers found. By the mouth of the coast in South Wales, girls appear to enjoy smelling like their surroundings, with aqua scents flying off the shelves in Cardiff almost 90 per cent more frequently than across the rest of the UK. Those in the east Midlands also take their geography seriously, with oriental scents more popular in Nottingham than elsewhere. Mancunians, meanwhile, favour citrusy smells, while women in London buck the trend and go for rural fruity scents. Sales of fruity fragrances in the capital are 70 per cent higher than in all the other cities studied.Researchers also found women are increasingly switching perfumes during the day - from light day scents to a more dramatic fragrance for evening. The fragrance map of the UK was compiled using sales figures from John Lewis. Amanda Scott, head of beauty at the department store, said: ‘It is fascinating to see how lifestyle and surroundings affect customers’ fragrance choices. ‘Women wear a scent like they wear a statement necklace in the evening - to stand out and be original.’","Women in Liverpool are most pungent in Britain when it comes to perfume .

A British pub in New York is facing a human rights prosecution and a £5,000 fine after advertising for bar staff who are from the UK. The Longbow Pub and Pantry was accused of discrimination because the advert told applicants that ‘being British definitely works in your favour’. Its owners also claimed that staff had to know why Liverpool v Everton is an important match, and that the Old Firm refers to a match between Celtic and Rangers and not a law company. 'Being British definitely works in your favour': The Long Bow Pub & Pantry in Brooklyn, New York, after adding that statement to a vacancy for bar staff advertised on the classified ads website Craigslist . The New York City Commission on Human Rights disagreed and said its administrative code bans adverts which demand that staff be a specific nationality. It has set up a ‘conciliation meeting’ for talks with the pub’s owners Jennifer and Michael Colbert but unless a deal is reached there will be a trial with a fine of up to £5,000. Mrs Colbert is from Brooklyn in New York but considers herself an honorary Brit as her husband of 19 years, Mr Colbert, a carpenter, is from Wrexham. They posted the advert to online classifieds website Craigslist after hiring somebody who did not know British culture. Mrs Colbert said: ‘She was from (New) Jersey. The customers didn’t take to her. 'She didn’t understand when they were making jokes. There’s a certain cadence to the sarcasm that just flew over her shoulders’. After asking her to leave they wrote the advert which read that they wanted ‘energetic and enthusiastic men and women with an appreciation of craft beer, good food, whisky and real football (a k a soccer). ‘Being British definitely works in your favour.' Mr Colbert and his wife have vowed to fight the claims they are discriminating and wrote a letter to the commission outlining their case. It read that staff working in their pub had to know that ‘knocking someone up’ is not about being pregnant as it does in the U.S., and that a banger had nothing to do with gangs, as in the American phrase ‘gang banger’. Another issues was that Americans think that black pudding is a dessert, they wrote. Cliff Mulqueen, the general counsel for the New York City Commission on Human Rights said that the Colberts were ‘missing the point’. He told the New York Times: ‘There’s an argument that someone who works in a Chinese restaurant, for example, may need to speak Chinese in order to communicate with their co-workers. ‘But there’s a difference between saying you have to speak Chinese and saying you have to be Chinese.’","Owners say 'being British definitely works in your favour' in online ad .

"By . Nick Pisa . PUBLISHED: . 15:09 EST, 23 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:18 EST, 23 January 2013 . Detectives are investigating the discovery of human remains that had been hidden in the foundations of a pizzeria recently confiscated as part of an operation against the Mafia. The grim find was made as workmen carried out renovations at the restaurant, which also sits upon the site of an old Roman road. Sources said the skeleton was found in the cellar of the building which dates back to the 1600s, although the bones appeared to have been from a 'far more recent period'. Behind the facade: The human remains were found in the foundations of a pizzeria with connections to the mafia in the picturesque town of Lecco, Lake Como . Officers and forensic pathologists were called to the building by shocked workers just days after ornate frescoes were also uncovered at the former pizzeria. Following the discovery of the artwork at the pizzeria known as Il Giglio in Lecco, near Milan, experts from Italy's superintendency of art were called in to examine the works. But they will now have to leave as the building is now in the hands of the local police, putting plans to turn it into an old people's home on hold. It had initially been seized and closed down by anti-mob investigators as part of a crackdown on the Coco Trovato clan, who operate in the area and are part of the Calabrian mafia known as the 'Ndrangheta, who have spread north from their stronghold in the deep south of Italy around the port of Reggio Calabria. Godfather: Franco Coco Trovato, jailed in 1992, bossed over the Coco Trovato clan which led to the closure of the pizzeria . A police spokesman in Lecco said: 'The building has been sealed off and investigators are on site. 'They will be working to establish exactly how old the skeleton is and if possible try and identify it. 'At this point we are not ruling anything out, especially - given that the property was owned by the 'Ndrangheta - we need to see if there is a possible criminal connection.' Godfather of the clan was Franco Coco Trovato, 67, who was convicted and jailed in 1992 for life after being found guilty of murder, extortion and drug trafficking. The clan boss had a fleet of Porsche and Ferrari cars as well as a string of pizzerias and restaurants across Lecco and Milan which were popular with Italian celebrities. He ruled the area around Lecco with an iron grip, frequently ordering rivals to be executed.  In one hit, six opponents were gunned down while he himself was also targeted but escaped leaving his would-be assassins killing two innocent passers-by instead. In true mafia style he then invited the rival mobster who had ordered the hit to a 'clear the air dinner' where he was shot dead. And while he is still in prison, police say his clan still continues to influence the area and he manages to impose his will even from behind prison bars. The 'Ndrangheta has been growing in influence in northern Italy in recent years and is now said to be more powerful than its better-known Sicilian counterparts, with its fingers deep in the financial and fashion capital of Milan. Two years ago in a famous show trial dozens of 'Ndrangheta mobsters were sentenced to total jail terms of more than 1,000 years by a Milan judge. Police say the 'Ndrangheta controls the lucrative drugs supply from South America into Europe and operations to crack it are difficult as there are few informants. One of the most infamous events including the 'Ndrangheta was the infamous Duisburg Massacre of 2007 when six mobsters were gunned down in a pizzeria in the German city after travelling more than 1,000 miles from Reggio Calabria to settle a long running feud. The N'drangheta's power has increased in recent years and it dominates the drugs market in Europe especially cocaine with investigators estimating it makes more than £30 billion a year - equivalent to the GDP of Slovenia - and there are also said to be connections in Britain.","Police called to Il Giglio pizzeria in Lecco, near Milan, after grisly discovery .

"By . Associated Press Reporter and Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:30 EST, 24 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:41 EST, 24 June 2013 . Michael Karkoc, 94, pictured here in Minnesota in 1990, was a commander in a Nazi unit blamed for atrocities in the war, it emerged today . German prosecutors said Monday that they opened a formal preliminary investigation of a Minnesota man who was a commander of a Nazi-led unit during World War II, to determine whether there is enough evidence to bring charges and seek his extradition. The Associated Press found that 94-year-old Michael Karkoc entered the U.S. in 1949 by lying to American authorities about his role in the SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion, which is accused of torching villages and killing civilians in Poland. Evidence indicates that Karkoc was in the area of the massacres, although no records link him directly to atrocities. Kurt Schrimm, the head of the special German prosecutors' office responsible for investigating Nazi-era crimes, said prosecutors 'have opened a preliminary investigation procedure to examine the matter (and) seek documentation.' Schrimm's office is responsible for determining whether there is enough evidence against alleged Nazi war criminals for state prosecutors to proceed with a full investigation and possible charges. The only charges that can be brought in such cases are murder and accessory to murder, as all other offenses fall under the statute of limitations under German law. Germany has taken the position that people involved in Nazi crimes must be prosecuted, no matter how old or infirm, as it did in the case of retired Ohio autoworker John Demjanjuk, who died last year at age 91 while appealing his conviction as a guard at the Sobibor death camp. Poland's National Remembrance Institute, which investigates Nazi and Soviet crimes, has said prosecutors are reviewing files on Karkoc's unit for any evidence that would justify charges and an extradition request. Pictured: Michael Karkoc who served as a top commander in the Ukrainian Self-Defense Legion during World War II wearing a hat from America's museum honoring the war dead . In secret: The former Nazi is seen enjoying a Father's Day picnic in 2011 sporting the hat . It says the files were gathered during separate investigations into the killings of civilians in the village of Chlaniow, in southeastern Poland, and into Nazi suppression of the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against German occupation. Documentation shows that Karkoc's unit was involved in both. Karkoc's son, Andriy Karkos, has said that his father 'was never a Nazi,' and pointed to the portion of the AP story that said records don't show Karkoc had a direct hand in war crimes. He has said the family won't comment further until it has obtained its own documents and reviewed witnesses and sources. A woman who answered the phone at Karkoc's Minneapolis home Monday refused to comment when a reporter from the Associated Press made contact.

People walk past the home in Minneapolis, Minn., where 94-year-old Michael Karkoc lives . This 1944 photo shows head of the SS Heinrich Himmler, centre, reviewing troops of the Galician SS-Volunteer Infantry Division, of which Michael Karkoc became a member . One of the children who was at the scene of the 1944 massacre spoke to the Associated Press about her close call. Henryka Jablonska's eyes well up as she recalls the moment more than six decades ago when a man in a dark uniform aimed a submachine gun at her. He pulled the trigger but the weapon wouldn't fire. She lived, but 44 fellow villagers were killed when troops of the Nazi SS-led Ukrainian Self Defense Legion marched into this Polish farming community in July 1944 to exact revenge for an attack by resistance fighters that killed their German commander. Survivors like Jablonska expressed bitterness that Karkoc had a quiet life in Minnesota for all these years.

'He is 94 and has spent so many years in peace and . surrounded by his family.'

The soldiers fanned out across the village, she . said, shooting villagers, throwing grenades into buildings and torching . homes filled with women and children. A terrified 6-year-old, Jablonska . stood in the dirt road with her parents and sister amid burning houses . as the man in the dark uniform aimed at her a second time. Again, the . submachine gun did not fire. She watched, frozen with fear, as the soldier checked his gun and tried to shoot again. 'It was something so absolutely terrible,' Jablonska told AP at her modest farm house in southeastern Poland. Poland's National Remembrance Institute, which prosecutes World War II crimes, had been aware of a commander named Karkoc from old records, but until the AP investigation had not known he was alive. Following the AP report, the institute issued a statement quoting a 2005 article by one of its historians, Marcin Majewski, stating that Karkoc was 'the commander of the 2nd Company of Ukrainian Self-Defence Legion which participated, along with the entire Legion, in the pacification of Chlaniow and (the neighboring village of) Wladyslawin.' One of Karkoc's subordinates, Teodozy Dak, was handed a 25-year prison term in Poland for his role in the Chlaniow massacre, and died in prison.","Michael Karkoc, 94,was officer in SS-led Ukrainian Self Defence League and later in SS Galician Division .

It would not be out of place speeding around famous Formula One circuits like Silverstone or Monaco. But incredibly, this racing car is not the real thing. Rather than being built in a high-tech garage by a team of expert engineers, it was instead put together in a shed in Brighton by a complete novice. Kevin Thomas, who has no engineering experience, spent four years piecing together the BAR-Honda replica at his East Sussex home. Creative: This full-size replica BAR-Honda F1 car was hand built by Formula One fan Kevin Thomas in his shed in Brighton . Dedicated: Mr Thomas has no engineering experience and spent four years piecing together the BAR-Honda replica . A working second-hand version would have set Mr Thomas back around £100,000 - but his cost just £8,000, and hundreds of man hours. The racing enthusiast hand built his version in a specially designed shed, using parts sourced on eBay and swapped with fellow F1 memorabilia collectors. Mr Thomas, who created the replica without even using a manual or guide, said: 'A couple of years ago there was a Formula One car on display in a Renault showroom near Brighton. 'I went along to see it and thought to myself '""I would love one of these.""' Soon after his visit, a company called Memento Exclusives listed a former F1 car's chassis on eBay.When it failed to attract a single bid, Mr Thomas speculatively emailed the seller - and was delighted to learn there were two more also up for grabs. Office-worker Mr Thomas said: 'I did a deal with him there and then. A little while later, he turned up on my doorstep with a Reynard BAR-001 and BAR003 chassis. I paid him cash for the pair.' He added: 'I haven't just bought things from eBay, though. There's a whole group of memorabilia sites and dealers around the UK, but also you start to build a network of contacts and they know you are looking for a particular types of car parts. Bargain: A working second-hand version of the car would have set Mr Thomas back around £100,000 - but his cost just £8,000 and hundreds of man hours. This is the shed in which he built the car . Pride and joy: Mr Thomas built the car using parts sourced on eBay and swapped with fellow F1 memorabilia collectors . 'Then when stuff turns up, they let me know. I get one or two emails a week from people saying, ""do you need a new floor?"". Things like that. 'Also I check eBay religiously every morning. It's really immaterial what it costs as the people on there do not necessarily realise the value it has to you. They think it's just a worthless old control box from a Honda.' Delighted: F1 enthusiast Kevin Thomas poses with his full-size replica car . Despite having no formal training or knowledge of the race car construction industry, Mr Thomas set about handcrafting the replica during his spare time. He managed to track down every last detail of the car - including authentic suspension systems, wheels, tires, steering wheel and a seat. Mr Thomas added: 'I slowly started to plan out what I could do with the car, and it quickly became clear that it was very difficult, or even impossible, to get the right parts. I have to use what I can get, from whatever racing car that may be.' Now, after four years’ hard labour, . all that is left to complete the replica is an engine - which Mr Thomas . hopes to locate within the next few years. He said: 'I have got it to the point now where I can pretty much get it rolling, but you could not drive it. 'The wishbones would probably snap on the first bend. 'In the next year or two, when I can find more of the correct parts, and some spares, I will get it properly rolling. 'The . beauty of having your own Formula 1 car is that you can just build up . at your own pace, go to tracks you want to go to and do your own thing.'

A teacher has been told he can return to the classroom in just two years despite performing a series of sexually explicit actions with a string of young pupils. In one instance, Gregory Hallam inflated a condom covered in baby oil and asked a boy to rub it until it burst, a disciplinary tribunal heard. On another occasion, the 40-year-old talked about porn to a pupil, aged 14, who he had befriended on Facebook, a report into his conduct said. Banned: Gregory Hallam , 40, was found guilty of 'unacceptable' behaviour while teaching at Oriel High School at Gorleston, Norfolk, pictured . And an investigation into Hallam's behaviour also found he used school computers to access pornography. He was found guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' and not maintaining 'appropriate boundaries' with pupils while teaching at Oriel High School at Gorleston, Norfolk, and banned him from the classroom. But despite a report concluding that 'Mr Hallam's actions tend to indicate a deep-seated attitude that could lead to harmful behaviour', a decision by an Education Department official, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Michael Gove, paves the way for him to return teaching after just two years. At the end of the two year ban Hallam will be entitled to apply to return to teaching. But he will first have to convince another panel from the National College for Teaching and Leaders that he is fit to return. An investigation into Hallam's conduct found: 'We consider that Mr Hallam's comments . in relation to this subject were inappropriate given that he was not . conducting a sex and relationship education class and there were younger . pupils in the classroom.' It continued: 'He failed to maintain appropriate professional . boundaries in his relationship with a 14-year-old student, Student A, by . accepting her as a friend on Facebook, communicating with her through . Facebook on four occasions and made an inappropriate comment to her on . the site by saying he was ""watching porn"". Cleared to return: Married RE teacher Geoffrey Bettley, pictured, was deemed fit to return to teaching after being found with indecent images of children . 'There . was no good reason why Mr Hallam needed to befriend Student A and the . dangers of doing so are clearly illustrated by the comment about . pornography.' Earlier this month, teacher Geoffrey Bettley, 36, was sacked, given a police caution and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register after  admitting viewing sickening images over several years. But a professional conduct panel said the married RE teacher could return to the classroom because of his ‘excellent teaching’. A senior Education Department official rubber-stamped the decision, saying there was a ‘need to be proportionate and to act in the public interest’. The case sparked a furious reaction from MPs, schools campaigners and a children’s  charity. Research has shown that one in six men who view child porn go on to abuse children. In this case, Hallam was . also found to have befriended another 14-year old girl, Student B, on . Facebook and to have used School ICT equipment to access pornographic . material. However, an allegation that he had discussed his sex life with pupils was dismissed. Announcing . the ban Alan Meyrick, Deputy Director Teacher Regulation at the . Department for Education, said: 'Mr Hallam failed to maintain . appropriate professional boundaries in his relationships with students. 'The . Panel find these actions amount to unacceptable professional conduct . and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute. 'The . Panel find that Mr Hallam's behaviour was simply not consistent with . the standards that are expected of a teacher. They also say that it is . of the utmost importance that a teacher at all times maintains a proper . and professional relationship with students. 'The . Panel also say that Mr Hallam's actions tend to indicate a deep-seated . attitude that could lead to harmful behaviour, although they qualify . that by saying that there is not a lengthy pattern of behaviour that . proves that conclusively. 'It . is in part the cumulative impact of his conduct that lies at the heart . of this case. Although he has shown remorse, the panel have been shown . no evidence in the form of references or testimonials in his support. 'I . have given careful attention to the totality of the findings in this . case and to the need to be proportionate. I have also given careful . attention to the need to balance the rights of the individual with the . wider need to protect the reputation of the profession. 'In . my judgement, this case is one where the outcome should be a . Prohibition Order to reflect the serious nature of the findings and the . fact that those actions were not a one off event.' However, . in the light of the fact that the panel identified some remorse from Mr . Hallam, he said that he should be entitled to apply to have the . Prohibition Order set aside after two years. Hallam has a right of appeal to the High Court.","Gregory Hallam found guilty of 'unacceptable' conduct .

Troubled teen star Justin Beiber caused uproar when he bought a Capuchin monkey, called Mally, for his 19th birthday, and was then forced to leave her stranded alone in German quarantine because he didn't have the correct paperwork to travel with her. The instance raised the question of whether celebrities are viewing pets as mere accessories, without realising or being properly prepared for the huge responsibility they come with. Puppies, in particular, are proving popular with young stars. Britney Spears, Tulisa and Jessie J have all got one, Millie Mackintosh is debating whether to get another, and the celebrity puppy craze looks set to continue - but according to new research, the majority are not properly prepared. Puppy love: Celebrities such as Britney Spears often are seen wielding tiny pets, but a dog is a big commitment . Monkeying about: Justin Bieber was forced to leave his new pet monkey Mally in German customs, as he had failed to prepare the correct paperwork for her to travel . Despite nearly nine in ten dog-owners in the UK claiming that getting a puppy is like raising a child, the majority are not preparing themselves for the responsibility, according to a survey. Moreover, 59 per cent of people quizzed by Adaptil admitted they were not completely prepared for their new arrival, and 55 per cent said the experience was more stressful than they had previously anticipated. More than a third of the 2,000 dog-owners surveyed said they felt the same or more stressed than they did raising a puppy as they did raising a child. Owners complained of doggy damage to their homes, with soiled carpets (77 per cent), chewed items (62 per cent), or torn sofas, carpets and walls (22 per cent) cited as the main problems. Some 76 per cent of puppy owners waited less than two months between deciding to get a puppy and actually collecting their pet, while 21 per cent waited less than a fortnight. Two-fifths did absolutely no research whatsoever, and among those who did the majority only researched costs such as vet fees, insurance payments and cost per breed. Less than half looked into potential behaviour problems, and only two-fifths investigated which breeds were best with children. And 17 per cent didn't socialise their puppy with other dogs at the start, as they were worried how it or other dogs would behave. French fancy: Jessie J posted these snaps of her with her new French bulldog on Instagram, but many owners say they were surprised by the amount of work involved in caring for a pet . Three-fifths of those who did no research said they either thought they knew enough or felt they just didn't need it, while one in six said they 'just didn’t have time' to look up or ask for information. While 85 per cent used the internet to find their information, only 23 per cent asked for the help of a professional such as a vet. Sarah Endersby MRCVS, Vet Advisor for Adaptil, the pheromone calming product for dogs, said:  'It's clear from the research that owners are simply not equipping themselves with all the information necessary to bring up a puppy in a harmonious, healthy environment. 'For example, a quarter dealt with bad behaviour simply by shouting which can result in problematic behaviour as the puppy matures.' Puppy-dog eyes: They made be adorable, but pets are a huge amount of work and responsibility . Adaptil is warning potential puppy owners to be cautious when deciding to get a puppy, and ensure they leave themselves as much time as possible to do their research and make their decision. Sarah Endersby continued: 'Getting a puppy can completely transform your life and it's important to be aware of the changes it will cause. 'It is often compared to having a toddler in the house, and if you and your home are unprepared the situation can become extremely stressful. Sleepless nights, toilet training and behaviour problems - it's important to be prepared for them all! 'First of all investigate all the possible costs a new puppy may incur - ask yourself, can you afford it? 'Make sure you seek professional advice either from the Kennel Club, or your local vet so you are ready to train and socialise your puppy. 'Fully puppy-proof your home in the same way you would prepare for a new baby, and make sure you have invested in the right bed, collar, toys and food.'","Celebrities Jessie J, Britney and Tulisa leading trend for buying puppies .

Beleaguered Carnival Cruises has replaced its CEO after 34 years following a string of publicity nightmares, including one trip where passengers were stranded without working toilets for five days. Despite the media grilling, the company's second quarter profits tripled year-on-year to $41 million - but even that stellar performance didn't save Micky Arison, who is being ousted in favor of long-time board member Arnold W. Donald. Arison, the son of Carnival co-founder Ted Arison, took the helm in 1979 and will remain on the board after his departure from the top spot. He also owns the Miami Heat basketball team, and was criticized for attending a game while the Triumph crisis was ongoing. Gone: Micky Arison, the son of Carnival co-founder Ted Arison, took the helm in 1979 but he is being replaced, the company announced on Tuesday . The shake up comes as passengers remain hesitant to book cruises with the Miami-based business. But lower fuel costs and the timing of some administrative expenses saw Carnival's profit jump up from $14 million for the same period last year, a quarter which it suffered from steep losses on fuel prices bets known as derivatives. Arison led the company through an aggressive expansion that included the acquisition of several brands, including Holland America, Costa Cruises, Cunard and Seabourn. In 2003, he oversaw a merger between Carnival Corp. and P&O Princess Cruises. Today, Carnival runs cruises under 10 brands. However, Arison came under fire during Carnival's bad publicity earlier in the year when a string of its cruise ships suffered through mechanical problems and fires. Triumph: Passengers were stranded at see on the Carnival Triumph ship, pictured, after a mechanical failure saw toilets back up and air conditioners fail . The most dramatic of them was the . Carnival Triumph where passengers were stranded at sea for five days as . toilets backed up and air conditioners failed. There were media reports . of raw sewage seeping through walls and carpets. Donald founded and led Merisant, a . company whose products include sweetener brands Equal and Canderel. He . also held multiple senior management roles at Monsanto over the course . of 20-plus years, including president of the company's consumer and . nutrition sector and president of its agricultural sector. The Triumph nightmare was followed up with problems on three other Carnival ships - The Elation, Dream and Legend - all which made big headlines. Ousted: Carnival announced Tuesday, June 25, 2013, that Arison, pictured, who has been CEO since 1979 and is the son of Carnival co-founder Ted Arison, is being replaced by Arnold W. Donald . None of that helped restore . confidence in vacationers who are still wary after the January 2012 . sinking of the Costa Concordia, also owned by Carnival. In its earnings release Tuesday, . Carnival said that advance bookings for the rest of 2013 are running . behind last year's levels, even at lower prices. Bookings on its . namesake Carnival line are particularly weak. Arison said in a statement that Carnival is working to market the 'truly exceptional vacation values' that cruises offer through travel agents and other industry partners. 'We believe these initiatives, combined with slower supply growth, will lead to increased yields,' he said. 'In addition, we remain focused on reducing our fuel dependence. By year end, we will achieve a 23 percent cumulative reduction in fuel consumption since 2005 and expect our research and development efforts in fuel saving technologies to continue to bear fruit.' Those fuel-savings efforts seem to be paying off. In the quarter that ended May 31, the company saw a 14-percent drop in its fuel bill. The company spent $555 million on fuel, down from $645 million during the same quarter last year. Cruise companies, airlines and other large consumers of fuel typically make bets, called derivatives, on the price of oil to hedge again any sudden spikes. Last year, Carnival lost $145 million in the second quarter on such bets. This year, that loss was narrowed to $31 million. During the second quarter, the company took delivery of Princess Cruises' 3,560-passenger Royal Princess, the first of a new class of ships for Princess. Additionally, Carnival Sunshine entered service in May following a $155 million modernization. Shares of Carnival rose $1.11, or 3 percent, to $34.33 in morning trading, following the impressive results. Earnings totaled of 5 cents per share, up from 2 cents a share last year at this time. Revenue fell 1.7 percent to $3.48 billion. Excluding one-time items, Carnival's earnings were 9 cents per share. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of 6 cents per share on revenue of $3.56 billion. February 10, 2013 Carnival Triumph, with 3,143 passengers aboard, suffered an engine room fire, leaving the ship adrift for five days in the Gulf of Mexico. Toilets backed up and air conditioners failed. There were media reports of raw sewage seeping through walls and carpets. The ship was towed to Mobile, Alabama, docking on the evening of February 14. March 14, 2013 Carnival Dream experienced an emergency generator failure while docked in port at Philipsburg, St. Maarten. The ship was scheduled to leave port around 5 p.m. ET the day before. The United States Coast Guard said they were notified by Carnival that Carnival Dream was experiencing emergency generator problems. Carnival announced that the passengers would be flown back to Florida rather than completing their scheduled voyage. March 15, 2013 Carnival Legend suffered a mechanical problem with one propulsion pod while at sea. The cruise line cancelled Carnival Legend's scheduled stops in Belize and Grand Cayman, and the ship returned to Tampa, Florida at a reduced speed of 19 knots.","Micky Arison is being ousted in favor of long-time board member Arnold W.

Four years ago bodybuilder Justin House was lifting weights in the gym when he felt what he describes as a bang in his lower back. He was rushed to hospital where doctors discovered a massive cell tumour had been growing inside one of his . vertebrae. The bang he felt was his spine bursting under the pressure. It took three surgeons 14 hours to remove the cancer during which time Justin, 41, from south London, was given seven litres of blood. The ex-Calvin Klein model was lifting weights in the gym when he felt a 'bang' in his back. Doctors discovered he had a huge tumour which had burst out of a vertebra in his spine . But the ordeal didn't end there. Justin was prescribed opiate painkillers and after a year of taking them he had become addicted. In . an attempt to wean himself off, he switched to over-the-counter . paracetamol and ibuprofen that eventually destroyed both his kidneys. But now . Justin has been given a second chance thanks to pioneering . surgery, one of the most expensive drugs in the world, and a new kidney . donated by his older brother, Gavin. Earlier this week, surgeons . at Guy’s Hospital in London performed the kidney transplant and Justin is said to be doing well. But doctors will be keeping a close eye, as Justin has a high chance of rejecting . the kidney thanks to a particular type of antibody – usually found in . pregnant women – which he has picked up after having multiple blood . transfusions. To combat . this he has been given 108 hours of treatment over the last 12 days . pumping his blood through a machine designed to filter out the antibody . and give him a better chance of success. And to ensure the kidney is accepted, he is being used as a guinea pig for an . experimental American drug called Eculizumab, designed to suppress his . immune system. Justin, who is only the fifth person in the UK to be given the drug, had his first injection this week which cost £24,000. Depending how many he needs, the treatment could spiral to more than £200,000. Mr House had to have a 14-hour operation to remove the tumour and then spent 104 days in hospital recovering during which time he developed an infection in his leg and two collapsed lungs . He was given opiate painkillers but after a year he started to become dependent on them so had to wean himself off them and start taking over-the-counter medications instead . He . said: ‘This is a case of third time lucky. The operation has been . postponed twice before due to health complications and my surgeon has . warned me that it could still be put off at the last minute if the . blood-work doesn’t look good, but I’ve got to stay positive. ‘My . brother has never had so much as a broken bone so the first time he . goes into hospital will be to have an organ removed and given to his kid . brother. Over-the-counter painkillers caused Mr House's kidneys to fail meaning that he was dependent upon dialysis and needed a kidney transplant . ‘It’s a big thing he’s doing for me but he’s doing it because he knows I’d do the same for him. ‘It’s scary stuff but with this special kind of surgery, and with the drug, Guy’s have had a 100 per cent success rate so far.’ Following the tumour surgery in 2009, Justin spent 104 days in hospital having metalwork fitted in place of the shattered bone and he lost all feeling from the waist down. He also suffered two collapsed lungs and pneumonia. Doctors were even forced to carry out an unusual procedure in which one of his lungs was stitched to his ribcage to stop it from collapsing again. Speaking about the traumatic . experience, the former Fitness First personal trainer said: ‘The last . few years have been really tough. I do talk to myself most of the day, . in the car and when I’m walking around. ‘It’s . a good cop bad cop scenario playing out. 'Once voice telling me none of . it will work and I’ll be on dialysis forever, and the other telling me . that everything will be fine and I can still have a normal life. ‘I sob every day. Not just a little sob, but real genuine crying. ‘I have insomnia so I don’t sleep much, and even when I do I get vivid nightmares and wake up screaming.' ‘If it wasn’t for my loving family and my wonderful girlfriend, I wouldn’t have made it this far.’ Even . though Justin has to go for dialysis three times a week, goes to the . gym, and still sees clients from his personal training business, he does . manage to find time for himself. ‘I love to go to the movies on my own during the middle of the day and watch anything - action, romcom, thriller, whatever. ‘The . people at the box office must think I’m some sort of saddo going there . on my own, but I sit there by myself in the empty theatre and for two . and a half hours I’m gone. I don’t have to think about any of it.’ Mr House (right) has been given a new kidney by his older brother, Gavin (left). To stop his body rejecting the kidney he may have to take extremely expensive immune suppressing drugs . If the operation is a success, Justin . will still have to spend another nine months going back for check-ups, . blood tests, and biopsies on his new organ to make sure he is no longer . at risk. Even though . there is every chance the surgery could fail or be postponed again, . Justin is now starting to look forward to a better quality of life. He said: 'As soon as I’m done and . they’ve given me the ok to fly, me and my girlfriend Lou have some . friends in America we’d love to go and visit. We’d also like to expand . our business and open up a gym maybe. 'If . there’s one thing this experience has taught me is to live without . hesitation. A lot of the time you hear people talking about doing things . one day, but never getting around to it. I’m determined not to do that. 'I . was materialistic and got up tight about things that didn’t matter. But . I have learnt now that the things that really matter are your health . and your family.' Justin House, 41, a former bodybuilder, needed a kidney transplant because he developed kidney failure after having a tumour removed from his back . The drug - Eculizumab - costs £244,000 per patient, per year. It is one of the most expensive drugs in the world and Mr House would be only the fifth person in the UK to receive it . Mr House says that if the operation is successful he and his girlfriend, Louise Alford (pictured), will go and visit friends in the U.S.","Justin House discovered he had huge tumour in his vertebrae in 2009 .

Restaurants have taken Scottish lobster off the menu after poor weather caused shortages and sent prices rocketing. Fishermen in Scotland say lobster catches are down by 90 per cent because prolonged bad weather on the East Coast has damaged their equipment, forcing them to spend more time on shore repairing it. They have also been unable to get out to sea because many of the piers and jetties they use have been washed away by the long winter's storms. Fishermen's gear including the wicker 'creels' they use to catch the lobsters in have been damaged by storms . And the extended cold weather has forced lobsters and other crustraceans such as langoustines to stay further out to sea, as they only come in towards the shore when water temperatures rise. As a result, diners in upmarket restaurants across Britain are having to go without. Langan's Brasserie off Piccadilly took grilled lobster off the menu last week as scarcity forced prices up. Managing director Brian Clivaz told MailOnline: 'Prices went from £17.50 a kilo to £21.50, and then £25, and then we decided to take it off the menu altogether, as Langan's is all about affordable prices and we just couldn't ask our customers to pay those prices. 'The shortage was also a result of the cold weather, as lobsters only come in towards the shore when it warms up, and they are still out to sea.' Seafood restaurant Gamba Glasgow did the same after prices rose by 72.4 per cent in three weeks, going from £15 a kilo to £25. Delicious, but at a price: The scarcity of native British lobsters has forced prices up by £10 a kilo . The restaurant's owner and head chef Derek Marshall said: 'Our . Scottish lobster thermidor dish is one of the most popular items on our . menu. 'A single portion is a half-kilo, and with the shortage and price hike we . weren't willing to ask our customers to pay the 72% increase. 'We also couldn't guarantee that we would have lobster as our supplier . has been struggling for weeks, with any Scottish lobster being shipped . off to Europe.' The Scottish Creel Fishermen's Federation said landings had fallen by 90per cent off the east coast of Scotland, forcing a sharp rise in wholesale prices. Langoustine catches were also reported to be as much as 70per cent down in the Clyde fisheries area, and the federation said cold weather had forced lobsters further out to sea. Lobster creels, like these on Islay, have been damaged or washed away by rough seas and storms over the winter . Federation chairman Alistair Sinclair told MailOnline: 'The real problem is the severe weather along the East Coast, which has ruined the fishermen's gear. 'They're having to spend their time retrieving and then repairing their gear, as without gear you can't fish. 'They've also been unable to get far enough out to catch them because of rough seas: a lobster fisherman went missing last week in bad weather off the isle of Luing.' Mr Sinclair said catches on Scotland's east coast, which has suffered particularly bad weather, were down 90 per cent, which meant fishermen were suffering financially. 'Lobster is as rare as hens' teeth at the moment - we are hoping the weather will improve soon.' 'These guys often work on a overdraft, and if you can't service that, it's not good news,' he said.  'We are all hoping the weather will improve soon.' The federation, which has about 500 members, estimates overall creel fishing in Scotland to be worth about £39m a year. One fish supplier said fisherman had been struggling to catch any lobster from their boats . Andy Bell, owner of supplier The Fish People, said: 'The water is abnormally cold for this time of year and our fisherman have been struggling to catch any lobster from their boats as the lobster are hibernating and further out to sea. 'This limited availability and demand has driven the price per kilo up and any lobsters that are caught are being sold for a high price.' While it's disastrous for fishermen, restaurant-goers can choose alternatives.

A fabulously wealthy Qatari investment fund is  plotting an £8billion takeover bid for Marks & Spencer. Shares in the much-loved store rose sharply at the end of last week due to City speculation that the Qatar Investment Authority, which manages the Gulf state’s wealth, is about to launch a bid. The Qataris have been sounding out several private equity firms about forming a consortium to make a bid for M&S and have spoken to banks about loan finance. Under threat? Qatar Investment Authority is reportedly planning a £8billion bid on Marks And Spencer . A takeover of M&S would mean yet . another high-profile British company being surrendered to foreign . ownership following the sale of a list of historic business names . including Cadbury’s and ICI to overseas buyers. It would also be the boldest move yet . in Qatar’s multi-billion-pound UK shopping spree. The emirate recently . bought the Olympic Village in East London. In 2010 it bought Harrods . from Mohamed Al-Fayed. Qatar has also taken large stakes  in . Sainsbury’s, the London Stock Exchange and Barclays, which it helped . save from needing a bailout  from the British government at the peak of . the financial crisis. Marc Bolland, chief executive of Marks . & Spencer, is struggling to improve the performance of the . 129-year-old company, which has 700 stores in the UK and employs 78,000 . staff. The retailer reported a 1.8 per cent fall in sales over the key . Christmas period and is valued on the stock market at £6billion. Its shares were priced at 372.5p when the markets closed last week. That is still well below the £4 a . share Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green offered in a failed bid for Marks . nine years ago. Qatar is smaller than Belgium with a population of just . under two million, but its population is the wealthiest on the planet . thanks to its natural gas and oil reserves. The sovereign wealth fund eyeing . M&S is one of the most powerful in the world, and is run by the . Qatari prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr Al-Thani. Its purpose is to invest the . country’s  oil and gas riches in various overseas assets so Qataris are . less vulnerable to a fall in energy prices. But critics fear Qatar’s treasure chest here could give it too much influence over corporate Britain. The UK is also dependent on the Gulf state for 85 per cent of its supplies of liquefied natural gas. Outside the UK, Qatar owns Paris St . Germain football club, now home to David Beckham, and a large stake in . Swiss bank Credit Suisse. Despite the huge resources at their . command, the Qataris often part-fund deals with borrowed money in order . to reduce their financial risks. Marks & Spencer and the Qataris declined to comment.

Barclays has been accused of lending billions to Qatar just so the Arab state would plough it back in again to help avoid an embarrassing government bailout, it emerged today. The deal is alleged to have been set up in 2008, at the height of the banking crisis, and is being probed by the Serious Fraud Office and the Financial Services Authority. According to reports more than £6billion was lent to Qatar Holding, part of the rich country's huge investment fund, which then bought shares in Barclays to help them avoid becoming part-nationalised like Lloyds Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland. This investment was a critical show of support for Barclays when many were pulling their money out of banking shares. More scandal: Barclays has today been accused of underwriting a Qatari share deal to ensure the bank did not go bust in 2008 . The Qatari funding machine owns Harrods, David Beckham's Paris Saint-Germain and is the largest shareholder of Sainsbury's. Barclays' alleged loan to Qatar would be underwriting their later investment, which breaches Britain's financial regulations. At the time it would have given the impression that a new £6billion investment had been made in the bank at a critical stage, but in reality Barclays would have had to have borrowed the money to fund the loan which was then used to buy the shares. The probe comes as the terms of the bank's fundraising at the height of . the financial crisis are already being scrutinised, but allegations of a loan to the Qataris is a new strand. Last year the authorities started looking at the fees paid for fundraising deals in 2008. Barclays is already trying to rebuilt its reputation after it was fined a record . £290million for its role in rigging the interbank interest rate known as Libor, which affects how much customers pay for mortgages and credit . cards. Setting this rate low was a bid to paint a rosier picture of the bank's financial health at the time of the financial crisis. The rate fixing scandal led to resignation of former chief executive Bob Diamond, chairman Marcus Agius and chief operating officer Jerry del Missier. Former Citi banker Peter Hahn, now at Cass Business School, told the . Financial Times today: 'The concept of lending money to any investor to . purchase your own shares raises a series of immediate questions about . disclosure and other regulatory issues.' Embarrassing: Former Barclays Bank chief executive Bob Diamond was forced to resign and the bank was fined a record £290million after it manipulated Libor . Blow: New chief executive Antony Jenkins is trying to rebuild the bank's reputation but has now been hit with a FSA and SFO probe into the alleged loan . The allegation piles yet more pressure on Barclays chief executive Antony Jenkins as he pledged to help it bounce back. Row: The Qatari investment was alleged made by the group led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al Thani (pictured), but there is no suggestion of wrongdoing on his part . The FT says Barclays received cash injections in 2008 worth a total of £6.1 billion from Qatar Holding, which is a subsidiary of the Qatar Investment Authority, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the prime minister of Qatar and his family. There is no suggestion that they have carried out any wrongdoing. Investors from Abu Dhabi and other sovereign wealth funds also pumped cash into the group as part of a capital raising to prevent the Government bailing it out - a move that helped it avoid the fate suffered by part-nationalised Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. But existing shareholders complained the terms offered to the new investors were too attractive, while the fees paid for the deal are also thought to be under investigation. The FSA and the SFO were approached by MailOnline today but refused to comment. A Barclays spokeswoman said: 'Both the FSA and SFO investigations are on-going and, as such, we are unable to comment further.' Barclays said in August that Britain's fraud prosecutors had launched a criminal probe into payments between the bank and Qatar, a month after revealing the FSA's investigation into dealings between the two parties. It said the FSA probe was into the bank and four current and former senior employees, including finance director Chris Lucas.","Alleged £6bn deal helped the bank avoid part-nationalisation suffered by Lloyds TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland .

Two lesbians in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania became the targets of what appears to be a hate crime Wednesday while leaving a McDonald's. Around 5 p.m., customers started complaining to management at the McDonald's location on the 100 block of South 69th Street, that they saw two women enter the bathroom alone. The manager entered the second-floor restroom and found the two women engaging in 'sexual relations.' Attacked: A woman in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania was stabbed after she and another woman were discovered having 'sexual relations' in a McDonald's bathroom . 'Everybody should do their own thing but doing it at 5 o'clock in the afternoon in a McDonald's bathroom - whether you're female and female, female and male or male and male - what the f---?' Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood told The Daily Delco. The manager ordered the two women to leave and they agreed - but on their way out they encountered a group of seven or eight people who stared to verbally attack the couple. Chitwood says at least one person shouted: 'Get out of here you dirty dykes.' Things turned violent when someone stabbed one of the women. Reports say it was one of a group of three - a mother in her 40s and her two children. Early reports stated that the attacker was a minor, while more recent reports say it was their middle-aged mother. By the time police arrived, the crowd began to scatter, and they were unable to apprehend the stabbing suspect. Police are now reviewing surveillance tapes from that day to try to identify who stabbed the woman. The victim, 23, was convinced to seek medical attention and taken to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania for treatment.","Customers complained about two women entering a bathroom alone at a McDonald's in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania .

French designer Roland Mouret might think the 'Kate effect' is nothing to the 'Kim effect', but that hasn't stopped eco-label Beulah from reissuing the pale blue chiffon dress the Duchess of Cambridge sported on tour in the Far East. The Duchess, who turned 31 on Wednesday, wore the £540 dress to visit Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur's Assyakirin Mosque in September - sparking a stampede among fashion fans. Beulah designer Lady Natasha Rufus Isaacs is an old friend of the Duchess - and is engaged to her ex-boyfriend Rupert Finch.

Beulah designer, Natasha Rufus Isaacs (right, pictured with Lavinia Brennan, left) is a friend of the Duchess . According to the Grazia website, the relaunched dress will be sold exclusively at Harvey Nichols. But Beulah aren't the only designers to reissue pieces in order to capitalise on the Kate effect. Kate's cream silk Whistles engagement blouse was relaunched after selling out, as were her black LK. Bennett espadrille wedges. More recently, designer Rebecca Taylor reissued a blue tweed skirt suit after the Duchess was seen wearing it at a charity event in May. Missoni also re-released a blue tweed coat, part of diffusion line M Missoni, that was snapped up two years after it first hit the catwalk by the thrifty Duchess at discount outlet Bicester Village. Although the Duchess was lucky enough to get hers for less, copy-Kates had to pay the full price of £670 when the piece went on sale again at the M Missoni flagship store in London.

Whistles CEO Jane Shepherd also questioned Kate's ability to sell clothes - despite being the brains behind one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite brands. 'It raises our profile, it’s great, we get known in countries we’re not known in,' she told Grazia magazine. 'But it’s not going to turn us into a success overnight because she wears it. Fortunately, she looks great in it and it’s a great advert, but no more than that.'

Hostage: American Chip Starnes, co-owner of Specialty Medical Supplies, looks out from a window in Beijing . An American executive announced today that he has been held hostage for four days at his medical supply plant in Beijing. Chip Starnes, 42, said he was being kept captive by scores of workers demanding severance packages like those given to 30 co-workers in a phased-out department. Mr Starnes, a co-owner of Coral Springs, Florida-based Specialty Medical Supplies, said local officials had visited the 10-year-old plant on the capital's outskirts and coerced him into signing agreements Saturday to meet the workers' demands even though he sought to make clear that the remaining 100 workers weren't being laid off. The workers were expecting wire transfers by Tuesday, he said, adding that about 80 of them had been blocking every exit around the clock and depriving him of sleep by shining bright lights and banging on windows of his office. He declined to clarify the amount, saying he wanted to keep it confidential. 'I feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes told The Associated Press on Monday from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the window's bars. 'I think it's inhumane what is going on right now. I have been in this area for 10 years and created a lot of jobs and I would never have thought in my wildest imagination something like this would happen.' Scroll down for video . Anguish: 'I feel like a trapped animal,' Mr Starnes said from his first-floor office window, while holding onto the window's bars . Workers inside the compound, a pair of two-story buildings behind gates and hedges in the Huairou district of the northeastern Beijing suburbs, repeatedly declined requests for comment, saying they did not want to talk to foreign media. It is not rare in China for managers to be held by workers demanding back pay or other benefits, often from their Chinese owners, though occasionally also involving foreign bosses. The labor action reflects growing uneasiness among workers about their jobs amid China's slowing economic growth and the sense that growing labor costs make the country less attractive for some foreign-owned factories. The account about local officials coercing Starnes to meet workers' demands - if true - reflects how officials typically consider stifling unrest to be a priority. Huairou district and Qiaozi township governments declined to comment. A local police spokesman said police were at the scene to maintain order. Four uniformed police and about a dozen other men who declined to identify themselves were standing across the road from the plant. Demands: Mr Starnes said that dozens of workers demanding severance packages like those given to co-workers in a phased-out department . Captive: An unidentified U.S. Embassy employee, left, and Chinese official walk outside the closed gate at Specialty Medical Supplies plant where Chip Starnes is being held hostage . 'As far as I know, there was a labor dispute between the workers and the company management and the dispute is being solved,' said spokesman Zhao Lu of the Huairou Public Security Bureau. 'I am not sure about the details of the solution, but I can guarantee the personal safety of the manager.' Representatives from the U.S. Embassy stood outside the gate much of the day, and eventually were let in. U.S. Embassy spokesman Nolan Barkhouse said the two sides were on the verge of an agreement and that Starnes would have access to his attorneys. It was unclear what agreement might be reached, and subsequent attempts to contact Starnes were not immediately successful. Starnes said the company had gradually been winding down its plastics division, planning to move it to Mumbai, India. He arrived in Beijing last Tuesday to lay off the last 30 people. Some had been working there for up to nine years, so their compensation packages were 'pretty nice,' he said. Some of the workers in the other divisions got wind of this, and, coupled with rumors that the whole plant was moving to India, started demanding similar severance packages on Friday. Christian Murck, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said he wasn't familiar with Starnes' case, but that such hostage-taking was 'not a major problem' for the foreign business community. 'It happened more often say 15 years ago than today, but it still happens from time to time,' he said. 'It rarely leads to personal harm to the managers involved, but there are cases when it has in years past.'","Chip Starnes, 42, said he was being kept captive by scores of workers .

Most children dream of tucking into a slice of birthday cake, delving into bags of sweets, or scoffing an ice cream on a hot day. But for Finlay Doolan the luxury of sweets - and indeed all food - must remain a dream. The six-year-old suffers from a rare and incurable condition called eosinophilic esophagitis and eosinophilic colitis which makes him allergic to everything he eats and means he must rely on a drip to provide him with nutrients. Diagnosed three years ago, Finlay is unable to eat any food because it aggravates his throat and colon and makes him sick. The immune is so rare it affects as few as one in 10,000 people. Finlay Doolan is allergic to all food. The six-year-old suffers from a rare and incurable condition which affects as few as one in 10,000 people . Both conditions are caused by the body producing too many of a type of white blood cell in his oesophagus and colon. The cells’ job is to kill bacteria and parasites, but the autoimmune condition causes them to react to foods, which in turn produces toxins and causes inflammation. The severity of Findlay's condition is rare as most sufferers are usually able to find foods they can eat. But Finlay and his family are yet to discover anything which doesn’t make him very ill. Mother Vicky, 41, who lives with Finlay, his father Jason, 42, and their four other children in Wythenshawe near Manchester, is keen to raise awareness of the disease. She said: 'Finlay lives as normal a life as possible but he has his moments. 'When he’s with other kids who are eating he feels like it’s being rubbed in his face. He needs to be fed through his drip every three hours. Smiling through his condition, which sees him unable to eat any food because it aggravates his throat and colon and makes him sick . Finlay, pictured with his mother Vicky, has to be fed through a drip since he was diagnosed with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EOE), an allergic inflammatory condition of the oesophagus . 'He talks about wanting to eat all the time. We have tried to introduce foods one at a time but so far every one has made him ill. When we tried chicken he was sick for a week.' EOE is an allergic inflammatory condition . of the esophagus, the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. The . condition is caused when a type of white blood cell (an eosinophil) builds . up in the esophagus as a reaction to foods or allergens. They attack . the foods, rather than allowing them to be ingested. As they build up, . the eosinophils can inflame or injure the tissue, causing swallowing . problems. It can be treated . with modifying the diet to exclude certain foods, by taking steroid . medications to reduce the swelling or by mechanically widening the . esophagus. EOE was only discovered in recent years so little is known about its exact cause. Ms Doolan has been in and out of Manchester Royal Children’s Hospital with Finlay since the diagnosis, and she is yet to find anybody else in the north-west who suffers with the condition. 'I’ve found online help groups but everyone seems to be from down south. 'I would really love to find families nearby who we can talk to about it.' Despite his condition, brave Finlay gets on with life. He goes to school, plays on his Xbox, has a kick-about with his siblings and loves watching Scooby-Doo and SpongeBob. But he can’t play football at school because his drip may come out and the joint pain which is a side affect means he often can’t sit cross-legged on the floor with the rest of the children. Vicky added: 'We bought a book online for Finlay’s teacher to read to his class so his friends could understand the illness better. 'Often when I try to explain people don’t understand the severity of the condition or what it means for Finlay.' Finlay was always being sick as a baby but doctors said it was just colic until he was diagnosed aged three. The Doolans are holding a fundraiser and awareness day for the FABED - Families Affected with Eosinophilic Disorders - at the Wythenshawe British Legion on Woodhouse Lane, on July 5 from 7pm. There will be entertainment including a DJ.","Finlay Doolan suffers with eosinophilic esophagitis and colitis which cause all foods to trigger an allergic reaction in his throat and colon .

A Pakistani Taliban group has taken taken responsibility for the deadly attack of a mountain climbing camp that left 11 dead including 10 foreign tourists, one of whom was an American. Pakistani Taliban spokesman Ahsanullah Ahsan claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it carried out the shooting as retaliation for the death of the Taliban's deputy leader, Waliur Rehman, in a U.S. drone attack on May 29. The 10 foreigners who were killed included two Chinese, one Chinese-American and one Nepalese, said Attaur Rehman, home secretary in the Gilgit-Baltistan area where the attack took place. The other six have not been identified. One Pakistani was also killed. Revenge: Amid a crush of media, Pakistani rescuers lift a coffin containing a foreign tourist into an ambulance after Taliban militants stormed a mountain climbing base camp and murdered 11 in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike . 'By killing foreigners, we wanted to . give a message to the world to play their role in bringing an end to the . drone attacks,' Ahsan told The Associated Press by telephone from an . undisclosed location. The group claims to have formed a new faction specifically to launch such attacks. The . attack took place at the base camp of Nanga Parbat, the ninth highest . mountain in the world at 26,660 feet. It is notoriously difficult to . climb and known as the 'killer mountain' because of numerous . mountaineering deaths in the past. Death toll: Pakistani airforce personnel carry coffins of foreign tourists, one of which was an American, after airlifting the bodies from a remote mountain base camp in the wake of 11 murders at the hands of the Taliban . Drone war: Ten foreign tourists visiting Pakistan to climb Nanga Parbat (pictured here) and their guide were killed by Taliban gunmen who stormed their hotel during the night in retaliation for a US drone strike . Ultimatum: The normally peaceful, remote area in northern Pakistan has become increasingly violent and a Taliban spokesperson promised more killing of tourists will occur until drone strikes stop . The gunmen were wearing uniforms used by the Gilgit Scouts, a paramilitary police force that patrols the area, said the interior minister. The attackers abducted two local guides to find their way to the remote base camp. One of the guides was killed in the shooting, and the other has been detained and is being questioned, said Pakistani interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan. A senior government official told reporters that a large number of security personnel were sent to Gilgit-Baltistan in the wake of the shooting spree. The government suspended the chief secretary and top police chief in Gilgit-Baltistan following the attack and ordered an inquiry into the incident, said Khan. Dressed as police: Taliban attackers were dressed in Gilgit Scout uniforms. The Gilgit Scouts are a paramilitary police force that patrols the area . Officials: Ambassador of the Ukraine to Pakistan, Volodymyr Lakomov, arrives to a hospital where foreign tourists killed in a Taliban ambush at a mountain base camp in Pakistan were taken Sunday . Dangerously high: 10 tourists and a guide were gunned down in their hotel located in northern Pakistan, at the base of the Nanga Parbat (pictured here). The remote tourist spot had been largely peaceful until recently . 'The purpose of this attack was to give a message to the world that Pakistan is unsafe for travel,' said the interior minister in a speech in the National Assembly, which passed a resolution condemning the incident. 'The government will take all measures to ensure the safety of foreign tourists.' Local police chief Barkat Ali said they first learned of the attack when one of the local guides called the police station around 1 a.m. on Sunday.

Though the area where these shootings took place is relatively quiet, and considered one of the most beautiful regions of the country, this is not the first time those parts have seen violence. The northern Pakistan province was long considered to be on of the country's most secure regions, however, recent attacks from militants targeting Shi'ite minorities have made the area volatile.","Taliban spokesman claims the killings were in retaliation to a May 29 U.S. drone strike .

The Coalition turned the screw on Labour over spending last night, releasing the infamous letter admitting there was ‘no money’ left at the 2010 election. Cabinet Office minister David Laws made public the glib note, left by outgoing Treasury chief secretary Liam Byrne for his successor. It states: ‘Dear Chief Secretary, I’m afraid there is no money. Kind regards – and good luck! Liam.’ Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The letter has haunted Labour, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation’s  coffers were empty. On the eve of the latest round of . spending cuts, the letter from former Treasury minister Liam Byrne has . been pictured for the first time. Consisting . of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of . the nation’s finances, only a glib ‘good luck’ to whoever was left to . clear up the economic mess. The letter, written in blue ink on government note paper, was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Mr Laws mentioned its existence within days of taking office, claiming he assumed the envelope would offer advice on how to conduct himself in government. But he refused to bow to calls from former Tory spin doctor Andy Coulson to release the actual letter publicly. As he made the letter public for the . first time, Mr Laws claimed he had not deliberately intended for it to . be made public three years ago. Regret: Labour's Liam Byrne has said he will wish he had never written the not for the rest of his life . Lib Dem Mr Laws said: ‘I didn’t set out to embarrass Liam, but he left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. ‘I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.’ Labour MPs rounded on Mr Laws, with former minister Tom Harris accusing him of behaving ‘like the class swot’. Mr Laws told ITV Westcountry about when he opened it:  'I didn’t know who it was from. It looked a bit odd. I really didn’t regard as a big thing'. 'I only mentioned it almost by . accident at a press conference that we held a few days into the . government, not expecting – rather naively – the huge reaction that it . got. 'Within minutes of mentioning it in . front of a media audience, and without alerting the Chancellor of the . Exchequer about its existence let alone that I was going to mention it, . the whole story suddenly went stratospheric.' Money: Lib Dem David Laws revealed the existence of the note within days of becoming a Treasury minister, working with Tory Chancellor George Osborne . The decision to publish the note ahead of Wednesday’s Spending Review will seriously sour relations with the Labour party. The Lib Dems have hoped to reposition themselves as more economically competent than Labour, and the note’s release suggests they will use it to hammer home the message in the run up to the 2015 election. Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson said today that the letter was a 'stark reminder that Labour can't be trusted with the economy'. Earlier this month Mr Byrne, now Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary, admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. ‘It was a very foolish thing to do,’ he told the House magazine. ‘I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. ‘There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.’ Mr Laws was forced to resign as Chief Secretary to the Treasury - essentially deputy to Chancellor George Osborne - after just 17 days in office after revelations about his expenses. In September last year he returned to government as Schools Minister, with a roving brief across Whitehall.","Labour's Liam Byrne left note in 2010 as he left the Treasury .

Whitehall staff are being paid extra bonuses worth thousands of pounds just for their job, it emerged today. Extra allowances are given to civil servants for being good at typing, knowing first aid, being green and working late. Critics said the payouts were outdated and must be abolished at a time of austerity. Civil servants can receive more than £1,000 for 'proficient typing' under a raft of extra Whitehall allowances . Dozens of staff in government departments and agencies are eligible for the extra cash on top of their salaries. At Eric Pickles' Department for Communities and Local Government, staff can receive £144 for being a fire marshal, £200 as a first aider and £600 in a 'green allowance'. They can also be paid £3,160-a-year for being on call and up to £1,092 for 'typing proficiency'. Spending on the allowances and subsidies last year was £946,600, 23 per cent higher than in 2011-12. Spending on allowances at the Audit Commission last year totalled £1.664million, and at the Planning Inspectorate £360,885. A first aider can receive an extra £200 (file picture) Other perks available include a £2,325 ‘disturbance allowance’ for when staff have to work away from home. A separate payout of £684-a-year is made to civil servants who work from home. New staff cannot receive the extra money, which is only available to long-serving civil servants. Tory MP Priti Patel, who uncovered the allowances, said the government must stop ‘the cycle of rewards for people just for doing their day job’ She told the Telegraph: ‘This is the 21st century. The labour market has changed and these allowances must be abolished.’ A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: ‘Only a very small number of people receive these allowances, most of which do not have origins in the Department for Communities and Local Government. ‘The department had to honour existing terms and conditions for staff that transferred over from arms length bodies that were closed down as part of the Government's restructuring. They are not available to anyone else. ‘Some also address specific recruitment and retention issues around business critical posts that require professional skills such as accountancy. ‘The department is in the process of reviewing its pay policies, including allowances and subsidies, as part of wider civil service reform and ensuring good value for public money.’","Allowances paid to Whitehall staff for 'just doing their job'

A day after a woman reported finding an abandoned newborn crying in the sand on a Hawaii beach, police arrested her and revealed she's the baby's mother. Police say Keala Simeona brought a newborn baby to a Honolulu hospital, saying she found the infant on the beach . Keala Simeona, 21, of Honolulu, was arrested on Tuesday for filing a false police report. Police don't expect to pursue additional offenses at this time. She posted $250 bail and was released. She had told police she was parked at Sandy Beach in east Honolulu sometime between 11:30pm on Sunday and midnight when she heard several people screaming. After the screaming stopped, she said, she walked toward the ocean and found the naked newborn and took her to a hospital. It's up to Family Court to decide whether to return the child to her family or whether parental rights will be terminated, the state Department of Human Services said in a statement. An initial hearing is scheduled for Monday. To determine parentage, the department plans to ask the court to order the mother to submit to DNA testing. It will also seek DNA testing for the father, if a father is identified. Department Director Patricia McManaman said on Monday that the full-term, 8-pound baby was born immediately before she was found. However, officials couldn't pinpoint an exact time of birth. The baby was doing well and drinking formula at the hospital, McManaman said, while police investigated the case as child abandonment. McManaman said police were investigating the case as endangering the welfare of a minor and child abandonment. Ms McManaman said the baby was 'recovering well' in hospital. Crying: A woman parked at Sandy Beach in east Honolulu on Sunday night heard several people screaming and then found the baby crying, a police spokesman said (stock photo) She said. 'We're just very grateful this child is alive and doing well.' In 2007, Hawaii became the 48th state with a baby safe haven law which provides mothers with  immunity from prosecution for leaving an unharmed newborn within 72 hours of birth at a fire department, police station or hospital or with emergency services. No one has taken advantage of the law since it was enacted, Ms McManaman said. Human services officials are informally calling her Baby Sandy.","Woman found the baby at Sandy Beach, east Honolulu after hearing crying .

Key moment: Terry and QPR's Anton Ferdinand clash during the Barclays Premier League match at Loftus Road .

He said that while racism should never be tolerated, saying back what you thought someone said was ‘completely different’. Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle said an acquittal on the racially aggravated public order offence was the only verdict he could reach because there was no way to be sure what Terry had said.

Speaking out: Gay male tennis players feel oppressed at court and fear coming out of the closet according to Martina Navratilova . Tennis great Martina Navratilova says gay men still feel oppressed on court – and many are still in the closet. The 56-year-old, who has been championing gay rights since she came out in 1981, said she knew  that there were professional male tennis players who were homosexual – but none would go public. She claimed they had a tougher time in the sports world than those working in entertainment, where many have spoken of their sexuality. Speaking with sports broadcaster Clare Balding at the launch of London Pride at St James Theatre, Victoria, she said that there were far more openly gay women in sport than men. She said: ‘In the entertainment guys have an easier time coming out than women. In the sports world we have had a lot more women coming out than men. ‘In the US we only have Jason Collins who has come out, the basketball star. So, I don’t know.’ Miss Navratilova was one of the first openly gay sports figures and says she has gave up millions of dollars in endorsements and sponsorships because of her honesty. She received numerous awards from many of the most influential organizations within the gay and lesbian community. The Czech-American, who has retired from tennis, campaigned against homophobia in sports for three decades. She added: ‘It is more difficult in team sports as you may not get to play. But that does not explain why there are no gay male tennis players at all. ‘We know they are there, but they are so far in the closet I don't know who they are.’ Only one male tennis player has come out as gay and that was only in retirement. Pioneer: The 56-year-old Czech-American came out as a lesbian in 1981 and has been championing gay rights since . He . was Francisco Rodriguez of Paraguay, who played between 2001-2006 and . earned a high ranking of 373 in the world.  Rodriguez spoke about being . gay in a 2008 saying: ‘If you came out on the tennis tour you would be . an outcast.’ Miss Navratilova won 59 Grand Slam single and double crowns, a record 9 Wimbledon singles championships, and is one of the most successful tennis players of all time. Last year, she revealed that she had embraced playing mother to her partner’s children. After a string of tempestuous love affairs, she said she had finally decided to settle down - and loved her ‘instantaneous family’. Miss Navratilova has been in a relationship with former Russian beauty queen Julia Lemigova, 41, since 2006, and the couple were first pictured together in 2009. During an appearance on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, the sportswoman - who has been hailed as one of the greatest female tennis players of all time - said she spends most of her time in Paris, where Miss Lemigova lives with her children.","Retired champion Martina Navratilova says gay players feel oppressed .

Distress: A study, carried out by This Morning and Mumsnet, found that one in five British children suffers from 'school phobia', whereby children refuse to go to school due to emotional distress (stock image) One in five British children suffers from 'school phobia' - but only half of parents are aware of the condition. Children with the condition refuse to go to school due to emotional distress, but more than a third of schools do not address the issue. Research found that one in 25 parents of those children who experience difficulty attending school have been accused of allowing their child to play truant. Children aged five to six and 10 to 11 are most likely to be hit by the phobia, but there parents have experienced a lack of information. Just 52 per cent of the 1,054 parents polled by This Morning and the parenting website Netmums were aware of the condition. The condition often manifests itself in children faking illnesses on school mornings, used by 58 per cent of children who suffer. A further 46 per cent became ill with genuine stress-related headaches and stomach aches, while half were 'very worried and distressed' the night before school. More than a third of children with school phobia refused to leave the house on school mornings, and one-in-four would not walk through the school gates. Among older children suffering, one in 50 say they are going to school but then do not turn up, while five per cent went into school for registration then left. Being bullied was the most common cause of school phobia, with parents claiming it was the trigger behind almost a quarter of cases. A further 23 per cent were caused by kids feeling they were not performing well enough at school while 19 per cent said their child was 'overwhelmed' by the size of their school. This Morning agony aunt Denise Robertson . added: 'I suffered badly from it and one of my sons did too.

Instead, 20 per cent of parents resorted to waiting with their child in school every day until they settled, while 53 per cent talked through the issues at home until their child was more able to face school. However, one in 16 parents move their child to another school in a bid to overcome it while one in 50 took the more radical step of home schooling their child. Just three in 10 children who have been hit by school refusal have recovered completely, with 45 per cent of parents saying they still have problems getting their children to school. Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard said: 'School refusal is a devastating condition that blights the lives of both parents and children. 'It's incredibly stressful for parents to watch their children suffer and horrible for the children involved. 'There needs to be more awareness so schools realise these are not 'problem children' intent on truanting but pupils who have a deep-seated emotional fear of going to school. 'Schools and parents must do all they can to work together and ensure children are helped and supported so they don't miss vital months or years of schooling.'","Children aged five to six and 10 to 11 most likely to suffer from the condition .

But Andy Murray says he has come to terms with the fact that he may not win Wimbledon - and claims he is now a better player because of it. The Scottish tennis ace, 26, said yesterday that his failure to win the championship last year had taught him not to put too much pressure on himself. Improvement: Andy Murray, pictured during a training session yesterday, has said the realisation that he may never win Wimbledon has made him a better player . Speaking on the eve of this year’s games at SW19, the world number two warned fans he could not guarantee a win - and that he was ‘comfortable’ with that. He added that his new attitude would allow him to just ‘go out there and play’ - without worrying about letting anyone down. He said yesterday: ‘It’s still an incredibly difficult tournament to win. ‘The players that are around right now are so good and so consistent that it’s going to be a tough tournament for me to win and I’ve thought about finishing my career and not winning Wimbledon and I’m comfortable with that.’ Last year, when he lost to Roger Federer, his devastation was plain to see on live television when he shed several tears on court. Devastating loss: Andy Murray was defeated by Roger Federer of Switzerland in the men's singles final tennis match at Wimbledon last year an famously cried on the court . Among the crestfallen crowd on the day were his girlfriend, Kim Sears, and the Duchess of Cambridge - both of whom were also crying. After that disappointment, he went on to beat Federer and win gold at the London Olympics - and also became the champion of the US Open. Yesterday, he admitted that he had been putting too much stress on himself at crucial parts of matches in the run-up to the Wimbledon final. He told he told BBC5 Live’s Sportweek: ‘I can’t guarantee I’m going to win Wimbledon. 'I’m doing all I can to give myself the best possible chance. I work as hard as I can and as long as I give 110% on the court that’s the best that I can do. ‘After the Wimbledon final last year I accepted that there is a chance I may finish my career without a grand slam even though it’s something I was desperate to do. ‘I was starting to put way too much pressure on myself in the big matches and the important moments in those matches. ‘Once I became comfortable with those sort of thoughts I was able to just go out there and play.’ Yesterday, it was also revealed that Murray’s grandmother Shirley Erskine may miss him playing at Wimbledon. The 79-year-old - and his No1 fan - has broken her hip and may be unable to take her seat on Centre Court to cheer him on. Murray revealed that she was recovering from surgery after being taken to hospital following a fall at her home in Dunblane. ‘She was doing the bed and tripped on the electric blanket,’ he said. ‘I called and asked, why in this day and age, she was still using an electric blanket and she said, “It’s not me, it’s your grandfather!”'","Andy Murray says knowing he may never win made him a better player .

Slaving over a hot stove to impress dinner guests may be a waste of time if you neglect two crucial elements. The colour and weight of your cutlery will have a major  influence on what they think of your cooking, according to a study by Oxford University academics. Lead researcher Vanessa  Harrar said: ‘Subtly changing eating implements and tableware can affect how pleasurable or filling food appears.’ Eating yoghurt with a light plastic spoon made eating a more luxurious experience, giving the food a dense and expensive taste and texture . Cheese seemed saltier when eaten from a knife instead of a fork or toothpick. Yoghurt appeared denser and more expensive when served from a light plastic spoon. When tested with coloured cutlery, . volunteers rated white yoghurt as sweeter and more pricey than pink when . eaten from a white spoon. But if a black spoon was used, the pink . variety was rated as better. Cheese appears saltier when eaten with a knife according to the new research .

The sister of Josh Powell has published a book where she writes about her suspicions over his  involvement in his wife Susan's disappearance. Susan Cox Powell, a married mother of two young sons, vanished from her suburban Salt Lake City home in the middle of the night in December 2009. Jennifer Graves' book, A Light in Dark Places: A Story of Heartbreak, Survival and Redemption, was released on Monday. In the memoir, co-written by Emily Clawson, Mrs Graves says she grew suspicious about her brother Josh while also telling about her father Steven Powell's addiction to porn when she was growing up. Family tragedy: Susan Cox Powell, pictured with her sons Charlie and Braden, disappeared in 2009. Her husband Josh killed himself and their sons in 2012 . Suspicions: Josh Powell (pictured left), husband of missing Susan Cox Powell, in 2011. He killed himself and his two sons a year later.  His father Steven Powell (right) banished his daughter Jennifer after she was suspicious about Josh's involvement in Susan's disappearance . Josh Powell claimed his wife went missing in 2009 shortly after he left to go camping in the desert with their sons, who were two and four years old at the time, despite a snowstorm that blanketed the area. The police investigation led to searches of abandoned mines in Utah and neighboring Nevada, and authorities kept their attention on Josh Powell even as he moved from West Valley City, Utah, to Puyallup, Washington. Tragically he attacked his sons Charlie and Braden with a hatchet last year after saying he 'had a big surprise' for them before setting his home on fire, causing an explosion which killed them all. In January 2010, so deep were Mrs Graves' suspicions about her brother's involvement in Susan's disappearance that she went to her father's house wearing a hidden police microphone.

She confronted Josh at the family home in Puyallup, Washington in front of her father and other siblings Michael and Alina. According to her new book, her father chased her from the house, telling his daughter she was no longer welcome. Tell-all: Josh Powell's sister Jennifer Graves' book about her sister-in-law's disappearance was published on Monday . However following the family rift, Mrs Graves said that she was able to hold her head high, believing that she had done the right thing. The . book begins with the murder of her young nephews at their father's . hands in 2012 and retraces what happened from the night that Susan was . reported missing. Mrs Graves also covers her childhood in the memoir describing her parents' divorce and her father's obsession with pornography. She said that writing the book was a cathartic experience. Mrs Graves told deseretnews.com: 'Definitely it was very helpful for me. But it wasn't the only reason (I wrote it). 'I really felt like I needed . to do this to help other people to recognize abuse in either their own . relationships or relationships around them, because it's not always . completely apparent.' Mrs Graves also writes about her fraught relationship with her mother Terri Powell as she continued to defend Josh. Mrs Graves, cut her mother off after she wrote to the court's in support of Josh retaining custody of his two sons. Mrs Graves' father Steve Powell is behind bars on voyeurism charges after being convicted of taking photos of young neighbor girls without their knowledge, a crime that emerged after police seized computer hard-drives from his home while investigating Susan Powell's disappearance.

The implants, which officials say are . prone to rupture and leaking, were not sold in the United States, but . more than 125,000 women worldwide received them until sales ended in . March 2010. Of those, more than 5,000 are joining . the trial as victims, saying the executives misled them into believing . the implants were safe. Nathalie De Michel, who received the implants, said: 'We have the impression that he doesn't care. I want him at least to recognise that he made mistakes. When you fight against cancer, you fight to survive, and if after they put some garbage in your body, what's the point of fighting for life?' Mas declined to comment as he entered the . convention centre - which was turned into a courthouse to host all those . participating in the trial - in order to face the women for the first . time. Some of the hundreds of women who registered as plaintiffs at the trial on arrival at the Parc Chanot temporary courthouse . The vast majority of the implants were for cosmetic reasons. The rest were for breast reconstruction, often following cancer surgery. In France, about a quarter of the implants malfunctioned, most by rupturing and leaking silicone. Doctors and scientists who have followed the case say medical complications stemming from the ruptures and leaks appear to be limited even when the implants rupture. Rashes and localised pain were the most common complaints. Lawyers for the women - more than 300 from around the world who joined the month-long trial - say the full effects will not be known for years to come. Nataly Lozano, a Colombian lawyer who said she represents 1,500 women she says have had problems with the PIP implants, said she came to Marseille to seek justice for clients she says lack the resources to pay for follow-up care. 'I could name very difficult cases of women who don't even have means to undergo exams and know what state their implants are in,"" she said. Jean Claude Mas did not make any comment as he arrived at the courthouse for the trial . 'They know that they are dangerous implants and nevertheless they don't even have a way to know if their implants are broken inside their body, if eventually this substance will leak into their body.' The implants in question were not sold in the United States, where concerns about silicone gel implants overall led to a 14-year ban on their use. Silicone implants there were brought back to the market in 2006 after research ruled out cancer, lupus and some other concerns. In Britain, the government left the choice up to women and their doctors, but recommended that the implants be removed if there was a sign of rupture. The company ultimately went out of business, and regulators across Europe began demanding calls for tighter oversight of medical devices. Mas has said he is ruined financially. According to various government estimates, over 42,000 women in Britain received the implants, more than 30,000 in France, 25,000 in Brazil and 15,000 in Colombia. Venezuela, where PIP implants were hugely popular, offered free removals for the estimated 16,000 women with the implants, as did France. About a third . of Frenchwomen who had the implants have had them removed. Mas, his deputy Claude Couty, the quality director Hannelore Font, technical director Loic Gossart, and products chief Thierry Brinon face the possibility of five years in prison if convicted.

Shamed multi-millionaire art mogul Charles Saatchi made a show of defiance last night when he dined alone at the central London restaurant where he was photographed grabbing wife Nigella Lawson by the throat less than ten days ago. Life appears to be going on as normal for Mr Saatchi, 70, who was seen speaking on his phone and smoking as he sat outside Scott's restaurant in Mayfair.

A pet dog has saved the life of her teenage owner by jumping on her back when she started choking on her dinner. Sheba the Japanese Akita bounded into the room to help 18-year-old Aysha Perry when she began choking on a 1.5in piece of chicken which was stuck in her throat. As Ms Perry struggled to breath and thought she might die, Sheba saved the day last Friday. Pet saviour: Sheba the Japanese Akita came to the rescue when owner Aysha Perry began choking on a piece of chicken, jumping on her back to dislodge the meat . Ms Perry of Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire said: ‘She whacked me on the back with one of her huge front paws and the piece of chicken flew out. ‘I’ve got to say it hurt a little as she is such a huge dog but I can’t really complain. ‘I was at home on my own and genuinely thought I was going to die. ‘I’ve only had her for two weeks, she must have heard me choking and came running in. ‘My flatmate wasn’t home so there was no one else around to help me. ‘I . was on the floor trying to get to my phone when she came running in. It’s a good job she has such big paws otherwise I don’t think it would . have dislodged the chicken.’ Ms Perry, a tattoo artist, has since done some research into the breed of her four-year-old life-saver. She said: ‘They are quite an unpredictable breed and were used for bringing down bears. 'Thought I was going to die': Ms Perry said Sheba came running when she heard her choking, 'it was a heroic act,' she said . ‘She could obviously sense I was in distress.’ Ms Perry has since repaid the favour after Sheba got her paw stuck in a fence a few days after her life-threatening experience. She said: ‘I don’t think we are quite even yet but we have definitely got a special relationship. ‘After she helped get the chicken out of my throat she began licking my face to make sure I was okay. ‘There’s no doubt that she knew what she had done. She knew she had saved my life. I could tell by the way she looked and wouldn’t let me go. ‘I think she deserves some recognition because it was a very heroic act. I don’t know anyone else whose dog would do something like that.’ Japanese Akitas are known for their fierce protectiveness. Enthusiasts claim mothers in Japan, in ancient times, relied heavily on their pet Akitas to take care of their very young children. Japanese Akitas have been . responsible for numerous reported attacks in Britain which have resulted . in the victim needing stitches and/or surgery. Akitas are not listed as dangerous dogs under the Dangerous Dogs Act but are classed as a fighting breed. They can weigh up to nine stone and originate from the mountainous northern region of Japan. Enthusiasts claim that in ancient times mothers in Japan relied heavily on their pet Akitas to take care of their young child. In 1931, the Akita was officially declared one of Japan’s national treasures. The Akita is a large, strong, independent dog that is territorial and known for their fierce protectiveness.","Aysha Perry was choking on some chicken when her dog came to her rescue .

The Queen made a rare appearance at the funeral of a so-called commoner today as she attended the service held in honour of Baroness Thatcher at St Paul's cathedral. Baroness Thatcher was the Queen's eighth and longest serving prime minister and the former PM's  friends and allies were said to be delighted the monarch decided to attend. Traditionally the Queen does not attend funerals of so-called commoners. The only other time she has broken with tradition was in 1965 when she attended the funeral of Winston Churchill.

Rare appearance: This was the first time the Queen has attended a PM's funeral since 1965 when she attended the state funeral of Winston Churchill . The decision for the Queen to attend was made last week at a top-level Government meeting to . discuss plans for the farewell to the Iron Lady. Palace . officials then confirmed the monarch would join mourners at St Paul’s Cathedral. As reported by the Daily Mail's Royal Correspondent Rebecca English, the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, born six months apart, were two women very much making their mark in a man's world. But, Rebecca says, the Queen is often said to have had a less than easy relationship with . Margaret Thatcher, her eighth – and longest-serving – prime minister. 'Always . mindful of her constitutional role and cordial to the last, the monarch . is nevertheless said to have personally disagreed with some of Mrs . Thatcher's more divisive policies and privately expressed her alarm over . issues such as unemployment and the miners' strike.' Smart: The Queen wore a black wool coat and matching hat with triple string of pearls for the occasion . Close relationship: The Queen and Baroness Thatcher met for weekly meetings while Thatcher was in power . Upon hearing the news of Baroness Thatcher's death two weeks ago, a Buckingham Palace spokesman issued a statement saying the monarch was 'sad to . hear the news of the death of Baroness Thatcher' and would be sending a . private message of sympathy to her family. Inside the service today the Bishop of London paid tribute to this 'remarkable' woman who inspired many. She had, he said, a great capacity to 'reach out to the young and to those who were not in the world's eyes important.' He recalled her strength, power and dedication - and how she was affected by the loss of her beloved husband Denis. He spoke of Baroness Thatcher's increasing debilitation, from which, he said, she is now liberated. The congregation sang I Vow To Thee My Country before the Bishop of London spoke his final words of address. Despite fears of dissent, the atmosphere outside the cathedral was by and large very positive. Those close to St Paul's had arrived very early in the morning - some staying overnight - to secure a spot nearby. The crowds lining the streets, referred to as 'real True Bluers', gave out huge cheers as key Tories arrived - Lord Lamont and Boris Johnson - but reserved their biggest cheers for the Chelsea Pensioners and Lord Tebbit.

Strained relationship? The Queen and Prince Philip arrive at Margaret Thatcher's 80th birthday party at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Knightsbridge, London, in October 2005 . She . once told author Gyles Brandreth that the talk of a strained . relationship with the Queen was ‘a lot of nonsense' and spoke with . admiration about her commitment to the Commonwealth and armed services. ‘No one could curtsey lower than Margaret Thatcher,' said another former aide. Inevitably, after 11 years of almost weekly meetings, the pair reached something akin to friendship. Mrs . Thatcher was even said to have jokingly sent the monarch a pair of . rubber gloves as a Christmas present after witnessing her doing the . washing up following a barbecue at Balmoral without a pair. Other . sources say it wasn't that the two women did not like each other, they . were simply very different people.

Sugar hit: A 31-year-old woman in Monaco was found to have an irregular heartbeat and low potassium - and later admitted to doctors that she had only drank cola for 16 years (stock image) She had dangerously low potassium levels in her body. The nutrient plays a role in regulating the human heartbeat. After giving up soda for one week, the woman's potassium levels and heartbeat were found to have returned to normal levels, according a report of her case published this week. Research into the link between heart problems and excessively drinking soda has been conducted and found similar cases. More than two-thirds of Americans drink soda on a daily basis, amounting to 10.4billion gallons each year. However in doing so, they put themselves at greater risk of developing health problems. Soft drinks have been linked to Type-2 diabetes, obesity and a decrease in bone density which puts people at risk of osteoporosis and fractures later in life. Dental health is also under threat from frequently downing fizzy drinks. The sugar and acids in soda weaken enamel on teeth and make cavities more likely. Source: livestrong.com .

A frightening wasp nest containing 'more than a million' yellow jacket wasps has been found in Central Florida. Entomologist and bee removal expert Jonathon Simkins was alerted to the ominous mound, 1000 times bigger than the average nest, on a privately-owned hunting ground near Tampa recently and filmed as thousands of wasps tried to sting him. 'I have never seen a nest this large in my entire life,' Simkins, who has been working in the insect business for more than 20 years said. 'This is the prehistoric nest from the dinosaur ages.' Scroll down for video . Ouch: The monster wasp nest, pictured, was discovered on a private property in central Florida . Exterminator: Jonathon Simkins, pictured, said he was terrified as he attempted to kill the wasps . He told WFLA that an everyday nest might contain anywhere between 1,000 to 5,000 insects. But . this monster nest was six and a half feet tall and eight feet wide and . probably contained 'more than a million' wasps including thousands of . queens. Simkins set out to eliminate the nest, only to find himself being attacked by countless worker wasps. In his nerve-wracking video of the nest . before he eradicated it, the buzz of hundreds of wasps smashing against . the camera is clearly audible while Simkins' voice is tense as the scary . insects engulf the air. Millions: Simkins said there were more than a million wasps in the mound, which was the biggest he'd ever seen . 'I have to be honest with you, I was terrified at one point,' he told the TV station. 'There were several times that I had to pull out and get a breather. My heart rate was racing, I had hundreds of them on my veil.' Eventually the terminator - whose . company is called Insect IQ, managed to kill the entire nest with a good . spray and his own technique, details of which he hasn't disclosed. Miraculously, Simkins managed to walk . away with only a single sting on his chin. If anyone else had stumbled . across the mound they probably wouldn't have been so lucky, he said.

'There were only about a dozen guys there when I started,' he recalled. 'Now there are 1,600.' He talked to the Prince about the reduction in the number of tradesmen serving their time and the recent beginning of a turn around in the trend. Mr Alexander said: 'He said that was good to see and I totally agreed with him; you need to serve your time to be a coachbuilder.' All aboard: The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall view a new bus from WrightBus . Wrightbus won a £200m contract to supply 600 of the hybrid-engine vehicles to London . This is the second time he has met royalty after Prince Andrew visited the plant seven years ago. 'It was an honour to meet Prince Charles, he was very down to earth and talked to people and it went very smoothly and the staff seemed to enjoy it,' he added. 'After he shook hands with me he did go into the crowd of the men and shake hands with them, which I thought was very nice.' The new bus has a design similar to the old Routemaster. Route 24, which passes Parliament and Trafalgar Square, now uses the new vehicles exclusively. Transport for London (TfL), the public body that manages transport in the capital, has said the new bus is the greenest diesel electric hybrid bus in the world. TfL estimates the 600-strong fleet will reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the city by almost 20,000 tonnes a year.

Donatella Versace describes Versace's new Autumn/Winter 2013 campaign as 'stripped back to the raw power of the clothes and the models'. She says there is 'no set, no distraction', and in the case of one of the models used in the stark, electric shoot, there are barely any clothes, either. British supermodel Kate Moss, a long-time Versace favourite, appears in two images for the brand's new campaign - in one wearing just a fluffy yellow and black coat, and in another simply three colourful handbags, carefully positioned to cover her modesty. A nude Kate Moss appears in the campaign in one shot to be completely naked, apart from three strategically-placed colourful Versace handbags . A tousle-haired Moss is wrapped in a bright yellow and black fluffy animal print cat... and nothing else . With strikingly dark hair, the . usually blonde mother-of-one, 39, stares open-mouthed at the camera, . clutching three Demetra bags from the Vanitas line, in black, yellow and . red, valued at £1,505 each. In . the second shot, Moss is enveloped in a fluffy yellow and black coat, . with her newly-dyed brown hair tousled over her face, and wearing . nothing beneath the coat. Dutch artist and model Saskia de Brauw has worked with Givenchy, Versace, MaxMara, Chanel, Loewe, Fendi, Prada, Giorgio Armani and Lanvin . Saskia de Brauw was given far more clothes to wear than Moss, including this very unforgiving black dress, that only someone with a figure like de Brauw would be able to pull off . The other models in the campaign fare slightly better than Moss when it comes to being permitted to remain covered up. Saskia de Brauw, a Dutch artist and model who has worked with Givenchy, Versace, MaxMara, Chanel, Loewe, Fendi, Prada, Giorgio Armani and Lanvin, was given two punk outfits to wear: a pair of black PVC trousers and a sleeveless patterned top, and a PVC skin-tight dress. Travis Smith, Dominik Bauer and Matt Trethe are snapped much more fully-dressed - though Smith does get the chance to flash some chest wearing a patterned, open monochrome jacket, similarly-hued and chunky biker boots. Travis Smith wears printed monochrome trousers and open monochrome jacked with chunky biker boots . Matt Trethe is the warmest of the bunch in a cosy wool ovecoat, leather jacket and matching trousers . The campaign was shot by Mert Alas & Marcus Piggot, photography partners since 1995 and, with several Moss Vogue cover shots in their portfolio, old friends of the British model. The art director was Giovanni Bianco, best known for his work with Madonna, and stylists were Melanie Ward and David Bradshaw. Versace said: 'Versace campaign for Autumn/Winter 2013 is stripped back to the raw power of the clothes and models. 'There's no set, no distraction, just the provocation, glamour and attitude of our fashion. Mert & Marcus genius transformed Kate and Saskia into these strong Versace characters.'

They went out of their way not to be photographed with each other at the society wedding of the year on Saturday. But Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas were very much together as they returned to London on Sunday. The pair, who have been dating for almost a year, arrived by train at Kings Cross and, escorted by two Scotland Yard bodyguards, made their way to a waiting Range Rover which headed off in the direction of Kensington Palace. Scroll down for video . Casual: Prince Harry arriving at King Cross Station with girlfriend Cressida Bonas after spending the weekend in Northumberland . Laid back journey: Cressida, 24, was dressed in comfortable blue trousers with a weekend bag slung over her shoulder, while Prince Harry, 28, appeared to be carrying a suit . Royal carriage: Cressida and Harry were aboard the East Coast service from Alnmouth to London's Kings Cross on Sunday . Not alone: The couple were quickly escorted off the train by security guards and into a waiting Range Rover . Both Harry, 28, and his 24-yearold girlfriend were dressed for comfort not style. The third-in-line-to-the-throne was sporting a checked shirt open at the neck to display an African leather thong-style necklace, jeans, suede desert boots and a baseball cap. His girlfriend, pretty upper-class dance student Cressida, who at 24 is four years younger than the prince, was even more dressed down in slouchy ‘boyfriend’ jeans - so called because they look like they could have been borrowed from your partner. Her oversized grey wool jumper appeared to have been pinched from Harry as well, the sleeves hanging loosely over her wrists, while on her feet were hi-top white trainers. It certainly wasn’t the kind of outfit you would expect even an off-duty Duchess of Cambridge to be seen in. The day before: Prince Harry and Cressida Bonas all dressed up for the Saturday wedding . No secret: The couple have been dating for almost a year and were spotted kissing on a ski slope in the Alps earlier this year . Morning after: The couple were returning to London after attending the wedding of Lady Melissa Percy and Thomas Van Straubenzee who married at Alnwick castle on the weekend . But despite not wearing any make-up and with her long blonde hair unkempt, Cressida was still, clearly, naturally beautiful. The couple had attended the wedding of royal confidante Thomas van Straubenzee and the Duke of Northumberland’s daughter, Lady Melissa Percy, on Saturday, although they had taken pains not be to photographed together. The celebration, was also attended by Prince William but not his heavily pregnant wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, Also present as a joint maid of honour was Chelsy Davy, the bride’s best friend, who also happens to be Prince Harry’s former long-term girlfriend. The pair split for good in 2011, shortly after Chelsy accompanied him to the royal wedding, after an often tempestuous seven year, on-off relationship. If it was a difficult experience for Cressida, who like Chelsy went to Stowe public school followed by Leeds University, then the confident young beauty wasn’t telling. Jolly ride: The couple travelled back in a First Class carriage with several other wedding guests . Royal protection: The couple were escorted from the station to their car by two body guards . One direction: Cressida looks anxiously at Harry as they leave Kings Cross station to take a car which left in the direction of Prince Harry's flat at Kensington Palace . Perfect match: Friends close to Harry have said that the Prince is 'very keen' on his girlfriend of 12-months . ‘It would have been uncharacteristic of Cressida to be intimidated by anyone at all,’ a friend said. The source stressed that Cressida was still young, adding: ‘She and Harry are very fond of each other and taking things one step at a time to see whether or not there might be something more permanent one day.’ Cressida, whose best friend is Princess Eugenie, is a familiar figure on London’s social scene and is said by the those who know her as ‘bubbly and terribly, terribly sweet’. The couple arrived back from Alnwick Castle at King Cross Station on a 4.45pm East Coast train yesterday accompanied in a First Class carriage by a gaggle of other guests including Tara Palmer-Tomkinson and Viscount Jules Erleigh, heir to the Marquess of Reading, who is one of Harry’s great mates. True gentleman: The 28 year old royal stepped in as a knight in shining armour and helped his lady in distress with her bag . On the lookout: Prince Harry looks over his shoulder as his girlfriend gets in the car . Alighting on the platform, the couple peeled off from the rest of the group and headed, accompanied by two Scotland Yard bodyguards, towards a waiting Range Rover driven by another member of the security team. Ever the gentleman, Harry helped Cressida to load her bag into the waiting car before they hopped in together and headed off the in the direction of Kensington Palace, where the prince has an apartment. Well-placed sources say the prince, who has just completed a stint in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot and is continuing his training with the Army Air Corps, said he seems ‘incredibly keen’ on Cressida, with whom he was seen smooching on the slopes of Verbier ski resort earlier this year. Cressida is the daughter of four-times married and divorced Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, a renowned 60s society beauty who once posed semi-naked for a glossy coffee table photography book called Birds of Britain. Friends in high places: Cressida arrived at the Saturday service in Alnwick with 'best friend' Princess Eugenie . Society sisters: Cressida and her sister Isabella Calthorpe, who is married to Sir Richard Branson's son Sam, attend a party in London's Kensington on Thursday . She has five children with three of her husbands and one of her daughters, Isabella, by her second marriage to banking magnate John Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe (whose family owns most of Birmingham), has just married Sir Richard Branson’s son and heir Sam. Cressida was the product of her third marriage to Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas, which ended in divorce after six years in 1994. In an interview with US television last year, handsome Harry complained that girls appeared to be put off by his title and indicated he was keen to shed his playboy tag and settle down. ‘I’m not so much searching for someone to fulfill the role, but obviously, you know, finding someone that would be willing to take it on,’ he said. Clearly, however, his romance with Cressida is going from strength-to-strength. ‘She’s posh, pretty and perfect!’ a friend declared.","Prince Harry and girlfriend Cressida Bonas arrived in London together .

Relentless: The grieving mother of Gregory Spring, 17, who killed himself last Monday says he's been taunted even after his death . A tormented 17-year-old continues to be bullied even after his suicide. On the message board of the Olean, New York funeral home where Gregory Spring's memorial service was recently held, someone wrote ‘Ha ha. He died. I hope he is in hell.’ Keri Spring said her son, who suffered from Tourette syndrome and a brain malformation called callosum cysgenesis, was bullied for years and that the problem had recently worsened. Since beginning tenth grade at . Allegany-Limestone High School, she said Greg had suffered greatly. He . took his own life last Monday. Spring said Gregory was bullied from the fourth grade until his death and, it appears, even thereafter. The guest book for Gregory's memorial is still up at the website of the Casey Halwig & Hartle Funeral Home, though the disparaging comment WIVB reports was left for him appears to have been removed. In . part, his suffering was due his brain condition, an absence of the . connection between the left and right lobes, that made it tough for him . to understand things. Taunted: Local news station WIVB reports that a comment celebrating Spring's suicide was posted to the message board of his funeral home, though it appears to have been taken down . Suffering: The 17-year-old, who suffered from Tourette syndrome and a brain malformation, had recently broken up with a girlfriend and, his mother says, was bullied since 4th grade . He’d also recently lost his girlfriend. And, Spring said, a newcomer to his school had quickly become Gregory’s bully. Gregory’s condition caused him to wonder why the bullying was happening. ‘He just wanted to be accepted,’ Spring said. ‘He was very compassionate, very emotional, very loving.’ At one point, Spring said her son even pleaded with his bully. ‘There came an incident,’ Spring told WIVB, ‘where Greg actually picked him up and said, “Stop bullying, bullying isn't good. Bullying is only going to hurt people.”’ No idea: Greg's mother said her son was suffering silently. She's now speaking out in hopes others will learn from his tragedy . 'Emotional person': Gregory loved soccer, hunting, and woodcarving. His mother says his brain condition prevented him from understanding negative things like bullying . But instead of punishing the bully, Spring said Gregory was suspended from school. Once she learned of the message scrawled online against her deceased son, she and her husband decided to speak out. Denial: School district superintendent Dr. Karen Geelan released a statement saying an internal investigation revealed 'the young man was not bullied' They contacted the local news to tell their story in the hopes it can help others. ‘When a bully is brought to your attention, it needs to be hit head-on and stopped immediately,’ Spring said. Spring said her husband contacted their state senator about the need for tougher anti-bullying laws. Area . superintendent of schools Dr. Karen Geelan responded to the assertion . that bullying drove Gregory Spring to suicide in a statement: . ‘Any . allegation of bullying is taken very seriously. I have conducted a . thorough investigation and to the extent we can determine it, I have . determined the young man was not bullied. Based on information received . from the police, the untimely loss of this student's life may be . attributed to a factor or factors altogether unrelated to bullying.’ In the US, anyone in crisis can receive confidential support 24-hours a day by calling  call 1-800-273-8255.

A ten-year-old schoolboy racked up a £600 bill in three hours by playing an iPhone game downloaded for free. Lee Walters from Streetly in the West Midlands downloaded the 'Hay Day' app on his mother's old iPhone - and paid £19 a time to buy virtual diamonds and gold coins. He innocently clicked on the 'buy now' option which appeared more than 12 times an hour - landing his mother Katharyne, 42, with a giant £613 bill. Theory: Katharyne Williams (pictured with Lee) believes he was able to cost her the huge sum because the phone kept a password saved . Ms Walters, who runs a fireplace business, was in control of her son's Apple password but believes he was able to pay because the phone kept it saved. Today she warned parents to monitor their children's usage of iPhone apps to ensure they are not unwittingly racking up monster bills. 'I'm not a stupid person but this has made me feel really stupid. I'm devastated,' she said. 'It's a child's game that attracts children. It could happen to so many people. 'These people are designing these but I wouldn't allow children to have anything like that if they can spend money on it. Problems: Lee Walters, 10, managed to rack up a £600 bill on a game that was downloaded for free on an Apple iPhone . Upsetting: Even though the Apple App 'Hay Day' is a free download, it does contain options for people to pay for extras . 'As soon as I saw the emails coming through on the Sunday I cancelled my card and got in touch with Apple. The one saving grace for Lee (right) is that he is not the first youngster to amass a huge amount of money on his parents' computer. The problem is of increasing concern and it emerged earlier this year that Apple is to pay £66million in compensation to parents in America whose children run up massive bills using its free apps. Now as many as 23million people are eligible for a refund. However, the decision is unlikely to affect British families. A US legal case was triggered by a nine-year-old girl from Pennsylvania who bought $200 (£132) of 'virtual money' from three free Apple games. In a lawsuit brought by her father, the games were described as 'highly addictive' and designed to 'compel' children to buy game currency. Under the terms of the case settlement, Apple has now agreed to offer refunds worth a total of $100million (£66million). Experts say parents shouldn't  let children play with their phone if there are apps that can purchase automatically without inputting a passcode or security check. If they do want to let children use their phone, they must make sure they disable the purchase information - this can usually be found in the phone settings, and will mean anyone has to input a password to make a purchase. Putting your phone on 'airplane' mode - even if you’re not in the air - also disables all downloading and in-app purchases. 'What they don't tell you is if you download a free app, your phone holds the password for 15 minutes. 'We looked at the app and it's all bright colours and has GBP and the amount of money rather than a pound sign. 'He didn't realise he was spending money but if there would have been a pound sign then he would have done.' The game 'Hay Day' is a new farming experience app where children are encouraged to harvest crops, build bakeries and rear animals. It is free to play but the iTunes store warns that some game items can be purchased for real money. Katharyne, who lives with her partner Paul Lammond, 49, son Lee and two daughters, aged 16 and 18, added: 'Lee had only had the phone for six months and has never done anything like that before. 'He plays other games and he always knew to ask and I drilled it into him that he could only have free apps. 'In his innocent little head he was playing a game that wasn't costing anything. He didn't . 'I just want to warn other parents how easily something like this can happen.' Apple have now refunded Katharyne the money and reminded parents to use the restrictions on the game to stop unwanted purchases. A spokesman for Apple said: 'All iOS devices (iPad, iPhone and iPod touch) have built in parental controls that give parents and guardians the ability to restrict access to content. 'Our parents' guide to iTunes details the steps and measures parents and guardians can take to make sure younger players have access to the right content. 'The first thing we recommend is not to share your password.'","Lee Walters paid £19 a go for virtual diamonds and gold coins on 'Hay day'

Lisa Rennison carries about her person a photograph of herself when she looked like the big pink puppet, and calls the photo her 'thinspiration'. Lisa, 40, was inspired to lose the weight after an encounter with a too-tight pair of trousers in an Marks & Spencer changing room left her crying tears of shame. Overweight as a child, a lifetime of unhealthy eating had seen her weight soar to 12st, which at 5ft 2in put Lisa in the dangerously overweight category. Weight loss: Lisa Rennison, 40, was obese all her life - but after losing six stone 12 years ago, has managed to keep the weight off thanks to a photo of herself at her biggest, right, where she says she looked like Mr Blobby .

'It was such a horrible and difficult time and whenever I look at the photograph it makes me put down the treats and sweets and reminds me of just how terrible I felt. 'I turned 40 this year and people often say I look younger now than I did in my twenties - I feel much younger.'

She dieted by cutting out bread and . chocolate and lost a stone in a month and followed it by stopping greasy . takeaways and fast food. The mother-of-one added: 'I didn't use Slimming World, or Weight Watchers or muscle in on any fad diets. I literally stopped eating the rubbish. 'I stopped eating the chocolate and the cakes. I looked at my portion sizes and got rid of the takeaway meals. Inspired: Lisa, pictured with her father Jimmy, 58, after they both completed the Great Eastern Run, is now training to become a fitness instructor . 'Ultimately I used to eat like a pig and I'm only a small frame so for as long as I could remember I had always been a curvy and big. 'My new diet wasn't anything special; it was just a common sense diet. 'I lost a stone in six weeks through healthy eating and that set the ball rolling. In six months I was down to a size 12.' After losing the pounds she joined a gym in 2010 where sessions five times a week transformed her into a toned size six. She added: 'Looking back at the photograph reminds me of all the bad feelings I had. It's what I like to call thinspiration. 'When I celebrated my 30th birthday I was a healthy size eight and that was a big moment for me. 'Around eight years ago I started cycling, I joined the gym. Fitness was key to getting rid of the rest of the weight to get me down to how I am now. 'I never want to go back to looking like I did before this is why I remind myself daily - I remind myself how much I've achieved and how much happier I am within myself.' Reminder: After a lifetime of unhealthy eating the mother-of-one lost six stone - and is now determined never to put it back on. She says the photo helps stop her nibbling on unhealthy foods .

Caught short: It suggests that (pictured from left) Lunar Module pilot Eugene Cernan, Commander Thomas Stafford and Command Module Pilot John Young had difficulty mastering the spacecraft's bathroom facilities . Apollo 10 was the fourth manned mission in the U.S. Apollo space programme. It was designed to be a 'dry run' for Apollo 11 and tested all of the procedures required for a Moon landing. It included a second crew to orbit the Moon and a lunar module in lunar orbit which came within nine nautical miles of the surface of the moon.

Former International Space Station commander Suni Williams has lifted the lid on how astronauts aboard go to the toilet in space. Personnel aboard the International Space Station often spend months at a time in space, so effective facilities for using the smallest room in zero gravity are essential.

The toilet aboard the International Space station revealed by Space Station commander Suni Williams . Her tour of the £12.5million facilities showed that it is apparently all a case of docking and alignment when it comes to going to the toilet in space. The toilet, she explains, unsurprisingly 'serves for two functions' - number one and number two - with different colour-coded receptacles to accept each. Pointing out the number two loo, she says: 'You see it's pretty small and you have to have pretty good aim, and be ready to make sure things get let go in the right direction.' Pinching her nose, she adds: 'And it smells a little bit, so I'm closing it up.' 'Also there's a selection of paper,' she says, including a soft kind for U.S. astronauts and a coarser, rough variety preferred by Russian cosmonauts. Captain Williams, a U.S. Navy test pilot pilot who has over seven missions spend a total of almost 322 days in space, says the crew are provided with gloves, nappies and disinfectant wipes, 'in case things really get out of control'. 'The number one stuff can get really all over the place if you don't aim correctly,' she warns. Although, she adds, both toilets have a little bit of suction to keep things 'going in the right direction'.

"By . Becky Evans . PUBLISHED: . 14:20 EST, 26 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:20 EST, 26 June 2013 . The genome of a prehistoric horse that roamed the plains of Canada almost 800,000 years ago has been unveiled. It is about 10 times older than any DNA ever recovered and comes from a fragment of the ancient animal’s foot that had been so remarkably preserved in permafrost scientists were able to extract blood proteins. Dating up to 780,000 years ago, the bone sheds fresh light on equine evolution and dramatically extends the known limit of DNA survival. Scientists extracted the DNA from two pieces of 700,000-year-old horse bone found in the frozen Yukon . Professor Ludovic Orlando, of Copenhagen University, and colleagues mapped the animal’s genes and compared them to another ancient horse from around 43,000 years ago as well as five contemporary breeds, the only surviving wild horse called a Przewalski and a donkey. State of the art DNA analysis techniques allowed them to sequence 73 proteins, including some found in the blood. The study, published in Nature, showed the Equus lineage that gave rise to all modern-day horses, donkeys and zebras originated around four million years ago - twice the conventionally accepted time. The genome - or complete DNA - is almost 10 times older than the previous record which was for an early human called a Denisovan that lived about 80,000 years ago. It shows horse populations have fluctuated multiple times over the past two million years particularly during times of severe climatic change. There is also evidence for continuous change in horses’ immune system and sense of smell throughout evolution. And the findings support evidence . Przewalski’s horses represent the last living wild horse population and . reveal genes that were probably selected during domestication. The piece of bone was discovered in the frozen Yukon Territory in Canada (pictured) The findings support evidence Przewalski horses (pictured) are the last living wild horse population . The study suggests a significant fraction of DNA fragments could survive for over a million years in the geosphere. The piece of bone was dug up a decade ago at a fossil site known as Thistle Creek in the Yukon Territory. Researchers from Denmark, China, Canada, the U.S., Switzerland, UK, Norway, France, Sweden and Saudi Arabia all collaborated to sequence the genome. DNA molecules can survive in fossils well after an organism dies. They do not survive as whole chromosomes but as short pieces that could be assembled back together, like a puzzle, the University of Bristol. The university said occasionally enough molecules survive so that the full genome sequence of an extinct species can be resurrected, such as was done with the horse. Over the past few years, the full genome sequence of a few ancient humans, including the Neanderthal Denisovan genome, have been characterized.In March, scientists completed the first complete Neanderthal genome sequence. They used only a toe bone and a tiny fragment of finger to map out the entire genetic code of Denisovan man. Evidence suggests that the Denisovans, a little-known ancient cousin of modern humans who lived in Siberia around 50,000 years ago, had dark skin, brown hair and brown eyes. Prof Orlando said: 'We first got excited when we detected the signature of amino-acids that suggested proteins had survived. 'We got more excited when we proved able to directly sequence collagen peptides. 'When we detected blood proteins, it really started looking promising because those are barely preserved. 'At that stage, it could well be that ancient DNA could also be preserved. 'Our data represent the oldest full genome sequence determined so far. 'We also find that horse population size fluctuated multiple times over the past two million years, particularly during periods of severe climatic changes. 'We estimate the Przewalski’s and domestic horse populations diverged 38 to 72 thousand years before present and find no evidence of recent mixture between the domestic horse breeds and the Przewalski’s horse investigated. 'This supports the contention Przewalski’s horses represent the last surviving wild horse population.' Named after a Russian explorer, Przewalski’s horses are native to Mongolia and once freely roamed the steppe along the China border. They have since been kept and bred in captivity and have recently been reintroduced in Mongolia. Dr Craig Millar, of the University of Auckland, and Prof David Lambert, of Griffith University in Australia, reviewed the study for the journal and said its implications go 'well beyond the evolution of horses.' Dr Millar said: 'Until this study, many experts would have thought it was impossible to recover a genome from a sample of this age because of the rapid degradation of DNA into ever shorter fragments that occurs following the death of an organism. 'The decay is driven initially by the body’s own enzymes, and the actions of enzymes from microorganisms soon follow - death shuts down the normal defences that protect an organism against such fates.'","The DNA is 10 times older than any that has been previously recovered .

Controversial: Multi-millionaire financier Marc Rich has died in Switzerland at the age of 78 . Billionaire trader Marc Rich, who was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton on the President's last day in the White House, died in Switzerland today at the age of 78. He made his fortune by founding the company which would become Glencore, the world's largest commodities trader, but was more famous for fleeing from the U.S. in 1983 when he was indicted on more than 50 counts of fraud, racketeering and tax evasion. The charges could have earned Rich 300 years in prison - however, in 2001 Clinton decided to pardon him hours before leaving office, leading to speculation he was motivated by receiving thousands of dollars in donations from the financier's ex-wife Denise. Rich spent nearly two decades on the FBI's Most Wanted list, and narrowly escaped capture in Finland, Germany, Britain and Jamaica. Among the most serious crimes of which he was accused was trading with Iran during the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis, when he was alleged to have taken advantage of the oil embargo to make huge profits in the energy market. He had previously insisted that he was neutral on all matters of international relations, saying: 'In our business we're not political. That's just the philosophy of our company.' Switzerland refused to hand Rich over to U.S. authorities because of its secretive tax laws and neutral policy towards Iran, and his lawyers repeatedly pressed the Department of Justice to drop the case against him. When DoJ officials refused to negotiate, Rich's attorneys turned to Clinton, and on January 20, 2001 he granted the fugitive a pardon - just hours before he handed over the White House to George W. Bush. Critics pointed out that Denise Rich had donated $200,000 to the Democratic Party in the previous year, as well as giving money for Clinton's presidential library. However, a federal investigation did not find evidence of wrongdoing, and the outgoing President insisted that he had taken advice from independent legal experts. Couple: Rich pictured in 1985 with his wife Denise, who was a major donor to Bill and Hillary Clinton . Rich was born in Antwerp, Belgium, on December 18, 1934. His Jewish family fled from the Nazis to the United States, where Rich went to school and college in New York. After dropping out of college, Rich went to work for the commodity traders Phillips Brothers, now called Phibro, in New York. He quickly got the knack of trading and in 1967 was sent by the company to work in Madrid, where he met Pincus 'Pinky' Green, his future partner. In 1973, Rich and Green left the company after arguing over the size of their bonuses. They set up Marc Rich and Co., based in the Swiss town of Zug, whose low taxes have made it one of the world's oil trading centres. Business boomed, and Rich specialised in acting as a middle man for purchases in global trouble spots - such as Iran, apartheid-era South Africa or Cuba and Libya during U.S. trade embargoes. Rich and Green were the first traders to use short-term purchases, now known as the spot market, to make big money quickly. Buying large volumes when the price was low, they were able to control the market when prices rose. Close: Bill and Hillary Clinton with Democratic donor Denise Rich at a gala event in November 2000 . In 1983, Rich fled to Switzerland to . escape charges against him. In his absence, Rich's companies pleaded . guilty to the charges, paying fines of about $130 million. 'The . question is, was there crime, and I'm saying I don't think so,' Rich . told NBC in 1992, adding that as Marc Rich and Co. was a Swiss company, it was . legal for the firm to do business with Ayatollah Khomeini's .

His . company was a part-owner of Ravenswood, whose workers accused Rich of . locking 1,500 steelworkers out of the plant when their contract expired . and hiring replacement workers without negotiating. Pardoned: Rich, pictured in 2007, had his alleged crimes forgiven by President Clinton in 2001 . Rich had married the former Denise Eisenberg, a New York socialite, in 1966. They divorced in 1992. After that she contributed US$450,000 to Clinton's presidential library foundation and more than US$100,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign. In 1993, Rich sold his own company - which was then renamed Glencore and recently merged with rival Xstrata - and set up a new firm, Marc Rich and Co. Holding, also based in Zug. Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore Xstrata, said in a statement: 'We are saddened to hear of the death of Marc. He was a friend and one of the great pioneers of the commodities trading industry, founding the company that became Glencore.' After spending several years in Zug, Rich moved to 'La Villa Rose' on the shores of Lake Lucerne in nearby Meggen. He also owned property in the ski resort of St Moritz and in Marbella. Rich married again, to German-born Gisela Rossi, in 1998. They divorced in 2005. Rich had two daughters, Ilona Rich Schachter and Danielle Rich Kilstock.

The Guardian reporter Glenn Greenwald speaks to reporters at his hotel in Hong Kong - the journalist has claimed that Edward Snowden has handed out thousands of secure documents stolen from the NSA that will be unleashed should anything happen to him . Edward Snowden, the United States' most notorious and wanted leaker of national security secrets has given encoded files containing whole swathes of undisclosed information to several people should something happen to him. Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who was contacted by the former NSA systems administrator in February said that the paranoid Snowden 'has taken extreme precautions to make sure many different people around the world have these archives to insure the stories will inevitably be published.' The individuals entrusted with the files cannot currently access the data without passwords, but 'if anything happens at all to Edward Snowden, he told me he has arranged for them to get access to the full archives.' Worryingly for U.S. intelligence officials and the Obama administration it is unclear what else Snowden has taken while he was able to access secure files from the National Security Agency. The Guardian and The Washington Post have already published slides from the program called Prism which allows the NSA access to data on non-U.S. citizens from Internet companies such as Facebook and Google. According to NSA Director Keith Alexander, Snowden was able to access these files by creating digital keys that gave him access to secure areas despite him being only a contractor and systems administrator. Greenwald has said that he has been sent thousands of other documents by Snowden that he is pouring over right - directly contradicting Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairwoman of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee who said that Snowden only possessed 200 files. NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, allegedly has thousands of secret NSA documents that he will reveal to the public in the event of his disappearance or death as a passenger takes a picture of the sun rising at the Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport where he is currently holed up . An exterior view shows Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport June 26, 2013. President Vladimir Putin confirmed on Tuesday Edward Snowden, a former U.S. spy agency contractor sought by the United States, was in the transit area of the airport . 'I don’t know for sure whether Snowden has more documents than the ones he has given me,' Greenwald said to The Daily Beast. 'I believe he does. He was clear he did not want to give to journalists things he did not think should be published.' And in addition to the documents that have been printed in The Guardian and The Washington Post, Snowden has given interviews to the South China Morning Post - an English language paper in Hong Kong. Snowden has apparently disclosed Internet Protocol addresses for computers in China and Hong Kong that the NSA monitored. The paper also reported a claim from Snowden that the NSA scooped up text-message data from Hong Kong residents. However, Greenwald said that he was unsure of the wisdom of Snowden's revelations to the South China Morning Post. 'Whether I would have disclosed the specific IP addresses in China and Hong Kong the NSA is hacking, I don’t think I would have,' Greenwald said to The Daily Beast. 'What motivated that leak though was a need to ingratiate himself to the people of Hong Kong and China.' U.S. whistle-blower Edward Snowden is displayed on a giant screen in Hong Kong, China - it is believed he sent secret files to a number of individuals from the state before revelations were made public in The Guardian newspaper earlier in June . However, Greenwald made the point that Snowden, 30, only wanted to publications to print what was in the public's interest - unlike Wikileaks which published the names of serving intelligence operatives still in the field. 'Snowden himself was vehement from the start that we do engage in that journalistic process and we not gratuitously publish things,' Greenwald said. 'I do know he was vehement about that. He was not trying to harm the U.S. government; he was trying to shine light on it.' 'He was very insistent he does not want to publish documents to harm individuals or blow anyone’s undercover status,' Greenwald added. 'Leaking CIA documents can actually harm people, whereas leaking NSA documents can harm systems.' Departed: Snowden was believed to be booked on Flight CU 6150 from Moscow to Cuba on Monday . Where is he? Passengers queue on Monday to board a plane to Cuba at a terminal of Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. But Edward Snowden was nowhere to be seen despite being booked on the flight . Indeed, Greenwald specifically mentioned Wikileaks policy of publishing hundreds of thousands of sensitive diplomatic cables and intelligence reports from Afghanistan and Iraq - without redacting names. 'I am supportive of WikiLeaks, but I am doing something different,' Greenwald said. While the reporting of Snowden's data so fat has only disclosed wholesale telephone data, not those of specific individuals, Greenwald declined to say whether he possessed evidence of this occurring. When asked if Greenwald thought his computer was being monitored by the U.S. government he said . 'I would be shocked if the U.S. government were not trying to access the information on my computer. 'I carry my computers and data with me everywhere I go.'

Fight: Alex Rodriguez, left, has been attacked by New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman, right, for declaring himself fit to play baseball without consulting the team first . Controversial: The star sent out this tweet declaring that his surgeon believes he has recovered from injury . Rodriguez, 37, has not played a game so far this season after undergoing surgery on his hip in January. Last month he started rehabilitation at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, and on Monday he batted in a simulated game for the first time. Yesterday he revealed that he had met with his surgeon Brian Kelly, who suggested that he was ready to return to action straight away. Rodriguez wrote on Twitter: 'Visit from Dr Kelly over the weekend, who gave me the best news - the green light to play games again!' Meeting: Rodriguez with Dr Brian Kelly, who visited him at the Yankees' complex in Tampa over the weekend . But Cashman disputed the surgeon's judgment, and said that it was up to the team's own doctors to decide when Rodriguez is fully fit. 'You know what, when the Yankees want to announce something, [we will],' he told ESPN New York. 'Alex should just shut the f*** up. That's it. I'm going to call Alex now.' Yankees manager Joe Girardi added: 'I don't tweet, and I really don't follow Twitter. So I probably don't really know much of what is going on. As far as I know he has not been cleared. 'There's always a chain of command with injuries. There has to be and that's the process. It goes through our training staff, our doctors and our GM and then it goes to me.' Star: Rodriguez is paid $28million a year but has suffered from injuries and doping scandals . Rodriguez, one of the world's highest-paid sportsmen, only joined Twitter recently and sent his first message on the site less than a month ago. He has enjoyed a torrid time recently, as he was benched by the team for last year's playoffs and has now been threatened with suspension over a new doping scandal. Rodriguez is one of 20 players alleged to have obtained performance-enhancing drugs from Biogenesis of America, an anti-ageing clinic in Miami. He could face a suspension of up to 100 games if Major League Baseball officials judge that he has broken league rules.

A self-confessed 'sextortionist' from Indiana was sentenced to 40 years in prison on Wednesday for coercing more than a dozen teenagers into performing sex acts online.Richard Finkbiner, 40, admitted that he tricked the young people into stripping or performing sexual acts while on a webcam, recorded those sessions and then threatened to post the videos online unless the teens made more explicit videos for his personal use. Prosecutors allege that Finkbiner targeted hundreds of minors across the country, some as young as 12 years old.'For nearly two years, this man sat in front of his home computer and orchestrated a scheme that terrorized hundreds of young people across this country,' U.S. Attorney Joe Hogsett said in a prepared statement. Extortion: Richard Finkbiner tricked 'hundreds of teens' into making videos of themselves performing lewd acts, according to prosecutors . Finkbiner, who lives in Brazil, Indiana, agreed in January to plead guilty to child exploitation, extortion and possession of child pornography in exchange for a recommended sentence of 30 to 50 years in prison. He also was ordered to pay $70,000.In sentencing Finkbiner, U.S. District Judge William T. Lawrence noted that scores of his underage victims had not been identified. The alleged victims ranged in age from 12 to 17 and lived in at least 11 states - Indiana, West Virginia, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, New York, Michigan, Illinois, Colorado, Minnesota and Alaska.Prosecutors said a review of Finkbiner's email and chat logs showed at least 153 victims, including 20 identified by investigators. Investigators who analyzed electronic media seized from him revealed more than 22,000 video files captured from webcam feeds, about half of which depict sexual conduct, according to court documents. Targets: Finkbiner 'terrorized' hundred of teens across 11 states, said prosecutors (stock photo) According to prosecutors, Finkbiner met most or all of his victims on a video chat website that offers users random, anonymous one-on-one chats with strangers. The site says it is not for use by children under age 13 or by teenagers younger than 18 who don't have the permission from a parent or guardian.Prosecutors said the teens thought they were looking at live images of people who were acting sexually and encouraging the teens to do the same, but the images were actually recordings Finkbiner was showing them. He would later contact the teens again and threaten to upload their explicit images to porn websites unless they made more videos for his private use, prosecutors said. Confessed: Finkbiner admitted in court that he harassed teens online for more than two years . In one case cited in court records, a 12-year-old Michigan boy pleaded with Finkbiner not to upload explicit videos of him after he refused to do any more, but Finkbiner posted them on the Internet anyway.Prosecutors said the case is an example of 'sextortion,' a crime that authorities are seeing with greater frequency in which Internet predators catch victims in embarrassing situations online and threaten to expose them unless they create sexually explicit photos or videos. Foster said the case showed how vital it is for parents to be aware of what their children do on the Internet. 'I think our kids are sometimes doing things on the Internet that we don't know anything about, and it's very important to be proactive about the sites that we're vising and who they're talking with,' she said.","Richard Finkbiner, 40, was sentenced to 40 years prison for forcing dozens of teens to make videos of themselves performing lewd acts for his personal use .

Opportunities: The homemade plane, which Abdullahi completed in 2007, earned him a scholarship to study aircraft maintenance in the UK . But, incredibly, Mwangi has managed to build a plane in just seven months, working around his full-time farming job. It is not known whether it can actually fly - but Mwangi says he has managed to get it a full feet off the ground. Mwangi said: 'I built the helicopter to showcase my . talent, hoping that people would invest in me and give me an opportunity . to build bigger and better things'. But shortly after Mwangi unveiled his . helicopter earlier this year, his employer fired him claiming the media . attention was interfering with his work while police have banned him . from flying it, claiming it is a security risk.

Innovation: It may look like a car, but Abdullahi, pictured sitting in the front seat, used old car parts to make his own helicopter . Back to basics: Kenyan Gabriel Nderitu built this plane out of aluminum bars, bolts and plastic sheeting he salvaged before sticking it all together . He said: 'In any society, there’s always a subset of individuals with an interest in tinkering, fabricating, mimicking, inventing. 'At the very fundamental level, what drives them is curiosity. On top of that, it’s problem solving, or addressing gaps they see in society.' But there are a few success stories -  24-year-old physics student Nigerian Mubarak Muhammed Abdullahi being one of them. He spent nearly a year building a 12-metre (39ft) long helicopter out of spare parts sourced from old cars, motorcycles, and even a crashed Boeing 747. He used money he saved from repairing cell phones and computers. His bright yellow contraption with a salvaged Honda Civic engine was completed in 2007 and could actually reach heights of seven ft. His invention helped secure him a scholarship to study aircraft maintenance in the UK. Growing number of inventors: Nderitu used an engine which once milled animal feed to power his aircraft .

Asian powers are outpacing the United States to become the biggest spenders on defence by 2021 and are fuelling an 'explosion' in the global arms trade, a study showed. The global arms trade jumped by 30 percent to $73.5 billion between 2008-2012 in spite of the economic downturn, driven by surging exports from China and demand from countries like India, and is set to more than double by 2020, defence and security consultancy IHS Jane's said on Tuesday. 'Budgets are shifting East and global arms trade is increasing competition. This is the biggest explosion in trade the world has ever seen,' said Paul Burton, a senior manager at IHS Jane's whose study looked at 34,000 defence acquisition programmes. Weapons spending: Asian powers are outpacing the United States to become the biggest spenders on defence by 2021 . The United States has accounted for the lion's share of global defence spending over the past decade, but budget cuts in Washington, as it withdraws from countries such as Afghanistan, mean that it will account for just 30 per cent by 2021 to fall behind Asia at 31 percent. Military spending in the Asia Pacific region - which includes China, India and Indonesia - will rise 35 percent to $501 billion in the next eight years, compared to a 28 per cent fall in U.S. spending to $472 billion over the same period, IHS Jane's said. 'The big Western defence companies have no option - export or shrink - but this could be sowing the seed of their own demise; the opportunities in the East are a double-edged sword, fuelling a trend which threatens U.S. dominance of defence.' said Guy Anderson, senior principal analyst at IHS Jane's. China's ramp-up in defence spending in recent years is worrying its neighbours such as Japan, with whom it is currently embroiled in a stand-off over a series of uninhabited islands, despite its repeated reassurances that there is nothing to fear. Japan, as well as India and South Korea, are among countries being courted by weapon makers such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and BAE Systems who want to sell them fighter jets and other equipment to make up for reduced spending in their Western home markets, but such deals tend to require investment in the buyers's defence industries. French aviation firm Dassault, makers of the Rafael fighter (pictured) are in talks with the Indian government over a $12 billion deal . India, for instance, is speaking exclusively to France's Dassault Aviation on a $12 billion order of 126 warplanes and wants 50 per cent of the work to be given to Indian companies. China is expected to increase its defence budget by 64 percent to $207 billion by 2021, compared to India and Indonesia which are respectively forecast to spend 54 and 113 percent more, the study said. These countries aspire to build thriving defence industries capable of developing modern equipment such as fighter jets and aircraft carriers, and may be able to export 'world class kit' rivalling that of the West in a decade as a result of their willingness to spend, IHS Jane's said.","Weapons systems built in the East could rival Western-made devices within 10 years, experts believe ."

As he described the four thefts he knew of just in the previous two days, Ubiera-Cruz saw a man he recognized. ‘This is the guy that stole the other day,’ he told Craig as he took off in a sprint.

Anthony Weiner didn't stay up for very long. The former U.S. Congressman who wants to be New York City's next mayor had a five percentage point lead in a Wall Street Journal-NBC New York-Marist poll released Tuesday. But on Wednesday afternoon, a Quinnipiac University poll showed he was trailing  the openly gay City Council Speaker Christine Quinn by 2 points. Quinn has the support of 19 per cent of registered Democrats in New York City, compared to 17 per cent for Weiner and 16 per cent for former City Comptroller William Thompson. The Quinnipiac University Polling Institute is calling those results 'a three-way tie' since the poll's statistical margin of error is 3.4 percentage points. Fully 28 percent of Democrats polled said they haven't yet made up their mind about whom they'll support in the September 10 primary contest. If Weiner should emerge on top, it would cap an improbable political comeback from the depths of disgrace just a few years ago. The then-newlywed congressman resigned in disgrace after confessing that he tweeted indecent photos of himself to women who were not his wife. That acknowledgement followed weeks of false denials prompted by a relentless campaign from the late conservative firebrand Andrew Breitbart. Former U.S. congressman Anthony Weiner with his wife Huma Abedin in Soho in New York . Weiner is married to Huma Abedin, a . former U.S. State Department insider who was a close adviser to former . Secretary Hillary Clinton. His campaign has been based on the hope that New Yorkers will give him a second chance. Although Weiner's numbers are soft, he . would still claim Gracie Mansion if he were the Democratic nominee, the . Quinnipiac poll shows. As the Democrats' standard-bearer, Weiner would collect 36 per cent of the overall Election Day votes. Ray Kelley, who will run as an independent, would get 27 per cent for second place. City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn is in the running for New York mayor. On the same question, Quinn would still win, but with just one more percentage point than Weiner -- 37 per cent. Weiner is also under water on New York Democrats' favorable-versus-unfavorable views of him. He has a 37 per cent favorability rating among all New Yorkers, according to the new Quinnipiac poll, but 43 per cent of them find him unfavorable. In March 2009, his favorable/unfavorable numbers were 31 per cent and 13 per cent, respectively. Even among Democrats alone, fewer than half -- 44 per cent -- like Weiner. Christine Quinn's number on that score is 52 per cent. The only subset of Democratic voters in which half have a favorable impression of the former congressman is African-Americans, 50 per cent of whom have positive things to say about him. That could signal Weiner's campaign to spend more time and money in parts of the city where black turnout is high. 'Former Comptroller William Thompson’s spurt – no doubt spurred in part by his endorsement last week by the United Federation of Teachers – is the big news in this new poll,' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute . 'The other news is Council Speaker Christine Quinn’s slide and that’s more puzzling. A few polls ago, she was edging close to the magic 40 percent.  Now she’s down with the guys.' Carroll also noted that Weiner, whose online Twitter dalliances and serial fibbing made him the butt of jokes, 'does almost as well among women as Quinn.'","Wall Street Journal-NBC New York-Marist poll had him up by five per cent over City Council Speaker Christine Quinn  just 24 hours ago .

Ms Gillard had come under fire this week for posing for a photo shoot which showed her knitting a kangaroo as a gift for Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge's baby. Critics described the photos of the former leader, widely regarded as lacking home-making instincts, as 'contrived'.

Recent opinion polls showed that the party . could face huge losses in elections set for September, but that Mr Rudd . would be a more popular leader than Ms Gillard. 'I . wouldn't be putting myself forward unless I had a degree of confidence . about the support of my parliamentary colleagues,' Ms Gillard said ahead . of the ballot. While . not mentioning Mr Rudd by name, she said the loser of the ballot should . quit Parliament at the election. She said it was not right to have a . 'person floating around as the potential alternative prime minister'. Ms Gillard's announcement followed media reports that a petition was circulating among the 102 Labour Party lawmakers.

Opinion polls suggest Labour could lose about half of its 71 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives, where parties form the government. Mr Rudd had been a popular prime minister who started sliding in the polls when Ms Gillard, his then deputy, challenged him to a leadership ballot three years ago. He did not contest the ballot when he became aware of the level of Ms Gillard's support and she became prime minister unopposed. Weeks later, Ms Gillard led Labour to a narrow election victory and formed an unpopular minority government with the support of independent lawmakers and a legislator from the minor Greens party. In a 2012 ballot, Ms Gillard easily defeated Mr Rudd 71 votes to 31. In February, she threw open her job to a leadership ballot to end leadership speculation, but Mr Rudd refused to challenge and she remained prime minister. Opposition leader Tony Abbott challenged Ms Gillard on Wednesday to bring forward the election to August 3 because of the new wrangling over leadership. 'Given the paralysis now gripping her government and irreconcilable differences in her party over its leadership, will she bring forward the election date to August 3 and let the people decide who should run our country?' Mr Abbott asked in Parliament. Before announcing the leadership ballot, Ms Gillard replied that she continued to govern effectively.'I can assure him (Abbott) and I can assure the Australian people that as prime minister I am getting on with the job,' she said.","Ms Gillard announced a ballot of lawmakers in the ruling Labour party .

Closed: A strike by 300 staff at the Eiffel Tower forced its closure yesterday. Staff have complained that a restoration of the tower is being mismanaged . Thousands of holiday-makers have been left disappointed in the Italian and French capital’s after being denied access to their most famous attractions. Workers called a wildcat strike in Rome and closed the 2,000 year old Colosseum last Thursday and again on Sunday and were threatening to close the attraction once more this Friday. And in the latest economic disaster to befall President Francois Hollande's increasingly troubled government, the Eiffel Tower, the most popular tourist destination in the country was shut after 300 staff staged a walkout yesterday, complaining about appalling working conditions, low pay, and security worries. The strike left thousands of visitors grounded below the 124-year-old Paris landmark. Trade unions have been consistently complaining about mismanagement, saying repairs to the 1062ft wrought iron structure are long overdue. Renovation of the west lift started in 2008 but remains unfinished, posing huge problems for the 30,000 odd tourists who arrive every day. 'Queues and overcrowding are the result,' said one employee, speaking under conditions of anonymity. 'Meanwhile, we have to deal with huge groups of unhappy people. 'Yes, visitors are going to be frustrated that they can't visit the tower, but a strike is our only way of making ourselves heard.' A spokesman for the CGT, the biggest union behind the strike, said more were planned, and that members 'would stop at nothing' to achieve justice. Yesterday, Italy’s Ministry of Culture said it would ‘pay the outstanding arrears of wages to date from January.’ During the Colosseum closures, hundreds of tourists were left queuing for hours in the hot sun with temperatures up to 35C. American tourist Nancy Price, who was left astonished when she was turned away from a pre-booked tour told the newspaper La Stampa: 'I sympathise with their cause but I don't know why they have to take it out on us.' Roman tours guides are terrified that their groups will be denied entry. One guide Marinella Cementi said: 'It's unjustifiable. I have a group arriving Friday and there is a good chance they will be left outside with their tickets in their hands.' Locked out: Tourists were locked out of the 2,000 year-old Colosseum last Thursday and Sunday . The closure of the world-famous amphitheatre has caused 'incalculable damage' to Rome and the tourist industry, Bernabo' Bocca, the head of the Italian hoteliers' association Federalberghi said. 'In a country like Italy, tourism activities should be considered essential public services,' he said. 'While we respect workers' rights, those of tourists and citizens are no less important.' The association asked for Minister of Culture Massimo Bray to intercede, saying that 'mistreatment of tourists in Italy seriously damages the image of the country and has grave economic repercussions'. The Italian government said it had found the money to 'pay the outstanding arrears of wages to date from January', but that there is no money to hire additional staff 'because of the economic situation.' It is not the first time the Colosseum has closed shop. In September last year Colosseum workers walked off their jobs in protest against Prime Minister Mario Monti's cuts in public spending, . Restoration: Work to restore Eiffel Tower has been on-going since 2008. Workers have also complained about poor pay and working conditions . Then in December the grand monument had to close after heavy snowfall caused slabs of ancient lime plaster to fall from its crumbling walls. It is already in dire need of restoration and is due to undergo a long-delayed 25million euro restoration later this year paid for by fashion house Tod's. About 7,000 people a day visit the Colosseum - a 50,000-seacompleted in 80 AD and used for gladiator contests and mock sea battles in the Italian capital - paying €12 (£10) each for a ticket. Wildcat strike: Workers at the Colosseum say they haven¿t been paid overtime wages since January . The Eiffel Tower was built for the . Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1889, and has since become one of the . most recognisable symbols of modern France. It makes millions of pounds every year . and draws thousands to the French capital, which is the most visited . tourist city in the world. The . tower's closure is a source of national humiliation, but typical of . what has been happening since Mr Hollande came to power in 2012. Industrial . action has been rife in the face of rising unemployment, the spiralling . cost of living, high taxes and almost zero economic growth. Opinion . polls including one on Sunday continually portray Mr Hollande, the . first Socialist to be elected to power since the 1990s, as the most . unpopular president in the history of modern France.","Strikes in Paris and Rome close popular sites leaving tourists stranded .

It's the kind of electronic junk that piles up in basements and garages — an old computer motherboard with wires sticking out. But because it was designed and sold by two college dropouts named Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, it could be worth more than half a million dollars. An Apple 1 from 1976, one of the first Apple computers ever built and forerunner of today's MacBooks, IPads and IPhones, goes on the auction block at Christie's next week. It could be yours: An original Apple computer, now known as the Apple-1, which was designed and hand-built in 1976 by Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak . The bidding starts at $300,000, with a pre-sale estimated value of up to $500,000. 'This is a piece of history that made a difference in the world, it's where the computer revolution started,' said Ted Perry, a retired school psychologist who owns the old Apple and has kept it stashed away in a cardboard box at his home outside Sacramento, California. The 11-by-14 green piece of plastic covered with a grid of memory chips above a labyrinth of wires was one of the first 25 such computer elements, and sold for $666.66. About 200 were made but most have disappeared or been discarded. Various estimates put the number known to still exist from about 30 to 50. They came with eight kilobytes of memory — a million times less than the average computer today. It doesn't come with iTunes: Christie's expects it to attract a winning bid of between $300,000 and $500,000 . Vintage Apple products have become an especially hot item since Jobs' death in October 2011, surrounding the mystique attached to this entrepreneur who joined forces with Wozniak to build computer prototypes in a California garage. Another Apple 1 was sold last month for a record $671,400 by a German auction house, breaking a previous record of $640,000 set in November. Sotheby's sold one last year for $374,500. 'This is the seed from which the entire orchard grew, and without this, there would be no Apple,' said Stephen A. Edwards, professor of computer science at Columbia University. 'I've been shocked auction prices got into the six digits. The market has just gone crazy.' The latest auction at Christie's, 'First Bytes: Iconic Technology from the Twentieth Century,' is being conducted online only from June 24 to July 9. The Apple 1 is to be displayed starting Monday at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, south of San Francisco. Computing history: Ted Perry, owner of the Apple 1 computer displayed, points to the signature of Steve Wozniak. An Apple 1 from 1976, one of the first Apple computers ever built goes on the auction block at Christie's next week . Up for auction: Ted Perry, acquired his Apple 1 computer back in either 1979 or 1980, as a secondhand item he saw advertised and traded for some of his other computer equipped for it paying nothing for the Apple 1 computer . Limited edition: Only about 200 Apple 1 computers were ever built by Wozniak and Jobs . Perry, 70, acquired his Apple 1 in either 1979 or 1980, as a secondhand item he saw advertised. He paid nothing for it; it was a swap with the owner. 'I traded some other computer equipment I had for the Apple 1,' he said. At the time, he was working as a psychologist in a school in Carmichael, a town near Sacramento. While observing special needs children, he noticed that a teletype machine 'made a huge difference' in how a deaf boy using it responded and learned. Good value? $500,000 could buy you 250 MacBook Pros . As the first computers came on the market, Perry learned to program them. Then he approached Wozniak, who agreed to provide what the psychologist calls Apple's 'internal code' so he could create interactive lessons for his students using the new technology. An expert hired by Christie's recently came to Perry's home to examine the old Apple and try to turn it on. Only the Apple motherboard is original. A keyboard, monitor and a storage device — in this case a portable cassette tape deck — were added later. 'I was a little afraid to run it, but it still works, with the original chips!' he says.","The first Apple computer is now 37 years old .

Doesn't court publicity: The artist said she and Andy usually avoid the limelight . The 25-year-old may have carried a designer bag but she is known for her love of the British High Street, often wearing garments from Topshop and Hobbs to Andy's matches. Kim was joined by Andy's father, Will, while his mother, Judy, and Andy's best friend, Ross Hutchins, 28, who is currently battling cancer, were also there offering their support.

As he was on court one rather the centre court today those in the royal box, including Michael and Carole Middleton and Olympian Mo Farah, were not able to cheer him on.

South African-born golfer Gary Player is one of the 21 athletes who will strip down for ESPN Magazine's 2013 Body Issue. Not only is the 77-year-old the oldest one in this year's bunch - which includes 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, tennis star John Isner and Wizards point guard John Wall - but he is also officially the oldest athlete ever to to pose nude for the special edition. The nine-time grand slam champion's appearance in the magazine serves to remind readers that physical fitness is not reserved exclusively for the young. Gary bares all: South African golf pro Gary Player, 77, will be the oldest of 21 athletes to pose nude for ESPN Magazine's 2013 Body Issue . The golfer, who earned the nickname Mr Fitness in the Fifties, took to Twitter to share his excitement about the upcoming magazine. 'I was at first hesitant,' he wrote. 'But @ESPNmag's Body Issue celebrates the human body. No matter what your age, we should all look after ourselves!' Mr Player, who has six children and 21 grandchildren with his wife of 56 years, VIvienne Verwey, began playing golf professionally in 1953. Famous for his intense workout regime, which includes 1,000 sit-ups a day, the golfer has been training particularly hard for the upcoming shoot, according to Golf Digest. Mr Player is often credited for making intense physical fitness an integral part of golfing. 'When other players first saw my weight-training program back in the 1950s, they thought I was crazy,' he told the magazine in 2011. Olden days: Mr Player (pictured in the 1970s) has always been known for his intense physical workout - which apparently includes 1,000 sit-ups a day . Family man: Mr Player has been married to his wife Vivienne (pictured in April 1961) for 56 years. The couple have six children and 21 grandchildren together . 'In fact, lifting weights has made me a better golfer.' Mr Player explained in the same interview that his older brother Ian, now a notable environmental educator, first instigated his passion for exercise when he was eight years old. 'Today I'm about as fit as a 75-year-old man can be,' he said. 'The secret is commitment. It cannot be a fad. Even if your exercise program is small, you must make it a part of your life.' Another important part of Mr Player's life is his family; in the early days of his career the golfer was known to bring his wife, six children, nanny and a tutor along with him to each tournament. Winning days: The golfer (pictured in 1959, after winning the British Open at Muirfield in Scotland) was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1974 . Staying strong: 'The secret is commitment,' the father-of-six (in Augusta, Georgia, circa 1960s) has said about fitness. 'It cannot be a fad.

A kindergarten teacher from Virginia pleaded guilty Tuesday in Franklin County to trying to have her ex-husband assassinated. Angela Nolen, wearing an orange jail-issued jumpsuit, wiped away tears during the sentencing hearing in Franklin County Circuit Court. She pleaded guilty to solicit to commit murder. Police say the 47-year-old Sontag Elementary School teacher paid an undercover state police agent $4,000 to kill Paul Strickler, 64, a retired school administrator. She planned to pay another $4,000 after her ex-husband was killed. Court records show Nolen and Strickler were granted a divorce in December 2012. Admission of guilt: Angela Nolen, a teacher at Sontag Elementary School in Rocky Mount, Va., pleaded guilty to hiring a hit man to kill her ex-husband Paul Strickler, 64. She accused him of abusing her and their daughter . Nolen had been scheduled to stand trial in July. She faces up to 40 years in prison when she is sentenced August 9. Her attorney, David Furrow, said in court that he plans to call in a number of witnesses to testify on his client's behalf, Roanoke Times reported. A . co-defendant, school nurse Cathy Bennett, 37, of Rocky Mount, has been . charged with conspiracy for allegedly helping Nolen in her plot. Bennett remains free after posting $75,000 bond in February. Her trial is set for July 15. Nolen was arrested in February and charged . with solicitation to commit murder on her ex-husband, Paul Strickler. However, her plan unraveled as the kindergarten teacher hired an . undercover state police officer. Punishment: Nolen (center), 47, could face up to 40 years in prison when she is sentenced next month . The teacher told the man she believed . to be an assassin that her ex-husband posed danger to her and their . child, and said she wanted 'something that would eliminate him from this . earth without me being in fear constantly.' By all accounts, the couple's decade-long relationship had been a turbulent one, marked by allegations of infidelity and violence. Strickler told the paper that they were trying to work out plans so that Nolen could buy him out of their home. After . Mr Strickler was alerted by state police that Nolen had allegedly put a . price on his head, he speculated that if he was dead, his ex-wife would . not have to pay him a dime for the house. Grave crime: Nolen, left, a kindergarten teacher, was arrested in February and charged with soliciting a hit man; her friend and school nurse Cathy Warren Bennett was charged as being an accomplice . Murder for hire: Cathy Warren Bennett, left, 37, of Rocky Mount, speaks with her attorney at her bond hearing today; Bennett was charged with aiding in a murder-for-hire plot . Nolen was granted full custody of their adopted 7-year-old daughter and . later obtained an order of protection that barred the girl's father from . having any contact with her. The . woman had initially approached a co-worker identified as Sharon . Williams about her plan to have her ex-husband killed, and Williams then . called police and arranged for Nolen to contact Sgt. J.G. Blankenship, . who called himself 'Greg,' The Franklin News-Post reported. The law enforcement agent secretly recorded his February 19 conversation with . Nolen, which the woman's attorney introduced this week as evidence. The . transcript of the officer's chat with the woman reveals that Strickler . had allegedly abused both her and their child, and she was afraid for . her life. ‘I lay awake . at night with a knife in one hand and a phone in the other hand, . listening for any sound,” Nolen says. ‘There’s a two-year protective . order in place that doesn’t do me any good if he comes to my house in . the middle of the night.’ On . the recording, 'Greg' proposes that Nolen pay him $10,000 for killing . her husband but later settles on $8,000, asking Nolen to pay him half of . the sum upfront. Support: Cathy Warren Bennett's family sits in the Franklin County District courtroom before Bennett's bond hearing today in Virginia . Nolen then leaves to go the bank and returns 20 minutes later with the money. 'Greg' could be heard asking Nolen if she wants her former spouse 'really . messed up' and aware that she was the one who had put the hit on him, . but Nolen rejects the offer. Throughout . their conversation, the undercover officer repeatedly reminds Nolen . that once they agree on the terms of the contract, there will be no . going back. 'You’re going to be able to live with this?' he asks her. 'Yes,' Nolen replies. 'I have a child who continues to have nightmares about daddy breaking in and killing mommy.'","Angela Nolen 47, could face up to 40 years in prison when she is sentenced next month .

Inspired: Tiffany Beveridge's Pinterest page My Imaginary Well Dressed . Toddler Daughter focuses on the adventures of Quinoa, the couture-clad . little girl she never had . Nonchalant: Quinoa and friends manage to look fashionably bored in every shot . Elsewhere, a photo of Quinoa dressed in hotpants, waistcoat and a slouchy beanie hat looking forlornly into the distance is accompanied by the comment: 'One time, when Quinoa and I got separated in a busy train station, she thankfully remembered our safety training: stay in one place, look spectacular and don't talk to poor people.' The brains behind the blog, Australian writer and aspiring novelist Tiffany Beveridge, said the idea came about after she became frustrated looking at all the beautiful girls' clothing available to buy - but with two sons, she didn't have a daughter to indulge in. So she invented one - and made her the most nonchalantly high fashion, cooler-than-thou child she could muster up. The results are hilarious - and have already gained Tiffany thousands of followers on her MIWDTD page. Tiffany tells Hillary Manton on her blog that MIWDTD started 'very organically' a year and a half ago. Funny: 'Quinoa loves her friend Hugo, but wishes that he didn't try quite so hard,' and 'Know what really gets Quinoa down in the dumps? Pleather' 'I kept seeing cute things on Pinterest for girls, but felt I had no claim to them since I only have boys,' she said. 'Then I thought, why not? After all, Pinterest is really just an adult Fantasy Land. So I named the board for my imaginary daughter and started re-pinning clothes from friends that I thought were cute and fun. 'And then I guess my sense of humor . got the better of me. I mean, come on, if I'm going to spend time . dressing an imaginary daughter on Pinterest, why not go all the way?

Fantasy . land: Tiffany says the page came about organically, and actually . started as a moodboard for her to post the little girls' clothes she . loved but, as she has two sons, could not buy . But Tiffany says she found it a natural place to tell a story - and says the use of humour works well in the medium. 'I think Pinterest has always been about story telling, just maybe not in the way that I’ve done,' she said. 'Take a look at someone’s Pinterest boards and you’ll get a good idea about who they are, about their dreams and wishes - it tells a story about them. I hadn’t realised at the time that what I was doing was such a new concept, but judging from the response, I think it’s shown to be a great medium for creating a story. As for that name - which you could well imagine cropping up in the next batch of celebrity babies - Tiffany says she came to the name of her daughter after noticing that quinoa was cropping up in endless recipes over Pinterest. 'I remember thinking how funny it was that a grain had become trendy,' Tiffany says. 'Like, so trendy somebody was probably going to name their kid Quinoa. And then I realised that person would be me.' Parody: The name Quinoa was created after Tiffany noticed the grain had become so fashionable someone was bounded to give it to their child as a name - then realised it was going to be her . Familiar face: Five-year-old Instagram style icon Alonso Mateo makes it onto Quinoa's page as discerning friend Ridley . 'Friends, I'd like to introduce you to someone very special--my imaginary well-dressed toddler daughter.

The quickening of your heartbeat. The blood coursing through your veins. Your brain wobbling in your skull. Even the swivelling of your eyes in their sockets. Then imagine not being able to turn those sounds off. Ever. Well that was the daily torture for Julie Redfern whose hearing became so acute it amplified sounds that are normally never heard. Julie Redfern, 47, suffers from superior canal dehiscence syndrome which means she can hear noises inside her body exceptionally loudly. The condition is caused by thinning of the temporal bone in the skull . She had to give up dining in restaurants with friends because she couldn’t hear a word they said over the sound of her own chewing. Mrs Redfern, 47, also had to cut out crunchy foods like apples and crisps because of the deafening noise in her head as she ate. Her job as a receptionist became an ordeal because when the phone rang on her desk the vibrations would make her eyeballs audibly shake. But after seven years of suffering she may finally be able to cut out the sounds thanks to pioneering surgery to plug up her acute hearing. Mrs Redfern from Padiham, Lancashire, said she first noticed the condition shortly after her 40th birthday as she sat playing the computer game Tetris and heard a strange squeaking noise as she followed the bricks from side to side, before realising it was her eyes. She said: ‘I remember it like it was yesterday. I was playing on the game and I thought “What’s that noise?” – then I realised that it was my eyeballs. Every time the block moved and I followed it with my eyes I could hear them squeaking. It was a horrible sensation, I could literally hear them moving, scratching, it was very weird.’ When her husband, Martin, came home she asked him if he could hear his own eyeballs. Mrs Redfern can hear her eyeballs move in their sockets, her heart beat, her brain wobble and her body fluids swish around . SCDS was first discovered in 1998 and causes vertigo, hypersensitivity to noises and the sense that stationary objects are moving. The condition is caused by a hole in the temporal bone. This bone should cover and protect the inner ear but in SCDS, the inner ear is exposed to more vibrations. This can develop from a trauma or slowly over time as a result of the pressure placed on the bone by a part of the brain called the temporal lobe. The average age of diagnosis is 45 and it is believed that one to two per cent of the population have an abnormally thin bone covering the superior canal. Some people with the condition control their symptoms by avoiding the situations that distress them. However, other people require surgery to treat the problem. She said: ‘He looked at me very strangely. I thought I was going mad. I started asking people if they could hear theirs but no one could. ‘The doctors just said “It’s your age, when you get to 40 these things happen”. I thought I can’t put up with this forever, I knew something wasn’t right. 'I could hear things that were louder than they should have been, I could hear myself swallowing and my voice echoing. ‘Everything moving in my head sounded as though it was swishing away. I would be stood in the queue at the supermarket and I’d start  to sway, I felt drunk without having a drink.’ Eventually she read about a man who was suffering from the exact same symptoms so she photocopied the article and went to her doctor. She was referred to Manchester Royal Infirmary where she had a scan and was told she was suffering from superior canal dehiscence syndrome (SCDS). SCDS is a rare medical condition of the inner ear caused by a thinning or honeycombing of a bone in the ear, which causes over-sensitivity to sound. Dr Gerald Brookes, a consultant neuro-otologist and skull base surgeon at the The Harley Street ENT Clinic in London, said: ‘Some people may be born with missing bone, or very thin bone, which “dissolves” with increasing age or may be damaged by a blow to the head. She has a theory that the condition developed as a result of a bike crash she had when she was 24 (pictured). Doctors initially put her symptoms down to her age as she started to notice them shortly after her 40th birthday . ‘The condition was only recognised relatively recently in 1998. Patients may complain of various odd and seemingly bizarre symptoms, and may even be considered to be suffering from a possible  psychiatric ailment until the  true diagnosis is made.’ Mrs Redfern said fluid was leaking from the superior canal in her ear and turning the bone into a honeycomb that amplified sounds in her body. She said: ‘The surgeon opened me up like a book just behind my ear and described the inside of it like honeycomb instead of being like cinder toffee because of the holes.’ Mrs Redfern (pictured on her wedding day in 1994) says that when she first told her husband, Martin, about the sounds she was hearing, he looked at her very strangely and she feared she was going mad . Then, during a complex five-hour operation which carried the risks of deafness, the surgeon had to fill in the holes on the bones to stop the sound travelling through them. Mrs Redfern said: ‘Even though there were risks I had to have it done, I couldn’t have coped with it for another 40 years, seven was enough.’ After having one ear done she is now aiming to have her second ear operated on which will hopefully lead to a complete cure. ‘I know when I have the other ear done I’ll be cured,’ she said. ‘But you never know I might miss not hearing all these strange little things.’ Mrs Redfern has had an operation to fill in the holes in her temporal bone but she will require another operation to cure the problem. She had the surgery despite the risk of deafness and facial deformity . Her surgeon said that he had only performed the operation four times before as the condition is so rare. Mrs Redfern is pictured in December 2012, days after the surgery .","Julie Redfern, 47, suffers from superior canal dehiscence syndrome - a thinning of the temporal bone which exposes the inner ear to more sound .

She tried to resuscitate him but failed and the boy was rushed to Canonsburg General Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6:45 p.m. It is presumed the uncle recovered from the seizure. 'Just that quick he climbed up the ladder while they were trying to help my brother out of the seizure,' his devastated dad, Erik Metzger, told Channel 11. 'They looked up and he was already in the pool and that's how fast it happened.' Washington County coroner Tim Warco said the county received two 911 calls within five minutes from the residence - one for the uncle and one moments later for the boy. Mr Metzger received the devastating news at work. Gone: The family didn't want to look at the pool anymore . Devastated: The child's family, pictured, is reeling after the tragedy . 'If I have a message for anyone, it's that it only takes one second. Now the rest of my life I have to think about him not being here,' Mr Metzger said. The boy's mother April Sharratt thanked paramedics who she said tried hard to save her son's life. 'They tried hard for about an hour, but (he) didn't have no pulse, so they can only do so much. They did their best,' she told WTAE. Mr Metzger said that his son's organs will be donated in the hope that he can help another family avoid the pain he's feeling. 'My kid is gone. I can't bring him back. But if I can help some other mom not feel my pain, then that's what I'm going to do,' Metzger said. Quick: The child slipped into the pool while his family was distracted helping his uncle . Organs: Blake's father said he would donate his son's organs to prevent other families feeling his pain . The Metzger family said they ripped the swimming pool out of the backyard as soon as they got home from the hospital because they didn't want to look at it. 'We are really struggling right now. I never thought I'd have to bury my two-year-old son,' Metzger told the station. A teddy bear, large toy truck and a balloon were seen in the yard of the Richland Avenue home where the boy lived on Tuesday. The family has set up a fund with PNC Brank branch to help pay for their son's funeral costs. Anyone can donate to the fund called the Blake Metzger Fund at any branch.","Pittsburg toddler, Blake Metzger, was at his grandmother's house in Canonsburg on Monday afternoon while his father was at work .

The design of the domestic toilet has moved on very little in the last few hundred years, but that could be about to change. Designer Peter Codling, 30, has created a new style of toilet that allows the user to sit in a more natural squatting position. He believes that if this toilet was widely used it would result in a fall in the number of people suffering from colon cancer, haemorrhoids, heart attacks, and incontinence among other things. Peter Codling, 30, has created Le Penseur, a prototype toilet which allows the user to sit comfortably in the squatting position. Being in this position allows people to empty their bowels more easily and completely . The postgraduate Innovation Design Engineering student at the Royal College of Art in London explained that when people are sitting in a squatting position they can empty their bowels more easily and more completely. This means they have less chance of faecal retention which is a key contributing factor in many cases of colon cancer and appendicitis. He also explained that when people are able to empty their bowels more easily they are less likely to strain and that the straining can cause haemorrhoids, pelvic floor damage, and even heart attacks. Mr Codling claims that currently 43 per cent of women who have had a child develop some degree of incontinence, but that using the toilet would dramatically reduce the problem by reducing the pressure put on the pelvic floor. It is thought that if people relieved themselves while sitting in a squatting position they would also be less likely to damage the nerves that control the bladder, prostate and uterus and that they would be less likely to suffer hernias and pelvic organ prolapses. Mr Codling has spent four months working on the toilet design and the prototype, known as Le Penseur or The Thinker, is currently on display at the Royal College of Art in Kensington. Faecal retention - which results from difficulty emptying the bowels completely - can cause colon cancer and appendicitis, so using this toilet could reduce the incidence of all of these conditions . Using the toilet also reduces straining which reduces the risk of heart attacks, hernias and haemorrhoids. Mr Codling developed the toilet with handles (pictured) as the sitting position is lower than for a traditional toilet . He said: ‘The products we learn to use from an early age can be relegated to obscurity and no longer challenged. ‘The toilet presented a product that had changed little in hundreds of years and through speaking with healthcare professionals, I found there were great possibilities for innovation.’ His design is aimed at domestic use and could be installed by a normal plumber. Mr Codling says that it is very comfortable and is, actually, more comfortable than a normal toilet for shorter people. The prototype toilet is currently on display and Mr Codling hopes that it will be picked up by a manufacturer. Image shows how squatting allows easy bowel emptying . Mr Codling (pictured creating the prototype) says that the toilet is designed for domestic use and that it could be fitted by a normal plumber. He hopes it will eventually come into standard use . He also explained that the sitting position on his toilet is slightly lower than on a traditional one so he installed handles to ensure that people, including the elderly, can use it and then stand up easily. He told MailOnline: ‘The whole idea is to make life better for as many people as possible.‘I am hoping that this toilet will eventually be in standard use.’ Mr Codling now hopes that the design will be picked up by a manufacturer and that it could be put on the market in about a year. He told MailOnline: ‘It needs to be taken on by a large manufacturer who produces these things – I also need funding for more developments. ‘The concept has now been proven so I think it will then be ready for market.’","Peter Codling designed the toilet to allow the user to squat comfortably .

Just when I thought it was safe to step out in skinny jeans, along comes a trend to knock me off my fashion fulcrum, catapulting me back in time to the Seventies. Yes, flares are back. Part of me doesn’t give a damn about trends. By the time you get to 60 you know what suits you - or at least you should. But though sticking to what you know may stop you becoming a fashion victim, it could also leave you looking like a style Neanderthal. I only started wearing skinny jeans - thanks to two perfectly-fitting pairs from Gap and Comptoir des Cotonniers - in 2011. That was six years after Jane Shepherdson brought her skinny ‘Baxter’ style to the High Street when she was brand director of Top Shop. SUMMER WHITE: These are way too Elizabeth Hurleyfor me, although I bet the TOWIE girls will go mad forthem... White flared jeans, £34.99, mango.com. Blue blouse, £110, reiss.com .

While all this was going on I adamant that skinny was only for the very young. However, . when I dared to wear them, I felt I looked both fresher and more . fashionable. So, rather than wait six years to try the flares trend, I . decided to accept the challenge to give it a go now. When it comes to the flares revival, Victoria Beckham is the woman we have to thank (or blame). She has flaunted her love affair with flares in J Brand’s ‘Love Story’ bell-bottoms, as well as her signature, dark blue raw denims from her eponymous collection. And it’s not just Victoria Beckham . flying the flares flag in 2013. Gwyneth Paltrow has worn hers on the red . carpet, while Stella McCartney and Roksanda Ilincic featured them in . their collections. On the High Street, Oasis and Debenhams have seen . sales of flared trousers jump 57 per cent over the last year. In spite of all this, I have to say I . groaned when I saw the rail of flares in front of me. However, after . trying them on, I realised just how much they’d moved on since their . Seventies heyday. Like most jeans today, they have a degree of stretch . which means they fit better and hold their shape, resulting in less . flapping around your ankles.

Billionaire playboy Stewart Rahr has lived up to his reputation after releasing a sex tape of himself engaging in an orgy with three young women in the back of a limousine. The self-titled 'King Of All Fun' allegedly sent the tape to several of his New York contacts. It came one month after it emerged that he reached a $250million divorce settlement with ex-wife Carol. The 43-year marriage began before the pharmaceutical mogul made his fortune, so many assumed the riches would be split evenly in the absence of any prenuptial agreement. In the video, the 67-year-old can be heard from behind the camera urging the three pretty brunettes to perform sex acts on each other, the New York Post reports. Better days: Billionaire party boy Stewart Rahr seen here with ex-wife Carol. Carol recently received $250 million in their divorce settlement . The song 'I Don’t Care, I Love It' can be heard in the background. He emailed the video around with the . message: 'What a trip, what a crew!' Rahr’s lawyer Ben Brafman told the Post when asked about the video: 'However . inappropriate or offensive the footage might appear to some, all the . women are consenting adults who were engaged in friendly, voluntary and . lawful behavior.' The video is thought to have been posted in the South Of France. Rahr sold his pharmaceutical company Kinray for $1.3 billion in 2010 and did not have any money when he met his wife Carol. In that time, he has built . friendships with power brokers including Bill Clinton, Michael Milken, . Alicia Keys, Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Wahlberg, Lionel Richie and Andrea . Bocelli through his philanthropic work. 'Stewart always said he’d never get divorced because it would be too expensive,' a source told the New York Post last month. 'They met when he didn’t have two cents to rub together. She could be entitled to half his $1.6billion fortune.' The couple’s considerable real estate  assets will be split. According to the Post, Rahr will retain ownership of their Hampton’s estate, for which he paid a record breaking $45 million in 2005. Carol will keep their New York City pad, a $30 million unit in the Trump Park Avenue. Rahr, 67, was served with divorce . papers in late 2012 in front of the couples’ own home. Carol Rahr's . decision to launch divorce proceedings against her husband, follows . reports that the couple have been living increasingly separate lives in . recent years. His: In 2005, Rahr forked over the highest sum ever paid for a residence in New York for his 18,000 square foot Hampton's mansion. He kept the house in the divorce . Speculation . over how tempestuous the proceedings would become grew after it was . reported that Carol hired Robert Stephen Cohen, a divorce attorney . dubbed the 'pit bull’ who has previously represented the likes of . Christie Brinkley, Ellen Barkin, and Uma Thurman, and is famous for . playing tough. The Rahr's divorce settlement ranks among the highest of all time, but some even rank above it: . Those rumors were further fueled when . Rahr, in turn, hired attorneys Ben Brafman and David Aronson, whose firm . Aronson, Mayefsky & Sloan represented Katie Holmes in her . high-profile divorce from Tom Cruise. 'Mr . Rahr intends to act honorably and fairly,’ Brafman said when the . divorce was first reported. ‘He is hopeful and confident that the . parties will come to an amicable agreement and that despite ending their . marriage, will remain friends in the years ahead.' ‘I just have so few sunrises left and I want to be happy,’ Rahr explained to Forbes . after the divorce was announced last year. He said he believes . marriages should have clauses allowing them to be annulled mutually once . children reach adulthood. But . if years of reports of Rahr throwing tantrums, threatening violence, . and trying to buy his way into the ‘King Of All Fun’ title are to be . believed, the marriage may not have ended as mutually as Rahr describes. According to the New York Post, one . incident allegedly stemmed from a dispute between him and professional . gambler RJ Cipriani. Rahr allegedly pulled a gun on an elevator operator . at Trump Tower in New York after an altercation with the man. Hers: Carol gets to keep their palatial unit in Manhattan's prestigious Trump Park Avenue building . High places: Rahr's is a self-professed friend of Trump's and the socialite billionaire and self-professed 'Number One King of All Fun' claims a lot more celebrity connections . When police arrived, Rahr was found to have a gun, which was confiscated by officers. He claimed it wasn't loaded. And . in December, Rahr was banned from top New York restaurant Nobu after . the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he . didn't get his favorite table. Rahr reportedly sent an email complaint to Nobu owner Drew Nieporent. He admits having a disagreement with a female manager but denied threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call. Star crossed: Rahr has a wall in his home where hundred of portraits of him with big name celebrities are hung . No bull: Last year, the testy Rahr was accused of threatening to kill the manager of Nobu restaurant in New York and then emailing his celebrity friends about the experience . It was reported that after the face-to-face confrontation with the manager, which occurred on the night of Carol’s birthday party, he sent a caps-locked tirade to Nieporent and CC'ed a group of his famous friends including Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix. It is unknown what, if any response, Rahr got from his celebrity crowd sourcing but his misbehavior did reportedly get him banned from all 25 international Nobu locations. Cheese: Rahr hugs Russell Simmons while wearing his signature glasses. Rahr's misadventures also include an alleged armed confrontation with a poker player in Las Vegas . Sweetheart: Though he's called Stewie Rah-Rah for his partying, he's also called generous for his giving and his philanthropy has even won him connections with the royal family . Philanthropist: Rahr, here with Jessica Simpson at an Operation Smile event, has even hosted charity events with guests like Bill Clinton, Ed Koch, and Mark Wahlberg . But Rahr appears to have a softer side, as well. His philanthropic activities, including large sum donations to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, have helped him to forge friendships with powerful figures such as Bill Clinton and Michael Milken. Singers Alicia Keys and Andrea Bocelli performed at his annual charity dinner. Rahr made his fortune selling wholesale pharmaceuticals. He sold the company he started and still wholly owned, Kinray Pharmaceuticals, for a reported $1.3 billion in 2010.

An Indian journalist has been criticised for appearing on television reporting from a disaster zone while sitting on the shoulders of one of a flood victim. Narayan Pargaien was in the state of Uttarakhand reporting on floods which have devastated the region when he made his unorthodox broadcast for News Express. But he has denied the suggestion that he exploited the man by sitting on his shoulders while on camera, insisting that the flood victim 'wanted to show respect' because he had never met anyone as important as the journalist before. Scroll down to watch the video . Controversy: TV reporter Narayan Pargaien has come under fire for filming a report from a disaster region while sitting on the shoulders of a victim of the floods . A video of Mr Pargaien reporting on the floods swept the internet when it was posted to YouTube earlier this month, with many Indian web users criticising him for apparently using a disaster victim to keep his feet dry. One commenter denounced him as 'a disgrace to journalism', while another said he was 'a ridiculous reporter'. In an interview Mr Pargaien, who has nearly two decades of reporting experience, admitted that he was wrong to file the unorthodox report, but said that he only sat on the man's shoulders after the victim had invited him to do so. He also blamed his cameraman for revealing the bizarre arrangement, claiming that he had been told he would only be filmed from the waist up. Defence: The reporter said that the man offered his services because he was so impressed by the journalist . 'It wasn't my idea to begin with, but there was this man who took me to his home and asked me to report the damage he had suffered,' Mr Pargaien told News Laundry. 'His house was in a miserable condition and he had lost a lot in the flood, and was left with very little food and water. 'We helped him with some food and some money and he was grateful to us and wanted to show me some respect, as it was the first time someone of my level had visited his house.' The reporter added that he had paid the man, whom he refused to name, 50 rupees (55p) for his troubles. Disaster: Survivors being airlifted from the flood region in Uttarakhand by soldiers last week . He admitted that his actions were 'journalistically wrong', adding that he had 'no problem getting my feet wet'. But Mr Pargaien appeared keen to pass blame on to his cameraman for allowing the footage to come to light, saying the report was supposed to be shown 'only with footage of me chest-up'. He continued: 'This was entirely the cameraman’s fault, who, it seems, almost tried to sabotage my career by shooting from that distance and angle and releasing the video mocking this whole incident, and making me the villain.' The horrific floods in the northern state are believed to have killed 1,000 people, with many thousands more stranded in remote mountainous areas.","Narayan Pargaien was reporting on the devastating floods in Uttarakhand .

A 62-year-old skydiver is being treated for burns after landing on power lines during a parachute jump. The skydiver had to be airlifted to hospital at the weekend after landing on the power lines next to a busy road near Sacramento. Friends of Mark Elizondo say he is an experienced skydiver who had taken part in several jumps on Sunday, before falling on the power lines at about 2pm. Crash landing: Skydiver Mark Elizondo is being treated for burns after falling on power lines during a jump . 'It’s a freak thing,' Bill Dause, who owns the Lodi Parachute Center, said. 'He’s jumped here before. He’s . made several jumps today and just did something wrong.' Mr Elizondo's wife, Raedell, said he had been practicing routines with 14 others when the accident happened. She described her husband, who she met while skydiving, as experienced and said he had made more than 1,000 parachute jumps. Mr Dause told KCRA: 'For some reason he just went two far downwind and unfortunately the power line was below him when he turned around and tried to come back.' Witnesses said Mr Elizondo, from Utah, was conscious but had been burned and was in shock when emergency services arrived. Lieutenant Michael van Grouwt added that Mr Elizondo was alert and talking as he was carried away on a stretcher. 'He was fairly stable,' Lieutenant van Grouw told the Recordnet. Air miles: Mark Elizondo, pictured during an earlier skydive, had been practicing a routine before the accident . Mr Dause said wind was unlikely to have led to the accident at the weekend, but other skydivers at the center disagreed. 'It’s happened before and that’s . strictly the pilot of the parachute,' Ed Barr said. 'The wind today . makes it even worse.' The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the accident and will check the condition of the parachute and whether it was packed properly, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said. FAA records show that the agency recommended citations against the parachute center in 2010 and 2011 for failing to maintain aircraft equipment, according to the Los Angeles Times. An independent instructor at the center also faced the possibility of a FAA fine last year over allegedly not fastening a harness to a student properly during a tandem jump. A video of Laverne Everett celebrating her 80th birthday with a tandem jump shows her slipping out of the harness. However, she landed safely and refused to criticize her instructor, according to the Modesto Bee. Shock: Bill Dause, who runs Lodi Parachute Center, described the power line crash as a freak accident . Mr Elizondo, from Utah, is still being treated for burns in hospital. Fellow skydiver Bill Stanley said: 'Basically, any sport has risks. People get killed in any sport that exists. Quite honestly, my drive out here is more frightening.' Mr Dause added that he could remember only other accident involving power lines since starting his business.","62-year-old drifted on to cables after practicing routine near Sacramento .

There were claims that the family had been suffering from financial problems. ‘The latest information we have is . that the owner of the house had not heard from the family for a few days . and had not been paid,’ said a Guardia Civil spokesman. ‘He went to the house today and when there was no reply at the door, he went inside. ‘Inside he saw the man dead on the . sofa and immediately called the Guardia Civil. When officers inspected . the house they found the wife and the daughter dead in a bedroom. ‘The initial hypothesis at this early stage is that this was a murder-suicide.’ The spokesman would not confirm reports that the daughter, who was in her 20s, had Down’s syndrome. He said: ‘The main line of . investigation points to a  double murder by the father followed by his . suicide. But the investigation is still in its early stages.’ Scene: A shopping basket can be seen outside the front door to the property. There was not believed to be any sign of a struggle inside . Investigation: The Foreign Office has said it is 'urgently' looking into the deaths. Drying racks for washing can be seen outside the building . Resort: This map shows the location of Mijas within Spain . The family had lived in the Torrenueva . complex in Mijas, which is midway between Marbella and Malaga, for . about seven years. The apartment building is in a quiet, tree-lined . street in the village, which is popular with British expatriates and . tourists. The bodies were removed yesterday afternoon and a police cordon set up. A friend of the family said: ‘He had a . lot of problems on his back. His daughter was grown-up but her mind was . that of a baby’s and his wife had been ill for some time. ‘He did work in a bank but told me he had changed his job.’ Neighbours said debt collectors had . visited the family in recent days. Several said they had heard shots, . sparking speculation the bodies may have lain undiscovered for some . time. Dutch neighbour Elizabeth Van . Heyningen, 66, said: ‘The couple have been in my house for a drink. 'They . were both British but I don’t know where from. He seemed very nice. He . must have been in his late  fifties. He used to work in a Spanish bank . before becoming an estate agent and then losing his job. I think they . had run out of money. Probe: Detectives investigating the triple deaths are pictured inside the property . Tragic: A police officer places tape around the outside of the building . Horrific: Emergency workers can be seen at the scene . ‘He used to drive a BMW and his wife . had a nice car of her own but then they sold them for a hired Opel they . used to drive. In recent weeks I hadn’t seen them driving anything. ‘A couple of weeks ago I saw him walking up the hill to his house with heavy bags of shopping. ‘His wife had fallen ill in recent . months and he often came round asking if I could do anything about . another neighbour’s barking dog which was upsetting her. The talk round . here is he killed his wife and daughter and then turned the gun on . himself.’ Garage owner Kevin Watts, 65, an . immediate neighbour, said: ‘They lived like hermits. They always kept . the metal shutters on their windows down.’ Tragic: Three members of the same British family are reported to have been found dead on the Costa del Sol resort of Mijas, pictured . Pleasant: Mijas is known for being civilised and family friendly . Expat Suzanne Hughes, 58, added: ‘I . heard three shots the other day. I put it down at the time to someone . shooting wild boar. I even joked, “I hope someone’s not being shot”.’ Mijas is a typical Andalusian, white-washed village with cobbled streets set in the mountains overlooking the sea. Dawn Dale, who runs the Original . English Tearoom there, said the deaths would come as a shock to the . close-knit British community. ‘There is hardly any crime here’, she said. ‘It is a very laid back, chilled-out place.’ The Foreign Office said it was ‘urgently’ looking into the reports of the deaths.","Couple and their daughter in her 20s found shot dead .

Two teenage girls who incited riots in Sweden by posting insults about about their classmates online and calling them 'sluts' have been found guilty of defamation. The defendants, aged 15 and 16, set up an Instagram page on which they posted photographs of other girls and boys annotated with derogatory remarks. They were ordered to pay more than £55,000 in compensation to their victims, while the younger girl was sentenced to juvenile detention and the elder to community service. Scroll down for videos . Sentenced: The girls who set up this 'Sluts of Gothenburg' account on Instagram have been found guilty of defamation . For more videos, please go to Klykan Karisson . In December, the girls created the 'Sluts of Gothenburg' account on photo-sharing site Instagram, encouraging people to share photos of teenagers whom they claimed were sexually promiscuous. One of them put out an appeal asking 'which young people are the worst sluts in Gothenburg', and received hundreds of replies. The page quickly became notorious in Sweden's second-largest city, and a crowd of hundreds turned up at one of the girl's schools in protest at the 'slut-shaming' behaviour, prompting a showdown with police. The 15-year-old admitted setting up the Instagram account, and although the elder girl denied the charges the Gothenburg District Court criticised her for seeming to have a poor grasp of facts. Inflammatory: Gothenburg was hit with riots over the controversial online posts in December . Showdown: Police confronted protesters who turned up at the girls' school in vigilante retaliation . They were proven to have been responsible for the online abuse thanks to forensic evidence which was submitted to the court. The two girls will have to pay their 38 victims 15,000 kronor (£1,450 each) in compensation for the defamation. Arash Raoufi, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the verdict could help curb cyber-bullying by showing that it is impossible to hide behind an online pseudonym in order to abuse others. Mobbed: Students engulfed cars at the school as they showed their anger at the account . 'Many think they are anonymous when they are sitting behind a computer and therefore take greater liberties than if that anonymity wasn't there,' he said. 'The verdict sends a signal to young people and society that this indignity culture cannot be allowed to exist. I hope it will also result in parents being more alert to what kids do at the computer.' However, the 16-year-old's lawyer Claes Östlund told The Local that the sentences were 'a little harsh', and criticised the ruling that the girls' parents must pay half of their fine. 'How can you stop your daughter from going in on the net and writing that someone is a whore when you don't even have a computer yourself?', he asked.","'Sluts of Gothenburg' page sparked riots at Swedish school in December .

Yo-yo dieting mother-of-four Alison Batchelor had tried everything to lose weight, even having her jaw wired shut. But every slimming technique she used always resulted in her piling back on any weight she had actually lost - in that case, just 3lbs - immediately after. So now, having lost and regained a total of 70 stone over 45 years, Alison, 62, from Wadebridge in Cornwall, has taken drastic measures and had a gastric band fitted - selling her brand new £10,500 car to pay for the irreversible surgery. Alison Batchelor - pictured left, now at her 10 stone goal weight, and right, aged 54 and 16 stone - sold her car to pay for gastric band surgery after yo yo dieting for 45 years . Alison now weighs 10 stone, is a size 10/12, and is finally happy with her weight after having had gastric band surgery . The drastic step paid off and she dropped six stone (and kept it off) after her stomach was reduced to the size of a walnut. Alison, 62, said: 'I tried every diet going and I'd lose the weight but I would just pile it all back on again - and some more. I spent a fortune on it and one day 18 months ago I woke up and just decided enough was enough.' Alison told her husband Andrew she was selling the car and going to have gastric band surgery. 'People say to me I was brave,' she said, 'but truly I have reached a point where I was mentally exhausted with dieting. I wanted to be fit, I wanted to stop dressing to disguise my body.'

She embarked on her first diet aged 17, when eating only grapefruit for every meal she lost nine pounds in three weeks. At . one point the desperate dental hygienist even asked a colleague to wire . shut her mouth for three weeks, but lost three pounds after she took to . liquidising chocolate bars and drinking them through a straw.

Sailor Brinkley Cook, now 15, posted the two pictures on Instagram, with the caption '1 year ago at the same time #lol #transformationtuesday'.

The Moon could soon become a robot colony of mechanical apes exploring the lunar landscape, thanks to a monkey robot designed in Germany. Engineers from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) and the University of Bremen have developed a space robot designed to walk and climb like an ape over rocky ground, such as the terrain of the Moon. The iStruct Demonstrator has mechanical arms, legs and a spine that mimic the way primates behave - and could replace the wheeled rovers currently used in lunar missions. Scroll down for video . Engineers from the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence have developed a robot that walks and climbs like a monkey. The researchers plan to send the mechanical chimp to the moon to explore the lunar landscape because it is more agile and versatile than current wheeled rovers and explorers . The iStruct Demonstrator, pictured, weighs 18 kg. It has an articulated spinal column connecting the torso and pelvis to foot and ankle structures. These 'joints' are each fitted with sensors which react and respond to the ground below . The iStruct demonstrator has: . 43 individual force-sensing resistor (FSR) sensors. Six additional FSR sensors on exposed parts used for collision detection. A 6-axis Force/Torque-sensor. A distance sensor in heel to anticipate heel strike. A digital 3-axis accelerometer to perceive the orientation of the foot. Two temperature sensors to compensate for temperature changes in the electronics. Digital magnetic angular encoders to monitor every moving axes of the foot and ankle structure. The engineering team have already built the robo-ape and have now begun testing it in the centre's mock lunar landscape. According to researchers at the DFKI, a primate's body is better suited to the lunar terrain because its four-legged stance is stable when climbing over obstacles or hills. The robot can also right itself if it falls over. It can additionally stand on its hind legs and use its arms to pick up samples and move obstacles using its robotic hands. The iStruct Demonstrator weighs 18kg and measures 66x43x75 cm. It has an articulated spinal column connecting the torso and . pelvis to foot and ankle structures. These 'joints' are each fitted with sensors that react and respond to the ground below. It also has 26 degrees of freedom thanks to various electric motors. The iStruct Demonstrator is similar to the CHIMP robot developed for the DARPA Robotics Challenge. The iStruct Demonstrator's 'legs' and 'joints' have been engineered to mimic those of a primate. This makes the robot more capable of climbing, walking and collecting samples from the rocky Moon terrain . However, the . iStruct's articulated spine, which works as a 6-axes force-torque . sensor, is unique to this robot and . helps it move on all fours. The sensors in the foot and ankle also allow . it to maintain its balance on sloped terrain. A study from the research centre said: 'The aim of the iStruct project is the development of a robotic system which effectively improves the locomotion and mobility characteristics, if applied to the robotic system. 'The main focus in this project is the development of intelligent structures for application in mobile robots to increase the efficiency of a complex walking machine by the purposeful use of intelligent structures. 'A high number of sensors is needed to allow a precise perception of the environment; hence there will be large data sets which have to be locally pre-processed and evaluated. 'In order to meet the high requirements of the intelligent structures, sensors and actuators have to be selected or developed with regard to both their functionality and their integration capability within the intelligent structures.' In 2009, project leader Daniel Kühn worked on a similar robot called the Little Ape capable of simple quadrupedal walking. His current project is due to be completed by August.","The iStruct Demonstrator has been designed to move and behave like real-life primates .

Two Los Angeles police detectives have survived a 'blatant assassination attempt' after they were fired on as they drove into the parking lot of their police station early this morning. The two officers returned fire, resulting in a furious gun battle in which at least a dozen rounds were fired. Both detectives escaped with only minor injuries and were back on duty by Tuesday afternoon. More than 200 LAPD officers are currently hunting for the suspects in the Mid-City neighborhood of Los Angeles and Chief Charlie Beck has ordered security stepped up and police precincts across the city. Hunt: More than 200 officers fanned out in the Mid-City neighborhood of Los Angeles in a massive manhunt for the shooting suspects . Four men were detained during the search - though three were later released. The fourth is still being questioned . According to the Los Angeles Times, Beck had strong words for the shooters who opened fire on his officers, who were returning back to their station house after investigating a burglary. In a press conference, he called the attack 'a blatant attempt to assassinate two of the people who protect this community.' The targeting of two LAPD officers comes less than five months after rouge LAPD officer Christopher Dorner put every police officer in Southern California on edge after publicly swearing to seek revenge for his firing from the department. He killed four police officers and the daughter of a police captain during a two-week reign of terror in February. His rampage ended in a remote cabin near Bear Lake, California, when he shot himself in the head after being surrounded by SWAT officers. Tuesday's ambush took place about 4.30am as the two detectives, who specialize in investigating burglaries, were pulled into the parking lot of the LAPD’s Wilshire substation. The two officers had been working on a case and were returning to their offices when they were fired on in their squad car. Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies also joined the search for the suspects . '(The gunmen) knew that these were police officers or police employees,' LAPD Commander Andy Smith . said. 'Anybody willing to take on two police officers outside a police . station is obviously a dangerous individual.' The officers returned fire, but failed to hit the suspects. One officer was wounded in the hand. The other was wounded in the head - possibly by shattered glass from his car window. The attack prompted a full-scale response from the LAPD. More than 200 officers converged on the neighborhood and began searching for the suspects. Every police canine unit in the city responded, plus several police dogs from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The officers were treated at a hospital and released hours later. Beck said they, too, had joined in the . Despite the massive response, the search turned out to be fruitless. By Tuesday night, no suspects had been found. Beck ordered LAPD officers posted outside of the department headquarters and at every precinct station as a precaution. Officers were visible outside the department's downtown headquarters on Tuesday night.","Two detectives were fired on as they were pulling into a police precinct parking lot at 4.30am Tuesday .

Halinski, of Meadowbrook Court, Festus, was 'uncooperative' at the scene, refusing to tell police her name, and was taken into custody. The St. Louis Post reports the couple had been drinking and smoking marijuana prior to the shooting, and that Campbell had been showing Halinski how to load and unload firearms. Campbell allegedly handed Halinski a small handgun and told her it was unloaded and that the safety was on. 'He then told her to point and the gun at him and said, ""Shoot me,""' reported the paper.

A group of 20 tourists were rescued from the Canadian Arctic . today following a miraculous stroke of luck. The group had been trapped at sea on a 30 mile long ice sheet after it broke away from Baffin Island sometime between Monday night and early . Tuesday and floated out to sea. But the ice sheet on which they had found themselves trapped . bumped into another ice sheet which was touching land earlier today, the Canadian . coast guard said. Adrift: A group of 20 Canadian tourists was left stranded 2 miles from land when a 30-nmile long ice sheet they were camped on broke free from Baffin Island . The group managed to walk from one ice sheet to the other before reaching dry land, . the coastguard confirmed this afternoon. ‘Everyone is safe and sound,’ marine coordinator . Christian Cafiti told CNN. A rescue plane had managed to drop survival kits onto the three . and half square-mile frozen sheet on Tuesday, after the group alerted . authorities to their plight. The kits included satellite phones, inflatable . rafts and food rations. The plane kept a watch on the group while they waited for . helicopters to arrive. But when the helicopters did arrived early on Wednesday, bad . weather prevented rescuers from hoisting the group on board. They have been . standing by to airlift them to an Arctic station ever since. Sub-zero: The group were rather lucky as the weather at this time of year rarely falls below zero(File photo) ‘We are having regular conversations with them through . satellite phone,’ Mr Cafiti said. The tourists do not appear to be in danger of exposure. They . are dressed warmly and have been able to remain dry, he added. CNN reported Canadian air force spokesman Steven Neta as saying: ‘Ice breaking off is a very common thing at this time of . year.' The floe drifted two miles away from land and started to . break up Mr Neta said. Had it fallen apart, the three rubber rafts were more . than large enough to hold the whole group, he added. Baffin Island is in the Canadian territory of Nunavut and is the largest island in Canada and the fifth largest island in the world. It is 195,928 square miles in size and its population was estimated at 11,000 in 2007. Baffin Island lies in the path of a generally northerly airflow all year round. Winters tend to be very long and foggy while Spring thaw arrives later than normal given its position in the Arctic Circle usually not occurring until early June in the south or even as late as early to mid-July on the northern coast where glaciers run right down to sea level . Snow, even heavy snow, occurs at any time of the year, although is least likely in July and early August. Temperatures in Nunavut territory’s capital Iqaluit can hit a high of 9 degrees Celsius in July while the coldest month is February when temperatures can fall as low as -33 degrees Celsius. Sea ice surrounds the island for most of the year and only disappears completely from the north coast for short unpredictable periods from mid to late June until the end of September. Most of Baffin Island lies above the Arctic Circle and most of the communities that live on the island have Polar night in winter and the midnight sun in summer. The north eastern community of Clyde River has twilight instead of night from April 26 until May 13, continuous sunlight for two and half months from May 14 to July 28, then twilight instead of night from July 29 until August 16. This gives the community just over three and a half months without true night. In the winter the sun sets on November 22 and does not rise again until January 19 of the next year. However, there is twilight for at least 4 hours a day. The island is named after English explorer William Baffin, although it is likely that the island was known to Pre-Columbian Norse explorers from Greenland and Iceland.","Ice floe broke away from Baffin Island on Tuesday morning .

Over $1 million in $100 bills stolen from a shipping container on a Swiss Air passenger flight may have been a JFK Airport inside job. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday that the money was gone when the plane landed in New York. Now they believe an insider at JFK is the culprit. And they're administering lie detector tests to personnel to figure out whodunnit. Heist: The FBI is investigating $1.2million in cash found missing from a Swiss Air Lines jet when it at JFK airport, pictured, in New York Monday . The shipment on flight 17 left Zurich Saturday, but by the time it reached its destination at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, $1.2 million of the $92 million aboard was gone. The theft was discovered at the official count of the cash at its final destination in New Jersey. At first, it was it unclear if the money was stolen in Switzerland or somewhere en route. An investigation then uncovered a big hole had been punched in the crate, likely with a forklift. The thief then turned the crate in such a way that the hole wouldn't be evident. Take the money and run: An arm-sized hole was found in the shipping crate that contained the missing money . Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. And to find out exactly who, a source for the New York Post says the FBI is administering lie detector tests to JFK personnel. Previously, ABC News reported a forklift operator 'opened the sealed crate and noticed damage to one of the crates in the form of a puncture from a forklift. It was a hole large enough to put your arm in.' However, the operator failed to report the hole because reportedly because such damage commonly occurs to the crates after years of use. Meanwhile, a Swiss Air rep said the company didn't have 'any indication of a robbery of a Swiss aircraft.' Officials have not disclosed who the money was meant for or why it was being sent. No comment? Jim Margolin, spokesman for the FBI in New York, declined to provide further information. But the New York Post reports that the agency is performing lie detector tests on JFK employees . Investigators are now looking in to how . many mechanics, crew members and airport personnel had access to . the jet and whether any of them could feasibly have emptied the box and . escaped unnoticed. According to the US Treasury, $1 million in $100 bills is estimated to weigh just 22 pounds, meaning a thief could easily cart around the cash. The largest cash heist in JFK Airport history happened on December 11, 1978, when an estimated $5 million was stolen at the Lufthansa Airlines terminal. At the time it was also the largest cash theft to have been carried out on US soil and went on to be portrayed in the movie 'Goodfellas'. It is not unusual for airlines to transport large sums of money - with a single flight sometimes carrying more than $1 billion. Investigation: It was previously believed that the money was missing when the plane landed at JFK, but now the FBI reportedly believes the money was taken in New York .","Passenger flight 17 arrived at JFK Airport in New York Monday afternoon missing 12 bundles of $100 bills .

Shocks in tennis do not come any more earth-shattering than this. Somehow the impossible came true and Roger Federer’s Centre Court house came tumbling down. Not since he won the first of his seven Wimbledon titles in 2003 had the Swiss lost in the first week of Wimbledon. Heck, he hadn’t even lost before the quarter-finals. He did so last night and the manner of it was a Wimbledon throwback to the lost age of serve and volley. Stakhovsky didn’t just rewrite the history books, he ripped up the modern manual of how to play grass-court tennis. Demonically charging to the net at every opportunity, the world No 116 punched away volleys for three hours, even when Federer flayed shots in anger straight at him. Scroll down for videos . Down and out: Roger Federer suffered a shock defeat by Ukranian Sergiy Stakhovsky in round two . Fist-Pump: Stakhovsky celebrates a point during on the way to his surprise win over Federer . Flying: Stakhovsky jumps full-length to return the seven-time Wimbledon champion's shot . At 4-3 ahead in the decisive fourth . set, the Ukrainian displayed stunning reactions to duck out of the way . of a backhand which carried a message of spite. The ball flew long, but . Federer’s steamy glare across the net lingered. The 17-times Grand Slam champion . rarely demonstrates such antipathy. For once, he wasn’t in charge on the . court which is so often his serene domain. Disbelief enveloped the old . arena, sweeping away even former champions John McEnroe and Boris Becker . in the BBC commentary box. ‘You won’t believe what I just . witnessed’ said McEnroe. ‘I’ve got goosebumps, I know Boris does, . because that was just old school. You hear people say you can’t do this . any more, you can’t serve and volley, the courts are too slow.’ Stakhovsky was cheered on to the triumph that will define his journeyman career by Anfisa, his wife of 21 months. In action: Federer was another high-profile casualty of Wimbledon after Rafael Nadal's exit . Throwing in the towel? Federer takes a breather between games before his shock Wimbledon exit . For much of his married life, he has . changed tennis from the inside of an ATP Player Council meeting room. The most dramatic change they have influenced during that time has been . the increase in prizemoney at Grand Slams for first- and second-round . losers. That was supposed to help players like the 27-year-old himself. The deepest irony is that it is . Federer who will be the beneficiary, even if the £38,000 cheque is no . more than loose change to him. ‘I’m in the Council because I think I . can change things,’ said Stakhovsky. ‘On the court, I’m outside the top . 100 because there are 100 guys better than me. That’s it. ‘The revival of serve and volley is . not up to me. It’s about the tournaments and the surface. There is . hardly a surface left on which you can serve and volley successfully.’ Praying: Stakhovsky's wife Anfisa clutches her hands in hope during the final throes of the intense battle . On court, Stakhovsky created a stir . at the recent French Open. Having had a point awarded against him in his . first-round loss to Richard Gasquet, he marched to his tennis bag, . grabbed his phone and took a photo of the mark left on the red clay. When he later tweeted the photo, he earned himself a fine of 1,500 . euros. Stakhovsky advances to a third-round . meeting tomorrow with Jurgen Melzer. The only certainty is that he will . not match the magnificence of his performance. It is usually Federer who takes the . breath away from the Centre Court crowd, ripping the heart out of his . opponents in the process with the majesty of his play. True enough, even . while wearing the white-soled tennis shoes by decree of the All England . Club after transgressing in the first round, there were moments of . brilliance which drew a standing ovation. Crucially, they did not deflect . Stakhovsky from his quest. Even when he conceded a first-set tiebreak, . the Ukrainian continued to rush the net at every opportunity. His . approach shots were penetratingly deep, his movement sharp and his . volleys crisply punched away. A wistful glance: Federer departs Centre Court after his surprise defeat to the outstanding Stakhovsky, who celebrates below . In the second-set tiebreak it was . Federer who blinked, shanking a forehand so badly that the ball . ballooned over the baseline to give Stakhovsky set point. The firmest of . volleys converted it. A roar went up but, in truth, the . Centre Court crowd believed it was merely a blip on the usual . procession. The Swiss would simply raise his level and skate away to . victory. Not so. At 5-5 and after 34 games . without a service break, it was Stakhovsky who lifted his play and . Federer who wobbled, pushing a forehand inexplicably long. That third . set was secured with a superbly angled volley, the fourth set saved with . a deliciously controlled volley which plopped on to the Centre Court . turf and died. Another prayer: But these fans and their banner didn't get their wish . Historic: Federer last failed to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final in 2004, in a French Open loss to Gustavo Kuerten . Even in the tiebreak, no one truly believed in the miracle that was unfolding — except Stakhovsky. That was until, at match point down, . Federer pushed a backhand wide, ending an era which will surely never be . replicated.  Stakhovsky tipped an imaginary hat to the enraptured . Centre Court crowd, Federer simply scratched his head. Unsure of the . right etiquette, the Swiss departed. Stakhovsky halted his celebrations and joined in the applause, suddenly aware of what he had done. He will almost certainly never win Wimbledon but Stakhovsky, too, will now never be forgotten.","Champion crashes out as path to final opens up for Murray .

While he is best known for his role as the star of TV drama The Sopranos, the actor, who died last week aged 51, also had a successful career on the stage. New York's theatres are set to pay him their greatest sign of respect when they turn off their lights for one minute at 8pm. Family: James Gandolfini, who died in Rome last week, pictured with his wife Deborah and his son . Success: Gandolfini on stage with Hope Davis and Jeff Daniels in God of Carnage, for which he was nominated for a Tony Award in 2009 . 'James Gandolfini was a consummate actor who brought individuality to each role and inspired a true connection with the audience,' said Charlotte St Martin of the Broadway League. 'Whether on screen or on the Broadway stage, he made every role believable and seemingly effortless. 'Our thoughts go out to his family and friends, and certainly to all of his fans who felt as if they knew his characters.' Gandolfini was nominated for a Tony Award for best actor in 2009 for his role in God of Carnage by Yasmina Reza. He also appeared in productions such as A Streetcar Named Desire in 1992 and 1995's On the Waterfront. Mob: Gandolfini found fame as the star of The Sopranos, HBO's long-running crime drama . Dimming the marquees is an honour handed out just a few times each year to mark the deaths of prominent actors, directors, crewmembers or other figures from the theatrical world. Gandolfini died in Rome last Wednesday while on holiday with his family. His 13-year-old son found him having a heart attack in the bathroom of their hotel room. The star, who was working on an upcoming HBO series and has two films due out next year, had been due to attend the Taormina Film Festival in Sicily. Funeral: The 51-year-old will be laid to rest tomorrow at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine . His body was flown back to the U.S. on Sunday, and his funeral will take place tomorrow at the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine in New York City.

Hundreds of Radford University graduates received diplomas in the mail over the weekend that had Virginia spelled incorrectly. The university remained unaware of the error - the third 'I' was missing from 'Virginia' - until Tuesday morning, when a graduate notified officials. The school has now acknowledged that more than 1,400 students, both undergraduate and graduate students who graduated in the fall of 2012 and spring of 2013, received the marred diplomas. Meghan McNeice graduated from Radford University in Virginia in May, and she was excited when she got her diploma in the mail on Saturday. But the 21-year-old media studies major from Richmond, Va., soon heard chatter on Twitter that there was a spelling error on some graduates' diplomas, so she looked at hers again. Sure enough, the freelance reporter's diploma had the word ""Virginia"" spelled incorrectly. In one of two instances of the word on the document, the final ""i"" is omitted, leaving the word spelled ""Virgina."" McNeice missed the error the first time she looked at her diploma because, she said, ""I was just looking at it as a graduate, I was excited. I wasn't, like, going through copy editing."" In fact, the university remained unaware of the error until Tuesday morning, when a graduate notified officials. In total, 1,481 undergraduate and graduate diplomas from fall 2012 and spring 2013 were misspelled, according to Joe Carpenter, Radford's chief communications officer. In a st . Radford University graduate Laura Weston, left, said she went 'crazy' when she found out that her certificate had been printed with spelling mistakes, while Meghan McNeice, right, tweeted her fustration . It has also confirmed that the word ‘thereto’ had been mis-spelt as ‘therto.’ University spokesman Joe Carpenter blamed human error exacerbated by computer technology. ‘The error was caused when the commercial software system used to produce the diplomas within the university's registrar's office was upgraded in the fall of 2012,’ he told ABCNews.com. ‘That software upgrade required that the diploma narrative be re-keyed into the program. It was during the re-keying process that the typographical errors were introduced into the template,’ he said. Hundreds of Radford University graduates received diplomas in the mail over the weekend that had Virginia spelled incorrectly . The diploma also featured the word 'thereto' mis-spelt as 'therto' ‘Radford University regrets any inconvenience this error may have caused our alumni and will be working to correct these errors in a timely manner,’ he added. Corrected diplomas will be mailed to graduates as soon as possible, but that didn’t prevent angry students from taking to social media to vent their frustrations at the situation. Meghan McNeice, 21, from Richmond, Va. graduated from Radford in May, and received her media studies diploma in the mail on Saturday. ‘Well I sure hope my thousands of dollars is going to cover a reprint of my diploma! Way to go Radford Virginia isn’t that hard to spell’ she tweeted. University spokesman Joe Carpenter blamed human error exacerbated by computer technology . A Facebook posting under the name Becca Barteau read: 'When you send out a document that is supposed to be a professional piece of paper. You might want to check the spelling. Good job Radford you have officially spelled Virginia wrong on my diploma!!!' And at least one parent took to Facebook to note the issue. Woody West posted: 'My daugter got her diploma from Radford University It states that it was issued by the Commonwealth of Virgina, not Virginia.' University officials have set up a customer service email and phone number and will provide that info to graduates in case they have questions.

Police are searching for the person responsible for beating and burning a horse in Florida over the weekend. Lisa Hensley returned to her mini-farm in Marion County after a camping trip Monday to find 'Sassy', a 14-year-old Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse she cares for, with bruises on her stomach and burns on her left hind leg, possibly made by paint, The Ocala Star-Banner and WKMG reported. 'She was hiding in a dark corner of the barn. She could barely stand or walk,' Hensley told the Star-Banner. Attacked: A Florida woman came home from a weekend trip to find the horse she cares for had been attacked brutally attacked. The horse named Sassy, pictured, is a Kentucky Mountain Saddle Horse . Sassy's owner, Dr Todd Overcash, told WKMG he believed the horse was burned by acid. 'Her pain is pretty severe, and those wounds have to be scrubbed down twice a day, and we have to dose her,' said Overcash, an Ocala surgeon. Because the wounds were fairly shallow, a veterinarian who treated the horse said they were likely not caused by acid, but by paint that can burn skin, according to the Marion County Sheriff's Office report. Farm: Sassy, the horse who was attacked, was staying at a barn in Ocala's Meadow Wood Farms when someone beat her and burned her, possibly with paint . Overcash told the Stat-Banner it appeared Sassy's attacker also kicked her repeatedly. 'She is one of the most gentle horses you could ever be around,' Overcash said. Looking for answers: Sassy's owner, Dr Todd Overcash, said his horse was in severe pain. He is offering a reward to anyone who has information about the attack . A neighbor saw a man walking around the two-acre property at Meadow Wood Farms on Friday, according to WKMG. The man was driving a red car. But police still have few leads, with no broken gates, finger prints or other incriminating evidence. Overcash is offering a reward for anyone who knows who might be responsible for Sassy's injuries. 'I'm just overwhelmed by it,' That horse is the love of a 4-year-old boy,” Overcash told the Star-Banner. Hensley's son, Heath, loves Sassy, but is confused about her injuries. 'He . knows she is hurt, but doesn't really understand what happened,' Hensley said. 'He didn't want to go to school today so he could be with . her.' Sassy was taken to an equestrian hospital where she's being given round-the-clock care. 'Barring infection, she should make it,' Overcash told the Star-Banner. 'I'm worried about how it will affect her walk.' The Marion County Sheriff asks anyone with information about the attack to call their office.","Lisa Hensley found 'Sassy' curled up in a dark barn in Ocala, Fla.

"By . Imogen Edwards-jones. PUBLISHED: . 16:02 EST, 26 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:04 EST, 26 June 2013 . Regrets? I have a few. Well, three to be precise. They are shaped like a swallow, a butterfly and the most appalling daisy that grows, like a meandering weed, from the gap between the last two stubby little toes on my right foot. It is not the best look for a fortysomething mother of two. I don’t really know what I was thinking. But about 25 years ago I went through my ‘tattoo phase’. The swallow came first. I remember traipsing the streets of Bristol, while I was at university, trying to find a small, grubby parlour where a bloke with more tattoos than teeth scribbled something vaguely avian on my ankle. Warning: Imogen regrets the tattoos she got in her youth . Faded: She's now embarassed of her swallow and 'appalling' daisy designs . I am not even sure why I chose a swallow. I’m sure it had tremendous significance at the time. Or perhaps I thought it looked pretty. All I remember is that this, like drinking lots of cider and flunking my first-year exams, was an act of rebellion. And it was as achingly cool as it was painful. ‘I thought you were going to go through the roof there,’ said the ‘artist’, putting down his inky needle to admire his work. I left the place high as kite on endorphins. My mother was appalled. ‘With ankles as fat as yours, darling, why highlight them with a tattoo?’ she asked. Yet I needed more! Back then, in the late Eighties, only the really ‘out there’ had the guts to get a daisy on their foot, a dolphin on their heel or a fluoro butterfly on their hip that changed colour under the UV lighting at raves. At least, it did. Change colour that is. For what no one tells you about tattoos is that no matter how beautiful they look when first done, they fade and shift over time. Not so unique: She also has a butterfly on her bikini line but her attempt to be different has failed since many people today have tattoos . So the pretty pink flower you had when you were prancing on a podium at Pacha nightclub aged 20, or that fabulous tiger you had done in Thailand, will turn into a dull sailor-blue smudge by the time it has been rubbed in office shoes for a decade, or stretched to Calais and back by pregnancy. When you become a not-so-yummy mummy on the school run, the presence of tattoos becomes quite mortifying. What I also didn’t realise was how banal my poncy, posed, anarchic statement would become. It seems that every fortysomething who fancied themself a little racy, who did a spot of raving or holidayed in Ibiza in 1989, has a symbolic souvenir on their body. Half the country’s middle management has a flower on their thigh or a musical note on their wrist. These days, tattoos are as ubiquitous as Primark. Any girl worth her lobster tan and tongue stud is covered in doodles and motifs. And who is to blame for this? Today’s mindless, self-obsessed, misguided celebrities. There’s not a pop, rock or reality TV star who hasn’t been ‘inked’. And the more famous they get, the more tattoos they acquire. Robbie Williams, David Beckham, Russell Brand, Johnny Depp and Colin Farrell are perhaps the most obvious examples of ‘super-inking’. Not so yummy-mummy: Imogen hates her tattoos on show on the school run . Taking this dubious trend to its limits is everyone’s favourite bit of cougar-bait, One Direction star Harry Styles, who seems intent on entirely colouring himself in. The ladies are not immune, either. Angelina Jolie is an Ordnance Survey map of international adoption, Kelly Osbourne is a sticker book and Cheryl Cole’s tattoos look like a Moss Side bus shelter. Even It Girl, Cara Delevingne, has inked a lion’s head on her finger. I, too, thought my tattoos were the height of artistic expression. Now, whenever I’m trying to be glamorous or sophisticated, they rear their smudgy heads. It’s the pitying look on the shop assistant’s face as she spots my poorly drawn daisy poke out from  the overpriced mule I’m trying to squeeze my foot into. Bad influence: Robbie Williams, left, and David Beckham are covered in tattoos . Inked: Cheryl Cole revealed her new rose tattoo when she performed with Girls Aloud earlier this year . On holiday my tattoos are equally irritating. My no-longer-neon butterfly slips out of the side of my bikini, looking like an odd-shaped bruise on my right hip. The stamps on my feet, long since turned a mouldy green, go crusty and flaky and dry. And there is always a point, just as I’m about to relax on a lounger, when some bright spark pipes up: ‘What’s the hell’s that on your ankle? Have you had some sort of terrible accident?’ To which my eight-year-old daughter will pipe up: ‘It’s one of Mummy’s rubbish tattoos.’ And she’s not wrong. They are rubbish. I have considered getting rid of them but it seems you have to go through a painful palaver only to be left with an equally ugly scar. If only I could have predicted the future when I sat there, burning with rebellion, in that Bristol tattoo parlour. If I’d only known how boring and commonplace my ‘revolutionary’ fashion statement would turn out to be. They are everywhere, from the Prime Minister’s wife to everyone who has ever auditioned for The X Factor. Works of art? Angelina Jolie, left, has a number of tattoos while model of the moment Cara Delevingne has one on her finger . So if, like Becks, you are tempted by a Latin verse; or, like Peaches Geldof, you fancy inking the names of former lovers up your forearms, my advice would be: don’t. I promise you. You may not regret it in the morning but in 20 years’ time, when these follies of youth are still mocking you from your middle-aged folds and wrinkles, you will fervently wish you could turn back the clock.

Glum: Nigella Lawson seen leaving the rented Mayfair flat where she has been staying since her husband was pictured throttling her in a restaurant . When she moved out, her husband played down photographs of him grabbing her by the throat and tweaking her nose at a restaurant as a ‘playful tiff’. But Nigella Lawson appeared yesterday to have dashed any hopes Charles Saatchi may have that their marriage can be reconciled. She sent a van to take away not just her clothes but also her precious cookery utensils and recipe books – everything, it seems, but the kitchen sink. The arrival of the removal team at the . £14million marital home in Chelsea was the clearest sign yet that the . TV chef’s marriage split may be permanent. They appeared in the middle of the afternoon, evidently while Saatchi was out. Under the direction of Miss Lawson’s . sister Horatia, they trooped in and out of the house removing box after . box, including ones labelled ‘cookbooks’ and ‘kitchen’ as well as a food . processor, clothes and paintings. Other items including Miss Lawson’s . weights and exercise ball, dresses, hats, toys, toiletries and even a . bag of wrapping paper were loaded into the van. One box contained a can labelled . Cannabis – which despite the alarming name is a legal energy drink . containing hemp extract. Miss Lawson was not seen and Saatchi turned up . only after the process was complete. There were so many possessions that . the removal team made two runs. One onlooker said he had been told that some statues had been removed earlier in the day. ‘It looked very much like Nigella is moving all of her personal possessions out of the house – and isn’t going to be back in a hurry,’ he said. Many items were apparently taken to a storage facility while the rest were taken to an address some seven miles away in south-west London where Miss Lawson appears to be setting up home. She was spotted yesterday with Bruno, . her 17-year-old son from her first marriage, before heading back to the . £10,000-a-week Mayfair flat where she has been staying. The . 53-year-old has been seen there several times looking drawn and without . her wedding ring, and while her two children and sister have visited, . there has been no sign of her husband of ten years. Moving out: Miss Lawson's keep-fit equipment is packed into the van, along with bags and her Gibson guitar ... ... not forgetting the collection of summer hats and boxes of items, including a can of Cannabis Energy Drink . Seems to be a permanent decision: Workers trooped in and out of the house removing box after box, including ones labelled ‘cookbooks’ and ‘kitchen’ as well as a food processor, clothes and paintings . Saatchi, 70, has accepted a police caution for assault for the scenes that provoked their split, despite playing it down. The advertising tycoon turned modern art mogul was photographed grabbing Miss Lawson by the throat and tweaking her nose outside Scotts restaurant in central London during an extraordinary 27-minute incident three Sundays ago. When Miss Lawson left home after the photos were published a week later, Saatchi claimed he had simply suggested she moved out to wait for ‘the dust to settle’. He initially tried to explain the throat-grabbing as a ‘playful tiff’. When further pictures of him twisting Miss Lawson’s nose emerged, he said he had merely been trying to clean her nose. Miss Lawson’s spokesman last night continued to refuse to comment either on the assault incident or on the state of her marriage. But moving her belongings to a different house would appear to signal the start of a divorce between the millionaire celebrity chef and Saatchi, who is said to have a fortune of up to £100million.","Move seems to dash hopes of reconciliation with husband Charles Saatchi .

Hong Kong officials have claimed their hands were tied over Edward Snowden because the U.S. government used a wrong middle name for the NSA whistleblower on extradition papers. Provisional arrest warrant documents listed his middle name as James, whereas it is Joseph. In other papers, he was just called Edward J. Snowden, Hong Kong's Secretary of Justice Rimsky Yuen said. When Hong Kong asked the U.S. for clarification on Friday, they failed to respond in time for officials to stop Snowden's flight to Russia on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Mix up: Hong Kong officials have said they were unable to help the U.S. with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden as extradition papers listed his middle name as 'James' rather than 'Joseph' 'Until the minute of Snowden's departure, . the U.S. government hadn't yet replied to our requests for . clarification,' Yuen told the Wall Street Journal. 'Hong Kong's government had no legal basis to block his departure.' The embarrassment for the U.S. comes as Ecuador revealed it could take months to decide whether to grant asylum to Snowden. He is currently in a transit area of a Moscow airport but it is believed he is hopeful Ecuador will protect him. Ecuadorean Foreign Minister Ricardo Patino compared Snowden's case to that of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who has been given asylum in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London. 'It took us two months to make a decision in the case of Assange, so do not expect us to make a decision sooner this time,' Patino told reporters. Hideout: He is in the transit area of Sheremetievo airport in Moscow after flying from Hong Kong on Sunday . No sign of Snowden: Passengers wait in the transit area of the airport where Snowden has been for days . Hordes of journalists have camped in and around the airport, looking for Snowden or anyone who may have seen. But after talking to passengers, airport personnel, waiters and shop clerks, the press corps has discovered no trace of the elusive leaker, AP reported. Russian news agencies, citing unidentified sources, reported that Snowden was staying at a hotel in the transit terminal, but he was nowhere to be seen at the zone's only hotel, called 'Air Express'. The area where Snowden is purportedly staying serves both connecting passengers traveling via Moscow to onward destinations and passengers departing from Moscow who have passed border and security checks. The departure and transit area has dozens of small rooms, some labeled 'authorized personnel only,' where one could potentially seek refuge with support from airport staff or security personnel. There are also a few VIP lounge areas, accessible to business-class passengers or people willing to pay some $20 per hour. Snowden was not seen in those areas. Exiting the area would either require boarding a plane or passing through border control. Both require a valid passport or other identification; the U.S. has revoked Snowden's passport. Snowden, who is charged with violating American espionage laws, fled Hong Kong on Sunday and flew to Russia. Russia only acknowledged his arrival only . on Tuesday, when President Vladimir Putin said Snowden was still in the . transit zone of Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov confirmed that he remained there on Wednesday. Snowden had also booked a seat on a Havana-bound flight on Monday en route to Venezuela and then possible asylum in Ecuador, but he failed to board the plane. Despite U.S. officials called for . Snowden to be extradited immediately, but Russia said it would not as . they have no extradition treaty with the country and Snowden has not . committed a crime in Russia. 'He hasn't violated any of our laws, he hasn't crossed our border, he is in the transit zone of the airport and has the right to fly in any direction he wants,' Lavrov said. Asked if Ecuador would provide protection to Snowden while considering his request for asylum, Patino said through a translator that if Snowden 'goes to the embassy, then we will make a decision.' Patino refused to say what criteria his government would use, but added that it would 'consider all these risks', including whether it could hurt trade with the U.S. and damage Ecuador's economy.

"The 16-year-old took to the stand for the first time in Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit against AEG .

UPDATED: . 17:30 EST, 26 June 2013 . Michael Jackson's eldest son recalled the moment Conrad Murray informed him of the pop star's death. Prince, 16, took to the the stand for the first time in the Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit against AEG in Los Angeles on Wednesday. He told the court Murray simply said: 'Sorry kids. Dad's dead.' The teen is a witness in a lawsuit . claiming AEG negligently hired Murray, the doctor who was later . convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson an overdose of . the anesthetic propofol. Taking the stand: A courtroom sketch depicting the testimony of Prince Michael Jackson in LA on Wednesday . Formal: In court, Prince wore a black suit with a dark grey tie with his long brown hair tucked behind his ears . According to TMZ, Prince was in the . lounge room of the family's Holmby Hills mansion when his father went . into cardiac arrest on June 25, 2009. 'Dad's dead': The Jackson lawsuit claims AEG negligently hired Conrad Murray . He recalled hearing screams and Murray called him upstairs. Prince said . his father was 'half hanging out of the bed' while the doctor was trying to resuscitate him. He . said his sister Paris, 15, who is being treated following a suicide attempt . earlier this month, suffered the most in the wake of their father's death. He recalled she screamed that she 'wanted her daddy' while Murray was performing CPR. He said: 'She was my dad's princess. She definitely is dealing with [his death] in her own way.' He also revealed his father was . excited about going back on tour before his death but wasn't happy about . the terms of the ill-fated shows. He . told jurors his father wanted more time to rehearse and had several . tense phone conversations with promoters of his This Is It shows that . sometimes ended with his father in tears. He said his father remarked after one of the conversations: 'They're going to kill me,' but he did not elaborate. AEG denies it hired the physician or bears any responsibility for the entertainer's death. Prince . testified that he saw AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips at the family's . rented mansion in a heated conversation with Murray in the days before . his father died. The teenager said he saw Phillips grabbing Murray's . elbow. Excited but concerned: Michael's eldest son testified that his father was excited about going back on tour before . his death but wasn't happy about the terms of the ill-fated shows . Phillips 'looked aggressive to me,' Prince testified. Michael wasn't at home at the time and was probably at rehearsals, Prince said. For the first time, the teenage publicly provided details about the day his father died. Prince testified that he saw Murray performing CPR on his father, who was hanging halfway off a bed. It appeared his father's eyes were rolled up in the back of his head, Prince told jurors. Prince's eyes appeared red as he recalled being told by Murray at a hospital that his father was dead. Fatherless: Prince, his sister Paris and their brother Blanket were left without a father when Michael passed away in June 2009 . The testimony began with the teenager showing jurors roughly 15 minutes of private family photos and home videos. He described growing up on Neverland Ranch and showed the panel videos of the property's petting zoos and other amenities. After his father's acquittal of child molestation charges, Prince described living in the Middle East, Ireland and Las Vegas. He told the jury that his father was always working, but his children had no idea he was a global superstar. 'We always listened to his music, but we never knew how famous he was,' Prince said. Brotherly: Prince is seen out with his brother Blanket at the mall last week . He said he and his sister Paris watched a video of one of their father's performances and got a sense of his fame when overwhelmed fans were carried from his shows on stretchers. Prince is the first Jackson family member to testify during the trial, now in its ninth week. Attorneys have said TJ Jackson, who serves a co-guardian to Prince and his siblings, and Taj Jackson, are also expected to take the witness stand. They are the sons of Tito Jackson. Prince, his sister Paris and brother Blanket are plaintiffs in the case against AEG, which their grandmother and primary caretaker filed in August 2010. On tape: Prince is seen giving pre-recorded evidence for Micheal Jackson's inquest back in March . In court, Prince wore a black suit . with a dark grey tie with his long brown hair tucked behind his ears. He . spoke softly as he began testifying, and the first exhibit shown to . jurors was a photo taken with their grandmother on his and Paris' first . day of school. He described . his school life, including taking a summer course in U.S. history, . participating on the school's robotics team and volunteer work. Another image shown to jurors was Michael Jackson playing piano with his son while Prince was still an infant or toddler. Recorded: His sister Paris did the same two days later . Plaintiffs' attorney Brian Panish asked Prince whether he was interested in pursuing a career in music. 'I can never play an instrument and I definitely cannot sing,' Prince said to laughter from the jury. He said he wanted to study film or business when he goes to college. Prince said he helped attorneys pick out the videos and photos shown in court. Michael sheltered his children from the public eye while he was alive, often obscuring their faces while out in public. The children have been more public in recent years, appearing at a star-studded memorial service and other events honoring their father. Tragic: Michael 's official cause of death was attributed cardiac arrest caused by an overdose of propofol and benzodiazepine, which he used to help him sleep . Paris, 15, had also been expected to testify during the case but was hospitalized last month and her status as a witness remained unclear. Attorneys for AEG played a snippet of her videotaped deposition last week, and more of her testimony may be played for the jury later in the trial. Blanket, 11, is not expected to testify. The jury of six men and six women has learned numerous details about Jackson's role as a father during the case. They've heard about a secret trip to a movie weeks before Michael's death, a private circus he hired for Paris' 11th birthday, and Blanket's interest in his father's dance rehearsals. The trial is expected to last several more weeks.","The 16-year-old took to the stand for the first time in Jackson family's wrongful death lawsuit against AEG .

The owner of a suburban Chicago pizzeria was gunned down early Thursday morning saving his beloved wife during an attempted armed robbery after closing.A drifter has been charged with two counts in the shooting death of Giovanni Donancricchia, the heroic pizzeria owner who distracted the shooter while his wife fled to safety. Returning to defend his business, Giovanni was then allegedly shot in the chest, according to police.Donanricchia, 64, allegedly saw Matthew Brown-Turner enter his Cicero pizzeria after midnight Saturday morning, pull a gun on his 62-year-old wife Angela and attempt to rob the joint, officials said. Rising to the occasion, Giovanni was able to get his wife to safety before returning to defend his restaurant. The Italian immigrant was shot in the chest and the gunman fled the scene, cops said. Hero: Giovanni Donancricchia hurrying his wife out of their pizzeria before later returning to confront the armed robber . ‘Giovanni observed the offender with the gun and entered through the swinging door and physically confronted the offender, giving his wife time to escape from the area,’ the Chicago Tribune reported officials said in a statement.Brown-Turner, 25, then reportedly fled down an alley and was arrested early Friday morning after admitting to a friend during a news report that he was the killer. It didn’t take the friend long to call police and gave him up, cops told the Tribune. The alleged killer was denied bail Saturday after being charged with murder and attempted armed robbery, according to media reports. Identified in conflicting reports as either a Chicago man or as living in Buffalo, Brown-Turner later made incriminating remarks during police questioning, according to officials. This is not Brown-Turner’s first run-in with the fuzz. He previously pled guilty to felony drug possession in May 2009 after being arrested by Chicago police on suspicion of heroin possession the previous month, records show. A warrant was then issued two years later after repeated parole violations, that warrant was also served during his Saturday arraignment, according to reports. The suspect is currently being held in a local jail. Killer: Matthew Brown-Turner, 25, is allegedly shown on surveillance video pointing a gun at the Donancricchias while attempting to rob Albano's Pizzeria . Thug: Brown-Turner was snitched on by a friend after admitting to being the killer while they watched a local tv news report on the shooting . Donancricchia had owned Albano’s . Pizzeria for 25 years and had worked his whole life since immigrating to . Chicago from Sicily in 1968 at the age of 19. The restaurant was . popular among locals in Cicero, about 10 miles west of Chicago, and even . featured on multiple local and national TV shows, according to media reports.‘My . father built his business for 25 years and to shut down his dream won’t . make sense,’ the Donancricchia’s son Saverio told WLS. ‘We also want to . reopen in his memory and to continue his legacy.’ Saverio told the . station his family will reopen the now-closed pizzeria June 28, with an . off-duty police officer hired as security. Dead: Slain suburban Chicago pizzeria owner Giovanni Donancricchia, 64, shown at left on a local tv show and right in a photo provided to local media by his family. Crime scene: Albano's Pizza went from being a popular local restaurant to the location of a horrific shooting . 'It makes us feel safer. We plan on going back into the restaurant and getting it up and going and re-establishing it at some point soon. It might not be as soon as we think we can do it because it's been difficult for all of us on and off. At times we keep it together. At others we fall apart,' the slain man's son-in-law Bill Fleischer told the station. Cicero town officials hailed the popular pizza chef as a hero.‘Giovanni Donancricchia was a real hero,’ Ray Hanania, Cicero Town spokesman, said in a statement cited by multiple local media outlets. ‘When he discovered that an unknown person had entered his restaurant from the backdoor with a weapon, and confronted his wife Angela, his first concern obviously was for his wife's safety. With a disregard for the threat the killer posed to him, he ushered his wife out of the restaurant and harm's way, which saved her. He then returned to confront the suspect when he was shot and killed.'","The suspect was wanted for violating parole stemming from a felony plea deal four years ago .

'Our . mother was under oath asked in a deposition to pour over her entire . life and to admit whether or not she had ever heard or used this word . and it broke her heart to have to answer truthfully and say, yes that . she had,' Bobby Deen said during an interview with CNN. The joint appearance was the first formal statement made by any member of the family this week following the two video statements that Deen released on Friday. She was initially scheduled to be interviewed on The Today Show but failed to show up, and now she is expected to appear tomorrow morning. She has apologized about the claims that she used the n-word and wanted to hire an all-black waitstaff for her brother's wedding but feared the PR-repercussions. 'The important thing here is for people to know that that is not her heart, it is certainly not the home that we were raised in,' Bobby Deen said on CNN. Under fire: Paula Deen's testimony during a deposition has gotten her in trouble . 'We were raised in a family with love and . of faith and a house where God lived. And neither one of our parents . ever taught us to be bigoted towards any other person for any reason and . this is so saddening to me because our mother is one of the most . compassionate, good hearted, empathetic people that you’d ever meet. And . these accusations are very hurtful to her and it’s very sad.' His older brother Jamie also leapt to her defense. 'This is ridiculous. It’s completely absurd to think there is an environment of racism in our business and it's really disrespectful to the people we work with,' he said Tuesday morning. 'We have strong educated men and women of character that have been with us for 5, 10, 15, 20 years. To think they would allow themselves to be in this position is simply baloney. It's ridiculous.' 'It was a different time when my mother was growing up. There's been leaps and bounds generationally that has helped, you know, the chasm that we have of racism in this country.' Their appearance comes just hours after the latest sponsor- Smithfield, a meat producer- cancelled their partnership with Paula Deen. Financial fiasco: A number of the chef's sponsors, including Smithfield, have withdrawn their support . Explaining her side: Deen was supposed to appear on the Today Show on Friday (seen here at a different appearance in January) but she did not show up and rescheduled for Wednesday . 'Bobby and I are here today not to stem the tide for endorsements or any of those things. We're here to speak out for our mother's character and to say that our mother is a truly wonderful people that is inclusive of all people and spends a lot of her time and energies to help those people that are challenged,' Jamie said on the morning show. He went on to say that the millions that the Deen empire has raked has helped them to donate to non-profits and ‘to do good things in our life and the power we've been given through our media career’.

Government can believe it is acceptable to provide information to help . women become strippers or run a lap dancing club, which is classed as a . sex establishment. ‘While . jobs are difficult to find and money is tight, should the Welsh . Government be effectively facilitating these activities by putting . information on their website? ‘Stripping . is degrading for women and the Welsh Government should not the . promoting the view that sexually exploitative work is an acceptable . career.’ Her remarks were echoed by Lib Dem Eluned Parrott and Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies. No longer there: After the issue was raised in the Senedd, the sections about stripping, lap dancing and escort agencies were removed from the site . Stripper: The guide said that it was an offence for an agency to 'incite escorts to act as prostitutes', but provided links to websites offering 'transsexual post-operation and submissive escorts' Miss Parrott said: ‘These are perfectly legitimate businesses - however I was very surprised to learn that these factsheets are offered to young people via a link on the Welsh Government’s Big Ideas Wales website, which is aimed specifically at youth entrepreneurs. 'The adult entertainment industry is a field that is appropriate for adults, but not one that should be marketed as an aspirational career opportunity to potentially vulnerable young people' Eluned Parrott, Lib Dem AM . ‘The adult entertainment industry is just that - a field that is appropriate for adults, but not one that should be marketed as an aspirational career opportunity to potentially vulnerable young people.’ And Mr Davies added: ‘While we should all be free to choose our own career paths, the Government has a duty to put safeguards in place protecting the most vulnerable.’ After the issue was raised in the Senedd, the sections about stripping, lap dancing and escort agencies were removed from the site. Wales First Minister and father-of-two Carwyn Jones told AMs he had had just been informed of the website ‘10 minutes ago’ but promised his officials would be investigating the matter. ON STRIPPERS . Strippers and lap dancers can expect to be paid an average of £232 per evening and earn between £24,000 and £48,000, according to the Welsh Government-backed guide. 'Some strippers will remain in underwear but others may become completely naked' Male or female strippers, it says, perform choreographed dance routines while removing items of clothing - ‘some strippers will remain in underwear but others may become completely naked’. Aspiring actors, models and artists may use stripping as a source of extra income while they try to establish themselves in the entertainment industry, the factsheet advises. Tips include training in dance, kiss-o-grams or pole-dancing.ON ESCORTS . Clients typically pay between £120 and £150 per hour for ‘an escort's time and company’, it advises. Single businessmen and women typically hire an escort to accompany them to dinner or the theatre. 'Any sexual activity between a client and escort is outside of the agreed escort service' Agencies charge escorts an introduction fee of between 25 per cent and 55 per cent, with some agencies flying escorts overseas to meet clients. ‘While it is legal for agencies to provide escorts for companionship and conversation only, it is an offence for an agency to cause or incite their escorts to act as prostitutes,’ it adds. ‘Any sexual activity between a client and escort is outside of the agreed escort service, a private matter and not connected with the agency.’ON LAP DANCES . Fancy running your own lap dancing club? There is a factsheet for that too. 'The majority of customers at lap dancing clubs will be male and venues are particularly popular with stag parties' Club owners will first need a sex establishment licence from their local council. Local residents can object to lap dancing venues if they feel they are in an inappropriate area. ‘Dancers usually work on a self-employed basis and pay the club a fee to use its premises. A club will need to recruit suitable dancers for its customers and can use a dancer recruitment agency to do so,’ it adds. ‘The majority of customers at lap dancing clubs will be male and venues are particularly popular with stag parties. Groups may wish to hire areas of the club to host private parties.’ ON SEX SHOPS . Sales of adult toys and lingerie were reported to have surged during the recession, with UK consumers now spending £315million a year in sex shops, according to the advice. Emerging trends include new luxury sex . toys that target a high-end, largely female market and have become more . commonplace thanks to changing attitudes. 'These luxury toys can cost anything from £100 upwards and sales have been strong despite the recession' ‘These luxury toys can cost anything from £100 upwards and sales have been strong despite the recession,’ it says. Budding erotic boutique owners will need to get a sex establishment licence from their local council, depending on what they sell. A typical budget for fixtures and fittings comprises of mannequins for displaying lingerie (£80 each), wall display units (£60 for 10), changing cubicles (£162) and full-length mirrors (£150). Refunds on items, including underwear, latex clothing and sex toys that have been worn or used do not have to be given on grounds of hygiene, it adds.","Tips offered by Business Wales included how to run escort agency .

New York mayoral candidate Anthony Weiner raised eyebrows at a political meeting in Brooklyn on Thursday when he suggested that an elderly woman in the audience might be flirting with him. Weiner was taking questions from attendees at a Friends of the United Block Association of Brooklyn meeting when he noticed a gesture from one woman. ‘Were you raising your hand or flirting with me?’ Weiner asked the woman, who had tentatively raised her hand. Flirt? Anthony Weiner asked an elderly woman at a meeting on Thursday evening if she was flirting with him when she tried to ask a question . The off-the-cuff comment drew slightly uncomfortable laughter from the crowd, who otherwise were responsive to his message about education and public safety. After the forum, Weiner told The New York Observer that the comment had been meant as a joke. In a radio interview on Friday, he downplayed another incident from Wednesday evening when an angry Weiner had shouted down by a voter who . asked him asked about his infamous sexting scandal. Weiner told WCBS radio host Steve Scott that the incident Democratic district leader Jessie Strauss was little more than a 'New York-style' exchange of opinions. 'I’d say, basically, standing up for want you believe in, speaking clearly to people, and understanding they’re gonna push back pretty hard,' he said. 'I frankly like that tussle of politics and tussle of the way we do things in New York. You know, you can have five New Yorkers standing in a circle, and you can have 12 or 13 different opinions and I like it that way.' Weiner told WCBS radio host Steve Scott that he was all in favor of 'New York-style' exchange of opinions . Strauss had told Weiner at a small gathering in Williamsburg, Brooklyn on Wednesday that 'we can't have our politicians going around apologizing all the time,' according  Buzzfeed. Weiner responded curtly, 'Listen, if you believe that my personal failings disqualify me, don’t vote for me. But, my friend, I’m not sure exactly what it is that you’re asking for.' Strauss said he would be supporting New York City public advocate Bill de Blasio's campaign. Weiner responded by rolling his eyes. 'That's a surprise,' he quipped. After another minute of verbal sparring, Weiner said, 'I’m gonna win this election, OK? And I’m gonna govern this city really well. And I’m gonna do it based on a foundation of Democratic ideals, and I’m gonna do it on a foundation of progressive values, and I’m gonna do it smart.' He added coyly: 'If you don’t think I should even be standing here today, I certainly would respect that. I mean, you’re supporting another candidate who’s not gonna win.' Working for votes: Weiner waves an Israeli flag as he marches up New York's Fifth Avenue in the Israel Day Parade last Sunday . By the time of his exchange with Strauss, Weiner had already been confronted about the sexting scandal that forced him to resign from Congress in 2011. Chris Owens, a Brownstone Brooklyn district leader, told Weiner, 'I have a three word question, ""How dare you?""' I’m a parent, I’ve got two sons. I represent the Democratic Party. 'I am outraged and disgusted by you, both by what you did and by the fact that you have the arrogance to run for mayor now. And the only reason why you’re running for mayor is because you have this money that you’re going to lose.' 'Now you come back – not even four, eight years later – you come back after two years and you expect us to embrace you because you have good ideas?' Weiner said he appreciated the question and realized that many people will feel that way. And then he accused Owens of holding a grudge against him because Weiner supported Owens' rival when he ran for Congress in 2006. 'All I can say is that I have explained - and I’ll explain it to as many people who want to ask me about those things - that it was a personal mistake that I made,' Weiner added.",The New York mayoral candidate asked an elderly lady at a recent meeting if she was flirting with him .

While brightly coloured kit is allowed at many other tennis tournaments, Wimbledon is famous for enforcing its rule of only allowing players to wear white. But stylish female competitors have been bending the rules by adding a splash of colour to their outfits via their nail varnish. Serena Williams led the charge taking to centre court today sporting elaborately painted nails. Not entirely white: Serena Williams wore orange shorts under her skirt and intricately painted nails . Super hero: The defending champion had nails in animal print and one with the word 'pow!' The U.S. defending champion modelled a different style on each tip including animal print, diamante encrusted and comic strip 'pow!' in shades of orange. She also stretched the clothing guidelines by wearing orange shorts under her white skirt (the rules state a 'preference' for shorts to be totally white and a 'preference towards pastel colours'). Meanwhile her socks had a small orange bobble at the heel. The style savvy player also showed off her fashion process by wearing a smart white blazer as she warmed up on court this morning before taking victory against Mandy Minella. The British female players followed in Serena's style footsteps by also painting their nails in bright colours. Going for gold: But Heather Watson's glittery nails didn't reflect a glittering performance . Heather Watson displayed a glittery gold polish as she played on court two. She wrote on a blog for beauty company, Benefit, who are one of her sponsors: 'As a treat, I recently got my nails done too which was a lovely luxury. I . had complete trust in nail extraordinaire Micheal Doe, so let him . create what he wanted. He is so creative! 'All of this help me to relax and calm me down in the build-up to Wimbledon.' Unfortunately her choice of gold colour didn't reflect a winning performance as she lost to American Madison Keys - who sported dark blue nails. Dashes of colour: Maria Kirilenko, left, had neon green nails while victorious Laura Robson went for bright pink . Meanwhile, when Laura Robson played this afternoon she also followed the trend with shocking pink nails and a matching pink hair band. Her Russian opponent Maria Kirilenko broke a rule of having 'no  fluorescent colours' by painting her nails neon green. The 'predomiately in white' rule was introduced in 1963 and the 'almost entirely in white' was established in 1995, according to the Wimbledon website. The championship has set out a list of what is acceptable on-court attire stating there should be 'no solid mass of colouring', 'no dark or bold colours' and accessories like hats and socks to be 'almost entirely white.' Players must wear 'recognised tennis attire' according to both Grand Slam and WTA rules and 'a decision on the day as to whether clothing/players' turnout is suitable at discretion of Referee.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter and Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 16:00 EST, 26 December 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:45 EST, 27 December 2012 . The State Department security bosses who resigned from their post after a damning investigation blamed the agency for 'systematic failures' leading up to the terror attack on the American consulate in Libya, have reportedly not stepped down at all, drawing the ire of a Florida lawmaker. Eric Boswell, the assistant secretary of . state for diplomatic security, and Charlene Lamb, the deputy assistant . secretary for embassy security, both quit after the independent probe last week. But an explosive new report on Wednesday claims that not only have Boswell has stayed put in the State Department, and has remained on the payroll. Scroll down for video . Resignations? Eric Boswell was responsible for . diplomats security and Charlene Lamb was in charge of security for the . embassy in Benghazi . Anger: The revelations drew fire from Florida congresswoman Ileana Ros Lehtinen, a Republican, who called the State Department's actions 'pathetic' The New York Post additionally reported that Lamb and two others who had quit were merely placed on administrative leave and will soon be back at their jobs. As the paper puts it, the 'resigning' officials are merely changing desks. The revelations drew fire from Florida congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican, who called the State Department's actions 'pathetic.' Ros-Lehtinen told Fox News: 'If these reports are correct, they're pathetic examples of yet another ruse about the tragedy of Benghazi. 'State Department officials proclaimed to the world that heads would roll after the deception related to the deceitful video excuse and the non existent spontaneous protest outside the consulate. 'Now we see that the discipline is a lie and all that has happened is the shuffling of the deck chairs. That will in no way change what the ARB found to be systemic failures of management and leadership in the State Department.' Attack: A U.S. ambassador and three other Americans were killed in the terror strike that occurred on the eleventh anniversary of 9/11 . 'Systematic . failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels . within two bureaus of the State Department resulted in a Special Mission . security posture that was inadequate for Benghazi and grossly . inadequate to deal with the attack that took place,' the panel said as they released their findings last week. The report singled out the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Bureau of Near East Affairs for criticism, saying there appeared to be a lack of cooperation and confusion over protection at the mission in Benghazi, a city in Eastern Libya that was relatively lawless after the revolution that toppled Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi. Despite those failures, the Accountability Review Board determined that no individual officials ignored or violated their duties and recommended no disciplinary action now. But it also said poor performance by senior managers should be grounds for disciplinary recommendations in the future. The report appeared to break little new ground about the timeline of the Benghazi attack during which Libyan Ambassador Chris Stevens, information specialist Sean Smith and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods - who were contractors working for the CIA - were killed. Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack on the consulate in Benghazi . Stevens' slaying was the first of a U.S. ambassador since 1988. But it confirmed that contrary to initial accounts, there was no protest outside the consulate and said responsibility for the incident rested entirely with the terrorists who attacked the mission. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, administration officials linked the attack to the spreading protests over an American-made, anti-Islamic film that had begun in Cairo earlier that day. Those comments came after evidence already pointed to a distinct militant attack. U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice appeared on numerous TV talk shows the Sunday after the attack and used the administration talking points linking it to the film. Derailed: Susan Rice appeared on numerous talk shows after the attack and used talking points linking it to the anti-Islam film . An ensuing brouhaha in the heat of the presidential campaign eventually cost her the job to replace Hillary Clinton as secretary of state in President Obama's second term. The review board determined that there had been no immediate, specific tactical warning of a potential attack on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. However, the report said there had been several worrisome incidents in the run-up to the attack that should have set off warning bells. While criticizing State Department management in Washington along with the local militia force and contract guards that the mission depended on for protection, the report said U.S. personnel on the ground in Benghazi 'performed with courage and readiness to risk their lives to protect their colleagues in a near-impossible situation.' It said the response by Diplomatic Security agents on the scene and CIA operatives at a nearby compound that later came under attack itself had been 'timely and appropriate' but absolved the military from any blame. 'There was simply not enough time for armed U.S. military assets to have made a difference.' The State Department sent a classified version of the report to lawmakers on Tuesday and shortly thereafter released an unclassified version. The report made 29 recommendations to improve embassy security, particularly at high threat posts. In an accompanying letter to Congress, Clinton thanked the board for its 'clear-eyed, serious look at serious systemic challenges' and said she accepted all the recommendations. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died of smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a . desperate battle with insurgents . Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack . Some of those challenges were revealed in earlier congressional hearings when several State Department officials discussed competing demands for security and cost prohibitions. Clinton said the department had already begun to implement some of the recommendations. They include increasing by several hundred the number of Marine guards stationed at diplomatic missions throughout the world, relying less on local security forces for protection at embassies, consulates and other offices, and increasing hiring and deployment of highly trained Diplomatic Security agents at at-risk posts. Members of local Libyan militias provided some security around the consulate, but in the attack it became unclear whose side they were on. The report also called on Congress to . fully fund the State Department's security initiative, noting that . budget constraints in the past had led some management officials to . emphasize savings over security despite numerous requests from the . Benghazi mission and embassy in Tripoli for enhanced protection. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours . 'For many years the State Department has been engaged in a struggle to obtain the resources necessary to carry out its work with varying degrees of success,' it said. This has led to efficiencies but also 'had the effect of conditioning a few State Department managers to favor restricting the use of resources as a general orientation.' It said the number of Diplomatic Security staff in Benghazi before and on the day of the attack 'was inadequate despite repeated requests ... for additional staffing.' On her way out: In a letter to lawmakers, Clinton urged Congress to support the State Department's security requests . 'The solution requires a more serious . and sustained commitment from Congress to support State Department . needs, which, in total, constitute a small percentage of the full . national budget and that spent for national security,' it said. 'Congress must do its part to meet this challenge and provide necessary . resources.' Congress has denied some funding requests from the State Department for more security. In her letter to lawmakers, Clinton urged Congress to support the department's security requests, noting that 'all of us ... have a responsibility to provide the men and women serving this country with the best possible security and support.' The Benghazi attack has highlighted the larger question of how U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers can do their jobs in unstable environments, as al-Qaeda spreads across Africa, without also expanding their security. Diplomats have said that overreacting to the attack could produce what some are calling a 'Benghazi effect' that would wall them off from the people they are supposed to be engaging. In her letter to lawmakers, Clinton said, 'We will never prevent every act of terrorism or achieve perfect security' but she stressed that 'our diplomats cannot work in bunkers.' 'We must accept a level of risk to protect this country we love and to advance our interests and values around the world,' she said.","Report says that quitting State Department officials never actually left their posts and remain on payroll .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . UPDATED: . 11:29 EST, 31 October 2011 . The pilot of a plane grounded for seven hours because of the freak October snowstorm was forced to call for police back-up when passengers grew hostile. Angry passengers on the JetBlue flight from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, . to Newark, New Jersey, were kept on the tarmac in 'disgusting' conditions after being diverted to Bradley International Airport in Connecticut. In a recording obtained by LiveATC.net, the pilot said: 'I got a problem here on the airplane, I'm gonna need to have the cops on board. 'There's a cop car sitting in front . of me right here right now. I need some air stairs brought over here and . the cops brought onboard the airplane.' Scroll down for video . Blizzard: Passengers were left tired and angry after being kept on board a JetBlue flight at Bradley International Airport for seven hours. Snow had made conditions difficult . Frustrated: Passengers were left without food, water or working bathrooms and journalist Andrew Carter, pictured second row on right with his head turned, Tweeted his annoyance . The 200 passengers spent seven hours locked on board the plane without food, water or working bathrooms on Saturday. A dozen travellers called 911 after . receiving little explanation and the ordeal was only ended when police . and firefighters came on board to help a paraplegic flier who had . difficulty with the circulation in his legs. Those wanting to leave were then told by the pilot they could do so at their own risk, as the unseasonally early snow continued to fall. Loud cheers greeted the announcement. The plane had left Florida at 10am but was unable to land in Newark Liberty International Airport because of the adverse weather conditions. It sat motionless on the Bradley runway from 1.30pm to 9pm. Department of Transportation's Aviation Consumer Protection division is investigating how the debacle could have happened, with the time limit of three hours set out in the bill of rights well surpassed. JetBlue issued a statement apologising for the incident, blaming an 'unusual combination of weather and infrastructure issues'. Fury vented: Mr Carter, a reporter with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel on the flight to cover a football game in New Jersey, kept his followers updated while on board . If the government determines an . airline has violated the tarmac delay rule, that carrier could be fined as . much as $27,500 per passenger. However passengers do not get a cut of the fines. One passenger . told ABC News that while the plane was circling Newark Airport, the pilot told them from the cockpit that they only had 30 minutes . of fuel left. He then terrified passengers by adding that the nearest place to land, Bradley Airport,  was an hour away. The . pilot then came back on the PA system to provide reassurance and clarify they did in fact have enough fuel to reach . Bradley. Passengers: Mr Carter, left, was exhausted after the ordeal, while a passenger who would only identify himself as Robert, right, said he was furious . After the flight landed at 1.30pm, the pilot told passengers they would de-ice, re-fuel, and then fly on to Newark. After nothing happened for two and a half hours, a Bradley Airport representative boarded the plane to assess the situation. There were further delays when more flights landed as a result of diversions. 'The airport infrastructure was just overwhelmed,' said JetBlue spokeswoman Jenny Dervin. According to JetBlue, there were at least 23 diversions to the New Jersey airport, including six JetBlue flights and an international flight from American Airlines. A statement from the airline read: 'The airport experienced intermittent power outages, which made refueling and jetbridge deplaning difficult.' For the next four hours, passengers were told that the airport has only one tow bar to bring the planes in off the tarmac and that international flights were the priority. Then from 8.30pm a paraplegic man began to complain of intense pain. According to ABC News, he had not been moved for leg circulation or been taken to the bathroom since before boarding the plane in Florida. State police, Emergency Medical Services and an ambulance were called. Other passengers were then allowed to leave the plane. Help required: Passengers on board dialled 911 after hours of being told they were told they couldn't leave. Fire and police crews arrived . Andrew Carter, a football writer for . the Sun Sentinel newspaper in Florida who was intending to cover the Miami Dolphins game against the New York Giants at the Meadowlands, was . one of those left stranded. 'Still on the plane. We haven't . moved. Now EWR closed. Getting ugly in here. People yelling wanting to . get off,' Mr Carter posted on Twitter just before 6pm. 'This is awful customer service,' he . added to his followers. 'Still on the runway. Still blizzarding outside. Aren't there rules about how long they can make people sit here? 'To answer questions we're on Tarmac. No water. Bathrooms don't work. Don't know the reason why we're stuck. It changes. 'Lady on board just broke down. Like that guy who cried in his cell at . the beginning of Shawshank. Can someone sneak me in Rita Hayworth?' While . on the plane, Mr Carter told the Hartford Courant via cell phone: 'It's . been a long day. There's been no real explanation as to why we’ve been . sitting here for seven hours. Still delays: Stranded passengers today rest on cots at Bradley International Airport, a day after the snowstorm in Windsor Locks, Connecticut forced passengers to stay on board the plane . 'We . ran out of water. The bathrooms are all clogged up and disgusting. The . power would go off every 45 minutes for five minutes or so, and that . would freak people out. I've heard about these kind of stories. 'We're close to the terminal. We can look out the window and see other planes.' Mr . Carter said that while a few arguments popped up, passengers had mostly . been well behaved. However he added that some were . screaming: 'Get us off this plane!' Passenger Todd Bailey told FOX Connecticut that some passengers were extremely frustrated. 'People are on their last edge,' Mr . Bailey said from onboard. 'It's just crazy. Everybody . is freaking out here. They're tired of it.' Another man on the flight, who would only identify himself as Robert, said: 'At the three-hour mark they told us by law they had to let us off the plane. 'They were waiting for a tug to take us to a gate. We heard that same message at the four-hour mark, and continuing until state troopers boarded the plane for a medical emergency.' Passengers told how they thought the long delay was down to the airport rather than the airline. Another passenger told NBC Connecticut: 'I'm frustrated with this airport, because they obviously don't have very clear operations and they can't deal with anything out of the ordinary.' Victoria Lucia, another JetBlue representative, added: 'JetBlue is doing everything possible to ensure our customers affected by today's unusual combination of weather and infrastructure issues are being well cared for. We apologise for the experience.' Governor of Connecticut Dannel Malloy had arranged for 1,000 cots to be delivered to the airport to help make stranded passengers comfortable over night.

A year ago when Jonathan Antoine & Charlotte Jaconelli were heading for the finals of Britain’s Got Talent, the worst they expected to be thrown at them were barbs from Simon Cowell. His initial reaction, on seeing them, was that things could not get any worse. He then suggested Jonathan should dump Charlotte and go solo. At this year’s final, Charlotte, seated without Jonathan, saw the egg-hurling incident during classical singers Richard and Adam’s performance, but thought it was all part of the act and viola player Natalie Holt was throwing flower petals at the judges. Hitting the high notes: The classical duo were one of the show's underdog stories that captured the nation's imagination . ‘I thought, “Oh, this is different. Our act could have done with something like this last year.” Then I realised it was egg on Simon’s jacket. ‘I saw Richard and Adam afterwards. They were quite upset about it. They felt people would watch it to see the egg girl rather than watch them, but they were happy to have got as far as they did in BGT.’ ‘Thankfully it was only eggs,’ adds Jonathan. ‘If the situation was more serious and they had a gun or something else that could do harm and I was there, I am a large guy, I would literally have fallen on them and they’d be out of commission.’ For Jonathan and Charlotte, their own experience of the show has been life changing, but for 18-year-old baritone Jonathan in particular, who had severe depression during his childhood, it may have helped to save his life. At their first audition in April 2012 they sang Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion’s duet The Prayer. Charlotte says: ‘The difference between walking on stage with his head down and walking off with his head high was like watching a film. Afterwards I thought, “Is this the same person? He’s so happy!"" ‘I was probably bouncing around the room,’ he says. ‘I had not felt that elated for a very, very long time.’ What a difference a year makes: Jonathan lacked confidence when he appeared on the talent show last year. He had suffered from depression . Upstaged: Natalie Holt took centre stage on this year's final when she threw eggs at judge Simon Cowell . ‘That’s when we realised, hang on, it was a good thing we applied,’ says Charlotte. ‘This will be good for us.’ Jonathan says: ‘A year ago I had no direction in life and now it’s insane the change that has happened. 'I have grown out of my teenage angst. I am the same person but I feel different . . . like Doctor Who, I have regenerated.’ Jonathan . weighed 20st when he appeared on BGT, but he says now: ‘I am on Weight . Watchers and I have lost about 40lb, it is all on track and I’m really . happy. 'My depression came . from dealing with life. I feel I am better equipped for that now after . the adventures we’ve been through and all the stuff that’s happened. ‘When . I look back I understand why I felt that way. When you are in that . mind-set it feels impossible to get out, you are upset about everything . all the time, nothing seems bright or good. 'Being able to look back at that is something I thought I’d never be able to do and I am just so glad I can. ‘No one thing triggered it, but it was pretty much about school — I never enjoyed it. ‘Stress . and how I deal with it has been a big part of my life. That’s why I . left school. I wasn’t sure I could handle the stress of this, either, . but it has turned out for the best. ‘I no longer see a psychiatrist and I feel stable and able to cope — which is crazy considering where I was a year ago. Second place: Jonathan and Charlotte lost out on the top prize, but went on to sign with Simon Cowell's record label . Chart success: The pair's first album reached no. 5 in the charts. They are going on their first tour and will be releasing a second album in October . 'I am still on Prozac, but my dosage has gone down considerably. The irony is that being in the spotlight has helped.’ Though she plays it down, Charlotte is his guardian angel. You could see it in their first appearance where she rested a comforting hand on his shoulder, and sang his part when he joined in too early. ‘Watching somebody come from such a low place to where he is now made me think I’ve really had it easy,’ she says. ‘He’s made me appreciate things much more.’ Says Jonathan: ‘Charlotte has taught me to take no nonsense — she most certainly does not. ‘In the business we are in you could so easily get messed up and you just have to have the strength of will to stand your ground.’ Turning to Jonathan, Charlotte adds: ‘Before going on the show I was probably one of the most unemotional people you could ever meet. I think you have only ever seen me cry twice. ‘I’m not cold-hearted, I just couldn’t express emotion except through my music, but the past year has made me more vulnerable and more able to be emotional in front of people.’ Charlotte faced a crisis of confidence at the start when Cowell suggested Jonathan dump her because she would hold him back. Jonathan told him: ‘We’ve come on here as a duo. We’re going to stay as a duo.’ She says: ‘What happened in the first audition knocked me back. Competition: Last year's winner was Ashleigh Butler and her dog Pudsey, who beat Jonathan and Charlotte to the top prize of performing at the Royal Variety Show . ‘Before we went on stage at the semi-finals, I couldn’t stop crying and couldn’t work out why. I realise now it was a panic attack. Usually before we do a performance, Jonathan is very nervous and I’m there relaxed in a chair’. Jonathan and Charlotte met at school in Chigwell, Essex, when they were both 11. ‘We are like brother and sister,’  Charlotte says. ‘I’ve had a few marriage proposals,’ adds Jonathan, not believing anyone could really be interested in him. ‘I’ve stopped counting how many. It’s very weird. I know it’s in jest. I haven’t had a girlfriend for a very long time, two or three years.’ Both live at home with their parents. Charlotte is funding a house extension and Jonathan is paying for his family’s garden to be landscaped. Meanwhile, they are excited about their second album Perhaps Love, which is due out in October. And next week they begin their first tour — backed by a 16-piece orchestra, all playing live — with, they hope, no egg throwers among them. Though if there is one, they’d better steer clear of Jonathan. Jonathan & Charlotte are on tour from June 22-29.

Airlines including British Airways have been accused of purchasing headphones manufactured at a Chinese jail where prisoners were beaten for missing production targets. A former inmate of China's Dongguan Prison has claimed he made disposable headsets for British Airways, Qantas and Emirates while he was behind bars. Danny Cancian, who is from New Zealand and was released from Dongguan last year, told the Australian Financial Review prisoners were punished for slow production rates by being 'taken outside and tasered'. British Airways has emphatically denied using prison labour in its supply chain and said all of its suppliers were subject to 'rigorous' checks. Prison labour: A former inmate at a Chinese jail claimed prisoners mass produced disposable headsets for airlines including Qantas and British Airways . Accusations: Former Dongguan inmate Danny Cancian has claimed he produced disposable headsets for airlines including Qantas and British Airways while imprisoned in the Chinese jail . Qantas immediately suspended its sourcing arrangements in the wake of Mr Cancian's allegations in order to carry out an investigation, while Emirates has said it is 'satisfied' there is no evidence of any unethical practices in the headset manufacturing process. Mr Cancian also told the AFR he made inductors that were used in electrical appliances for local Chinese companies while at Dongguan - including one that supplies home appliance giant Electrolux. The Kiwi, who spent four years behind bars after a man he kicked during a restaurant brawl died, said it was a 'cruel environment' at the prison, adding: 'You wake up every morning wondering if you are going to survive the day.' Claims: British Airways rubbished claims from a former inmate of China's Dongguan Prison that it had purchased disposable headphones manufactured by prisoners at the jail . Investigation: Qantas announced it had suspended its current sourcing arrangements pending an investigation . He claimed some prisoners' hands were left 'deformed' by the repetitive nature of producing the intricate inductors, which he said inmates made by winding copper wire around a ceramic cylinder. Another inmate, who withheld his name, also told the Australian newspaper he had made inductors and headphones for Qantas while serving time at Dongguan. 'We also made them for Emirates, British Airways and lots of others,' he said. Dongguan City Joystar Electronic Co, which uses prison labour to fulfil large orders, told the AFR it had made 300,000 sets of disposable headphones last year to fill an order for Airphonics - a main supplier of Qantas. During visits to the prison reporters from the paper also saw trucks leaving Dongguan's factory complex that bore the logo for Dongguan Dazhong Electronic Co, which lists Electrolux and Emerson Electric among its clients. Qantas has released a statement announcing that it was 'very concerned' by the allegations and that sourcing arrangements had been suspended pending an investigation. 'The allegation that our supplier of economy class headsets, which is in Vietnam, used a third party company in China to help fill an order contradicts the verbal and written assurances we've had from this supplier that their supply chain process met our standards - including the ethical treatment of workers. 'To be clear, Qantas has no relationship with the Chinese-based company at the centre of AFR's claims,' the statement goes on, insisting that the airline conducts regular audits of factories to ensure the strict conditions it places on suppliers are met. British Airways said its headsets were provided by Linstol, which only uses credited factories when producing the headphones. 'Our supplier has made it abundantly clear that it has never used prisons in China to produce any British Airways headphones,' a spokesman said.'We pride ourselves on providing the very best products for our customers. 'All of our suppliers are subject to a rigorous procurement process prior to appointment and we enforce compliance to a robust Labour Standards Policy throughout the duration of the contract,' it said, adding that Linstol, like all BA suppliers, were required to comply with its ethical code of practice. 'Cruel environment': Chinese authorities have made it compulsory for prisoners to work while they serve out their sentences - this photo shows inmates sewing clothes at a jail in Anyang city . A spokesman for Swedish firm Electrolux told MailOnline that Dahzong was an 'indirect supplier', but added that it had carried out an audit and found no evidence to indicate it had sourced any products made using prison labour. 'It is obviously an extremely complicated issue to know exactly what came from where when you go right down the supply chain,' pointing out that the number of indirect suppliers could run to 'hundreds of thousands'. He added that while the firm's audits had indicated no cause for concern, any evidence of the kind of production methods outlined in the AFR report would be 'completely unacceptable' to Electrolux and against the company's code of practice. Emirates told the Australian newspaper its headsets were made by an 'industry-leading' company that supplied hundreds of other airlines. The airline is yet to respond to MailOnline's request for comment. Emerson, which has said all of its suppliers are expected to comply with the firm's code of conduct, has said it is investigating the matter. Chinese authorities have made it compulsory for prison inmates to work while they serve their sentences. Prisoners in Dongguan are paid 8 yuan ($1.40) a month for their work.

The number of people living in England and Wales rose by nearly 400,000 in a year despite curbs on migrants, according to official estimates. They show population growth has not slowed down after the years of large-scale immigration. One reason is a high birth rate among recent immigrants, the Office for National Statistics analysis says. The number of people living in England and Wales grew by almost 400,000 thanks to continuing high immigration and the highest birth-rate for 40 years . The latest figures, for the 12 months . to the end of June last year, mean the population of England and Wales . has grown by 3.97million, or 7.5 per cent, over the past decade of high . immigration and rising birth rates. In the latest 12-month period, the . Coalition’s second year in office, ‘growth is about average to that seen . over each of the last ten years’ – but was still the highest in Europe. Estimates for the whole UK have not . yet been published but figures suggest the total must be close to . 64million – and is likely to reach 70million in around 16 years if the . growth continues. At that point, many analysts believe . overcrowding will put unbearable pressure on housing, transport, water, . power and services such as health and education. More than 250,000 Londoners left the capital city, possibly because of the high cost of living . The England and Wales population grew by 396,900 thanks to a high birth rate and migration . Annual population growth first hit . 400,000 in 2005 after the borders were opened to Poles and other Eastern . European citizens in 2004. Since then, net migration – the number . by which the population grows after both immigration and emigration . have been counted – has often been 200,000 a year or more. Immigration curbs introduced by Home . Secretary Theresa May mean net migration fell to 155,500 in the year to . June 2012. However, total numbers rose steeply because there were . 239,100 more births than deaths – more than double the level in 2003. The ONS said: ‘The number of births was at a 40-year high – the largest since 1972.’ People are flooding south from northern cities, the ONS said. Urban populations in the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the West Midlands fell, while more than 24,000 extra people moved into the South East. The South West showed a gain of nearly 20,000, mainly because of retirees moving to Dorset, Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. Some 52,000 people left London, largely young families moving to commuter towns for cheap housing and better schools. The ONS said: ‘The general trend is for more people to arrive than leave for regions in the south and east, whereas for the more northern regions, the net flows show more people are leaving than arriving.’ Recent migrants tend to have high birth rates, with many of the right age to have children. Sir Andrew Green of think tank Migrationwatch said: ‘This is yet more evidence of the impact of mass immigration. 'We have the largest number of births for 40 years and the greatest addition to our population among European countries. ‘The dual effect of immigration and extra births accounts for about two-thirds of our population growth.’ A quarter of the increase came in London, where birth rates were high and where many immigrants settle. The increase of 396,900 people in . England and Wales was the highest in Europe, followed by France at . 319,100 and Germany with 166,200.","Net migration in England and Wales was 155,000, says ONS .

African nations were rolling out the welcome signs for President Obama ahead of his official visit which begins this week. Obama, First Lady Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha are scheduled to depart Washington on Wednesday morning. The President will visit South Africa, Tanzania and Senegal. In the latter country, artist Ouzin put the finishing touches on a painting of Obama and Sengal's leader Macky Sall today ahead of the President's visit. Warm welcome: Artist Ouzin puts the finishing touches on a painting of Obama and Sengal's leader Macky Sall ahead of the President's visit . The sign read: 'Welcome to Senegal your home Obama' and had portraits of a smiling Obama and more serious looking Sall. When Obama arrives . in Africa this week, there will be one notable omission from his travel . itinerary: Kenya, the birthplace of his father and home to many of his . relatives. Concerns about Kenya's political situation have trumped Obama's family ties. Kenya's new president is facing charges of crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court, accused of orchestrating the violence that marred the country's 2007 election. Ahead of Uhuru Kenyatta's victory earlier this year, a top Obama administration official warned Kenyans that their 'choices have consequences' - a remark that now appears prescient given the president's decision to skip a stop in his ancestral homeland. Return to his roots: Obama has not visited Kenya since 2006 when he was a senator (pictured) 'The optics of that, of a . presidential trip, are not what he wants to be demonstrating right now,' said Jennifer Cooke, Africa director at the Center for Strategic and . International Studies. The . White House did consider a visit to Kenya when they contemplated an . African swing during the president's first term, before Kenyatta's . election. That trip never happened, but Obama pledged that he would, in . fact, visit Kenya before leaving office. 'I'm positive that before my service as president is completed I will visit Kenya again,' he said in a 2010 interview with Kenya's state broadcaster. White House officials say they respect the right of Kenyans to choose their own leaders. But deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the U.S. also has 'a commitment to accountability and justice'. President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle Obama and their daughters Malia and Sasha (pictured last week returning from a trip to Ireland and Germany) are due to leave for Africa on Wednesday . 'Given the fact that Kenya is in the aftermath of their election and the new government has come into place and is going to be reviewing these issues with the ICC and the international community, it just wasn't the best time for the president to travel to Kenya,' Rhodes said. Kenya's government has been muted in its response to the president's decision to leave the county off his itinerary. 'It's for the Americans to decide where Obama goes,' spokesman Muthui Kariuki said. 'There are 54 nations on the African continent and he's only visiting three, so I don't see the real big deal about not going to Kenya.' But Sam Ochieng, a political activist who lives in Kibera, Nairobi's largest slum, said the U.S. president was sending a message about Kenya's political problems by putting democratic values ahead of his personal connections. 'It would be a shame for an American president to come to Kenya and shake dirty hands,' Ochieng said. By now, Obama's ties with Kenya are a well-known part of his unique family history. Barack Obama, Sr. was born in the western Kenyan village of Kogelo, moved to the U.S. to study, and met and married the president's mother in Hawaii. He left the family soon after his son was born. Obama made his first trip to Kenya in 1988, after his father's death, and wrote extensively about the visit in his memoir 'Dreams From My Father.' 'My name belonged and so I belonged, drawn into a web of relationships, alliances and grudges that I did not yet understand,' he wrote. The president visited Kenya two more times, most recently in 2006 as a freshman senator. He was greeted by cheering crowds in the capital of Nairobi and in Kogelo, where he spent time with his grandmother and visited his father's grave. He and wife Michelle Obama also publicly took HIV tests, part of their campaign at the time to reduce the stigma surrounding the virus. But Obama's nationally televised speech criticizing the government for failing to curb corruption or instill trust in its people earned him a cold shoulder from Kenya's leadership. Kenya's presidential spokesman said at the time that Obama was ignorant of Kenyan politics and had yet to form an understanding of foreign policy. Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has been charged by the International Criminal Court as an 'indirect co-perpetrator' for the crimes of murder, deportation, rape and inhumane acts . Kenya is an important strategic partner for the U.S. in East Africa. But the recent election has complicated the relationship. Johnnie Carson, who until April served as head of the State Department's Africa bureau, said in the lead-up to this year's election that 'choices have consequences,' a comment that was viewed as a warning against electing Kenyatta. His remarks were widely criticized as an inappropriate intrusion into a sovereign nation's elections. Kenyatta, the son of the country's first president, has been charged by the ICC as an 'indirect co-perpetrator' for the crimes of murder, deportation, rape, persecution and inhumane acts allegedly committed by his supporters in the aftermath of the 2007 elections. He insists he is innocent of any wrongdoing. More than 1,000 people were killed in the ethnic violence that followed the flawed 2007 contest. The ICC has pushed back the start of Kenyatta's trial until Nov. 12. Kenyan deputy president William Ruto will also face similar charges at the international court in September.","Barack Obama will visit Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania on tour .

Britain's first purpose-built campsite for new age travellers is facing the axe after only a handful agreed to move in because residents were told to pay council tax. Officials were due to spend £1.2million of public money transforming an existing illegal camp into fifteen state-of-the-art eco plots. They promised communal allotments, a children's play area, a site manager and environmentally friendly features such as composting bins. But the plans have stalled after one . tenth of the itinerants currently there do not want to stay because . they will not want to fork out for council tax. Changes: A £1.2m plan to transform this illegal travellers site at Haldon Hill near Exeter has been scrapped because residents have refused to pay council tax . The council had secured a massive £1.2million grant from the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) to pay for the camp, described as the first of its type in the country. It has left Teignbridge Council in Devon facing a £40,000-a-year management bill for an mostly empty site - or handing back the grant to the Government. But if the council take the grant, build the site but then no-one moves in - the authority may be forced to pay back the £1.2million. And they say the only way to make that back would be to increase council tax on local residents by 0.7 per cent a year. A council spokesman said: 'The HCA have advised the council that should the site cease to operate they are entitled to require repayment in full of the £1.12m grant. 'Assurances have been sought from the HCA that they would not do so but these have not been given. 'Should the site cease to operate, the land value is likely to be a very small fraction of the grant value, leaving the council at risk of having to repay most if not all of the £1.12m back to the agency.' Cash: The local council had secured a grant for the site but if the transformation is shelved they may have to pay back the cash . The woodland setting has been used illegally for twelve years at Haldon Hill, a nationally recognised wildlife haven off the A38 near Exeter in Devon. It became home to caravans, old buses, huts and shelters housing up to 100 travellers causing tensions with the local community. Following a ten year debate to find a solution Teignbridge District Council won a massive grant to upgrade facilities and make the camp legal. It expected existing travellers to jump at the chance to stay - with the only condition being they would have to pay rates to contribute to the £40,000 annual running cost. In return, travellers were asked to sign a lease agreement, pay service charges and council tax. It is thought there are around 100 people there - made up of 15 families and single dwellers. The council hoped the families, who have children at local schools, would apply to stay at the new-look camp. But only 11 people have applied to remain - and nearly all made up of single travellers and not families. Closed off: The woodland at Haldon Hill has been used illegally by travellers for twelve years . Paused: The site was due to have 15 state-of-the-art eco plots with communal allotments, a children's play area, a site manager and environmentally friendly features such as composting bins . Teign Housing, the firm lined up to run the camp, has now said it does not wish to take on an under-used site, populated by mostly single people. The HCA has given the authority until July 12 to decide if it wants the grant after which the funds will be re-allocated. Philip Vogel, executive spokesman for housing and planning at the council, added: 'The situation has changed, specifically around the amount of formal expressions of interest and subsequent financial risks to Teignbridge and that requires further careful consideration.' Ever since the community first pitched up near pretty Kennford village in August 2001 it has officially been 'tolerated' by Devon County Council, the overall authority for the area. A report for the executive recommends the project should only proceed provided 'satisfactory financial safeguards and indemnities' are obtained to address the 'financial implications of failure'.","Plans included 15 eco plots with attached allotments and composting bins .

NHS staff treated a man suffering from a diagnosed brain tumour like 'just another drunk' in the vital hours before his death, an inquest has heard. Terry Day, 35, had been diagnosed with a brain tumour in July 2010 but it was not acknowledged when he was rushed to Basildon Hospital A&E with head pains and vomiting just over a year later. His brain tumour haemorrhaged causing Mr Day to go into cardiac arrest which eventually killed him on August 14, 2011. An inquest at Chelmsford Coroner's Court Terry's father, Brian Day, 59, a bricklayer from Cranham, said: 'They just left Terry in a cubicle to die - it's absolutely disgusting what they did. 'They treated him like just another drunk even though they knew he had a brain tumour.' Terry had been just three weeks away from marrying Samantha Blythe, 38, a PA from Rainham, Essex, when he was admitted to hospital in the early hours of August 13, 2011. Ms Blythe recounted the moment police called at her door just hours before she was due to go out for her hen night. She said: 'The police knocked at my door at 6.45am on the Saturday and told me I needed to come to hospital immediately. 'It was absolutely horrible. 'We were set to marry at St Andrew's church in Hornchurch three weeks later and we were trying for a family. 'Doctors had told us he had a low grade tumour and had given him medication to control fitting. 'I wasn't ready to lose him that soon.' Terry Day (right) was just three weeks away from marrying Samantha Blythe (left) Terry's mother, Gail Major, 56, a housewife from Hornchurch, paid a tearful tribute to her son following the emotional inquest. She said: 'I can't express how wonderful he was and we loved him so much. 'The treatment the hospital gave him was absolutely appalling - he just didn't get any. 'He hadn't drunk for hours and he fitted in the ambulance so they knew he had a brain tumour. 'He was severely let down by the hospital as we have been told there was a window of opportunity where treatment could have saved him.' Ms Blythe recounted the moment police called at her door just hours before she was due to go out for her hen night . Mr Day, from Wickford, Essex, had been out drinking with friends when he began suffering with pains in his head and vomiting. The epilepsy sufferer was rushed to Basildon Hospital in an ambulance but suffered a fit on route. Consultant Saad Abdulla told the inquest: 'The fits should have been the most important factor here. 'The alcohol factor should increase the risk to make it even more important to be cautious. 'Our system should have dictated neurological observation. A continuing observation would see a pattern, but this wasn't there.' Mandy Brokenshaw, emergency planning liaison officer at the hospital, said an internal investigation had suggested staff relied too heavily on ambulance notes which stated paramedics thought the patient was drunk. She added: 'Concern about his tumour was noted, but not addressed.' Mr Day was placed on a saline drip - a treatment commonly prescribed for drunk people - despite being only slightly over the drink-drive alcohol limit. The inquest heard that staff failed to make regular observations on Mr Day every half-an-hour as had been recommended despite concerns due to his brain tumour as well as his epilepsy. Mr Day went into cardiac arrest when his tumour haemorrhaged causing irreversible damage to his brain. Mrs Brokenshaw added: 'Failing to take regular observations is a clear breach of practice. 'From an investigation's point of view the hospital does take any serious incident seriously and does investigate it thoroughly and any findings and recommendations will be implemented by the trust.' Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said there had been 'very serious failings' in the care given at Basildon Hospital after recording a narrative inquest verdict.

Appeal: Brady, who appeared at the tribunal via video-link, wants to be transferred from Ashworth secure hospital back to prison to die . The astonishing £300,000 a year cost . of keeping Ian Brady in a secure hospital was highlighted yesterday as a . key reason to send him back to jail. Lawyers for the Moors Murderer said he was merely ‘an elderly, socially isolated man talking to the television’. They complained the killer had been . ‘tired’ during his self-glorifying four-hour testimony to his mental . health tribunal on Tuesday and accused the authorities of treating him . as a ‘special case’ by denying him his wish to die in jail. The annual bill for keeping the 75-year-old at Ashworth on Merseyside is almost eight times the £40,000 cost for a jail place. The difference is accounted for mainly . by the army of medical staff. Despite accommodating no more than 228 . patients, Ashworth employs 937 staff, with an annual running cost of . £67million. That includes 11 consultants and 649 . nursing staff along with psychiatrists and psychologists, social . workers, occupational therapists, teachers, physical health care staff, . chaplains, cooks and cleaners, quite apart from security staff. Relatives of the five children . murdered by Brady and Myra Hindley in the 1960s have said the money . would be better spent tracing the remains of Keith Bennett, which have . never been found. In closing submissions yesterday to . the tribunal, which itself is costing £250,000, his barrister, Nathalie . Lieven QC, said he suffered from a ‘static’ personality disorder rather . than mental illness and argued there was ‘no therapeutic benefit’ in . keeping him in hospital. She said the psychosis which resulted . in Brady’s transfer from prison in 1985 had not returned, and claimed . episodes psychiatrists had classed as hallucinations were no more than . ‘an elderly, socially isolated man talking to the television’. Faces of evil: Brady and his accomplice Myra Hindley, pictured in police mugshots after their capture . During his evidence on Tuesday Brady, . who is seeking to be moved back to a normal prison, referred to his . killings as ‘existential’ and ‘recreational’. But Miss Lieven said his ‘refusal to . accept blame’, ‘lack of empathy’ and ‘sense of grandiosity’ could be . explained by personality disorders which could be addressed in prison. He would also have been tired from giving evidence at the end of a long tribunal, she added. The killer also refused to accept that . by eating toast and soup he was no longer meaningfully on the hunger . strike he began in 1999, a stance Miss Lieven put down to wanting to . avoid ‘loss of face’. Ashworth Hospital in Merseyside: Brady, who has been kept in the high security unit since 1985, has already been told he will never be considered for release even if he does succeed in being sent back to prison . She also highlighted previous Press . reports that Brady had a penchant for Creme Eggs as an example of how . his life at Ashworth was susceptible to leaks. Miss Lieven argued that Ashworth was . treating Brady as ‘a special case’, questioning whether it had been . ‘drawn into a battle’ with him and ‘lost perspective’. ‘Is he to be kept for ever in hospital . at massive public expense because of the possibility of a relapse . despite more than two decades without one?’ she asked. Victims: Keith Bennett, whose body has never . been recovered, left, and John Kilbride, right, were two of the . youngsters killed by Moors murderer Ian Brady during the 1960s . Lured to their deaths: Brady and his partner . Myra Hindley killed Edward Evans, left, in October 1965. Pauline Reade, . right, 16, disappeared on her . way to a disco on July 12, 1963 . Eleanor Grey QC, for Ashworth . Hospital, however, said Brady continued to suffer ‘chronic’ mental . illness for which he refused therapy, adding that ‘the nature of the . case of untreated schizophrenia is that it does not vanish’. Miss Grey also said Brady had not . given a ‘cogent’ reason for why he wanted to return to prison, instead . telling anecdotes about being locked up in the 1960s with other . notorious criminals. Judge Robert Atherton said the panel hoped to announce its decision by the end of the week. Along with Hindley – who died in 2002 – . Brady murdered Pauline Reade, 16, John Kilbride, 12, Keith Bennett, 12, . Lesley Ann Downey, ten, and Edward Evans, 17, between 1963 and 1965. Victims were lured to their deaths, sexually tortured then buried on Saddleworth Moor above Manchester.","Brady's legal team accuses authorities of making the killer a 'special case'

Prospering: London Transport commissioner Sir Peter Hendy's pay was doubled after he was awarded a bonuses totalling a huge £319,000 . Transport bosses have been awarded two years’ worth of deferred bonuses thanks to their ‘impressive’ performance during the Olympics. The biggest winner was Transport for London commissioner Sir Peter Hendy, who nearly doubled his pay packet. He took home more than £652,000 after receiving bonuses totalling £319,000. Sir Peter topped the pay list, but three of the capital’s transport chiefs earned more than £500,000 in total, with 12 taking home more than £300,000. Top staff were told their bonuses for the last two years would be deferred until after the Games, with payment dependent on the quality of the transport service during the Olympics. Paralympic gold medallist  Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, who is paid £25,000 to chair the remuneration committee that approved the pay packages, said: ‘London’s transport network had a record-breaking year with hugely improved reliability and tremendous support for a  successful London 2012 Games under the gaze of the world. ‘Based on this impressive level of performance and delivery, the remuneration committee decided it was right that the deferred performance awards for the two years before the Games should be paid in full.’ Sir Peter said the figure was justified because TfL successfully reached nearly all of its targets. He added: ‘I have never worked so hard in my life as in the Olympic year. Neither have my colleagues.’ Transport chiefs in London have received bonuses totaling £2.5m following a 'successful transport performance' during the 2012 Olympic Games . London bus drivers demonstrate outside the offices of Transport for London, in central London, as part of a campaign by the Unite union for an Olympic payment . However critics claimed their success . was partly thanks to costly deals with transport unions, who agreed not . to strike during the Games. And others recalled the ‘scare  tactics’ employed by officials – who urged people to work from home. They also set up reserved lanes to speed VIPs to their destinations, with fines for anyone who strayed into them. TfL said Tube customer satisfaction . was at an all-time high of 84 per cent during the Olympics, while bus . passenger satisfaction hit a record level of 82 per cent. They . also pointed out that Sir Peter and TfL’s other chief officers had seen . their basic pay frozen for a fourth consecutive year. But . Bob Crow, general secretary of the RMT transport union, said: ‘It is . outrageous that the top brass across TfL are raking in such huge . bonuses. ‘Our union will take the loadsamoney culture at the top into full account as we make our own pay claims.’ And .

Members of a sadistic paedophile ring convicted of grooming vulnerable underage girls for sexual exploitation threatened to decapitate the baby of one of their young victims, a court heard today. The Old Bailey in central London was also told that one of the Oxford-based sex ring’s victims has considered suicide while another suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the abuse. Statements from some of the victims' parents were read out in court ahead of the sentencing of the gang, in which they described how the seven defendants had ruined their daughters' lives. Evil: Six of the defendants listened from the dock, but the court heard that Mohammed Karrar (left), 38, had refused to come up from the cells. He was convicted last month with his brother, Bassam Karrar (right), 34 . The court heard the extent of the girls' psychological damage, with one admitting she is prone to depression and self-harming, while another suffers nightmares, panic attacks and flashbacks. A statement from the mother of that girl said her daughter developed chronic insomnia and also suffered a minor stroke, believed to have been brought on by the stress of what happened. She said the family had to leave their home, leading to her daughter receiving a call in which she was threatened with having her face cut off, and relatives having their throat slit and being decapitated. As a two-day sentencing hearing got underway, referring to a statement written by one of the victims herself, prosecutor Noel Lucas QC told the court: ‘She has suffered psychological issues. ‘She has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and aggressive bouts of anxiety and depression as a result. She mentions that although she has managed to have a successful job and make a life for herself, she has missed out on a vital part of her education. ‘Her self-confidence as a result of the abuse is next to none. She struggles with trust and with romantic relationships. Physical affection is something of which she is wary.’ Sickening: Another two brothers, Akhtar Dogar (left), 32, and Anjum Dogar (right), 31, were also convicted at the Old Bailey of charges including rape, trafficking and organising prostitution . Reading directly from the victim impact . statement, Mr Lucas said: ‘It's hard for my family when I go through . depressive stages because I'm prone to self-harm.’ Another mother said of her now grown-up daughter: ‘I think the damage done to her by these men is irrevocable.’ 'Her self-confidence as a result of the abuse is next to none. She struggles with trust and with romantic relationships. Physical affection is something of which she is wary' Noel Lucas QC, prosecuting, referring to victim impact statement . The statements also referred to the failures of local authorities in dealing with what was going on, and how some of the parents themselves were blamed before the truth was uncovered. One father said: ‘If these men hadn't been doing such vile things to my daughter then we wouldn't have had to deal with social services, children's homes or police. I don't want any other parent to feel as impotent as we were.’ He added that the abuse had had a ‘devastating effect on me and my family’. The man's wife also made a statement in which she said of their daughter: ‘She went from a loving, sweet young child to a sullen, frightened and evasive child. Facing jail: Kamar Jamil (left), 27, and Assad Hussain (right) , 32, were also found guilty after the five-month trial . ‘She went to being frustrated and . aggressive towards me if I tried to reach out to her. I guess that was . her way of trying to deal with what was happening to her. Convicted: Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, was found guilty of charges involving the abuse of underage girls . ‘She was protecting me from the truth and horror of what she was being subjected to. They took my daughter's teenage years, which I'm sure seems obvious, but those teenage years were taken from me too.’ She also referred to the failure of the police and social services in finding out what was happening and protecting the girls, writing that they were made to feel like they were ‘over-reacting’. ‘I can recall countless incidents when I have been upset and frustrated by various professional bodies,’ she said. Six of the defendants listened from the dock as Mr Lucas outlined some of the victim impact statements, but the court heard that Mohammed Karrar, 38, had refused to come up from the cells. He was convicted last month with his brother, Bassam Karrar, 34, and another two brothers, Akhtar Dogar, 32, and Anjum Dogar, 31, of charges including rape, trafficking and organising prostitution. Kamar Jamil, 27, Assad Hussain, 32, and Zeeshan Ahmed, 28, were also found guilty following the five-month trial during which the jury was told the gang sexually exploited girls as young as 11.","One victim 'considered suicide' and another 'now suffers from PTSD'

More than 100,000 jobless foreigners will be forced to learn English to the standard of a nine-year –old or face losing their benefits. Chancellor George Osborne said it was a ‘reasonable requirement’ to expect people who want to work in Britain to learn the language. He unveiled a £350million package of extra support to prepare the jobless for the work place including forcing them to attend jobcentres more often. Tough: New rules will force the unemployed to wait seven days instead of three before they receive Jobseekers Allowance, with the money spent on extra help to get them back into work . But anyone who loses their job will have to wait longer before they can start receiving benefits. The new welfare package was one of the biggest surprises in Mr Osborne’s statement, setting out £11.5billion of spending cuts for 2015-16. The savings are on top of £3.6billion in cuts to the welfare budget already announced. People who lose their jobs will have to wait seven days - instead of three- before receiving Jobseeker's Allowance. But the Lib Dems have blocked any more cash savings being made in the welfare budget, so the money will be spent on making the jobless do more to find work. Warning: George Osborne told the Commons that people who refuse to learn English will have their benefits cut . A Tory MP who tried to air his support for getting tough on the unemployed who have poor levels of English was left red-faced after including a spelling mistake in a tweet. Andrew Selous, a former shadow pensions minister, took to Twitter to voice his support for cutting benefits for people on Jobseekers Allowance who do not speak English to the standard of a 9-year-old. But he accidentally wrote: 'Strongly support the loss of benefits unless claimants lean English.' The unemployed will have to go to jobcentres every week instead of once a fortnight, have their job hunting efforts regularly reviewed and given extra training in writing CVs and preparing for job interviews. Mr Osborne said: 'Those first few days should be spent looking to work, not looking to sign on.' People who refuse to make an effort to learn English will also have their benefits cut. Around a third of the £350million in savings will be spent on English lessons for 100,000 people to reach Entry Level Two standard – the average language ability of a 9-year-old. Mr Osborne said: ‘From now on, if claimants don’t speak English, they will have to attend language courses until they do. ‘This is a reasonable requirement in this country. It will help people find work. ‘But if you’re not prepared to learn English, your benefits will be cut.’ A new ‘upfront work search’ will require all new claimants to prepare for work and search for jobs right from the start of their claim. Half of claimants will have to turn up to jobcentres once a week, instead of once a fortnight at present . Half of jobseekers will have to sign on at Jobcentres once a week, instead of once a fortnight, to give them more incentive to find work. All Jobseekers Allowance claimants will also have to verify their claim every year. And unemployed single parents will have to start preparing for work when their youngest child turns three, but they will only face sanctions for not taking a job once their child is five years old. Mr Osborne added: ‘Half of all jobseekers need more help looking for work, so we’ll require them to come to the jobcentre every week rather than once a fortnight. ‘We’re going to give people more time with jobcentre advisors and proper progress reviews every three months. ‘And we’re going to introduce a new seven day wait before people can claim benefits. ‘Those first few days should be spent looking for work, not looking to sign on. ‘We’re doing these things because we know they help people stay off benefits and help those on benefits get back into work faster.’","New language tests to ensure job hunters are able to work in Britain .

A self-proclaimed knight who pocketed £1.8m in disability benefits while performing beachball tricks in a luxury pool has been ordered to pay back £270,000. 'Sir' Barry Brooks, 50, was jailed for eight years last August for claiming he was disabled and so weak he could not pick up a telephone. In reality, the fraudster took the wheel of a string of luxury cars and ran his own motorcycle shop. 'Sir' Barry Brooks has been ordered to pay back £270,000 after pocketing £1.8m while claiming he was disabled . Brooks was filmed dive-bombing into a swimming pool during a holiday in the south of France in 2008 . He was filmed serving meals in a pub, carrying plumbing equipment, and dive-bombing into a swimming pool during a holiday in the south of France in 2008. Brooks, who insists on being called Sir, claimed up to £29,000 a month under the Access to Work Scheme. Together with Derek Arnold, 56, and Stephen Isaac, 55, they pocketed £1.88m by submitting bogus claims for travel, support staff, and office equipment, for themselves and for disabled employees at the bogus firm they ran Access Audit Corporation (AAC). Claims were even submitted for daily taxi fares in Brooks' name while he was holidaying in Koh Samui, Thailand, and Gran Canaria. At a hearing into the profits of their scam, Brooks tried to claim the Rolls Royce and Jaguar bearing the personalised numberplate BAZ belonged to his father John and could not be seized as a proceed of crime. He also tried to claim four houses registered in his name belonged to relatives. The court heard Brooks had plans to buy properties in the Caribbean and Florida, and hoped to buy Duncraig Castle, in Scotland . But Brooks refused to attend Southwark Crown Court to back up his arguments, and Judge Martin Beddoe ordered Brooks to repay £268,910.40 or face a further three years in prison. 'Baz is an abbreviation for the name Barry and not for the father's name, John', he said. 'The Jaguar and Rolls Royce were used by the defendant on foreign trips, and there was evidence to suggest he arranged the finance for the purchase, as well as the storage after his arrest. 'Mr Brooks has declined to appear today and put forward no evidence to support these claims.' The conman, who stood in the dock for his earlier . sentencing with the aid of a walking frame, earned £1,810,161.67 from . the scam, and put forward no evidence of what he could realistically pay . back. The judge . agreed with prosecutors that the benefit of his crime could be judged . through bank accounts, luxury cars, a property portfolio, as well as . more than £53,000 in cash found at his home. But he said it was clear Brooks had nowhere near that amount to repay. Brooks claimed up to £29,000 a month under the Access to Work Scheme . Brooks suffered minor whiplash in a 1993 car crash, but had routinely overstated his injuries ever since. When Brooks was arrested he owned six properties, including a penthouse on the Costa del Sol. The . court heard he had plans to buy properties in the Caribbean and . Florida, and hoped to buy Duncraig Castle, in Scotland, and a £2m . mansion in the English countryside. At . the house he shared with Arnold in Bromley, Kent, officers discovered a . designer kitchen, collection of fine wines, and around £50,000 in cash. 'What the evidence has revealed is a . wholesale assault on a part of the benefit system designed to assist . some of the more vulnerable members of our society' - Prosecutor Andrew Marhsall . They owned a pub in Dockenfield, Surrey, where Brooks was secretly taped serving food to undercover investigators. The duo was also plotting to expand their scam in an attempt to build up 'some sort of empire'. Prosecutor Andrew Marshall said: 'Throughout all the time he was under surveillance Barry Brooks was walking freely all the time he was seen. 'He was never seen in a wheelchair and was never seen using crutches or a stick at all. 'What . the evidence has revealed is a wholesale assault on a part of the . benefit system designed to assist some of the more vulnerable members of . our society.' He . described AAC as being set up purely to 'control the claims' of . employees, though there was 'no evidence' of any work being done. 'Any . good that came out of AAC was entirely collateral to its main purpose . which was to be a vehicle for systematic fraud,' said the barrister. He added: 'Staggering amounts of money went to funding a wealthy, greedy lifestyle.' Brooks declined to attend Southwark Crown Court (pictured) where he was ordered to repay £268,910.40 or face a further three years in prison . The Access to Work Scheme is a government programme designed to assist disabled people in obtaining and remaining in employment. Arnold, who was also found guilty of . claiming disability living allowance on the grounds he was 'dependent on . his children for lifting and carrying', was also recorded on film . driving, shopping, and carrying plumbing to and from different vehicles. In sentencing Brooks, the judge said he was sure the fraudster did not need to use a wheelchair. 'What . I am satisfied of is that when it suited you, you exaggerated the fact . of that accident and the claims to a disability requiring you to use a . wheelchair were then as they remain now a sham', he said. 'You purported to be champions of the disabled but throughout this period you have been their enemy, encouraging suspicion by what you did rather than succour. 'The Jaguar and Rolls Royce were used by . the defendant on foreign trips, and there was evidence to suggest he . arranged the finance for the purchase, as well as the storage after his . arrest' - Judge Martin Beddoe . 'You eroded public trust in a systematic way and have made it harder for genuine claimants to get help for what they need. 'The jury saw through the nonsense you have been pedalling for years about yourself and they saw through the dishonest web the two of you had so carefully and craftily weaved. 'This was a brazen, callous, sophisticated, and entirely parasitical fraud by the two of you over several years.' Brooks and Arnold, both from Bromley, Kent, were convicted of conspiracy to defraud between January 1, 2004, and March 3, 2010 after a trial last year. Brooks was found guilty of a further charge of fraud between January 16, 2007, and March 17, 2010 after claiming £18,745 in disability living allowance. Brooks was ordered to sell his two luxury cars and pay back £268,910.40 in the next three months or face a further three months behind bars. Isaac, from Cardiff, admitted conspiracy to defraud before the trial. Arnold was also convicted of claiming £2,874 in disability living allowance after saying he was dependent on his two children for lifting and carrying. Arnold was jailed for eight years and Isaac two-and-a-half years. A separate hearing into how much Arnold will pay back will be held on July 11, but the court has been told he only has £114.20 to his name.","Barry Brooks was jailed for eight years for falsely claiming he was disabled .

In court: Eddy Shah arriving at the Old Bailey today where he admitted he lied to police about his sex sessions with a prostitute . Newspaper tycoon Eddy Shah has admitted he lied to police about his sex sessions with a prostitute because he was scared his former Bond girl wife would leave him. Shah, 69, would meet call girl Susan Davies in top London hotels from the mid-1980s when he was away from his Manchester home. The businessman was first introduced to her at a book launch at Harrods but when police raided his Cheshire mansion he said he started seeing her after the launch. According to Shah, his mind went into 'meltdown' and he 'just blurted it out' because he was terrified his disabled wife Jennifer, who featured in the film Casino Royale film, would leave him with their three children. ‘I did lie,’ he told the jury today at the Old Bailey in central London. ‘I lied to the police principally because I was trying to protect my relationship at home. ‘I knew it had been a longer relationship with Susan I don’t know how much longer. Stupidly I tried to lie. ‘Having started that to protect myself at home I kept it going.’ The court has heard Shah slipped thousands of pounds into Davies’s handbag after steamy sessions in his grand suites at hotels like the Grosvenor House and the Intercontinental. Prosecutors claim she also introduced him to a 14 year-old girl and they had sex up to eight times, sometimes as a threesome. But Shah insists he never had sex with the teenager. He eventually made a statement to police admitting he had lied about the number of times he had sex with co-defendant Davies. ‘It was only after that I realised it was going to go to court and I was not prepared to lie in court that I came back and said this was the length of time I was seeing Susan Davies,’ he told the jury. In the first police interview, Shah also suggests he was being blackmailed by Davies. Shah once owned a portfolio of local papers and started the now defunct Today. Eddy Shah pictured with his wife Jennifer outside the Old Bailey where he gave evidence today . He also owned and ran the Wiltshire Golf and Country Club, in Royal Wootton Bassett, until February this year after putting it on the market for £3.5m. Shah admits that Davies was one of up to four prostitutes he was seeing when his life got ‘a bit wild’ in the early 1990s. But both he and Davies insist the teenager, who is now 34, was never involved in any sexual encounter with them. Mother-of-four Davies is also accused of introducing the girl to her boyfriend Tony Pallant, 53, for threesomes.

An entire troop of bunga bunga girls have been placed under investigation for perjury for lying at Silvio Berlusconi’s sex trial. Judges say 30 witnesses gave false testimony to the court during the former Italian premier’s trial for sex with an underage prostitute and corruption. Half of those accused of lying in Berlusconi’s defence are the starlets and showgirls who attended his infamous bunga bunga parties. Verdict: Italy's former Prime Minister Silvio . Berlusconi, pictured left last year, was found guilty of paying . Karima El Mahroug, nicknamed Ruby the heart-stealer, pictured right, for . sex at a 'bunga bunga' party . The former Italian premier was yesterday handed a seven year jail sentence for paying for sex with exotic dancer Ruby the Heartstealer when she was just 17. He then used his power to cover it up, the Milan court ruled, securing the release of Ruby, real name Karima el Mahroug, from police custody by claiming that she was the niece of then Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Over a two year trial a parade of dancers, models and reality TV stars who had attended the dinners at Berlusconi’s mansion gave evidence for the defence. Showgirl Barbara Faggioli testified that she never saw ‘hard’ scenes or touching between the ex-premier and his female guests. After . dinner at the lavish parties, which took place at Berlusconi’s opulent . Palazzo Grazioli in Rome and one of his villas outside Milan, the . one-time cruise ship crooner ‘would often sing’, she said ‘and tell . anecdotes, sometimes political gossip.’ Aspiring model: Maria Esther Garcia Polanco, pictured when she was winner of Miss . Roberta 2007, told the court that the bunga bunga parties were no more than 'innocent fun' Marysthell . Garcia Polanco, a Dominican singer and model, who released a song . called 'bunga bunga' told the court that the sordid sexcapades . chronicled by the international media were no more than ‘elegant . dinners’ and ‘innocent fun’. But . this version of events contrasted wildly with that of the prosecutors, . who said Ruby was ‘part of a prostitution ring set up for the personal . sexual satisfaction of the defendant.’ In a wiretapped conversation one guest invited to a dinner told a friend that Berlusconi’s mansion was a ‘whorehouse,’ the prosecution said. After attending a party at Arcore she told a friend: ‘It’s unbelievable, you have no idea,’ she said. ‘You can’t begin to imagine what goes on there.

Berlusconi denies all charges, which he says are part of a left conspiracy against him among the judiciary. After the verdict he said: ‘This is a violent sentence. I will resist the persecution.’ Protests by supporters of his centre right party against the sentence were planned tonight in Rome.

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 09:58 EST, 26 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:57 EST, 26 June 2013 . Tony McGuire (pictured today) has been spared jail after destroying his family's £300,000 home with a sledgehammer . An electrician who destroyed his family's £300,000 house with a sledgehammer in a feud over his inheritance has walked free from court today. Father-of-six Tony McGuire battered the semi-detached house to pieces and caused £126,000 of damage. McGuire, 50, was left fuming when his father left the home to his brother Terry in his will when he died. Cardiff Crown Court heard McGuire had carried out expensive extensions to the house and lived at the property for two years after his father died. But he flew into a rage when he was handed an eviction notice by his younger brother Terry McGuire, 44. The court heard he took a sledgehammer to the family home while he was watched by astonished neighbours. Electrician McGuire targeted the extensions and garage which he built himself - leaving a pile of rubble of bricks, roofing tiles, glass and insulation. Prosecutor Jason Howells said: 'It appears Terry tried to reach an amicable agreement for Tony to live in the house - but no agreement was reached. 'Police attended the property while the damage was being caused but due to confusion about who owned the home they took no action.' The court heard £126,000 of damage was caused to the home in the Birchgrove suburb of Cardiff. McGuire admitted causing the damage to police - but said the will of his father Allan McGuire had been 'created fraudulently'. He had contested the will in civil courts but had lost after their sister Tina had supported brother Terry. McGuire was watched by neighbours as he took a sledgehammer to the property, causing extensive damage . McGuire targeted the extensions and garage he built himself - leaving a pile of rubble of bricks, roofing tiles, glass and insulation . But McGuire said he couldn't accept that the house didn't belong to him. Eugene Egan, defending, said McGuire 'lost focus and judgement' when he decided to hammer the house to rubble. Mr . Egan said: 'For 15 years before his father's death he had been the . person who was going to inherit the home and he felt sore about that . change. 'When people fall out within a family context it can bring out the very worst in someone. 'He thought he had a moral right to . do what he did. Sadly, a moral right didn’t equate to a lawful excuse . and gave him no defence whatsoever.' He . said McGuire has since been made bankrupt but was a 'man of good . character' who had never had any trouble with the law before. 'It was a crime committed out of . bitterness and resentment which led a good person like yourself to . commit an act of very considerable evil. You have also caused inestimable harm to your own immediate family' - Judge Philip Richards . Mr Egan said McGuire's wife Darriel is registered blind - and he has six children aged 33 to school age. The court heard he is the sole breadwinner in the family for his three dependent children. Judge Philip Richards told him: 'It . was an ugly crime committed against members of your own family which has . caused substantial loss to a property which your father decided they . were entitled to. 'It . was a crime committed out of bitterness and resentment which led a good . person like yourself to commit an act of very considerable evil. You have also caused inestimable harm to your own immediate family.' Judge Richards said he had 'nothing . but sympathy' for McGuire's brother who suffered 'enormous pain' as a . result of his determination to 'get even'. He told McGuire: 'It seems that a getting even mentality would gain nothing for others who are entirely innocent. McGuire, who pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage, was given a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid work . McGuire caused £126,000 of damage to the house after he was left fuming when his father left the home to his brother Terry . 'Given your excellent history and the appalling harm a substantial prison sentence would have on your children I can just about suspend the sentence I must pass.' McGuire, of Cardiff, pleaded guilty to causing criminal damage. He was given a two year prison sentence, suspended for two years, and ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid work.","Tony McGuire was watched by neighbours as he caused £126,000 of damage .

"By . Mark Duell . PUBLISHED: . 11:34 EST, 26 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:49 EST, 26 June 2013 . Trial: Magdalena Luczak (pictured), of Coventry, is accused of depriving Daniel Pelka of food . A mother accused of starving her four-year-old son before beating him to death was an aggressive drunk who threatened the boy's father with a knife, a court heard today. Magdalena Luczak, 27, and her partner Mariusz Krezolek, 33, of Coventry, are accused of depriving Daniel Pelka, of food, force-feeding him salt and locking him in a home-made prison. The toddler was so skinny he resembled a ‘concentration camp victim’ before he died from a head injury in March 2012, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Daniel's biological father Eryk Pelka said he regularly found Luczak drunk while looking after their son, and the pair would regularly argue - with her lashing out by hitting him over the face. He told the court she once threatened to stab him with a knife at a party, and he had to call the police. They met in Poland in 2004 then moved to Coventry a year later before Daniel was born. But their relationship deteriorated and he eventually left Britain to return to his native Poland when Daniel was aged one. Mr Pelka said he had ‘fierce arguments’ with Luczak. Speaking through a translator, he said: ‘They are only my thoughts but she was aggressive towards me. She was shouting and calling me names and she was trying to hit me as well.’ Mr Pelka said at a party in 2007 police had to be called after Luczak threatened him with a knife. He said: ‘We were at the party together and we had been drinking together. We were arguing all the time and she grabbed a knife. 'I rang the police and the police came and arrested both of us because I was drunk as well. I was pushing her away.’ Mr Pelka said Luczak would ‘repeatedly’ slap him across the face. He said on two occasions he had to call into work and pretend to be sick because Luczak had not come home from a night out. He also said he came home late from . his job as a lorry driver on at least two occasions and found her drunk. He said: ‘She was drunk and Daniel was lying on his own and no-one was . looking after him.’ The pair moved to Coventry in 2005 and shared various addresses before and after Daniel was born in December 2007. Hearings: A file sketch of Magdelena Luczak (right) and Mariusz Krezolek (left) at Birmingham Crown Court . Police were called to several domestic incidents involving the couple - sometimes by Mr Pelka and sometimes by Luczak. Mr Pelka denied ever being violent towards his ex-partner. Daniel, who was so badly starved he weighed just 1.5st - 15lbs below average - was found by horrified paramedics with a head injury on March 3 last year. Earlier in the trial the court heard his levels of emaciation were like those seen in parts of Africa and his Body Mass Index was too low to even register on the scale. Despite being rushed to University Hospital Coventry doctors were unable to resuscitate him and he was pronounced dead. Mr Pelka told the jury when he left England to return to Poland, Daniel was ‘really chubby’. He said: ‘He was as all normal children are, he was healthy, he was not neglected. Even his granny said that taking into consideration he had been drinking English milk, he's really chubby.’ Toddler death: Daniel Pelka was so skinny he resembled a 'concentration camp victim' before he died . The jury also heard from Grzegorz Lukasik, a former colleague of Krezolek at an automotive factory in Coventry. He said Krezolek had described Daniel as 'autistic' and said he did not respond to beatings because of his mental condition. At the trial: Eryk Pelka, biological father to Daniel Pelka, leaves Birmingham Crown Court after giving evidence today . He said: ‘I remember he said that he [Daniel] had autism and it's not even worth beating him because he won't feel any pain because he's autistic. I have never heard any good words about Daniel.’ Meanwhile the court also heard that Mr Pelka broke up with the boy's mother after she cheated on him with one of his friends. He said that he and Luczak's relationship had deteriorated after she found a new partner - who had been living with the couple at the time. He said: ‘I was sick and tired of the arguments and the cheating.  I found out Magdalena had cheated on me with on of my mates. ‘When I left our relationship was not very good, Magdalena already had a new partner. Their relationship started just before I left England but I can't remember exactly when it was. ‘I got up once and went upstairs and Magdalena just told me about it. He lived with us at the time.’ Mr Lukasik, who worked with Krezolek, said Daniel's stepfather had spoken of sending the youngster 'back to Poland'. He said: ‘He mentioned they would like to send him to his biological father but because there's a very strong bond between Magdalena and Daniel it probably won't happen.’ Lead investigator Detective Inspector Chris Hanson, of West Midlands Police, said when he examined Daniel's body on a mortuary slab the little boy's body was in a ‘wretched state’. DI Hanson, who has investigated 80 child deaths over 21 years, said the schoolboy's hair fell out when he inspected the corpse. He said: ‘I was pretty shocked actually, I would describe him as grotesquely thin. His body was in a completely wretched state and I was completely shocked at the severity of his emaciation. ‘His appearance was akin to a child from famine-affected Africa. He was very pale. Even wearing plastic gloves I could feel that his hair was very frail and brittle.’ DI Hanson said Daniel's hair had fallen out when he inspected his skull. He said: ‘I could also see to the back of his head there was a swelling. I felt the injury and I instantly suspected it was a subdural [brain] bleed. It was obvious to me Daniel had been murdered.’ Krezolek and Luczak have admitted child cruelty, but deny charges of murder and causing or allowing Daniel’s death. The trial continues.
