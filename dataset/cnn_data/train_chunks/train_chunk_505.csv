A seven-year-old boy from Texas who developed a rash . under his arm during a July trip to San Diego, California, died after . contracting a flesh-eating bacterial infection, the Medical Examiner’s Office . announced on Thursday . Tevita Alatini’s official cause of death . was listed as bacterial necrotizing myositis, which means that infection spread . into muscle tissue. Officials listed autoimmune hemolytic . anemia - a malfunction of the immune system - as a contributing condition. Infection: Tevita Alatini died while from a flesh-eating bacteria that he contracted while on a camping trip with his family in San Diego . Tragic death: Tevita, seven, pictured with his baby sister, was said to have been throwing up before a red rash developed under his armpit . Alatini passed away on July 10 at Rady . Children’s Hospital, three days after arriving in San Diego with his family . from Spring, Texas, for a family reunion, the San Diego Union-Tribune reported. Shortly after the boy’s death, his uncle Sione . Niko told the North County Times that the family had traveled to Lake O’Neill . Recreational Park on the Camp Pendleton Marine Corps base on July 9 when his nephew . fell ill and developed a rash. Helen Niko, one of Tevita's aunts, told San Diego's 10News.com: 'He was happy and climbing light poles and running around and having a good time just like any other seven-year-old would. 'At first we thought it was nothing to worry about as he was born with a weak immune system but then the rash came.' Flesh-eating infections are often contracted while . swimming in a lake or pond, and the boy's parents told the press in July that their son ventured into the water during the camping trip. However, Niko insisted that his nephew did not even go near . the lake. 'He was sitting down and just hanging out with everybody, just having family time. Then he . was complaining about a pain on his side, and it started off just like a . little rash, and then it just became bigger,' Niko said. Mystery: The boy's parents initially said their seven-year-old son went swimming in a lake at Camp Pendleton, but his uncle claimed Tevita did not go near the water . Heartbroken: Tevita was vacationing with his parents, older sister and brother and baby sister when he feel sick and was rushed to the ER . Swimming in lakes always carries certain risk because of the bacteria hazards associated with it. A variety of microorganisms are naturally present in soil and water in the environment. Bacteria is just one of these. While they can be beneficial, they can also pose a serious and potentially fatal hazard to those who swim in ponds and lakes. Bacteria have several routes of . infection. They can be swallowed, you can breathe them in, or they can . come in contact with an open wound. One drop of untreated water can . contain millions of bacteria. It is possible to develop skin infections, . ear infections, eye infections, diarrhea, and respiratory infections . from contaminated lake water. One of these bacteria are known as Primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). It is a rare and usually deadly disease caused by infection with the amoeba Naegleria fowleri. Naegleria thrives in warm, stagnant bodies of fresh water when temperatures are above 80 degrees. Consequently, cases of the disease usually occur from June through September. Source: Yahoo . 'He was just laying there not feeling . well, and he was throwing up again, and he just became real sick. He wasn’t really responding to his mother, so that’s when . they decided that he needed to go straight to the ER.' The autopsy conducted on the seven-year-old’s body did . not address how the boy might have developed the rare disease. Tevita’s parents noticed a large red spot . under his left arm after their lake outing and took their son to the base . hospital, where doctors recognized the signs of a severe infection and had the . child airlifted to Rady Children’s Hospital. The boy went into medical arrest shortly . after arriving at the hospital and was pronounced dead early the next morning. The day after he died, the family held a memorial for the seven-year-old at the beach at Camp Pendleton. The bacteria that led to Tevita’s death is . known to release toxins which destroy tissue, thus earning it the term ‘flesh-eating.’ According to the National Necrotizing . Fasciitis Foundation, it can be caused by various types of germs which usually . enter the body through a wound in the skin, sometimes as small as a paper cut. They can also be swallowed or inhaled. One drop of untreated water can contain . millions of bacteria. It is possible to develop skin infections, ear . infections, eye infections, diarrhea, and respiratory infections from . contaminated lake water. If caught early, the rapidly progressing . disease can be stopped with the use of antibiotics, according to the foundation.","Tevita Alatini, 7, died while vacationing with family at Camp Pendleton, San Diego .

I . have taken her away from you all but I could not leave her with no . money. That would be cruel.’ Makin was charged with murder ten . months later. She suffered brain injuries from the anti-freeze which . caused her loss of mobility. After the verdict, Chloe’s father, . Michael, who had split from Makin three years before the tragedy, said: . ‘This has been an absolute nightmare. I just want Chloe to rest now.’ Regret: Makin's solicitor said outside court that Makin was 'seriously mentally deranged' and 'must now live with the consequences' Scene of the crime: Police were called to the family home (pictured) in Bury, Manchester where Chloe was found dead in February 2011 .","Dawn Makin, 35, became depressed after being sacked for leaking confidential information about patients to her former boyfriend .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:31 EST, 31 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 06:40 EST, 31 August 2012 . An Amish bishop accused of orchestrating hair-cutting attacks in Ohio coerced women at his settlement into having sex with him so he could turn them into better wives, a court has heard. A woman has testified that what started out as hugs turned into kisses and then sex, which she said she resisted at first. Prosecutors say the alleged sexual 'counseling' of married women shows the control Samuel Mullet Sr. had . over followers at the Amish settlement he founded two decades ago. Sexual force: A woman testified that Samuel Mullet Sr, pictured, accused of orchestrating the hair-cutting attacks, forced married women to have sex with him so he could turn them into better wives . Arrests: These five men, along with reputed Amish breakaway sect leader Samuel Mullet Sr and Emanuel Shrock, were arrested by the FBI and local sheriff's deputies last fall on federal hate crime charges . 'He would say things like `I can't . understand why you won't obey me, the other ladies can,' the woman said. 'I always gave up. I was afraid not to.' The 16 people accused of carrying out the hair-cutting attacks last fall all lived on Mullet's settlement in Bergholz, eastern Ohio near the West Virginia panhandle. The government contends that the hair cutting was motivated by a religious dispute between Mullet and other Amish bishops who had sought to limit his authority. Those accused of planning and taking part targeted the hair and beards of the Amish because of its spiritual significance in the faith, prosecutors said. Court: Amish men leave the federal courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio . Drama: The case has drawn national attention to life in the Amish community . Mullet has denied any involvement. His defence attorneys had tried before the trial began to bar any testimony about the alleged sexual 'counseling.' They argued that there was no proof of such sexual conduct and that mentioning it would be highly prejudicial. U.S. District Court Judge Dan Aaron Polster told jurors after the woman took the stand that Mullet was not charged with any sex crimes and that they could only consider the testimony as it relates to charges in the indictment. The woman said her husband had a mental breakdown in the summer of 2008 and was in the hospital when Mullet suggested that her husband's trouble stemmed from dissatisfaction with his marriage. Mullet told her he wanted to help the couple with marriage counselling, and she agreed to his request to move in with him, she said. Community: Amish children play baseball during recess outside their school in Bergholz . Refusal: After refusing Mullet's sexual advances, the woman testifying said that she moved her family out of the Amish settlement and to Pennsylvania (Lancaster County pictured) At first, he wanted hugs, she said, adding that she learned he had asked the same of other women. 'Next we had to kiss him or maybe we had to sit on his lap,' she said. 'I'm not sure what was first.' Even asking for a hug was a startling request, she said, in a community that values modesty and is deeply religious. Amish women in the most conservative churches traditionally wear long dresses, bonnets over their hair and frown upon drawing attention to themselves. She went along with Mullet's wishes because she thought it would help her husband, she said. One evening after moving into Mullet's home, another woman came to her and said that he wanted to see her in his bedroom, she said. She said she refused, but Mullet was insistent. The woman said she moved out of the house after about two months when her husband returned to the settlement, but she continued to see Mullet at his home. 'I was afraid not to go,' she said. The woman said she finally told Mullet a month later that it had to stop. He called her a whore, she said. The woman and her husband soon left the Amish settlement where they had raised their children and moved to Pennsylvania. 'We just took our children and a few suitcases with our clothes,' she said.","Woman tells court he asked for kisses and hugs which led to sex .

The mother of the former college volleyball star shot dead in her car during a botched robbery has revealed she was on the phone to her daughter when her killers struck. Lisa Boken described the horrifying moment the phone cut out while she chatted with her daughter Megan on August 18, immediately knowing 'something isn't right'. Her daughter, who graduated from St Louis University in Missouri last year, had been fatally shot in the neck and chest after returning to her college city for an alumni volleyball match. Loss: Megan Boken (left) is pictured with her older sister, Annie Palazzolo, who arrived at the crime scene on August 18 to find her sister had been shot and taken to hospital, where she died . Megan, 23, was sitting in her car before driving to the game when 18-year-old cousins Keith Esters and Johnathan Perkins allegedly targeted her with the intention to steal her phone. Her mother said she was chatting with her daughter when the men ambushed the vehicle. 'The last sound that came out, I didn't quite know what it was,' Mrs Boken, from Wheaton, Illinois, told the Chicago Tribune. She frantically tried to call her daughter back, but Megan didn't pick up. 'I'm a mom, I'm always worried. I felt at the time that... OK, something isn't right here,' she said. Paul Boken immediately called their older daughter, Annie Palazzolo, who was also visiting St. Louis and asked her to go to the Central West End neighborhood where Megan had been visiting a friend. Star: Boken, who had graduated in 2011, was in St Louis, Missouri to play an alumni volleyball match . Missed: Her father Paul Boken, left, has not been able to return to work since the murder of his daughter . Palazzalo arrived to find news trucks and police tape, and a detective took her and her husband, Joe, to the hospital, the Tribune reported. The officer revealed very little of her sister's injuries - only that she had been shot - which led Palazzolo to fear the worst. Her sister was pronounced dead on arriving at hospital. 'I couldn't even cry,' Palazzolo said. 'I was just sitting there, holding on to my husband. You think tears are going to come, and nothing comes out. I thought for sure it was not her. It couldn't be her. This was all a mix-up.' Her father said, a week after her funeral, he continues to struggle with the murder and has been unable to return to work. Megan also left behind younger sister Mary, 15. Sisters: Megan, right, also leaves behind her 15-year-old sister Mary, left . Promise: Megan's funeral was held last week, where friends remembered her as lovable and determined . 'These kinds of things don't happen to . us. It doesn't happen to people in Wheaton. It was just so shocking,' he said. His wife added: 'There's going to be a hole in our family that's never going to be the same.' The Bokens said they are unsure how adjust to life without Megan, who was a central part of family life after moving back to her parents' home following her college graduation in 2011. She had started a gruelling job working for a financial adviser and, on the suggestion of her mother, had taken the summer off, allowing her to spend time with her family and train for a marathon. After her death, hundreds turned out for her wake and funeral, distributing bracelets baring her name and remembering her as a determined but popular volleyball player. The family has also been inundated with . support, cards, bagels and lasagne from members of their community, with . one friend saying there was enough food for a whole year. Brutal: Boken was sitting in her car, pictured, talking on her phone when her attacker opened her driver's side door and fired . multiple times at close range in a botched robbery . 'Murderers': Keith Esters, 18, allegedly shot Megan in the neck and chest after he struggled to snatch her phone. He then escaped in a car driven by his cousin, Johnathan Perkins, 18 . Police believe the 23-year-old was shot during an attempted robbery. Esters is accused of shooting her after he failed to snatch her phone. He jumped in a car driven by Perkins, police said. Esters was charged with first-degree murder, attempted robbery and armed criminal action, while Perkins was charged with second-degree murder, attempted robbery and armed criminal action. Boken's family said in a statement released after the suspects were arrested they were 'gratified with the progress in this case and with the efforts of the St Louis Police Department'. Yet, speaking with the Tribune, they added that the arrests do not bring any resolution. 'Right now I just can't get over the fact that she's gone,' Lisa Boken said.","Megan Boken, 23, shot fatally in neck and chest in St. Louis on August 18 .

One of the most respected figures in the Catholic Church has launched a scathing attack on his fellow clergymen in a last ever interview published the day after his death. The former archbishop of Milan and papal candidate Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, who died on Friday aged 85, said the Catholic Church was '200 years out of date'. Martini, once favored by Vatican progressives to succeed Pope John Paul II and a prominent voice in the church, gave a scathing portrayal of a pompous and bureaucratic church failing to move with the times. Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini lies in state at Milan cathedral. In his final interview before his death he criticised the Catholic Church for being 'pompous' and '200 years out of date' Attack: Italian Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, right, pictured with Pope Benedict . XVI in 2005, launched a scathing critique of the church in his final . interview before his death on Friday . 'Our culture has aged, our churches are . big and empty and the church bureaucracy rises up, our rituals and our . cassocks are pompous,' Martini said in the interview published in . Italian daily Corriere della Sera. 'The Church must admit its mistakes and begin a radical change, starting from the pope and the bishops. The pedophilia scandals oblige us to take a journey of transformation,' he said in the interview. In the last decade the Church has been accused of failing to fully address a series of child abuse scandals which have undermined its status as a moral arbiter, though it has paid many millions in compensation settlements worldwide. Martini, famous for comments that the use of condoms could be acceptable in some cases, told interviewers the Church should open up to new kinds of families or risk losing its flock. Much-loved: Thousands queue outside Milan Cathedral yesterday to pay their respects Cardinal Martini, who died aged 85 . The current Archbishop of Milan Dionigi blesses the coffin of Cardinal . Martini yesterday. In his last ever interview Martini said the Church must undergo a period of . 'radical change' or risk losing its flock . 'A woman is abandoned by her husband . and finds a new companion to look after her and her children. A second . love succeeds. If this family is discriminated against, not just the . mother will be cut off but also her children.' In this way 'the Church loses the future generation', Martini said in the interview, made a fortnight before he died. The Vatican opposes divorce and forbids contraception in favor of fidelity within marriage and abstinence without. A . liberal voice in the church, Martini's chances of becoming pope were . damaged when he revealed he was suffering from a rare form of . Parkinson's disease and he retired in 2002. In a letter marking Martini's death, . Pope Benedict remembered him as a 'skilful teacher and preeminent . biblical scholar,' and recalled his dedication to Christian works. The coffin of Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini is carried to Milan's . cathedral on September 1, 2012. Martini had been suffering from . Parkinson's disease for years and his condition had degenerated last week . Sombre: The casket containing Italian cardinal Carlo Maria Martini rests inside Milan's Duomo yesterday . Martini . retired because of his age in 2002 after 22 years as head of the . diocese, revealing at the same time that he was suffering from a form of . Parkinson's disease, which hurt his chances of becoming pope three . years later. Pope John Paul II was instead succeeded . in 2005 by Pope Benedict XVI, a hero of Catholic conservatives who is . known by such critical epithets as 'God's rottweiler' because of his . stern stand on theological issues. Martini's final message to Pope Benedict was to begin a shake up of the Catholic church without delay. 'The church is 200 years out of date. Why don't we rouse ourselves? Are we afraid?' Outspoken: Cardinal Martini's liberal opinions sometimes raised the hackles of Church conservatives . A . Jesuit intellectual, Martini was reported to speak 11 languages. But . his liberal opinions sometimes raised the hackles of Church . conservatives. He once told . an interviewer that even issues as controversial as birth control and . women priests could be seen in a different light in the future. 'Certainly . the use of condoms in particular situations can constitute a lesser . evil,' Martini said in an interview with the Italian magazine l'Espresso . in 2006. 'There is the . particular situation of married couples in which one of the spouses is . affected by AIDS. This person has an obligation to protect the other . partner and the other partner also has to protect him or herself.' The Catholic Church, which runs many . hospitals and institutions to help AIDS victims, opposes the use of . condoms and teaches that fidelity within heterosexual marriage, chastity . and abstinence are the best way to stop the spread of HIV/AIDS. It says promoting condoms to fight . the spread of AIDS fosters what it sees as immoral and hedonistic . lifestyles and behaviour that will only contribute to its spread. Martini remained a prominent voice in . the Church, and in May spoke out about the leaks scandal that led to . the arrest of Pope Benedict's butler. Martini appealed to Church leaders to 'urgently win back the trust of the faithful' after the scandal. After he retired from the Milan post, he spent about six years in Jerusalem, returning to his first love - Biblical studies. After he lost the ability to swallow . around two weeks ago, Martini refused to be fed artificially, his . neurologist Gianni Pezzoli said. 'We saw the inexorable consequences of . his affliction, which progressively robbed him of speech, reducing it . to a whisper that was barely audible, and of his movement,' said an . article published on the Milan diocese's website.","Former archbishop of Milan and papal candidate Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini died on Friday aged 85 .

UPDATED: . 21:22 EST, 3 September 2012 . Hobby: Paul Smith's 10-year habit of making DIY bombs in a workshop at his parent's house in East Hull came to an end in April when neighbours got sick of his explosions setting off their car alarms . An electrician gave a whole new meaning to DIY by building and setting off homemade bombs as a hobby, a court heard yesterday. Paul Smith was so obsessed with constructing explosive devices from a workshop at his parents’ house that his family gave him a birthday cake in the shape of a bomb. It carried the message: ‘Paul 40 today. Hope it goes with a bang.’ However, neighbours got so fed up with him setting off explosions that they complained to police. One explosion in Smith’s back garden set off all the local car alarms. Officers raided the home and found a huge collection of bomb-making equipment, Hull Crown Court was told. It included material of the type used by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Smith told officers he was not a terrorist or fanatic, but made the devices as a hobby for fun. He told police: 'I don’t know what all the fuss is about. Everyone knows I make small bombs. Some people collect stamps, I make small bombs.' He learned his skills from the internet and spent the past ten years making increasingly sophisticated bombs, the court heard. Some parts were made from household objects, such as a lunchbox which was turned into a remote-controlled detonator. He also collected gunpowder from unexploded bombs found in eroding cliffs on the East Yorkshire coast. Recognition: Unemployed drug user Smith set off so many of his homemade devices that this year his family bought him a bomb-shaped cake for his 40th birthday . In his workshop police found two live . pipe bombs and 20 to 30 detonators as well as shotgun cartridges, 9mm . bullets and gunpowder. Prosecutor Richard Woolfall said . chemicals including sulphur, iron oxide and magnesium were held in . storage jars on the shelves. He added: 'There was a mixture of sugar and . aluminium of the type used in Northern Ireland and by the Taliban in . Afghanistan.' An Army bomb disposal team was called in to make the home safe. David Gordon, defending, said Smith was 'a somewhat naive 40-year-old'. Serious: Police uncovered two live pipe bombs, 20-30 detonators, two battery packs and a sophisticated halogen light operating trigger at Smith's bomb-making workshop . Collection: Police also found a series of home-made detonators and a stock-pile of scaffolding tubing, 10 shotgun cartridges, a hoard of 9mm bullets and a store of gun-powder in the raid . He added: 'He has been in custody now . for five months and does not find it at all pleasurable. He is not a . terrorist. He does not have any radical religious or political opinions. He does have an unhealthy interest in explosive devices.' Smith, of Hull, pleaded guilty to . making or possessing explosives under suspicious circumstances and . another charge of possession of a class B drug. The court heard he had . lost his job and had taken to injecting amphetamines, to which he was . addicted. Dangerous: Chemicals including sulphur, iron oxide and magnesium were held in storage jars on the shelves and a pestle and mortar had been used to mix gunpowder . 'Some people collect stamps I make small bombs': Hull Crown Court heard Smith had lost his job as an electrician and had taken to injecting amphetamine . He was given a 15-month supervision . order, with a drug rehabilitation programme and 150 hours' unpaid work. A . ten-year anti-social behaviour order was also imposed, banning him from . possession of flares or fireworks which are not commercially available.","Police found two live pipe bombs, 20-30 detonators, two battery packs and a halogen light operating trigger .

A dedicated pet owner who lost her beloved dog two years ago is offering a staggering £10,000 reward just to find out what happened to him. Animal lover Debbie Spalton has spent more than £6,000 delivering thousands of leaflets, knocking doors and flying back and forth from her Dubai home to find her dog Kito. She has even got the attention of pet care retail giant Pets At Home and celebrity vet Joe Inglis. Mrs Spalton is now also getting help from former . policeman turned pet detective Tom Watkins, as well as trying animal . psychics and tracker dogs. And now with Tom's help she's . even got a video van - usually used in police MISSING PERSON searches - . to drive around the Midlands beaming video footage of her lost dog. After getting the Rhodesian Ridgeback . as a puppy in 2004 Debbie had the heartache of leaving him in the UK on . a farm with friends after she married her pilot husband and moved to . the Middle East. The former helicopter instructor knew Kito wouldn't have a life in her 23rd floor apartment or be . able to cope with 50C summer heat so found him a 'doggy heaven' on a . farm in Rugeley, Staffs. But on August 7 2010 Kito disappeared . from the farm a day after he'd gone missing for several hours before . returning 'agitated' and 'glad to be home'. Scroll down to see the missing dog appeal video . Reward: Distraught pet owner puts up the cash reward in a bid to find Kito even though thousands have been spent already. On the hunt: Detectives Matthew Massey (left) and Tom Watkins are helping search for Kito and the car used to find missing pets . Mrs Spalton still fights back the tears talking about her 'baby' and said the reward was for any information that would let her know what has happened to him. The 55-year-old, who lives with Emirates pilot husband Rupert, said using the video van - which toured the Midlands on Friday - was her final push to find Kito who now would be around 11 years old. She said: 'For people who think it's ""just a dog"" I would say he was my baby, he and dogs like him are part of the family, he used to sleep on my bed. 'When I had to move to Dubai it was heart-breaking leaving Kito behind but our friend Sian and her family had a farm and I knew him living there would be much more dog friendly than a 23rd floor apartment and 50 degree heat, it was 'doggy heaven'. Just playing around: Debbie and Kito used to have lots of fun together before she had to leave him to go to Dubai . Part of the family - Kito had finally settled down with his new owner Sian on the farm in Rugeley, Staffs . 'Rhodesian Ridgebacks are very loyal friendly dogs, they were bred to protect farms in Africa so they are protective but Kito is the most loving dog. 'When I went to Dubai Kito was welcomed into a lovely home where he was loved and cared for for six years - longer than he was with me. These are just some of the extreme lengths Debbie Spalton went to in order to find her dog... 'They took him in and he was their beloved boy. Sian in particular was devastated when he went missing from under her nose, he was her best friend. 'On the farm he would always be close to Sian guarding her, then the day before he went missing they couldn't find him for several hours and when he did come back he was agitated and very glad to be home it seemed. 'He disappeared the next day. I now think his behaviour the day before could have been because someone had befriended him and kept him somewhere perhaps in preparation to take him away. 'I feel like I have let him down, I know £10,000 is a lot of money and it's all the savings I have. 'The reward is because I need to know what has happened to Kito, he might still be suffering now, he might be dead, we need to know. 'The reward is for any information, we just need to get some closure.' When Kito first went missing Mrs Spalton flew back to the UK and met with Tom Watkins - a former policeman turned pet detective - who runs the UK's biggest missing pet service Animal Search UK. Mrs Spalton added: ""Tom has been amazing, he helped me organise the search for Kito and we have never given up. 'Tom has even agreed to drive the . video van around for next to nothing, this could be the final push to . find Kito as he would be getting older now.' When . Kito went missing he a missing lower front tooth, a scratched face from . a previous altercation with a badger and a scarred tip of his right . ear. He is also chipped. Pet detective Tom Watkins said Debbie's determination and the lengths she has gone to find Kito were the most he has ever seen.

A 92-year-old war veteran who shot dead an intruder at his home had been targeted by robbers three times in just 12 days in August, police have revealed. Sheriffs were so fearful of further activity around Earl Jones' home in Boone County, Kentucky they installed surveillance cameras to capture any other robberies at the property. Footage from the motion-activated video cameras captured the most recent break in that led to the death of Lloyd Maxwell after Jones coolly shot him dead from his living room chair with a .22 rifle. Scroll down for video . Frustration: Earl Jones, 92, shot dead a home intruder after his house had been robbed three times in a month . 'The video quality is subpar but definitely shows activity in the house,' sheriff's spokesman Tom Scheben said. The dark video reveals the first intruder crawling through a dog door in the basement before letting in his two accomplices. Scheben added that the cameras had been installed on August 30 after Jones' home, where he has lived since 1955, had been hit three times between August 14 and August 25. Burglars took a . television, a several thousand dollars and a personal cheque from his . house. In April, thieves also stole 90 of Mr Jones' cows from a field behind his property. Enraged: Jones shot dead Lloyd Adam Maxwell, right, with a single shot as he sat in his armchair . Perfect shot: The WWII veteran demonstrates how he shot Maxwell as he came through the doorway . In the latest incident, Jones was awoken by noises in his home at around 2.10 a.m. and fetched his rifle before settling in his favourite armchair and taking aim at the living room door. Jones said he fired a single shot after the . intruder climbed up stairs and kicked in the door. 'He kicked it hard and dang near knocked . it off the hinges,' Jones told Cincinnati.com. 'When the body appeared, that’s when I . raised the rifle, and I fired one shot.' He went on: 'I’m a military man – I ain’t going to . dial somebody and have to wait for an hour while the guy shoots me in . the face and is gone. Time is of the . (essence). You only got so much.' Maxwell's accomplices Ryan Dalton, 22, and Donnie Inabnit, 20, then fled, dragging the dead man with them. Jones said he was only sorry that two others who took part in the raid escaped unharmed. 'I was hoping another one would come up – I aimed right for his heart,' he said. Caught: Dark surveillance camera images show an intruder (right) approaching Jones' house early Monday . Escaped unhurt: Ryan Dalton, 22, left, and Donnie Inabnit, 20, fled with their accomplices' body . Jones also showed little emotion over killing 24-year-old Maxwell.

Recovery workers have found human remains on Tuesday inside a cement silo in Medley, Florida, where a plant worker disappeared more than two weeks ago following a roof collapse during Tropical Storm Isaac. The identity of the victim has not been confirmed, although the only missing employee was 58-year-old Pierre Mezidor, who was standing on the roof when it gave way underneath him. The father of two plummeted into the towering silo storing tightly-packed cement powder, which quickly filled with rainwater from the approaching storm. Macabre: Pictured here is the 200-foot-tall silo into which a worker plunged on Aug. 17 when its roof buckled and collapsed . For more than two weeks, the recovery . effort has been led by Miami-Dade police, the federal Mine Safety and . Health Administration, and workers hired by Titan America, the company . that owns the Pennsuco Plant, according to the Miami Herald. Pierre Mezidor, a 58-year-old immigrant father of two, was standing atop the silo, measuring the quantity of dry cement inside, when the accident occurred . Attorney Edward Blumberg, who . represents Mezidor’s family, hired three structural engineers to . investigate the scene in order to determine the cause of the collapse. ‘Something went seriously wrong, but . it would be a mistake to say for sure until we have everything squared . away,’ Blumberg said. ‘We don’t want to jump to a conclusion until all . the dots connect.’ Wind and rain from Isaac slowed an already difficult task to find Mezidor’s body. The storm dumped rain into the silo that was about 70 per cent full of cement. Police said the remains found inside the silo were taken to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy and identification, Local 10 News reported. Mezidor's co-workers who witnessed the collapse on August 17 described it as a 'a horribly gruesome event.' 'His son is like collapsing inside,' family friend Yolaine Casimier told Local 10 News outside Mr. Mezidor's Florida homestead. Mezidor was reportedly standing atop the 200-foot silo located in Medley, Florida, at around 8.30am, measuring the level of dry cement inside, when the roof beneath him  buckled and collapsed. Along with the piecemeal roof, Mezidor reportedly fell some 140 feet into a silo that one fire official said was only 20 per cent full of dry cement at the time. Rainwater from Isaac quickly poured into the suddenly-open silo, not quite creating wet concrete, but rather a gooey mush that has bound to debris - and hampered recovery efforts. 'I just look at the situation myself, my head ready to blow and seeing that big thing,' Casimier told Local 10 News. 'From what we see the situation he's not going to come out alive.' Freakish Accident: The incident occurred at Titan America's Tarmac Cement Plant in Medley, Fla., which manufacturers dry cement . Macabre: The interior of the silo (pictured) quickly filled with rainwater from Hurricane Isaac, entombing Mezidor in a gooey mush from which he is yet to be extracted . Mezidor had been working at the Tarmac Cement plant, which is owned by Titan America, for 19 years, according to Local 10 News. His step-daughter has said that he loved his job so much that he would go into work on his days off. Titan America told The Miami Herald that company officials 'deeply regret the incident and emphasize that employee safety is their primary concern.' 'I just look at the situation myself, my head ready to blow and seeing that big thing. From what we see the situation he's not going to come out alive.' But family members have already hired an attorney in anticipation of filing a civil suit. 'This type of death in and of itself is unspeakable,' Blumberg told The Herald, 'and the family still does not have the closure of having a body.' Miami-Dade Fire Rescue reportedly lowered sophisticated cameras and listening devices into the silo - devices sensitive enough to hear someone tapping -  but heard no signs of life. 'We have cadaver dogs that detect only dead people and we have live rescue dogs,' MDFR Lt. Arnold Piedrahita told Local 10 News in the day. 'Hopefully, with those dogs we will be able to determine whether this is going to be a recovery operation or continue as a rescue operation.' A Furious Search: Miami-Dade Fire Rescue has furiously searched for the fallen Mezidor with, among other things, cadaver-sniffing dogs, but to no avail .

When grandmother Kath Forster spotted a snake curled beneath Indian garden slates on her driveway, she calmly picked it up with ice cube tongs and trapped it in a box of Celebrations. She might not have acted so decisively had she known exactly what she was tackling – for the 57-year-old had in fact just encountered one of the deadliest snakes in the world. Mrs Forster’s experience at home in Dronfield, Derbyshire, is the second time in a week that a saw-scaled viper has been seen in England. Snakes in a crate! Ms Forster snapped up the slippery stowaway with her trusty pair of tongs . Experts are now warning that it is only a matter of time before someone is seriously injured or killed by one of the snakes, because the authorities in India are not checking their shipments carefully. Yesterday, Mrs Forster described the moment she saw the snake in her front garden. She was having work done at home and her gardener was unpacking a crate of patio slates from India when he saw a 20-inch snake curled at the bottom. He told Mrs Forster and, with little hesitation, she reached in and grabbed the snake behind its head – as she had seen animal experts do on television. ‘He removed the last slab and there it was,’ she said. ‘I came to see it and neighbours all came round and looked from an arm’s length. ‘I caught it and put it in a sweet container. Its tongue was out but I didn’t really look at it, it happened quickly. ‘We put the lid on the box but the box started moving. I wasn’t scared.’ The saw scaled viper has a lethal bite that can cause bleeding and brain hemorrhages . Mrs Forster, a housing officer, called a vet, who sent expert reptile handlers to collect the snake.  They called later to tell her just how dangerous the snake was, and the reptile is now with a licensed collector.‘I was very lucky,’ Mrs Forster added. ‘But I wouldn’t have wanted it to have injured anyone else so I’d do it again.’ Though they are not the most venomous, saw-scaled vipers are among the deadliest snakes in the world because they attack so often, with some reports saying they kill more than any other snake. They live mainly in highly populated . areas of Asia and Africa. Just one bite can be enough to kill, . especially where treatment is not available. Expert John Bent said yesterday that . it is only a matter of time before someone is killed if the vipers keep . arriving in the UK in shipments from India. ‘The snakes are number one in the top . ten dangerous snakes because they are so aggressive,’ he said. ‘They . strike faster than you can blink. It’s amazing no one was killed. ‘A saw-scaled viper is like a loaded gun with a hair trigger. ‘When I went to collect the snake, I asked: “Is this Indian slate?” And then, very quickly: “Where is it?” ‘In the car driving away it was jumping in the box on my wife’s knee. We got it home and put it in a tank and it was striking the glass to get at me. ‘It was really feisty, even though it probably lost half its bodyweight from the journey.’ While it is extremely rare to see them in the UK, two sightings have been reported in the past week. Another saw-scaled viper was seen in Tilbury Docks, in Essex, arriving in a giant shipping container from India. Mr Bent said the snakes could survive up to six months trapped in a shipping container. ‘I don’t want to scaremonger but this is a time bomb,’ he added. ‘There have been two in a week. They are getting through and if they colonise here we’re in deep trouble.’","Kath Forster picked the saw scale viper up and plonked it into a chocolate box .

'I had just accepted that I was disabled,' he admitted. 'My clients were loyal to me and took on the training advice I gave them even though I couldn't practice what I preached.' Lifestyle change: The father-of-two thought he couldn't exercise at all following his Army injury but found he could do low intensity work outs like power walking and lifting small weights . His problems were compounded by the breakdown of his marriage and he was later diagnosed as suffering with  Post Traumatic Stress Disorder caused by . the incident in Northern Ireland. His weight had crept up from ten stone to 27st with a 72 inch waist but the reality of his situation didn't hit home until a doctor warned him he had just months to live unless he changed his lifestyle. 'Reality hit then,' he recalls. 'I realised I had to change my ways. I have two children, Matteo, 12, and Carmen, nine, and I needed to be a good father for them.' Drawback: Franco's weight loss has left him with excessive skin and he said he has been refused an operation to remove it on the NHS . Franco realised he had to apply all the nutrition and fitness lessons he had learnt from his personal trainer course to his own life. He devised himself a training programme and restricted his diet to 1500 calories a day through healthy eating. While his back condition meant he couldn't do high-intensity exercise or lift heavy weights, he was able to do low intensity exercise like power-walking and swimming and tone up with small weights in the gym. The weight gradually began to fall off and 18 months later, he was 17 stone lighter. But while the weight loss improved his health, it has also left him with unsightly folds of skin. Franco, who is now in a new relationship with a girlfriend who has been supportive of his ordeal, said the excessive skin damages his self-esteem and is a constant reminder of his painful past. He applied to the NHS and appealed to the Army to pay for him to have skin removed but both refused. He said: 'The military said it's a matter for the NHS and the NHS told me they won't do it because it's a cosmetic and not health-related procedure. 'I feel let down by them both. I deserve the operation because I served my country and developed these problems as a result.' The operation, known as a 'body lift', will cost £20,000 to have privately. Franco is now planning to raise the money through a 20 mile sponsored walk which will take place next June. Any money raised beyond the cost of the operation he will donate to Coldstream Kids, a charity he set up to support children of both serving and former Coldstreamers who may have become victims of misfortune or unforeseen circumstances.","Franco Gasparotti was medically discharged from the Army following injuries he sustained while on patrol in Northern Ireland .

They also handed out 20,000 wristbands, called Xylobands, to everyone at the O2 arena at the weekend, where they played as part of their December tour. The LED light bands worked during four songs at the O2 gig when people would normally have waved lighters. ‘It looked absolutely amazing to see everyone wearing them and the whole stadium lit up,’ said Claire Adams, 36, from London.

The Titanic might have hit the fatal iceberg because of a rare weather condition that created a 'fake horizon', leaving the crew unaware of the threat until it was too late. The same rare phenomenon, found by a historian studying studying weather records unseen for a century, might also have meant that a nearby ship, The Californian, was unaware of the scale of the disaster and failed to save passengers from the stricken liner. The 'cold weather mirage' occurs when a cold weather front collides with warmer air and causes light passing between the boundary of the two to be bent dramatically, distorting how an object appears. Photograph showing the iceberg which sank the Titanic: A British historian now believes that a rare 'cold weather mirage' might have concealed the fatal iceberg until it was too late . The White Star Liner RMS Titanic, built by Harland & Wolff in Belfast, 4th February 1912, preparing to leave for Southampton for her maiden voyage to New York on April 10th 1912. The steamship sank on April 15th 1912 off the coast of NewFoundland . Jim Maloney played by Peter McDonald in the new TV series of Titanic . Look-outs on-board the Titanic could not . see the approaching iceberg because the optical illusion created a fake . horizon above sea level which concealed it from view. The theory also explains why Stanley Lord, captain of the nearest ship The Californian, ignored the sinking vessel because the illusion made it look like a much smaller ship. British historian and author Tim Maltin outlines his findings in a TV documentary for National Geographic Channel to be aired. He claims his theory ties not only with weather records but also with eyewitness accounts. He said: ‘It does actually make me feel sorry for Captain Lord, knowing now what I know about the science of that night.When he is apparently making excuses, saying the ship he was looking at did not look anything like the Titanic, what I now understand is that he was telling the exact truth.In fact, what he was looking at did not look anything like the Titanic at all.’ Unusually high-pressure weather also played a part in the tragedy, according to Mr Maltin. ‘A weather chart of the North . Atlantic from April 1912 reveals that the Titanic actually sank right in . the centre of a 1,035-millibar Arctic high. ‘To put that into context, that is the highest pressure anywhere in the northern hemisphere. ‘So this menacing Arctic high which built up over the North Pole swung down and zeroed in on Titanic's crash site.‘It's . almost as though the Titanic sank in a killing zone of nature where all . these dangerous elements combined to make it fatal.’ Contemporary painting illustrating the sinking of the White Star Liner, Titanic after it struck an iceberg whilst sailing south of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland on April 14 1912 . Harry Widener played by Noah Reid and Georgiana Grex played by Pedita Weeks in the new TV series of Titanic . The actual iceberg which sank the liner Titanic in April 1912 photograaphed from the German ship Prinz Adalbert . Mr Maltin, 39, from Wiltshire, unearthed weather records and the logs of other ships in the North Atlantic at the time that have remained unseen in archives for a century. Along with survivors' testimony, he pieced together how the tragedy most likely unfolded on that fateful night on April 15, 1912. Using contemporary records, Mr Maltin discovered the ship sank at the exact location and time that freezing waters from the Arctic flowing along the Labrador Current met hotter air from the Gulf Stream. And because this bent the light rays passing through the air at this point - completely obscuring the iceberg on the horizon - the doomed liner sailed directly towards it for a full 20 minutes, when under normal circumstances it would have been in clear view of the look-outs. Mr Maltin - author of the book '101 Things You Thought You Knew About The Titanic...But Didn't!' - said his mirage theory also explains why Captain Stanley Lord, whose ship The Californian was just 10 miles away, did not attempt a rescue because the illusion made the Titanic look like a much smaller ship. Mr Maltin said the 1,500 people who died in the disaster could still have been saved even after the collision with the iceberg but the cold-water mirage made the ship's SOS Morse lamp signals appear to the crew of the Californian to be the mast flickering under the stars or ordinary lights on the deck. ‘I've spent years wondering why these two ships which were trying to Morse each other all night couldn't communicate,’ said Mr Maltin. ‘A phenomenon known as scintillation scrambled Titanic's Morse lamp signals and it meant that the nearby ship, instead of realising it was the Titanic and coming straight to her aid, never came to her aid.’ Scintillation is the same effect that makes stars appear to twinkle as the light is distorted when it passes through the Earth's atmosphere. Mr Maltin said the logs of German and British ships near the area at the time recorded a massive drop in temperature around the site of the sinking, which he believes is proof that the conditions were perfect to create a mirage that would have hidden an iceberg from view. He added that survivors' testimony backed this up, particularly those who recalled seeing a column of smoke rise from the sinking ship before flattening out like a mushroom cloud, which indicates a large difference in the layers of air pressure and temperature.

The Dutch 'bird man' who posted a video showing a successful 'test flight' of a wing suit contraption has admitted that the amazing feat was a hoax all along. Viewers became sceptical after it emerged that no scientists actually knew 'Jarno Smeets', who claimed to have created the technology. Now Smeets has confessed that he is actually a 'filmmaker and animator' named Floris Kaayk, and has described the faked footage as 'online storytelling'. Smeets lifts off - powered only by a run up and the flapping of the wings, without a rocket or a rotor in sight . The engineer's suit is made from a 200 square foot 'kite', powered by motorised wings which 'amplify' Smeets's arm movements . He told a Dutch television show: 'I am now eight months working on an experiment about online media,' having begun blogging about the flying project last year. But Mr Kaayk shot down rumours that . the footage, which shows him soaring into the air, was intended to be . publicity for a company.

His LinkedIn biography links to Pailton . Engineering Limited, a workplace which has no record of him - and there . is also no record of Smeets at Coventry University, which also appears . on his CV.

The engineer claimed that . wireless engines in the wings work as 'amplifiers' for Smeets's own . arms, allowing him to flap wings that would otherwise be far too large . for a single human. The technology is plausible - in theory. But effects experts quickly called into question whether Smeets' attempt is authentic. ‘They’re able to afford to build this thing, but can’t invest in proper video equipment, or a tripod,’ Ryan Martin, technical director at George Lucas's Industrial Lights and Magic effects house said in an interview with Gizmodo. ‘If I were to make a fake video with the intention of going viral, I would make certain that the quality was as poor as possible to disguise any flaws in poor animation work. ‘I am suspicious because there is not much detail shown of the actual machine,’ he says. ‘The device is also something that is only possible in recent times, given proliferation of these types of high torque, high power density brushless motors, high voltage speed controllers and lithium batteries, off the shelf carbon fiber components and so on.' Smeets pretended that the 'suit' is driven by Wii motion sensors in the arms which 'sense' the pilot's movements, helped by an . accelerometer from an HTC Wildfire S smartphone. The movements are . transferred into Turnigy motors which give Smeets the power to move the . 200 square foot wing, according to his claims.

The app grades radiation exposure as low, high and medium, and offers tips on how to lower your levels . Worriers rejoice - a new Android app tells you exactly how much electromagnetic radiation your handset is blasting into your brain, and even tells you when to hold it away from your head. But iPhone owners aren't so lucky - the app isn't available for Apple's handsets, after it was personally turned down by late CEO Steve Jobs in a terse email that simply said, 'No interest.' The app warns when radiation levels from a phone are high - taking into account the model, and what is transmitting through its aerials, and even offers tips on how to lower your radiation levels. 'Tawkon is a free app that alerts you when your phone radiation level spikes, and offers tips to help you lower it,' say its creators. The phone senses the activities of components inside the handset that lead to radiation 'spikes', and suggest you hold the phone away from your head - or even hang up. The app has been downloaded 10,000 times in less than a week. It looks unlikely, however, that Apple users will be able to enjoy Tawkon. Apple's Steve Jobs was well known for personally responding to numerous emails from the public. But . some of his replies were a little more terse than others, as the . bosses of Tawkon discovered. The CEO, in response to a . politely worded email asking for assistance to get their app off the . ground, simply said ‘no interest’ (sent from his iPhone, naturally). The app senses when components are about to release high levels of radiation, and warns users to switch to a headset or speakerphone . Your phone is already equipped with what you need to protect yourself. You just don’t have access to that information. Deep in the guts of a phone’s circuitry, we found that components actually gather radiation-related data. We learned how to gather this information and we built tawkon: our app tracks the contributing factors to rises in radiation and simply suggests you to make a quick change — as you begin a call or while you are in the middle of one,' say the app's creators. 'In 2010, tawkon launched a jailbroken iPhone app (Steve Jobs told us personally Apple wasn’t interested in it; we assume he wasn’t keen on discussing radiation in relation to the iPhone), as well as a Blackberry app. 'In 2011, we successfully launched our Beta Android app, which is now where the core development focus lies. In April 2012 we launched our native Android App.' Steve Jobs rejected the app, which tells users . how much radiation is absorbed. It's calculated by using the location to . phone masts and how the phone is held . No convincing evidence has been revealed that mobile phones damage human health in spite of an ‘explosion’ in research into the issue over the past decade, according to a review of scientific studies billed as the most comprehensive yet. Driving while using a mobile phone remains the one established health risk of mobile phones, a leading scientist said as a report on exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields emitted by devices such as mobile phones was published. The review found that a large number of studies have been published on cancer risks in relation to mobile phone use but overall the results have not demonstrated that the use of mobile phones causes brain tumours or any other type of cancer. Steve Jobs is known for responding to numerous . emails from the public. Some responses are more terse than others, as . Tawkon bosses found out . But the report, from the Health Protection Agency’s (HPA) independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation (AGNIR), warned that it was ‘important’ to continue to monitor all the evidence as there was little information on the risks beyond 15 years from first exposure. This monitoring should include monitoring national brain tumour trends which have so far given ‘no indication’ of any risk, the report recommended. The HPA said it would continue to advise a ‘precautionary’ approach and keep the science under close review. The agency recommends that ‘excessive’ use of mobile phones by children should be discouraged while adults should make their own choices as to whether they wish to reduce their own exposure.","App monitors radiation from Android handsets .

It is the second victory for Apple as . earlier this week sales of Samsung's Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet . in the US were barred until the case was resolved. The two companies have been locked in a battle over several continents over Samsung's Galaxy tablets and smartphones. Apple has waged an international . patent war since 2010 as it seeks to limit the growth of Google's . Android system, the world's best-selling mobile operating platform. US District Judge Lucy Koh said Apple 'has shown a likelihood of establishing both infringement and validity.' Yesterday . the U.S. District Court of Northern California said that the Galaxy . Nexus smartphone 'likely' infringes four patents held by Apple Inc., . including a patent used in the 'Siri' voice-activated assistance . available in the iPhone 4S. 'Apple . has clearly shown that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the . absence of preliminary injunctive relief,' Judge Lucy Koh wrote in the . ruling available online. She ordered Apple to post a $96 million bond - an estimated damage sustained by Samsung from the temporary sales ban - in case the iPhone maker loses to Samsung in a later trial, scheduled for 2014. The sales ban in the United States will be effective immediately when Apple posts the bond. The Galaxy Nexus lawsuit is one in a series of legal battles between Apple and Samsung. The two world's largest makers of smartphones together claimed more than half of the global smartphone market in the first three months of this year. Samsung's rival to iPad has been banned from sale in America, after a judge handed Apple a victory in the two companies' long-running patent battle . Samsung and Apple have been embroiled in multiple lawsuits in Asia, North America and Europe since April 2011 when Apple accused Samsung of copying its iPhone and iPad. Samsung shot back with claims that Apple is using its mobile technology without permission. Samsung's Galaxy tablets are the main rival to Apple's iPad - helped by the hit 'mini tablet' Galaxy Note (pictured) The latest order from the Californian court follows Koh's decision on Tuesday to temporarily block the sales of the Galaxy Tab 10.1 tablet computer in the United States. But it is 'the first serious blow' Apple has dealt to Samsung and Google Inc., said Florian Mueller, a Germany-based patent analyst. The Galaxy Tab 10.1 was released more than a year ago and accounts for a small portion of Samsung's mobile sales. The Galaxy Nexus smartphone was launched in the U.S. market in December 2011. The Nexus is also the first smartphone to be powered by the most recent . Android operating system called 'Ice Cream Sandwich,' which includes a unified search feature that lets users search information stored in various locations with a single input. As a result of the sales ban, Samsung and Google's 'co-developed flagship device for the current generation of Android will have to be stripped of some or all of its Siri-like functionality,' Mueller said in an emailed response. Samsung said it is disappointed with the court order and will take all legal measures. 'We are currently working closely with Google to resolve this matter, as the patent in question concerns Google's unified search function,' said Nam Ki-yung, a Samsung spokesman. 'Samsung will continue to take all available measures, including legal action to ensure the Galaxy Nexus remains available to consumers.' Apple did not return calls seeking comment.","US District Judge said Apple 'has shown a likelihood of establishing both infringement and validity'

Our galaxy, the Milky way is still 'ringing' from a cosmic impact where a smaller galaxy tore through it - and the terrifying collision happened just 100 million years ago, very recently in cosmological terms. The 'smoking gun' was telltale vibrations in nearby stars, which astronomers claim is the equivalent of a 'ringing' sound left by the enormous impact. The collision - either with a tiny galaxy or a hurtling ball of mysterious 'dark matter' - left our galaxy with unevenly distributed stars, as if a wave was passing through it. Our galaxy, the Milky way is still 'ringing' from a cosmic impact where a smaller galaxy tore through it - and the terrifying collision happened just 100 million years ago, very recently in cosmological time . A team of astronomers from Canada and the United States have discovered what may well be the smoking gun of such an encounter, one that occurred close to our position in the galaxy and relatively recently, at least in the cosmological sense.‘We have found evidence that our Milky Way had an encounter with a small galaxy or massive dark matter structure perhaps as recently as 100 million years ago,’ said Larry Widrow, professor at Queen’s University in Canada. ‘We clearly observe unexpected differences in the Milky Way’s stellar distribution above and below the galaxy’s midplane that have the appearance of a vertical wave -- something that nobody has seen before.’The discovery is based on observations of some 300,000 nearby Milky Way stars by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Stars in the disk of the Milky Way move up and down at a speed of about 20-30 kilometers per second while orbiting the center of the galaxy at a brisk 220 kilometers per second. The 'smoking gun' is an uneven distribution of stars which seems to hint that a massive object such as another galaxy passed straight through the Milky Way . Widrow and his four collaborators from the University of Kentucky, the University of Chicago and Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory have found that the positions and motions of these nearby stars weren’t quite as regular as previously thought.‘Our part of the Milky Way is ringing like a bell,’ said Brian Yanny, of the Department of Energy’s Fermilab. ‘But we have not been able to identify the celestial object that passed through the Milky Way. It could have been one of the small satellite galaxies that move around the center of our galaxy, or an invisible structure such as a dark matter halo.’Adds Susan Gardner, professor of physics at the University of Kentucky: ‘The perturbation need not have been a single isolated event in the past, and it may even be ongoing. Additional observations may well clarify its origin.’When the collaboration started analyzing the SDSS data on the Milky Way, they noticed a small but statistically significant difference in the distribution of stars north and south of the Milky Way’s midplane. For more than a year, the team members explored various explanations of this north-south asymmetry, such as the effect of interstellar dust on distance determinations and the way the stars surveyed were selected. When those attempts failed, they began to explore the alternative explanation that the data was telling them something about recent events in the history of the galaxy.The scientists used computer simulations to explore what would happen if a satellite galaxy or dark matter structure passed through the disk of the Milky Way. The simulations indicate that over the next 100 million years or so, our galaxy will ‘stop ringing:’ the north-south asymmetry will disappear and the vertical motions of stars in the solar neighborhood will revert back to their equilibrium orbits -- unless we get hit again.The Milky Way is more than 9 billion years old with about 100 billion stars and total mass more than 300 billion times that of the Sun. Most of the mass in and around the Milky Way is in the form of dark matter.Scientists know of more than 20 visible satellite galaxies that circle the center of the Milky Way, with masses ranging from one million to one billion solar masses. There may also be invisible satellites made of dark matter. (There is six times as much dark matter in the universe as ordinary, visible matter.) Astronomers’ computer simulations have found that this invisible matter formed hundreds of massive structures that move around our Milky Way.Because of their abundance, these dark matter satellites are more likely than the visible satellite galaxies to cut through the Milky Way’s midplane and cause vertical waves.‘Future astronomical programs, such as the space-based Gaia mission, will be able to map out the vertical perturbations in our galaxy in unprecedented detail,’ Widrow said. ‘That will offer a strong test of our findings.’","'Smoking gun' proves that massive object tore straight through our Milky Way galaxy .

Experts believed the creatures to be extinct, but a hive of the insects have been breeding for almost 100 years in the eves of a church in Northumberland. They were discovered in the roof of . Whitfield’s Holy Trinity Church after the church warden found the 19th . century church littered with bees. Conservation officer for the Bee Improvement and Bee Breeders’ Association (Bibba) Dorian Pritchard, was called in to help. Slates were removed from the church . by cutting into the roof with an electric saw, but the bees showed no . signs of agitation - and no-one was stung. Dorian first recognised the insects’ unusual dark features. He said: ‘They are generally a lot darker than the European bee with pale thin strips across the abdomen. It takes a specialist bee keeper to recognise them. ‘These bees were the native bees in Britain after the Ice Age but in the 1830s we started to import foreign bees. ‘An epidemic wiped out 90 per cent of the population after the First World War.’ A rare 'black' honeybee which was thought to have been wiped out by a strain of Spanish flu in 1919 has been rediscovered in the rafters of a church in Northumberland . The British Black bee is different from other bees as they developed in the UK after the ice age and when the sea filled the channel . The only surviving bees are predominantly black, with a hint of yellow, but much darker than the common bee seen across the UK . The bees that had made their way into the main body of the building died - but wardens were stunned when they made their way up to the roof and stumbled upon a huge swarm of the insects. The British Black bee is different from other bees as they developed in the UK after the last ice age. The only surviving bees are predominantly black, with a hint of yellow, but much darker than the common bee seen across the UK. They are ideally suited the British climate - particularly that in the North of England - and more so than the European Black bee. The Spanish flu came to the UK in the early 20th century. After the disaster, the country was repopulated with bees from abroad, which has led to more species of bee, including the popular honey bee. Bee experts were called to the church in Whitfield to find a way of tackling the nest, only to realise the pesky bees could have been the rare ‘apis mellifera mellifera’ species. A handful of dead bees were taken away from the church for examinations to confirm Dorian’s hunch that they were British black honeybees. Plans are now being made to transfer the bees to a hive before they can be rehomed. Although no-one connected to the church had noticed the bees, the nest is thought to have been occupied for several years. Estate maintenance manager, Jonathan Archer said: ‘It is fascinating that these bees have possibly been here this long even though they were thought to be extinct. ‘We now hope that by moving them to a new home they will go from strength to strength with help from experts who know how to take care of them.’","'British Black' species thought to have been wiped out in 1919 .

As marriage proposals go making sure your intentions can be seen from space is a strong sign of commitment. And when Anthony 'Tony' Larson, 41, decided to ask his girlfriend Emma Wightman to marry him he wanted everybody - even the odd astronaut - to see. After being cajoled into a beach walk at Woolacombe, North Devon on Saturday, Miss Wightman, 37, was pleasantly surprised to see an 'EM' in a love heart etched into the sand on the beach below. Loud and clear: Anthony 'Tony' Larson made sure his girlfriend Emma Wightman - and the odd astronaut looking down from space - knew his intentions when he got friends to draw this message in the sand at Woolacombe, North Devon . Yes, yes, yes! After tucking into strawberries and champagne with friends Miss Wightman thought she better leave her answer and drew a 'yes' and a kiss in the sand . She told MailOnline: 'I looked at Tony and said, ""did you do that?"" Then he started smiling from ear to ear and the look on his face, I just knew then.' Two of Mr Larson's friends, armed with garden rakes then carefully carved out 'Will You Marry Me' as the couple watched from Marine Drive on the dunes. 'He waited till the question mark appeared and then got down on one knee,' Miss Wightman said. 'There were lots of tears from both of us and then a 'yes yes yes!''

Mr Larson, an accountant, also presented the administrator with a 'beautiful' single solitaire diamond ring. Miss Wightman had been planning to visit the hairdresser on Saturday after being dissatisfied with a previous cut but had been told by Mr Larson and in fact everybody she knew, that it looked fine. 'Tony was saying, ""It's fine, I don't know why you keep mucking around with it"".' Miss Wightman said. Her friends all said it was fine too and unbeknown to Miss Wightman even called the hairdresser to ask them not to book her in if she called. 'They were all in on it,' she said. 'In the end we went to the beach for a walk but I did wonder why he was in such a rush,' Miss Wightman recalled.

Apple launched an attack on Samsung in court yesterday as lawyers for the firm related how Apple's entire business was at stake when it launched the iPhone. Harold McElhinny, representing Apple, painted an evocative picture of Apple as a struggling underdog company which knew it would either revolutionise the smartphone market - or die trying. He reminded the San Jose courtroom, in which Apple and Samsung are flinging patents at each other in a bid to prove they did not infringe each others' inventions, that the mobile market was an entirely different landscape when Steve Jobs pitched the final designs. He said: 'Apple had absolutely no name in the field, no credibility. [The iPhone] was an entry that - had it gone bad - could have ended the company's future. 'On January 9, 2007 when Steve Jobs and Phil Schiller went through that presentation, they were literally betting their company.' Apple attorney Harold McElhinny questions Apple designer Christopher Stringer in this court sketch during the San Jose trial . Apple and Samsung are business partners turned bitter rivals over Apple's claims that the Samsung Galaxy range infringes on the iPhone's design. Samsung meanwhile points to pre-2007 phones to show the 'rectangle touchscreen' was not a novel look, accusing Apple of 'fighting over rectangles'. On Tuesday afternoon, Apple designer . Christopher Stringer wrapped up the first day of testimony discussing . his role in helping create the company's iPhone and iPod during his 17 . years at the company. Dressed in a tan suit, the bearded and long haired designer said because . of Apple's desire to create original products, he and his co-workers . surmounted numerous engineering problems such as working with the . products' glass faces in producing both products over a number of years. Stringer said he was upset when he saw Samsung's Galaxy products enter . the market and said: 'We've been ripped off, it's plain to see. It's offensive.' Samsung attorney Charles Verhoeven demonstrates how rectangular phones with rounded corners' were not novel before 2007 . McElhinny told the jury that Samsung faced two options to compete in the booming cellphone market after the iPhone: Innovate or copy. In his opening statement, he claimed Samsung chose to copy, making its smartphones and computer tablets illegal knockoffs of Apple's popular products - and that Samsung 'has copied the entire design and user experience' of the iPhone and iPad. Samsung attorney Charles Verhoeven countered that the South Korean company employs thousands of designers and spends billions of dollars on research and development to create new products. He said: 'Samsung is not some copyist, some Johnny-come-lately doing knockoffs.' Verhoeven asserted that Apple, like many other companies, uses similar technology and designs to satisfy consumer demands for phones and other devices that play music and movies and take photographs. For example, he said several other companies and inventors have filed patent applications for the rounded, rectangular shape associated with Apple products. 'Everyone is out there with that basic form factor. There is nothing wrong with looking at what your competitors do and being inspired by them.' The iPhone 4S and the Samsung Galaxy S II: Apple claims Samsung ripped off their phone with the Galaxy range . The trial resumes on Friday with the testimony of Apple senior vice president for marketing Philip Schiller. Apple is demanding $2.5 billion in damages, an award that would dwarf the largest patent-related verdict to date. The . case marks the latest skirmish between the two companies over product . designs. A similar trial began last week, and the two companies have . been fighting in other courts in the United Kingdom and Germany. Samsung . counter-claims that Apple copied its iPhone from Sony. In addition, . Samsung alleges Apple is using some of Samsung's own inventions without . payment, such as a computer chip at the heart of the iPhone. Samsung . lawyers also stressed the company has been developing mobile phones . since 1991, long before Apple jumped into the market in 2007. Also . at issue at the trial are some of the most basic functions of today's . smartphones and computer tablets, including scrolling with one finger . and zooming with a finger tap. Tuesday morning's proceedings began with a bit of drama. First, . a juror pleaded with the judge to be released from the trial, saying . she suffered a panic attack and spent a sleepless night after belatedly . discovering that her employer would not pay her salary while she served. A sympathetic judge granted her request and left the jury with nine . members. Then the . judge rebuked John Quinn, one of Samsung's attorneys, for refusing to . stop a line of legal argument the judge said she had ruled on numerous . times. Quinn relented . and sat down, but his tenacity underscored the high stakes of the trial . that is costing both sides millions of dollars in legal fees and . expenses. Battalions of lawyers from prestigious law firms are working . overtime to file myriad court documents. The most senior lawyers on each side charge upward of $500 an hour for their representation . Legal experts said that most patent disputes are resolved way before trials that can bring unpredictable and ruinous verdicts. 'A . patent case of this magnitude has the possibility of impacting phone . technology for years to come,' said Manotti Jenkins, a patent attorney . with no stake in the trial. 'Given the substantial revenue that is . generated by smartphone technology, companies are likely to prompt more . litigation of this type and continue to use the courts as an attempt to . protect and expand market share.'","Apple lawyer Harold McElhinny paints Apple as underdog during opening salvo against Samsung .

It cost more than all the electricity needed to run those games, emails, videos and news stories for a year. The annual cost to charge an iPad is just $1.36, according to the Electric Power Research Institute, a non-profit research and development group funded by electric utilities. By comparison, a 60-watt compact fluorescent bulb costs $1.61, a desktop PC adds up to $28.21 and a refrigerator runs you $65.72. Power play: It takes only $1.36 of electricity to charge an iPad for a year, much less than other electronics . The group, known as EPRI, studied the power consumption of Apple Inc.'s iPad to determine the effect that the newly-popular devices might have on the nation's electricity use. The answer: not much. If the number of iPads triples from the current 67 million, they would need the electricity from one small power plant operating at full strength. But if people are using iPads instead of televisions to play video games, or ditching their desktop computers for iPads, the shift to tablets could mean lower overall power consumption. A desktop computer uses 20 times more power than an iPad. Baskar Vairmohan, the EPRI researcher who conducted the iPad test, said the group is now studying usage to understand whether the explosion of tablets is adding to power consumption, or reducing it. Heavy use: The cost would be slightly more for those who play video games on the iPad and use it incessantly . Residential power demand is on track to fall for the third straight year, according to the government. A weak economy is keeping people in smaller houses and shacked up with others. At the same time, efficiency programs are pushing more efficient light bulbs, air conditioners and other devices into homes. Refrigerators use a quarter of the power they used a generation ago, according to EPRI. For the iPad test, Vairmohan measured the amount of power used to charge up an iPad with a drained battery. He assumed that users would charge up every other day. Over a year, the latest version of the iPad consumed 11.86 kilowatt-hours of electricity. (Older versions consume somewhat less power.) The juice would cost $1.36 at the U.S. average residential price of 11.49 cents per kilowatt-hour. But there's an even cheaper way to go than the iPad. EPRI calculated the cost of power needed to fuel an iPhone 4 for year: just 38 cents.","Electric Power Research Institute calculated the annual cost to charge iPad is $1.36 .

Honest: Brian Caswell admits if he'd won the money when he was younger it might have changed him more . Pride: Mr Caswell is still a regular at his allotment in Bolton, Greater Manchester despite his huge win . The 77-year-old grandfather won the . jackpot three years ago, and admitted at the time that the performance . of his carrots on his beloved allotment was one of his few regrets. ‘I . have been trying to grow carrots ever since I have been on that plot . and I have never had any success,’ he said. ‘I have followed every . instruction in the book and never had a single success.’ He promised, however, that life as a multi-millionaire would not see him abandon his blessed plot.

Keen: Mr Caswell's win has allowed him to get night vision cameras fitted to the allotment to watch wildlife . Mr Caswell said: ‘My allotment is . still a lovely place to go to get away from it all. But one thing that . has changed since the lottery win is my approach to growing carrots. ‘I could never grow them before the . win and then I was given a tip to grow them in pots. Apparently they . always come up because you’re putting in a fresh supply of compost. That’s what I’m doing now and it works.’ That leaves him with only one ambition . unfulfilled since his numbers came up – the slightly more costly desire . to visit South America. Mr Caswell was chairman of the Harpers . Lane Allotment Society in Bolton when he became one of the country’s . largest EuroMillions winners in 2009. Since then he has swapped the modest . semi where he and his wife Joan, 76, spent the first 50 years of their . marriage and bought a £1.25million five-bedroom farmhouse three miles . away.

Trevor Roche had been in the air for only a few minutes in one of the rarest planes in the world when he lost control and plunged to the ground 300 yards from crowds. The former British Airways pilot  had taken to the skies in a 1923 de Havilland Humming Bird which had a history  of crashing. Tragic: Trevor Roche in the de-Haviland DH53 Hummingbird which crash-landed in a field yesterday at an air show as 600 people watched on . More than 600 onlookers watched in horror as the aircraft’s engine faltered and it plunged into a field. Emergency vehicles raced to the wreckage but Mr Roche, who was flying solo, was believed to have been killed instantly. The Military Pageant Air Show at the Old Warden Aerodrome near Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, was cancelled immediately. The de Havilland DH53 Humming Bird was one of only a handful left in the world and is thought to have been the only one still flying. After the crash it emerged that it had a history of the engine cutting out in mid-air and was deemed unfit to fly in 2000. It had been kept as a static exhibit at an aeronautical museum at the aerodrome which is home to the Shuttleworth Collection. But pilots continued to get behind its controls and it  tentatively returned to the skies in 2002, when its engine failed again. Tragedy: The wrecked de Haviland DH53 Hummingbird plane broken on the ground just 300 yards from where spectators were standing . Crash probe: Emergency workers on the scene after former Gulf War pilot Trevor Roche was killed . Wreckage: An Air Accident Investigation Board probe into the crash is underway after pilot Trevor Roche was killed instantly . Investigation: A group of emergency workers begin to examine the wreckage of the aircraft yesterday . At the time Andy Sephton, former chief pilot for the Shuttleworth Collection, revealed: ‘It has a high propensity to turn over. ‘It’s crashed several times, breaking one pilot’s legs and trapping another upside down in a potato field with fuel dribbling over him.’ The de Havilland Humming Bird was decommissioned by the RAF in 1927. The one which crashed yesterday was a prototype. A man who wanted to remain anonymous said only very experienced airmen were allowed to fly planes in the collection. He said: ‘I’m a pilot and they wouldn’t let me out there. It’s very experienced pilots who do this stuff. ‘They fly these aircraft on a voluntary basis and it doesn’t matter which pilot it is that’s flying, you wouldn’t be able  to stop them getting into  the aircraft.’ Tragedy: Pilot Trevor Roche was killed in the accident at Shuttleworth airfield, near Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, today . He added: ‘The older a plane is the harder it is to fly and any pilot who takes to the skies knows of the risks.’ One man who saw the crash said Mr Roche had been ‘a very experienced pilot for a long time’. Mr Roche, who was in his 40s, became chief pilot for the Shuttleworth Collection in 1995, but stepped down two years ago. The former RAF Tornado pilot flew in the first Gulf  War before becoming a commercial pilot with British Airways, flying Boeing 767s and 777s. Aerodrome bosses said in a statement yesterday: ‘The Shuttleworth Collection can confirm that earlier today an aircraft experienced difficulties and crashed at the airfield. ‘Today’s planned air show has been cancelled to allow accident investigators to assess the scene.’ Officials from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch have launched an inquiry.","Former RAF pilot Trevor Roche killed as rare 1923 de-Haviland DH53 plunges into a field .

Large numbers of France's most well-heeled families are selling up and moving to neighbouring countries, estate agency figures have shown. It is thought many are leaving France to avoid a proposed tax rate of 75 per cent on earnings of more than 1million euros - £780,000. The countries previous top tax bracket of 41 per cent on earnings over 72,000 euros is also set to increase to 45 per cent. British estate agent Sotheby's said it's French offices sold more than 100 properties over 1.7 million euros between April and June this year - a marked increase on the same period in 2011. Sotheby's French boss Alexander Kraft said: 'The result of the presidential election has had a real impact on our sales. 'Now a large number of wealthy French families are leaving the country as a direct result of the proposals of the new government. 'These properties are then bought up by foreign investors looking for a stable real estate market like France to invest in. 'It shows the high-end property market is holding up very well, even in these difficult times.'

He told the B20 business summit in Mexico in June: 'I think it's wrong to have a completely uncompetitive top rate of tax. 'If the French go ahead with a 75 per cent top rate of tax we will roll out the red carpet and welcome more French businesses to Britain and they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.'

Geologists believe the Oi plant in Fukui Prefecture is at real risk of earthquake if the tectonic plates it sits on suddenly shift. The news comes at a sensitive time for the Japanese nuclear industry - less than 18 months after a tsunami struck the nuclear power station at Fukushima, causing a meltdown . The earth's crust under the Oi Nuclear power plant in Fukui, western Japan, will be examined over claims it sits on an active fault . Japan shut down all its nuclear power stations after the Fukushima disaster so safety checks could be carried out. In June Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda ordered the Kansai Electric Power Company to restart the reactors at Oi, amid fears of summer power shortages in Japan. The first reactor was fired up a few weeks ago and a second is planned to restart later in July. Last month Japanese Prime Minsiter Yoshihiko Noda ordered the reactors at Oi to be restarted . The power company insists it won't alter its schedule, despite the order to examine the earth under the huge plant. A KEPCO spokesman said: 'The company from its evaluations . believes the fault has not been active for between 120,000 and 130,000 . years.; . 'Now the company has received the order . to reinvestigate the matter and swiftly report, we will comply fully . with this order.' Experts reporting to the safety watchdog have also recommended tests are carried out at the nearby Shika plant, claiming both sites could be sitting on active fault lines. The company that operates Shika has also vowed to comply with the order. Earlier this month a parliamentary report called for an investigation into the cause of the meltdown at Fukushima. Experts want to know how much damage was caused by the tsunami and how much was a result of the earthquake that started the devastating chain of events. Ministers in Japan are calling for an investigation into the cause of the Fukushima disaster in March 2011 .",Warning comes just 18 months after tsunami wiped out Fukushima plant .

A relative of Helena Bonham Carter choked to death on a piece of orange after being left alone at his car home, an inquest heard. Retired musician Thomas Bonham-Carter, 66, was found motionless in the conservatory of the care home two minutes after being handed the fruit by a care assistant. Paramedics later removed a chewed segment from his airway, but were unable to revive him en route to hospital, Westminster Coroner’s Court heard. Relatives: Thomas Bonham-Carter is connected to the actress Helena Bonham Carter, left, who is the partner of filmmaker Tim Burton, right . The younger son of author, farmer and publisher Victor Bonham-Carter, he is a distant relative of actress Helena Bonham Carter and a descendent of former Prime Minister Herbert Asquith. Giving evidence, coroner’s officer Martyn Urquhart said ‘Tom’ Bonham-Carter grew up on a farm near Dulverton, West Somerset, close to Exmoor. He developed a ‘very early love of music’ playing the family’s grand piano and harmonium, before his talents were recognised by a church organist in nearby Brushford. After graduating from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, he went on to play for the National Symphony Orchestra of Ecuador as a bassoonist for ten years. The former wife of Mr Bonham Carter leaves Westminster Coroner's Court after the inquest into his death . ‘Unfortunately he suffered from schizophrenia, for which he had taken medication from the age of 16,’ said Mr Urquhart. Mr Bonham-Carter went on to spend 30 years of his adult life staying in residential care homes. He had been living at the eight-bed St . Andrew’s care home in Drewstead Road, Streatham, southwest London, for . seven years at the time of the choking incident. Giving evidence, home manager Eugene Owusu described him as a ‘very pleasant gentleman, very, very helpful to everybody.’ ‘He set the tables for all meals,’ he said. ‘He also loved his music, and he had his own piano in the home.’ Mr . Bonham-Carter, who was born in Marlborough, Wiltshire, on November 28, . 1945, had been looking forward to playing in a local church after . learning that their organist was retiring, the inquest heard. The . incident happened shortly after 9.30pm on May 21 this year, where . patients were allowed to sit unsupervised after eating dinner and being . given their evening medication. Just two minutes after being given an orange by a member of staff, another resident was heard shouting for help. Care assistant Guy Grimmond said: ‘I immediately ran there, and he looked blue. ‘Food was streaming down the left side of his cheek, and it was a bit like froth coming out of his mouth. He was unresponsive.’ An . ambulance crew received a 999 call at 9.39pm, and used forceps to . remove a ‘large piece of masticated orange’ from his windpipe after . finding him in cardiac arrest. He was rushed to nearby St George’s Hospital but pronounced dead at 10.44pm that day after attempts to resuscitate him failed. A post-mortem report gave the cause of death as upper airway obstruction.

Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox said Mr Bonham-Carter ‘was very stable and clearly had a fulfilled and happy life with his music to draw upon. ‘He unfortunately choked on a piece of orange which obstructed his upper airway, which caused him to suffer respiratory arrest. ‘Clearly there is only one verdict for this court to consider, and that is the verdict of accident.’ She added she was satisfied he had been ‘entirely self-caring and did not require any enhanced supervision.’","Thomas Bonham-Carter, 66, found unconscious after choking on fruit .

Emmy Award-winning comedian and writer Tom Davis - who along with Al Franken formed the comedy duo 'Franken and Davis' on NBC's Saturday Night Live - has died aged 59.Mr Davis, hailed as one of the best comedy writers of his generation, died of throat and neck cancer on Thursday at his home in Hudson New York, his wife Mimi Raleigh told the New York Times. The entertainer grew up in Minnesota where he met Franken, and the two formed a comedy duo when they were teenagers. Emmy Award winning comedy writer Tom Davis is famed for forming one half of The Franken and Davis Show on Saturday Night Live, (seen here performing in 1978) Mr Davis wrote for Saturday Night Live from 1975 to 2003, and famously shared a writing salary with Franken when he first joined the show. One of the best known sketches Mr Davis helped create on the show was 'Theodoric of York.' The sketch starred comedy actor Steve Martin and was about a barber surgeon who relied on bloodletting to cure any ailment. Al Franken (left) and Tom Davis first began performing together as teenagers . Mr Davis also worked on Saturday Night Live's popular 'Conehead' sketches about a family of aliens living in the United States who famously consumed 'mass quantities' of beer and cigarettes. He co-wrote the 1993 film adaptation along with Dan Aykroyd, who starred as the alien father 'Beldar' in both the show and film versions. The talented writer won three Emmy Awards for his work on Saturday Night Live and one for The Paul Simon Special in 1977, and was nominated for another nine. Mr Davis reminisces with old friend and fan Mary Duffy while signing books in Minneapolis in 2009. He died in New York on Thursday aged 59 . Mr Franken, who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008 to represent Minnesota after a long career in show business, remembered Davis as 'a great friend, a good man, and so funny' and he called his death 'a sad day for all of us who loved Tom.' In a statement, he said he had spoken with Davis' mother on Thursday 'and she recalled fondly all the laughter that would come from the basement when Tom and I first got started in comedy.' Lorne Michaels, the creator of Saturday Night Live, credited Davis with helping to get the long-running show off the ground. 'He was there from the beginning,' Michaels said in a statement. 'No one saw things the way that Tom did. 'He was funny, he was original and he was always there to help, no matter the hour - and I always trusted his laugh. I can still kinda hear it.' Jim Downey, a long time writer for Saturday Night Live who began working with Davis in 1976, called him 'a loyal friend, a generous and supportive collaborator, and utterly unthreatened by the success of talent of those around him.' 'His old pals have known for some time that this day was coming, but still it's hard to accept that he's now no longer out there, somewhere, thinking those crazy thoughts that no one else would think.'","Talented writer won three Emmy Awards and was nominated for another nine .

Hundreds of Olympic spectators were turned away from one of the Games' first events today after a ticketing mix-up before the archery. Olympic fans had streamed towards Lord's cricket ground early this morning for an event widely advertised as one of the first of the Games, only to be told it was a behind-closed-doors competition. Dozens of would-be spectators were left angry and frustrated, having thought they could attend a free and unticketed pre-competition 'ranking event'. Scroll down for video . Access denied: Archery fans, many of whom had queued from early this morning with what they thought were genuine tickets, were turned away from a ranking event this morning . No entry: A Locog official attempts to calm spectators who had been turned away from the Archery event early this morning . Double disappointment: Fans who could not get in were not only denied entry but also missed out on two world records being set today . But their hopes were dashed when stewards turned them away at the entrance to Lord's, saying that unofficial websites advertising the event were false. The confusion led to frustration among fans, some of whom had travelled from abroad especially for the archery, only to be denied entry. A queue of over 50 fans had gathered outside Lord's by 8am this morning, with dozens more who arrived before the 9am start hoping to get in on a 'first come first served' basis. Some fans even produced what they thought were genuine tickets, purchased from a fraudulent unofficial website. Among those turned away were four devastated archery fans from Siberia, who had travelled to London solely for today's ranking event. Early starters: The Archery ranking event which began at 9am this morning had been wrongly advertised as a ticketed event by some unofficial websites . Going for gold: Team GB pair Larry Godfrey and Simon Terry were among those taking part in the event at Lord's cricket ground today . Missing out: Descher Grit and Ursula Weidner, left, along with Canadians Chris Stewart, Norm Sabapathy and Jim Stewart. right, were among those left disappointed after not being allowed into Lord's . The four men, part of an amateur archery team, were devastated after dashing to the cricket ground from Heathrow following a 16-hour flight from their homeland just to see the one event. Speaking on behalf of the men, two of whom were wearing special Olympics T-shirts, volunteer guide Jelena Petrova said: 'They have come from Siberia all the way for this. 'They are very upset - they don't have tickets to see any other events.' She added: 'These guys have just come off a 16 hour flight at Heathrow this morning and rushed to get here in time. Then the security guard tells us that there's been a miscommunication and non-ticketed also means not open to the public. 'There are people from all over the world turning up here today - it's not good enough.' There was further confusion as other events, such as the cycling road race and marathon running, allowing spectators to watch for free. Royal approval: Team GB competitor Larry Godfrey takes a break in the Archery event, which was also watched by Princess Anne . False: Several ticket sites, such as SportTicket Exchange, confused fans by appearing to offer tickets for sale for the behind-closed-doors archery event today . Mix-up: Another website claiming to sell tickets, Global Ticket Market, also appeared to offer admission to the competition today . Many had assumed the archery was following a similar set-up, but the ranking event eventually went ahead with only members of the media watching. One spectator, Anthony Hunt, had flown in from Mexico especially for the event. The red-faced blunder for Locog at Lord's was the latest of several slip-ups by organisers before the Opening Ceremony. On Wednesday, video producers sparked a diplomatic row by mistakenly displaying a South Korean flag during the warm-up of North Korea's women's football match at Hampden Park. The incident saw North Korea's players walk off the pitch in protest, before the glitch was fixed an hour later. It is thought a video producer in London - who has since offered to resign - was at fault for the gaffe. And just yesterday, Olympic programme producers referred to Welsh Team GB footballer Joe Allen as being English. He told The Times: 'There are some good Mexicans in the archery and I came especially for this day when I saw it advertised as free. 'This is all I have come over for.' Locog's Lord's venue manager Vanessa Bellamy said: 'This has always been a non-ticketed event but it seems some people believed they could come down on the day. 'This was never the case but we believe some illegal websites may have suggested this was the case.' Russell Miller, venue general manager for Locog, added: 'It’s a mistake. We are not licensed today. We had never intended to have spectators here and we cannot allow any in. 'We will look into the communications side and I appreciate that this is not an ideal start. I think the publicity has taken on a snowball effect.' It is unclear from which websites spectators had bought tickets which they produced at Lord's. A spokesperson for the cricket ground declined to comment. A . Locog statement later added: 'We think we have made it very clear that . this is not a free event, like the Road Races or Marathon which have . been advertised as free events. 'This is a ranking round and there is no spectator access at all. 'We . are dealing with this at the venue, along with some people who have . turned up with fake tickets purchased from a fraudulent website. 'Tickets . have not been advertised or sold by LOCOG for the Archery ranking event . which starts today at Lords cricket ground we have always made it clear . that the preliminary rounds are not open for spectators. Warning: Bosses at Lord's were forced to issue this tweet stating that tickets were not available for the event this morning . World beater: South Korean Im Dong-Hyun, who is legally blind, celebrates after setting a new world record in the men's ranking event this morning . 'There are a number of unofficial . websites claiming to sell tickets, we therefore advise people to be . extremely cautious and vigilant when attempting to buy tickets and only . purchase from an official source – if in doubt there is a url checker on . our website which will identify official sources.' Even . more frustratingly for the fans, the ranking event saw two world . archery record smashed - including one by a competitor who is blind. South Korea have claimed the first two world records of London 2012 in the men's archery ranking round. Im . Dong-hyun broke his own individual record for 72 arrows and joined Kim .

A grandmother accused of drowning her five-year-old grandson in a bathtub claims she was suffering from mental health problems dating from World War II. German Marianne Bordt, 72, is said to have killed Camden Hiers by holding him under the water while he was holidaying with her in Florida. She then allegedly tried to commit suicide, but failed and was found by her husband. 'Violence': Marianne Bordt, 72, is said to have killed Camden Hiers by holding him under the water while she was visiting the US . Bordt, from a village near Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, was said to have been distraught at the fact that her daughter and the boy's father had divorced. She had travelled with her husband to Roswell, Georgia, to spend the 2009-10 New Year with their daughter and grandson, before taking him for a holiday to St George Island in Florida. It is alleged she drowned the five-year-old while her husband was out shopping on January 5, before trying to kill herself. Her defence is now planning to argue that she has mental problems which date back to an injury she suffered during World War II, according to a report in The Local, based on articles from Florida paper the Apalach Times. The start of her trial was reportedly delayed last week when . the prosecution asked for more time to prepare a rebuttal against the . last-minute defence witness - a German-born psychoneurologist. 'Confused': The German grandmother is being held at the Florida State Hospital as she awaits trial . Manfred Grieffenstein had carried out tests on Bordt and is to argue that a head injury she suffered in a bombing raid - as well as depression and paranoia - contributed to the crime. The raid was carried out by Russian . forces on her hometown of Breslau on October 7, 1944. The prosecution say they need time to find an expert in dementia and memory loss who can contradict Grieffenstein's argument, so the judge has postponed the trial until both parties were ready. Prosecutors have called for the death penalty, while the defence are pleading insanity and think she should be detained in a Florida mental hospital for the rest of her life. Judge Angela Dempsey has reportedly encouraged the two sides to sit down and reach a deal outside of court, because continuing the trial would mean flying in German-speaking witnesses and end up very expensive.

Finger lickin' good: David Bell's parents had bought supermarket fried chicken when he wanted takeaway brand KFC . An angry son left his elderly father with a broken hip after flying into a rage because his parents did not get the right fried chicken. Norman Bell, 76, bought a supermarket variety of chicken to take to his son David's home in Hartlepool, County Durham, instead of the takeaway Kentucky Fried Chicken the 46-year-old wanted. Mr Bell and David’s mother met their son at a bus stop where the 46-year-old alcoholic became infuriated when his mother revealed the type of chicken they had bought. As Mr Bell tried to walk away, his son went to headbutt him and the pensioner fell while trying to to avoid the blow, Teesside Crown Court heard. Mr Bell had to have surgery and spent 11 days in hospital because his hip was so badly fractured - but still pleaded with the judge to show his son mercy. Bell admitted causing grievous bodily harm, but avoided jail after recorder Richard Woolfall accepted his father's request. The family had joined each other at a bus stop on February 8 when the violence occurred. When Mr Bell became irritated with . his son's behaviour and went to walk home, his son stood in his path . with clenched fists and shouted in his face before preparing to headbutt . him. Nathan Moxon, . prosecuting, said: 'He stepped backwards to avoid the defendant, fell to . the floor and felt what he described as excruciating and unbearable pain to his left hip.' Mr Bell, 46, avoided jail after the trial at Teesside Crown court, pictured, because his father said he was doing well in treatment for alcoholism . Police were called and Bell was arrested at the scene. His dad was taken to hospital where x-rays revealed he had a fractured hip. Bell had drunk half a bottle of whisky and four cans of strong lager that day. He was facing prison but his dad made a plea through lawyers to the court for him to remain free. Mr Moxon added: 'His father said his son has been undertaking alcohol treatment, that this has been effective and he would not like to see his recovery derailed by any custodial sentence.' Rupert Doswell, mitigating for Bell, said he did not mean to fracture his father's hip. He added: 'For the first time in a long time there does seem some hope he will rid himself of his addiction. 'He has made progress. He has been alcohol-free for 28 days.' Bell was given 12 months in prison suspended for 18 months with probation provision. Recorder Woolfall told him: 'You are going to have to get a grip of your life. Not only for yourself, but for those around you. 'But for the fact you have made progress and your father does not want you to go to prison, I would have locked you up. Consider yourself extremely fortunate.'","David Bell had drunk half a bottle of whisky and four cans of strong lager .

Simon Brown, who says that his teachings 'come from a place of love', is disputing the mother of his 16-year-old son’s right to a share of his wealth or the £500,000 home they shared for more than 15 years, despite her claim that they were 'man and wife' in all but a legal sense. Mr Brown, who practices holistic health . therapies and counts Boy George and Alicia Silverstone amongst his . celebrity clients, is facing a High Court claim for half of his wealth . from former partner Dragana Brown. Court case: Macrobiotic chef Dragana Brown, left, is suing her former partner and the father of their child Simon Brown for half of his wealth in a unique bid to secure a common law divorce pay-out . This includes a 50 per cent share of his flat in Camden, West London, half the value of his collection of classic Jaguar cars and half the royalties for two of his books written since September 2010. Although the couple share the same surname they are not married. Ms Brown,a 48-year-old macrobiotic chef, co-authored a cookery book with Boy George about the diet which is based around grains, local vegetables, and avoiding animals products and processed foods, and is linked with the belief that food quality can affect health, happiness and well-being. Famous followers of the diet are said to include actress and model Kelly Brook and singers Madonna and Sting. She claims her guru partner told her that she 'need not worry' about their home being in his sole name 'as she was protected as a common law wife' should they split up. However when the couple parted ways in 2008, after a 'serious and committed relationship' which lasted 15 years and produced a child, Mr Brown told his former partner that she had 'no legal or beneficial interest' in his flat, his cars or the books. Ms Brown, originally from Kosovo, has now launched a High Court claim, asserting she is entitled to half shares in the property, the book royalties and the three Jaguars. In documents filed at London’s High Court, Ms Brown’s barrister, Michael Glaser, set out her case and told how the former golden couple of the new age scene came to fall out over money. 'Although unmarried, the parties began living together as man and wife at the property when Ms Brown moved in on February 5, 1994. The reason for the delay in her moving in is that Mr Brown informed her that the timing and direction of her move had to be correct according to feng shui principles,' the barrister said. 'Although it was purchased in Mr Brown’s sole name in September 1993, it had always been the intention and understanding of the parties that it was to be their joint home,' he went on. 'Following the birth of their son, Ms Brown was concerned as to her position in relation to the property and any claims she may have against Mr Brown in the event that the parties were to separate. Cooking up a storm: Ms Brown, a macrobiotic chef, co-authored a cookery book with her friend - popstar Boy George . 'These concerns were raised with Mr Brown and the parties discussed their situation. Mr Brown said to her that she need not worry as she was protected as a common law wife. 'The parties agreed and understood this to mean that they both owned 50 per cent of the property and other assets they went on to purchase. This agreement and understanding was frequently repeated throughout the parties’ relationship,' he added. 'Ms Brown now understands that there is no legal concept known as a common law wife. In any event the agreement which they both made...was that she was entitled to one half of the property and other assets which they purchased during their relationship. 'She relied on this agreement - and the assurance given by Mr Brown to her - to her detriment,' the barrister said. Mr Glaser went on to claim that Ms Brown was entitled to a share of the book royalties because she had 'edited them and co-authored the books' and that she had also made substantial payments towards the upkeep of the family home and the maintenance of the family whilst living there. Ms Brown is also seeking an order that she and her son Michael be permitted to live in the contested flat until he has finished University. Of this claim, Mr Glaser concluded: 'The property was purchased as a home for Ms Brown and Mr Brown and any children of the family. Although the relationship has since broken down, Ms Brown requires the property in order to provide a home for herself and the parties’ child.” In his defence to the action, Mr Brown’s barrister, Morgan Sirikanda, denied that Ms Brown has any 'legal or beneficial interest' in the flat, the cars or the books, and denied feng shui had anything to do with the timing of her move into the property. 'It is expressly denied that the property was bought by Mr Brown with the intention that it would be a joint home for Ms Brown and himself,' he said. 'It is expressly and specifically denied that Mr Brown sought to assuage any concerns by representing to Ms Brown that she need not worry because she is his common law wife. Issue: Ms Brown wants 50 per cent share of the couple's home in Camden, West London. Simon Brown, who says that his teachings 'come from a place of love', is disputing the mother of his 16-year-old son s right to a share of his wealth . 'Mr Brown has never described Ms Brown as a ‘common law wife’ either to her or to anyone else,' he went on. 'The . parties on occasion referred to themselves as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ because they were in a serious and committed relationship which by 1996 . had produced a child,'he added. 'These . references have no connection to any understanding they had as to . ownership of the property or any other asset,' the barrister states. Mr Sirikanda also denied that Mr Brown’s former partner had edited or co-authored any of his books, or that she had the financial input into the home and family that she claims, adding: 'Mr Brown never assured or promised Ms Brown that his income was joint monies to be shared between them.' Famous associations: Simon Brown practices holistic therapies and counts Alicia Silverstone among his clients . In promotional material for his . alternative therapies business, which at times has earned Mr Brown . upwards of £90,000 a year and focuses on feng shui, macrobiotics and . healing, the guru says: 'The words that best express my intentions are empathy, honesty, integrity, kindness, respect, dignity, understanding, care and gentleness...You will be listened to and heard in a way that is non-judgmental, open, considerate and caring. 'All our interactions come from a place of love.” Dragana Brown said outside court: 'I don’t want to tarnish anybody’s name; I am just going to court to claim what I know is legally and morally mine. 'There are so many women who are under the illusion that there is such a thing as a common law wife - I was one such woman. 'I could walk away from this case with nothing, but I want to get it out there so other people know.” She called for the law to be changed to give long-term partners similar property rights to married women calling it 'outdated.''","Simon Brown is disputing the mother of his teenage son's right to a share of his wealth as they go through .

The total haul of 22 eclipses the 19 won at Beijing four . years ago. Team GB now has 47 medals of all colours with more guaranteed in the men’s and women’s boxing. In . a few hours of extraordinary drama yesterday, Alistair Brownlee, 24, . delivered the first gold in the triathlon in a packed Hyde Park. His brother Jonny, 22, collapsed from exhaustion after winning the bronze. Thanking the home fans, Alistair, . said: ‘I don’t think I’ve ever come across anything like that, my ears . were stinging. It was amazing.’ Soon . it was the turn of Laura Bechtolsheimer, Carl Hester and Charlotte . Dujardin, who held off a strong challenge from Germany to win the team . dressage in the Greenwich Arena. It was Britain’s first ever dressage gold and came 24 hours after the equestrian team’s victory in the show jumping team. Attention . then switched to the Velodrome where Laura Trott, 20, confirmed her . status as the new star of British cycling with a brilliant win in the . six-discipline omnium. It was her second gold of London 2012. Edinburgh-born Hoy followed up her . achievement with his second gold of the Games to add to his one from .

It’s one of the greatest feelings I have ever had,’ he said. ‘The . crowd have been absolutely magnificent throughout and the noise they . made was deafening – it definitely makes a difference to have that kind . of volume of home support and to know how much people are behind us as a . team.’ He did several . laps of honour to celebrate holding off the rest of the field in the . keirin, which starts with a pace-making motorcycle.

Team GB's medal count stood at 22 golds, 13 silvers and 13 bronzes. In 2008, our athletes won 19 golds, 13 silvers and 15 bronzes . Some fans say it should be the British team’s anthem for London 2012, but for others it has become an irritation. Spandau Ballet’s song Gold is played on the BBC’s Olympics Tonight show whenever our gold medal tally needs to be increased on the studio chart – that’s 22 times as of last night. But some fans are sick of the track, which was a hit in 1983. One wrote online: ‘The unfortunate side effect of Team GB winning so many gold medals [is that] Spandau Ballet is stuck in my head. Thanks BBC.’ However, many are calling for Spandau Ballet to play at the closing ceremony, and band member Gary Kemp, told the Daily Mail: ‘We would love to take part. If they asked we would jump at it. I am so proud of the team.’ Australia's sports minister has lost a bet with her British counterpart over who would do better at London 2012. Kate Lundy had bet Hugh Robertson that if Australia did not beat Britain in medals, she would row down the Olympic course on Eton Dorney wearing a Team GB shirt. His forfeit if Britain lost out was to play hockey in a Kookaburras’ shirt. With Australia at 13th in the medals table and Britain in third, Miss Lundy admitted she would have to put on the shirt and test her rowing skills. She told Channel 4 news: ‘I’ve already conceded I know I’m going to be rowing out of Eton.’ The cyclist said he was unlikely to . compete at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro but could carry on until the . 2014 Commonwealth Games, which are being held in Glasgow. There . was disappointment for home fans when double gold medallist Victoria . Pendleton, 31, was beaten by her greatest rival Australian Anna Meares . in the individual sprint. She did however become the most successful British female Olympian. Pendleton, who had entered London . 2012 hoping to win three Olympic golds and had lost that chance after . disqualification in her first race five days ago, appeared to have taken . the lead in her three-race final after crossing the line first, but the . win was taken away from her for a technical infringement. ‘I’m just so relieved and I’m overwhelmed with emotion,’ said Pendleton, who is retiring after the Games. It . meant that Britain’s track cyclists had won seven of the ten events in . the Velodrome together with a road cycling gold taken by Tour de France . winner Bradley Wiggins. A . silver medal in the windsurfing at Weymouth for Nick Dempsey added to . Britain’s tally and Robbie Grabarz won high jump bronze in the athletics . stadium. That means Team GB has equalled the overall medals total from 2008 with five days of action left. Chef de mission Andy Hunt said: ‘What has been achieved is the result of a shared commitment made by 541 athletes.' Hoy became a member of the national squad in 1996 and won his first world championship medal in 1999 - a silver in the team sprint. He has since won 11 world and two Commonwealth titles. Hoy won his first Olympic gold medal in Athens in 2004 in the kilo event, but went on to focus on other disciplines after it was dropped from the schedule for the Beijing Games in 2008. He rode in the keirin, the sprint and the team sprint at Beijing and won a gold medal in all three. In doing so, he became the first Briton since 1908 to win three gold medals in a single Olympic Games, and the most successful Olympic male cyclist of all time. He was voted BBC Sports Personality of the Year in 2008 and was awarded a knighthood in the 2009 New Year Honours list. The velodrome for the 2014 Commonwealth Games has been named after the cyclist.

Sentenced: Orlando Lopez, 24, will spend life behind bars even though he maintains his innocence . Even the judge who sentenced the murderer to spend 311 years behind bars couldn't help but inject her own personal condemnation at the sentencing hearing. Judge Doris Shockley said that the even though she has worked in the Lakeport, California area for 'a very long time' she found Orlando Lopez's shooting spree that left one child dead and five others injured to be 'the most callous and vicious and nonsensical' crimes of her career. The shooting took place at a family barbeque in 2011, when he and a friend opened fire inside a home as the result of a feud between two families. Authorities say he and 22-year-old Paul Braden fired shotguns from a neighbor's yard at people attending the barbecue. Victim: Skyler Rapp, 4, was the young boy who was shot dead in the June 2011 incident and his mother and her boyfriend were among the wounded . Lopez, 24, was convicted of first-degree murder and other charges in the June 2011 shooting in Clearlake.  Four-year-old Skyler Rapp died. The boy's mother, Desiree Kirby, was one of the wounded, as was her boyfriend Ross Sparks, his brother Andrew Sparks, and two others. The boy’s grandmother spoke at the sentencing, saying that her grandson was ‘very much loved’ and had just finished preschool and looking forward to kindergarten at the time of the shooting. Co-conspirator: Paul Braden, 22, is also charged in the same case . She warned that Lopez was ‘about to find out what hell is’. Lopez was found guilty of first degree murder, five counts of attempted murder, six counts of assault with a firearm, two counts of mayhem, and a number of other charges relating to the use of a firearm inside a home. He is now due to spend 311 consecutive years in prison. The judge said that the shooting at the barbeque was the most violent in a continued escalation of criminal activity by Lopez, who has a history of substance abuse, but she did not detail the specific crimes. Throughout the trial and sentencing, Lopez maintained his innocence and claimed that his trial was flawed because he was tried in conjunction with Braden. Lopez says that while he was sorry for what happened at that fatal barbeque, he is now being taken away from his own children, ages 4, 6, and 8 years old. 'I now have lost my family, including three children, due to an unjust court system,' his lawyer read in a statement on Tuesday. Judge Shockley called the shooting 'callous' and 'nonsensical', and Lake County News reports that she left Lopez with the chilling warning that state prison 'is a very difficult place'.","Orlando Lopez, 24, maintained his innocence throughout the trial ."

The daring mission to retrieve a top-secret CIA satellite from the bottom of the ocean at the height of the Cold War was kept under wraps for 40 years - until the spy agency decided to lift the lid. Last week, the mission was declassified, and the report and photos of the effort to recover the Hexagon satellite were made available for public consumption. The satellite was one of three that was sent into orbit to provide a bird’s eye view of the Soviet Union and China and other potential foes during the Cold War. Scroll down for video . Salvage mission: These newly-declassified photos show the recovery effort to pluck the Hexagon from the sea . Lost? The satellite sits on the ocean floor in these newly-declassified photos . But as the Hexagon re-entered earth’s atmosphere, a parachute designed to soften its landing broke, and the craft plummeted into the Pacific Ocean. For months, the satellite - and its 60 miles of film - were lost on the sea floor. Space.com reported that two missions to retrieve the satellite in 1971 failed, but the Navy tried again on April 25, 1972. In the third mission, the Navy used its Trieste II Deep Sea Vehicle – complete with a mechanical arm – to bring the Hexagon to the surface. Helping hand: The Hexagon is lifted out of the water by a giant mechanical arm . There was, however, one setback. The report said: 'The third attempt was successful in locating and securing the film stacks; however, as the Trieste was surfacing, the film broke into pieces. Twenty-five feet was recovered.' What the Navy took away from the recovery mission was the proper actions to carry out such salvage missions in the future. Success? The attempt was successful in locating and securing the film stacks; however, as the Trieste was surfacing, the film broke into pieces . The highly classified Hexagon satellite, also known as the Big Bird, was not seen publicly until September of last year. That was when a KH-9 Hexagon was displayed to the public in a one-day-only exhibit at the Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center at Dulles Airport, Virginia. The Big Bird satellite is 60-feet long and weighs 30,000 pounds, bigger than a bus. It took extremely detailed photographs from space during the Cold War.

Big Bird was first placed in orbit in 1971 and was one of the most advanced spy satellites of its time, producing images of the Soviet Union, China and other countries that held strategic importance for the U.S. government.

The military officer in charge of planning for the Olympics has warned that it could take two years for the armed forces to recover from the burden of deploying extra troops at the Games. Wing Commander Peter Daulby also said the Games showed that the forces needed to be large enough to respond to emergencies. His comments come after thousands of troops were drafted in to plug gaps left by private firm G4S, which failed to provide enough security guards to protect Olympic venues. Duty: It will take the armed forces two years to recover after extra personnel were deployed to the Olympics, a senior military officer has claimed . They are likely to be interpreted as a veiled attack on politicians who seek to cut the size of the military to save money. Wing Cdr Daulby said: 'It just shows you the dangers of pulling the military down.' The senior officer said the deployment of extra officers had been a 'game changer' that had a major impact on the armed forces. 'We were originally planning to provide niche capabilities,' he told the Guardian. 'When the requirement for venue security was doubled, that was a bit of a game changer. Royal support: Prince William speaks to members of the Irish Guards on security duty at the Olympic rowing events . 'We had to generate 18,000 people. That . does not mean that there are 18,000 spare people. It means that the . Government has prioritised (the Olympics). 'It will take two years to recover from this, to get back to normal, to get everything back into kilter. 'You can’t expect them to go back to normal routine very easily.' G4S had a contract to provide 10,400 guards for the Olympics, but Army, Navy and RAF personnel had to step in after it failed to meet its targets. Some 3,500 troops were committed initially, but the Government had to draft in a further 1,200 as the opening ceremony approached. Guarding the Games: Soldiers like these at the Olympic Stadium were forced to plug gaps left by private firm G4S, which failed to provide enough security guards . Wing Cdr Daulby said the Olympics showed 'the country needs a military for more than war fighting'. He added: 'It just shows you the dangers of pulling the military down. I am sure that there are some people who think that if we are a smaller military power we will be less likely to get involved in international operations. 'If we shrink the military, do we really understand what we are losing? 'Look at the speed with which we pushed up the throttle. It proves the military offers the country a huge amount of resilience.' Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the failure by G4S to meet the security requirements illustrated the different approaches taken in the private and public sector. 'I still think that, in general, there’s a lot that the public sector still has to learn from the way private sector does things,' he told the Independent. 'But, the story of G4S and the military rescue is quite informative because as two models of how to approach a problem you could not get two greater extremes than the G4S model and the military model. 'The G4S model says here is a cost envelope within which I have to deliver an outcome and therefore I have to do it incredibly leanly. 'I have to do it with very little . resilience. So G4S were literally hiring people and expecting to deploy . them three days later, into a live situation; trying to build up a . management structure overnight, at the beginning of the operation. Team: Army and Navy personnel have been working together at the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London . 'A . very lean structure, with lots of dependence on self-motivation by the . people in the workforce; scheduling their own shifts, for example, by . accessing an internet site. 'The military comes at it from the exact opposite extreme. What’s the job that needs to be done? 'Ok, we’ll do it. Whatever it takes we’ll pour in massive over-resourcing, massively heavy structures of management.' Mr . Hammond added: 'What the military primarily deliver is contingent . capability and I haven’t been able to think of a single large-scale . example where a private organisation delivers a contingent capability. 'You pay for it, year in, year out, but you probably never use it for what it’s designed for.' Ready for action: HMS Ocean, the largest active ship in the Royal Navy sails down the Thames at Greenwich, as part of a pre-olympics security exercise . Poised: A crew member stands guard next to a mounted gun as British Royal Navy helicopter carrier HMS Ocean passes Canary Wharf during security rehearsals . A . Ministry of Defence spokesman said: 'The defence contribution to the . Olympics was always planned to avoid an impact on current operations. 'So, . while some individual training and leave may need to be rescheduled, . this will be managed and will not impact on operations including the . ongoing mission in Afghanistan. 'Given the scale and importance of . this once in a generation event, including the forthcoming Paralympics, . it is right that all across government play a part in ensuring the . success of the Games. 'This includes the armed forces who have done a fantastic job while continuing to deliver on other standing tasks and duties.' Police officers claimed that the G4S debacle showed that the involvement of private firms in policing carried risks. Hampshire . Police Federation chairman John Apter urged Home Secretary Theresa May . to 'think long and hard before handing over the public sector Crown . jewels to the highest bidder'. Taking aim: Trained RAF snipers were involved in the effort to ensure the Olympics were held safely . 'The Police Federation has raised concerns many times over the reliance of private industry in areas such as policing,' he said. 'What the Olympic G4S debacle has shown is that we were right to be concerned. 'It . is good to see that the Defence Secretary has come out fighting for our . troops, and is now reconsidering there are limits to what private . industry can do.' The . federation's national vice-chairman, Simon Reed said: 'Domestic . security must be undertaken by public servants - men and women who are . fully trained and accountable for their actions. 'This is what the public want and what the public deserve.

A stressed-out student trying to make his life easier tried a cheeky way to skip the last few chapters of a novel set as homework - only for it to sensationally backfire. The student took to Yahoo! Answers earlier this week, asking for a book summary of The Boy Who Couldn't Sleep And Never Had To, by D.C. Pierson, admitting he had not finished the book. By the following day, however, the student was rumbled - not by an angry teacher or disappointed parent, but by the novel's author... who was not impressed. Caught out online: A student was reprimanded by author DC Pierson after he posted this on Yahoo! Answers in an attempt to get away with not reading Pierson's novel for an assignment . The author reprimanded the student posting: ‘I'm bummed out that you don't want to try and finish it, and not even because you think it's bad, but just because it seems like work instead of like fun.’ Pierson told TODAY.com that he was particularly bothered by the student’s ‘huffy list of excuses’ for not finishing the 226-page novel including being a slow reader and his local library was undergoing renovations. Angry author: DC Pierson, right, was pleased his book The Boy Who . Couldn't Sleep and Never Had To, left, made it on a school reading list . but was not impressed by a student's online attempt to do an assignment . without reading it . Under the username ♥ Idiot America ~ . ϟƘƦІןן∑x ♥, the student had written in his original post: ‘I haven't . been able to finish this book. Can someone give me a complete review, . including everything important? I REALLY need this! AND it's not because . I'm slacking.’ Reading low: With a low national reading level, American students are assigned books appropriate for a 5th grader . Pierson, who is also a founding member . of improvisation group Derrick Comedy, was quick to post photos on . Twitter and Tumblr of a screenshot of the Yahoo! post joking that he was . a ‘full service author’. He tried to convince the student it was worth finishing the book. Pierson wrote: 'I think you'll find there's a ton more sex, swearing, and drugs in my book than anything else you have been or will be assigned in high school.' Others posted a range of responses from calling the student lazy and a whinger to encouraging him to read the book. Released in March, a report on American high school students found that national reading levels remained low, with assigned book lists reflecting a level appropriate for 5th grade students. Only 34 per cent of students were rated proficient in reading on the 2011 National Assessment of Educational Progress, an exam done every two year. The national 12th grade reading level was lower in 2009 than in 1992. The lowest SAT critical reading scores were recorded last year. First off, I'm really excited that my book is being suggested for summer reading. On the other hand, I'm bummed out that you don't want to try and finish it, and not even because you think it's bad, but just because it seems like work instead of like fun. I'm not going to sit here and act like I didn't sometimes not read assigned books for class in high school. Even though it's referenced once in my book, the book you're avoiding reading, I've never actually read ""The Scarlet Letter."" So I'm sympathetic to your plight. But I think you'll find there's a ton more sex, swearing, and drugs in my book than anything else you have been or will be assigned in high school, and I don't mean in the way your teacher will tell you ""You know, Shakespeare has more sex and violence than an R-rated movie!""

When Michael Rock planted 11 fruit trees on his allotment, he hoped to make enough jam to give to his pensioner neighbours. But it turned out he was sowing the seeds of his own eviction. Mr Rock’s pear, plum, apple, cherry and apricot trees did not impress many of his 600 fellow tenants more used to growing potatoes, marrows and leeks on their prized plots. They complained to the council, leading to a new set of rules requiring that three quarters of any allotment should be used for ‘productive crops’ such as vegetables. Allotment owner Michael Rock stands on his plot of land in protest. He doesn't want to be evicted from the land he grows his 11 fruit trees . He won't budge on the allotment: Mr Rock says he will appeal the case where a judge ruled against his wishes . Mr Rock, 60, a Canadian-born author . who lives in a tower block in Hastings, refused to agree to the new . rules that would force him to plant vegetables under his trees. He said he had grown potatoes, leeks and onions in the past but had produced so many that they had gone to waste. As a result, Hastings Borough Council . attempted to evict Mr Rock from his 250-square-metre plot and he decided . to challenge the decision in court. He said: ‘The council are not playing by the rules and should be ashamed of themselves. They are acting like bullies. ‘I have invested a lot of time and money in my plot and I am not prepared to see that undone.’ At Hastings County Court, the . barrister for the council, Jack Anderson, said: ‘I suggest there is . ample space at that plot for the cultivation of flowers and vegetables.’ Mr Rock replied: ‘No. I can’t plant . things where the trees are supposed to grow. I have not breached the . contract. This council ruling is to remove people who abandon their . plots. I love the trees and I feel I am being penalised. ‘I was never given any leaflets detailing what I could grow. I was given permission to grow fruit trees as dwarf stock.’ After a four-hour hearing, District Judge Geoffrey Smith ruled he could not grant an injunction against the eviction. But he appealed for common sense to . prevail, saying: ‘It is sad this case has come to court. I would . encourage both parties to find some middle ground.’ An unrepentant Mr Rock – who was . forced to pay court costs of £650 – insisted: ‘They will have to evict . me if they want me out.

Mr Rock sought an injunction and a declaration from the court to . preserve his rights as an allotment holder. We contested that Mr Rock . was not entitled to the relief requested; the judge dismissed Mr Rock’s . claim and awarded costs to the council.’ A spokesman for the National Allotment .

However, woman's rights groups say some families are bullied into accepting such payments.

The mother of one of two Iowa cousins missing for more than a month was taken to a hospital after police found her unresponsive at a relative’s home, police say. Misty Morrissey was taken Monday to Allen Hospital, according to a police report obtained by the The Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. Morrissey is the mother of 10-year-old Lyric Cook. She and her cousin, Elizabeth Collins, who has since turned 9, were reported missing July 13 from the Waterloo suburb of Evansdale. In hospital: Misty Morrissey, left, pictured with estranged husband Dan Morrissey, was rushed to the hospital earlier this week; she is the mother of missing girl Lyric Cook . Where are they? A security video shows Elizabeth . Collins, 9, left, and Lyric Cook-Morrissey, 10, right, riding by on . their bicycles on the day that they disappeared . Authorities believe the girls were abducted. Police Lt. Michael McNamee says a . relative says Morrissey was at the hospital earlier Monday and was given . medication. He said she drank alcohol and the relative grew . alarmed when she couldn’t be wakened. The hospital says Morrissey wasn’t listed as a patient Tuesday. Cousins Lyric and Elizabeth went . missing after leaving to ride their bikes in Evansdale, just miles from . their home in Waterloo. Mr Morrissey has come under intense . scrutiny from police because of his ties to the local methamphetamine . trade. But authorities have said he is not considered a suspect is the . girls' disappearance. Close: The girls, pictured in 2009, would often spend the day together when Lyric's mother was at work and were very close . A surveillance camera on an auction barn shows Lyric and Elizabeth riding their bicycles away from Meyers Lake in Evansdale, Iowa, shortly after they left home on July 13. After examining the fleeting footage of the girls racing through a corner of the screen, police concluded that they must have been kidnapped. Black Hawk County Chief Deputy Rick Abben told ABC News: 'It looked kind of grainy, I mean just -- zoom -- they were by . the thing and so it's very hard to really make much out of the thing.' He added: 'The girls were less than a block from the house when . this camera captured them riding by, important to note they were riding away . from Meyers Lake.' The footage, taken just after noon, runs in . accordance with the police timeline of the case. Missing: The two young cousins have been missing since Friday, July 13 after going for a bike ride together . Dan Morrissey leans on a tree . near Meyers Lake where his daughter Lyric and her cousin Elizabeth . Collins disappeared on July 13 . Authorities found the girls' bikes . and a purse on a path, hours after they were reported missing in . Evansdale, a northeast Iowa town of 4,700. FBI . bloodhounds picked up on the girls' apparent scent near the lake last . week and investigators have ruled out the possibility of drowning. An . extensive search involving local, state and federal investigators has . failed to find them. FBI spokeswoman Sandy Breault said there was . 'nothing new' about the case Tuesday. Ms Breault stood by her assertion, first made Saturday, that investigators believe the girls are alive. 'They . are not going to reveal the reasons why. You wouldn't want them to do . that. It would jeopardize the investigation and the children,' she said. David Finkelhor, director of the . Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New . Hampshire, said that claim means investigators could 'have something . quite important' for evidence. He . said cases of two children being abducted by a stranger were rare since . it would be hard for one person to control both, which makes the common . motive of sexual gratification less likely in this case. He said it makes sense to look into whether the abduction is linked to the pending drug charges against Mr Morrissey. In other cases, children have been kidnapped by rivals out of retaliation or held hostage to prevent incriminating testimony, he said. On the hunt: The special 10-member FBI dive team used sonar equipment on a boat for hours Friday to scour the 26-acre lake .

Violent end: Businessman John Steele took his own life on July 11 after battling with depression . A prominent Dallas businessman who horrifically committed suicide last month in his home had a powerful medication for insomnia in his system, an autopsy report revealed. John Rodman Steele stood over his sleeping wife on July 11th with a knife and tried attacking her, investigation papers said. He then fatally stabbed himself. The autopsy report, released by the Dallas County Medical Examiner’s Office, revealed that the BMW car dealership owner had .05 milligrams of zolpidem, a powerful insomnia medication, in his system. In the aftermath of Steele’s death, friends of the family told NBC Dallas-Fort Worth that the 50-year-old father of two suffered from sleeplessness. In an unusual move, the Medical Examiner’s office also released detailed summary of the investigation, including interviews with his wife Dina, and his psychiatrist. In the summaries, it was revealed that the family was struggling with their finances and also had legal troubles. The reports read that on the night of July 11th, Steele entered the couple’s bedroom and began attacking his wife Dina with a kitchen knife, who was sleeping at the time. According to the report, Steele attacked his wife with the knife, injuring her. Scroll down for video .

Tragic scene: Steele attacked his wife in their Highland Park, Texas home, and later turned the kitchen knife on himself . Grim scene: Investigators and a fire fighter discuss details behind the crime scene tape roping off the family's large suburban home . At that point, their 16-year-old son . heard his mother’s screams and came into the room, trying to wrestle the . knife from his father. The son rushed to call 911, at which point Steele apparently stabbed himself to the chest, some reports say in front of his teenaged son. He was taken to the emergency room, where he was pronounced dead. The report revealed that Steele had a long history of prescription painkiller abuse, which he hid from his wife and children. His psychiatrist said that he had been using Vicodin, a powerful drug used to moderate severe pain, for up to 2-3 years. During that time, the doctor said, he had also battled severe depression and anxiety, but refused to be admitted into an impatient facility, as his wife would then know he was having difficulties with depression. Mrs Steele was taken to the hospital and was treated for the injuries sustained. She was later released, WFAA reported. Insomniac: An autopsy report found that he had Zolpiderm in his system, a generic sleep aid that slows brain function to allow for sleep . Mrs Steele did not immediately respond to MailOnline’s request for comment. NBC DFW reported that there is a note in front of the Steele’s Highland Park home that is asking for privacy. Zolpidem, a prescription sleep aid, is used to treat insomnia and works by slowing brain activity to allow for sleep, according to the National Institute of Health. Brand-name forms of zolpidem include Ambien, Edluar, Internezzo, and Zolpmist. The NIH urges those with depression, mental illness, thoughts of harming yourself or others, and those with suicidal thoughts to tell their doctors. The government agency also advises that those taking the drug may experience ‘unexpected’ changes in behaviour and mental health. Man of God: Steele taught Sunday school at the Highland Park United Methodist Church, where he also led Bible studies . Success: Among other ventures, he owned the BMW dealership in Permian Basin . They write: ‘It is hard to tell if these changes are caused by zolpidem or if they are caused by physical or mental illnesses that you may already have or suddenly develop.’ It warns that some may develop aggressiveness, strange behaviours, hallucinations, out-of-body experiences, and anxiety. Steele’s obituary said that he ‘deeply loved his wife and children…and beloved friend.’ He was also a member of Highland Park United Methodist Church, and practiced his faith in part by teaching Sunday school classes and leading Bible studies. He also served on the church’s advisory board, as well as the advisory boards of two banks.

A woman is facing a jail sentence for slashing her dog’s head, nose and body 31 times before cutting herself and telling police it was an intruder. Kim Edmonds, 21, carried out the cruel attack on her springer spaniel Stig which left him mutilated with lacerations and burns in what a RSPCA inspector called the ‘worst attack’ she had ever seen. The unemployed woman from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to the dog on Friday and, pending a psychiatric report, the judge did not rule out a maximum sentence of six months in jail. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Dog slasher: Kim Edmonds was found guilty of slashing her two Springer Spaniels. Dogs Stig was found with 31 lacerations and burns while Dan (pictured) had lesser injuries in the horrific attack . The court heard that Edmonds, who had been taking medication for depression, had slashed the 14-year-old dog and her other dog Dan to a lesser extent, in her back garden in September last year. She made an emergency call to Staffordshire Police, claiming a balaclava-wearing intruder had broken into her backyard and attacked her and the dogs. Police arrived to a shocking scene. According to This is Staffordshire, detective constable Gary Madeley from Burslem Police Station said: ‘It was like an abattoir. There was blood all over the living room and the kitchen. ‘Edmonds' demeanour, considering the report and her dog had been mutilated, was calm.’ Veterinary surgeon Carole Bain, who also attended the scene said: ‘I was shocked by what I saw. ‘I . told her (Edmonds) Stig would need a lengthy operation and she asked if . he would need a skin graft and demonstrated by pinching the skin on his . head. ‘It was unusual as I have never known an owner show such calmness.’ Shocking scene: Police said Edmonds' house looked like 'an abattoir' with blood everywhere. Her two dogs (pictured) were badly injured while she presented self-inflicted cuts, claiming an intruder had attacked her and the dogs . Shocking mutilation: The RSPCA deputy chief inspector Jayne Bashford said the injuries sustained by the dogs were 'totally horrendous'. Stig needed a four hour operation and a week's recovery in a vet clinic (pictured) It is not known what weapon was used to carry out the attack. Stig needed a four hour operation and spent a week recovering at a vet clinic, costing the RSPCA thousands of pounds. Dan also required surgery for slashes to his head. Both dogs have since been re-homed together. But during investigations, police found that Edmonds’ injuries were self-inflicted and they referred the case to the RSPCA. The court heard that the nature of Stig’s injuries suggested he had been held down during the prolonged attack. Jayne Bashford, deputy chief . inspector of the RSPCA said: ‘Kim is a very dangerous lady and the . injuries suffered by the dogs were totally horrendous. ‘In order to inflict 31 separate wounds on this animal, it would have had to be a lengthy, sustained attack. ‘Every person involved has been severely affected by what they saw. It’s caused people a lot of distress.’ Held down dogs: The court heard that the attack done by Edmonds (pictured with husband Brian and injured dog Dan) would have been lengthy and it was suggested that the dogs were held down during the attack . In the Stoke-on-Trent magistrates’ court, Judge Taylor said: ‘I don’t know if a prison sentence is right or not.’ ‘It’s a serious offence that needs the right course of action.’ Edmonds was convicted of one charge of the Section 4 Animal Welfare Act 2006. Edmonds said she unsuccessfully tried to contact a neighbour before calling her husband Brian Edmonds who works in the Pets At Home distribution centre. He said: ‘She was extremely distressed saying that the dog had been attacked and she was on the verge of hysteria.’","Kim Edmonds was found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to her dog .

A Florida cement facility worker is presumed dead after plummeting into a towering dry cement-filled silo that quickly filled with rainwater from the approaching Hurricane Isaac. Officials and co-workers are still searching for the body of Pierre Mezidor, a 58-year-old Haitian father of two, after he was entombed Aug. 17 in what reportedly been described as, 'a horribly gruesome event.' Macabre: Pictured here is the 200-foot-tall silo into which a worker plunged on Aug. 17 when its roof buckled and collapsed . Pierre Mezidor, a 58-year-old immigrant father of two, was standing atop the silo, measuring the quantity of dry cement inside, when the accident occurred . ""His son is like collapsing inside,"" family friend Yolaine Casimier told Local 10 News outside Mr. Mezidor's Florida homestead. Mr. Mezidor was reportedly standing atop the 200-foot silo located in Medley, Fla. around 8:30 a.m., measuring the level of dry cement inside, when the roof beneath him freakishly buckled and collapsed. Along with the piecemeal roof, Mezidor reportedly fell some 140 feet into a silo that one fire official said was only 20 per cent full of dry cement at the time. Rainwater from Tropical Storm Isaac quickly poured into the suddenly-open silo, not quite creating wet concrete, but rather a gooey mush that has bound to debris - and hampered recovery efforts. ""I just look at the situation myself, my head ready to blow and seeing that big thing,"" Casimier told Local 10 News. ""From what we see the situation he's not going to come out alive."" Casimier was reportedly one of the many friends and family members gathered at Mezidor's home Saturday, offering support to his wife, step-daughter and 16-year-old son. Freakish Accident: The incident occurred at Titan America's Tarmac Cement Plant in Medley, Fla., which manufacturers dry cement . Macabre: The interior of the silo (pictured) quickly filled with rainwater from Hurricane Isaac, entombing Mezidor in a gooey mush from which he is yet to be extracted . Mezidor had been working at the Tarmac Cement plant, which is owned by Titan America, for 19 years, according to Local 10 News. His step-daughter has said that he loved his job so much that he would go into work on his days off. Titan America told The Miami Herald that company officials “deeply regret the incident and emphasize that employee safety is their primary concern.” 'I just look at the situation myself, my head ready to blow and seeing that big thing. From what we see the situation he's not going to come out alive.' But family members have already hired an attorney in anticipation of filing a civil suit. “This type of death in and of itself is unspeakable,” Edward Blumberg told The Herald, “and the family still does not have the closure of having a body.” Miami-Dade Fire Rescue reportedly lowered sophisticated cameras and listening devices into the silo - devices sensitive enough to hear someone tapping -  but heard no signs of life. ""We have cadaver dogs that detect only dead people and we have live rescue dogs,"" MDFR Lt. Arnold Piedrahita told Local 10 NEws in the day. ""Hopefully, with those dogs we will be able to determine whether this is going to be a recovery operation or continue as a rescue operation.""

Google is now attempting to ease the concerns of shareholders who fear that Apple may now target them after the success of the patent lawsuit against Samsung. The search engine giant issued a statement in the wake of the $1billion victory that Apple won from a California court, saying that the portions of Samsung's smartphones which were found to be copied do not apply to their software. If that is the case, then Apple will have no case against Google. 'The court of appeals will review both infringement and the validity of the patent claims. Most of these don't relate to the core Android operating system, and several are being re-examined by the US Patent Office,' Google officials said in a statement on Monday. Last week a Californian court decided that Apple's . iPad was copied by Samsung Electronics' Galaxy tablet 10.1 (right) and . that the South Korean firm must pay over $1 billion in damages . Google provided their Android . operating system to companies like Samsung for free, and allowed the . companies themselves to make their own tweaks to the software. 'The mobile industry is moving fast . and all players -- including newcomers -- are building upon ideas that . have been around for decades. We work with our partners to give . consumers innovative and affordable products, and we don't want anything . to limit that,' the statement continued.

Scorched earth: Steve Jobs was said to promise 'thermonuclear war' against Google after then-CEO Eric Schmidt (right) was on Apple's board when Google released their Android software . There is reason for the company to be . somewhat nervous, however, because it would be shortselling it to say . that Google and Apple had a frosty relationship. The Android software first came out on the market when Google's then-CEO Eric Schmidt was serving on the Apple board. The Associated Press reports that . after shoving Schmidt off Apple's board, Jobs vowed that Apple would . resort to 'thermonuclear war' to destroy Android and its allies. While Jobs is no longer at the helm of . Apple and their ensuing legal battles, his determination to kill the . Android software platform may be ingrained in the corporate mindset. Claims: Apple filed its lawsuit in April of last . year alleging that 28 Samsung smartphones and computer tablets had . 'slavishly copied' the iPhones and iPads . Before moving on to any seperate legal . challenges, Apple announced on Monday that they will be following . through with the implications of their victory against Samsung. Apple on Monday gave a federal judge a . list of eight Samsung Electronics Co. products it wants pulled from . shelves and banned from the U.S. market, including popular Galaxy model . smartphones.

A New Hampshire museum staff member insisted that a blind eight-year-old girl surrender her cane before entering its exhibit this week. Abby Duffy was left without the aide of her stick at the Museum of New Hampshire History, in Concord, and had to rely on her family for support as she moved around the museum. Her mother, Penny Duffy was outraged and wrote about the experience on her blog. Little Abby Duffy, who has Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, began losing her sight at age six. She is now legally blind . Confident Kid: The 8-year-old is normally reportedly confident in her movements with the aid of a blind cane . Cute-as-a-Button: Abby has a loving family that consists of father, Chris; mother, Penny; and a brother . Mrs Duffy said the staff member told them the museum has had 'issues with kids in the past', before forcing the girl to leave the cane at the entrance. 'Perhaps she didn't hear when Chris said Abby was blind,' wrote Mrs Duffy on her blog, according to WMUR9 in New Hampshire. 'Lets decide for just this argument she didn't hear him... regardless, what did she think it was? Who are these kids she spoke of? I envision a ninja army of blind children with white canes trashing the museum. It's a white cane, not a switch blade.' The museum has since apologized for what it called 'an unfortunate misunderstanding,' between an confused . employee and the Duffy family. A Much-Anticipated Trip: Chris Duffy decided to take Abby and her brother to the The Museum of New Hampshire History in Concord, N.H. earlier in the week . Museum Mandarin: Upon arrival, an unidentified, long-time museum worker told Abby she would have to surrender her trusty blind cane before she - and her family - could enter its galleries . Abby started losing her vision at age six due to Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and she is now is legally blind, The Huffington Post reports. 'Abby was really bothered by it on the fire tower. There . are some steep stairs, and she was uncomfortable on it without the . cane. She's pretty confident, but her whole demeanor changed.' Despite this, Chris Duffy graciously acceded to the demand - and allowed the cane to be confiscated - because his children were reportedly so excited about visiting the well-traveled historical depository. But the day proved to be a trial for little Abby, who later told WMUR9, 'I had to keep following my dad...I couldn't really walk on my own and go anywhere by myself.' 'Abby was really bothered by it on the fire tower,' Chris Duffy told the New Hampshire Union Leader. 'There are some steep stairs, and she was uncomfortable on it without the cane. She's pretty confident, but her whole demeanor changed.' A Hard Stance: Chris Duffy acceded to the worker's request that Abby relinquish her cane because his children were reportedly excited to visit the museum...and the worker was not going to change her mind . A Delicate Apology: The museum's executive director has since apologized to the Duffys for what it has termed, a 'misunderstanding' between the family and an allegedly confused employee . The museum's executive director, Bill Dunlap, emailed News 9 to explain that the incident was a profound misunderstanding between the Duffys and 'a good employee.' 'We sincerely regret what happened to Abby and her family...which was the result of an unfortunate misunderstanding,' Dunlap reportedly wrote. 'The New Hampshire Historical Society is committed to equal access for all individuals. We are proud of our record over many years of providing access to our facilities to persons with disabilities.' Mr Dunlop later elaborated to the New Hampshire Union Leader that the employee felt terrible about the incident. 'The employee involved is a good employee, a longtime employee, who has worked that job before,' he reportedly said. 'She just misunderstood that the girl had a legal impairment. It was a terrible misunderstanding, and we have apologized to the family.' Still, Mrs Duffy, who is president of the New Hampshire chapter of Parents of Blind Children, wondered aloud on her blog over the museum's logic on the matter. 'We have already gotten an apology and I believe it was genuine,' she reportedly wrote, 'but I am very concerned it may happen again. No one should ever have to (go) through what happened to my family.'

"By . David Cameron . PUBLISHED: . 17:15 EST, 1 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 05:00 EST, 3 September 2012 . This week, politics starts again for the autumn – and I profoundly believe we can face Britain’s challenges with confidence. Yes, growth has been disappointing – but in the past two years we’ve also seen more than 900,000 jobs created in the private sector. Yes, turning around our schools is tough – but hundreds of new Free Schools and Academies are opening every year. Yes, tackling welfare dependency is difficult – but there are more people in work now than at the last Election. This is a Government with fighting spirit for our future. Because the Olympics and Paralympics have taught us a valuable lesson: if you have  a vision and pursue it with enough rigour and drive, you can achieve it. And my vision for this country is clear. Clear vision: Prime Minister David Cameron is striving for a more competitive, dynamic and creative Britain . It’s a Britain that is more competitive, dynamic, creative – that is linked up with the fastest-growing parts of the world. It’s a Britain where we have real social mobility, where people can rise from the bottom to the top and no one knows their place. It’s a society where we build up the doers, the creators, the life-affirmers – whether that’s the person who starts a business or works for a better neighbourhood. And all of this means a nation where we talk about the values that matter: that families are vital; that we each have responsibilities to fulfil; that doing an honest day’s work is a moral good that should be rewarded. The truth is we’re too far away from . that country today. There is a lot to do – to help our businesses be . more successful, our young people more hopeful,  our society more . aspirational. Working progress: The Prime Minister admits there is still a lot of work to do . But Britain’s Olympians and Paralympians have taught us another lesson: graft equals success. You don’t get to the podium without making huge sacrifices and really wanting to win. That lesson can be applied to our country. It will be a hard road to success – but that’s the road we must take. We’re on a hard road to balancing Britain’s books. I know that people look at our growth figures, hit by the eurozone crisis and the fallout from the financial crisis, and ask: is this worth it? But we have to remember the fundamental truth at the heart of this debate: you cannot borrow your way out of a debt crisis. Countries across Europe have found there’s a tipping point where piling on more debt isn’t just counter-productive, it is lethal – because you slam the brakes on growth. We are pulling Britain out of that trap. When I became Prime Minister our market interest rates were the same as Spain’s. Ours are now less than two per cent; theirs more than six per cent. Why? Because we threw a lifeline around the British economy and pulled it back from the cliff edge. We’ve cut the deficit by a quarter already, and we are sticking to this course: rejecting the easy path; restoring sanity to our finances; keeping Britain safe. We’re on a hard road, too, to fix the underlying problems in our economy. The crisis in the eurozone has made things more difficult, but it was never going to be easy to rebalance away from unsustainable financial services, public spending and immigration. What we need is a bigger private sector; wealth spread more widely across the country; more emphasis on the industries of the future, such as green technology and advanced manufacturing. We’re seeing progress – for the first time since the Seventies Britain is a net seller of cars – but there is a long way to go. Hard graft: Olympians and Paralympians have proved people have to make sacrifices and work hard to achieve success . Proud: David Cameron and his wife Samantha with Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William at the Paralympic Opening Ceremony . A key part of recovery is building the . houses our people need, but a familiar cry goes up: ‘Yes, we want more . housing; but no to every development – and not in my back yard.’ The nations we’re competing against don’t stand for this kind of paralysis and neither must we. Frankly, I am frustrated by the hoops you have to jump through to get anything done – and I come back to Parliament more determined than ever to cut through the dither that holds this country back. That’s why I wasn’t prepared to allow the debate on House of Lords reform to crowd out the parliamentary timetable. Instead, we will return this week with new Government Bills for economic development. And nowhere will the road ahead be harder than on increasing opportunity. The easy road on education is to cave in to the unions who want to keep inflating the GCSE and A-level grades and pretend that standards are rising each year. The easy road on welfare is to spend more money, push people a pound or two over the official poverty line and pretend you’ve cracked the problem. But it’s these easy options that have betrayed millions. Tough times: Countries across Europe are struggling with debt in the current economic crisis . So this Government is being braver. In schools, there will be no more excuses for failure; no more soft exams and soft discipline. We saw that change in the exam results this year. When the grades went down a predictable cry went up: that we were hurting the prospects of these children. To that we must be very clear: what hurts them is dumbing down their education so that their potential is never reached and no one wants to employ them. ‘All must have prizes’ is not just patronising, it is cruel – and with us it is over. In welfare, too, we are restoring rigour. We’ve capped benefits. We’ve said to people that  if they want Jobseeker’s Allowance, they’ve got to actively seek a job. Above all, we have brought in dynamic charities and companies to support  people back into work. The result? In the past two years the number of homes where no one works has fallen by nearly a quarter of a million. And all these goals aren’t tick-boxes on some Government spreadsheet. They’re all linked into one vision. Priority: Mr Cameron wants an end to 'soft exams and soft discipline' in schools (stock image) Whether it’s giving our children a world-class education; putting work back at the heart of our welfare system; helping to create good, high-skilled jobs across our country; curbing immigration so that we get more British people into those jobs, or building more houses so that those who work long hours can afford a home for their family, the thread running through our plans is this: building a Britain where those who want to work hard and do the right thing can get on in life. And these ambitions show something else: that this is a historically radical Government. No previous Government has been bold enough to go to Europe and say no to a treaty that wasn’t in Britain’s interests. No previous Government dared to reform university finance in such a fundamental way. No previous Government has been brave enough to take on genuine reform of our public sector pension system and cut  in half the long-term cost to the taxpayer. At every turn we are taking the hard road over the easy path – and we are doing so because we have a clear destination in mind: a truly great Britain; equal to the challenges of the 21st Century; a country we are proud to call home not just for this golden month of the Olympics and Paralympics but in every month, all the time. I’m confident we’re making progress. And I’m more ready than ever for the challenge ahead.","In his own words, David Cameron reveals his vision for the future of Britain ."

A border collie with a chronic leg condition that could have meant she would never walk again has been given a new leash of life - after getting a pair of miracle boots. Nicky Prescott was devastated when her dog, Maddie, was diagnosed with severe Achilles tendon injuries, and was told it was unlikely she would fully recover. But 10-year-old Maddie has stunned vets by fighting back, and is even winning agility competitions after specialists designed her a revolutionary pair of splint boots. What an athlete! Maddie show off her recovery with a stunning jump . Ms Prescott, from Taunton, Somerset, said: 'We’re all astounded at Maddie’s recovery - in true paralympian style, she’s back out competing with the best of them. 'She has always been a really active dog, so it was devastating when we were told she had such terrible tendon injuries. 'She underwent an operation at Bristol Vet College which realigned the tendons - but they said she would re-injure them if she put any stress on them at all. 'I knew we wouldn’t be able to keep her still and was terrified she would re-injure herself. 'Her orthopedic boots are brilliant - she isn’t the least bit bothered about having her legs strapped up, and you wouldn’t know she was different from any other dog. 'I was a miracle just to have her walking again, let alone being able to run around competing in agility classes. 'She's not going to win crufts, but we can still go out and have fun in the veterans classes every weekend.' Plastered pup: After surgery and before her brilliant boots, the collie's legs had to be encased in plaster casts . Ingenious: The high-tech boots helped Maddie after her operation, and will now stop her injury recurring . Agility dog Maddie had been competing at a high level until she developed problems with her legs in 2009, making it difficult for her to walk. She underwent two operations to correct the ligaments at the University of Bristol Veterinary College in 2010, and got her boots soon after. The amazing footwear was the work of OrthoPets, who make braces and prosthetics for injured pets. Rod Hunt, who created the boots, said: 'In simple terms, Maddie had injuries to the Achilles tendons in both hocks, which were fraying. 'Both required surgical repair, during which the damaged sections were effectively cut out and the ""good"" ends sutured back together. 'After this type of surgical procedure the hock needs to be immobilised for several weeks to allow the tendon to heal, which is normally achieved by pinning the joint. Typically, when the pin is removed the joint will be put into a hard cast for a further few weeks. Stunning recovery: Owner Nicky Prescott poses with her border collie, Maddie, whose life was transformed by her splint boots . Not bad for a 10-year-old! Maddie's new boots mean she can keep up her agility skills . 'The problem is that at some stage the joint will go from a fully immobilised state to a free-moving state and at that point there is nothing to stop the dog over-flexing the joint and re-injuring the newly repaired tendon. 'Dogs don’t understand bed rest or being careful. This problem is compounded if the dog is particularly fit, active and energetic - such as an agility Collie! 'The orthotics that we made for Maddie have served two functions. 'During the healing and rehabilitation phase, they allowed the amount of movement at the hocks to be controlled and progressively increased in line with how the tendons were healing, instead of the conventional all-or-nothing approach. 'Then, on an ongoing basis, they prevent over-flexion and the subsequent risk of re-injury to the tendons, especially during periods of high activity - such as agility. 'We are thrilled that we’ve been able to help her continue with a healthy and active lifestyle.' Raring to go: Thanks to her orthotics, nothing stands between Maddie and a happy, active life .",Revolutionary orthotic boots mean agility champ Maddie will keep her winning form .

When Mark Welch, of Volusia County, woke up Sunday night, he had a desperate urge to tell someone about his vision, which he now thought was coming true. He tried his parents, but they did not believe him, so the 18-year-old did the next logical thing: he called police. ‘Something that happened in my dream and it's actually happening,’ Welch told replied a Volusia County 911 dispatcher.

In July, the EU banned oil imports from Iran, just after the US enacted tough measures against Iran's central bank. The sanctions, aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear development program, have severely harmed Iran's economy. Ahmadinejad said the banking embargo has affected Iran's ability to supply basic needs such as meat.

Appearing on a live TV talk show, Ahmadinejad said: 'It is an all-out, hidden, heavy war.' Ahmadinejad admitted that the West's sanctions have created problems in oil exports and banking. 'There are barriers in transferring money, there are barriers in selling oil,' said Ahmadinejad. 'We are going ahead, and God willing we will succeed.' 'We are removing the barriers', he added - but without saying how. The West's sanctions are supposed to press Iran to stop enriching uranium.

'If they were to switch, they could pay back that debt within a year with any savings they make. They are the ones who need it most, but they are the ones who don't get it.'

Japan's government has agreed to buy the group of uninhabited islands whose sovereignty has been fiercely disputed with China, it was reported today. It is understood to have paid 2.05billion yen ($26million) to the Japanese Kurihara family for three of the five Senkaku islands, which are known as the Diaoyu group in Chinese. The move would effectively nationalise them and stop China from buying the chain, which lie 200 miles from the Chinese mainland and 200 miles from Japan's Okinawa. It follows months of rising diplomatic tension between the two countries over which has sovereignty over them. The oil-rich islands in the East China sea have been heavily disputed by China and Japan . The acrimony has seen Chinese protesters . overturning Japanese cars in the streets last month and their Japanese rivals swimming to . the islands and planting their national flag on its soil. Tensions over the islands have flared since April, when Tokyo's nationalist governor, Shintaro Ishihara, announced a plan for the city government to raise money to buy the islands so that they would not be vulnerable to purchase by a third party such as China. A Japanese government official declined to confirm the deal after it was reported by the . Kyodo News agency and the Yomiuri and Asahi newspapers. He and said negotiations were continuing. Tokyo Mayor Shintaro Ishihara talks to the media after reports China had purchased the islands . Last weekend, Tokyo sent a team of experts to waters around the islands to survey fishing grounds and possible sites for development - although the central government forbade the expedition from setting foot on the islands. China responded by calling the reported purchase 'illegal and invalid.' Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said: 'For them to nationalize the Diaoyu islands seriously violates China's sovereignty and hurts the Chinese people's feelings. 'I stress again that any of their unilateral acts with the Diaoyu islands are illegal and invalid. 'China's determination will not change in terms of safeguarding its territory. China is observing the situation and will take necessary measures to defend its sovereignty.' While the move would clearly anger China, media reports said that the purchase is intended more as a means of squelching Ishihara's more inflammatory proposal, which includes development plans. The islands are near key sea lanes and surrounded by rich fishing grounds and untapped natural resources. No development would take place under the national plan, the reports said. The media reports said funding for the purchase would require Cabinet approval, something likely to happen in the next week or two. They said the final deal could be closed by the end of the month. Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the government and owner are still talking and he would not comment on details about the discussion. 'We are negotiating with the owner while we try to grasp where the situation stands between (the central government) and the Tokyo metropolitan government,' Fujimura said. He said the government would make an announcement 'when we reach a result after completing the process.' Ishihara said he had spoken to the owners of the islands and claimed they told him that no final deal had been made yet.

City officials said there has been no change in Tokyo's plans to try to buy them, or for Ishihara to visit the area himself sometime next month. They said, however, that the government was dealing directly with Ishihara, and said they did not know the context of those talks. Government representatives met with Kurihara family members on Monday and agreed on the basic terms of the sale, the reports said. The dispute over the islands grabbed headlines after a Sept. 7, 2010, incident in which a Chinese fishing boat collided with Japanese coast guard ships near the islands. The Chinese fishing boat captain was arrested and then released. The dispute had been on the back burner as Japan struggled to recover from last March's devastating earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.","China-Japan tensions over the islands have rumbled on for months .

Carol Hay, pictured outside Bradford Crown Court whose husband John Hay is alleged to have been murdered by her lover Kenneth Bill . A businessman accused of killing his lover's  husband wrote him a  letter to ask if they could share his wife, a court  heard yesterday. Kenneth Bill, 63, had rekindled a relationship with Carol Hay, his girlfriend of 40 years ago. He prepared the indecent proposal weeks before he murdered her husband John, it is claimed. He gave the typed letter to Mrs Hay during one of their secret meetings at a supermarket cafe and asked her to pass it on to her spouse. In it he confessed that he was seeing Mrs Hay, and went on to ask if Mr Hay would 'let her carry on seeing me occasionally as I am sure this will give her the best of both worlds'. It concluded: 'I want her to be happy and I am sure you do too, she deserves it don't you think? If you decide that you don't want her to see me again, please don't mention this letter to her, just look after her and keep her safe.' Giving evidence, Mrs Hay, 62, told the jury: 'He said to give [the letter] to John, saying we were having a relationship and could he share me, with him seeing me a couple of days a week. I said: “Are you having a laugh?” I took it home and shredded it.' Police recovered the letter file from father-of-three Bill's computer after he was arrested on suspicion of murder. He allegedly hatched an elaborate plot to kill Mr Hay, 61, after Mrs Hay finally broke off the relationship. She said her affair with Bill, the owner of a drilling business who split from his own wife five years ago, began last October. They had had a five-year relationship in the Seventies, but it broke down when she met her husband. However, last October she was reminded of him after speaking to some old friends at a party. She then wrote to Bill, asking if he wanted to meet for a cup of tea. 'He was very affectionate, very complimentary,' Mrs Hay told Bradford Crown Court. 'He told me that he loved me, that he'd never stopped loving me and that we should never have split up.'

Neil Armstrong's family announced today that the famed astronaut will be buried at sea. The family of the Navy fighter pilot-turned-astronaut told TMZ of their decision but would not specify where exactly they intend to have that service. Given the fact that Armstrong made his name by being the first man to walk on the moon, the choice to be laid to rest at the depths of the ocean may seem odd, but the practice is common for veterans of the Navy. Scroll down for video . One small step... Neil Armstrong was the mission commander of the Apollo 11 moon landing mission on July 20, 1969 and the first person to set foot on the moon. Neil Armstrong's wife and granddaughter were joined by hundreds of mourners who gathered to pay tribute to Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, at his funeral last Friday. He was honoured as a humble hero who saw himself as a team player and never capitalized on his celebrity. The private service at the Camargo Club in Cincinnati was attended by fellow space pioneers, including his two crew mates on the historic Apollo 11 mission, Buzz Edwin Aldrin and Michael Collins. One of Armstrong's 10 grandchildren, Piper Van Wagenen, was among the family and friends to give heartfelt readings in his memory. Tearful: Carol Armstrong, wife of Neil Armstrong, and Piper Van Wagenen, one of 10 grandchildren, pay their respects to the first man on the moon . Touching: Piper speaks during the service, in front of hundreds of fellow mourners . A memorial service has been scheduled . for September 12 in Washington, nearly two weeks after Armstrong, 82, died at the age of 82 due to complications resulting from . cardiovascular procedure. 'You'll . never get a hero, in my view, like Neil Armstrong,' said Apollo 8 . astronaut Bill Anders, who praised Armstrong after the service for his . wisdom and humility in the way he handled becoming a global icon. 'It's . going to be hard to top.' 'America has truly lost a legend,' said Eugene Cernan, an Apollo astronaut who is the last man to have walked on the moon. Mourning: Hundreds attended a closed memorial service at a private club in suburban Cincinnati . Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican, eulogized Armstrong ""as a reluctant hero"" and said afterward the service was a mix of emotion and humor, with Armstrong's two sons talking about him as a father and grandfather. 'He touched the lives of so many,' Portman said. 'He . was the embodiment of everything this nation is all about,' said NASA . Administrator Charles Bolden. Armstrong, he said, had a courageous drive . for exploration while being an 'incredibly humble' man who probably . wouldn't have wanted all the attention of Friday's service.

Four Navy fighter planes flew over at the end of the service, one flying upward in tribute to Armstrong, a former Navy pilot who flew combat missions in Korea. Raised in Wapakoneta, Ohio, Armstrong developed an early love for aviation. He commanded the Gemini 8 mission in . 1966 and Apollo 11's historic moon landing on July 20, 1969.

When Gordon Spence planted a few cucumber seeds, he was envisaging being able to use the home-grown produce to make a bit of salad for himself and his wife to enjoy. But the 86-year-old, from Brentwood, Essex, might have to invite a few more friends and family round to share in the feast after coming up with this bumper crop. The grandfather of five's gardening efforts produced a colossal 21-inch cucumber weighing more than three times the average. Gordon Spence, 86, pictured, from Brentwood, Essex, has grown cucumber more than triple the average . Mr Spence's wife, Vera, 85, discovered the mammoth crop hiding behind a leaf in greenhouse last week . Some of the UK's most super-sized vegetables are showcased every year at the UK National Giant Vegetables Championships. The monster veg can be so gigantic that forklift trucks are used to move them into display. A new world-record breaking 18.5ft parsnip was one of more than 200 vegetables unveiled at the competition in the Somerset town of Shepton Mallet last weekend. The root vegetable is an eye-popping 36 times bigger than the standard parsnip and was lovingly grown by Peter Glazebrook, 68, from Newark, Nottinghamshire. The retired chartered surveyor has previously held the world record for a 8lbs 40oz potato. He has also been the double Guinness World Record holder for the heaviest parsnip, at 13lb, and the longest beetroot, at 21ft. The veteran grower's record-busting reputation is rivalled by Joe Atherton, 56, from Mansfield Woodhouse, Nottinghamshire. He snapped up the world record for the longest carrot, which he grew to an enormous 19ft 2inches in 2007. He also held the world record for the heaviest leek, at 6.6kg, in 2001. His wife stumbled across his monster . vegetable - . which is twice as long as a normal cucumber - in their greenhouse after . the couple had forgot about the seeds Mr Spence planted last March. Last week Vera, 85, discovered the three-and-a-half pound vegetable hidden behind a large leaf. Mr Spence said: 'I couldn’t believe what she was holding in her hands really - I thought it was a dead animal or something.' 'It was so huge but then when we eventually came down we realised it was a cucumber.' 'It looks more like a marrow than a cucumber as I didn’t think a cucumber could grow this big.' 'I just couldn’t believe it. It is the biggest one I have grown by some distance.' The average cucumber normally weighs in at around 1lbs and measures 10inches in length. However, the couple’s greenhouse . giant cannot live up to Chinese farmer Akele Hi's world-record-breaking . cucumber. It measured an enormous 5ft 7inches long and weighed a . staggering 154lbs. Mrs Spence admitted their impressive effort was a complete accident, adding: 'It is a fluke as far as we are concerned.' But the couple are at odds with what to do with their mammoth vegetable. Mr Spence joked: 'We might eat it, although it would come in handy if you had a few words with your missus or your husband - wallop, take that.' For now, the impressive cucumber has become a major talking point in the couple’s kitchen. The Spence's granddaughter Gemma Sanderson, 29, said: 'I was impressed when I came in and saw it on the kitchen side and I said ‘I need a photo of that’.' Mr Spence's cucumber is still some way off rivalling Akele Hi's record-breaking 154lbs whopper, pictured .","Gordon Spence, 86, forgot about the bumper crop he planted in his greenhouse in Brentwood, Essex, last March .

Guilty: Kansas City Bishop Robert Finn was convicted of one misdemeanor count of failing to report child sex abuse within the church . Kansas City Bishop Robert Finn was found guilty on Thursday . of one count of covering up child pornography, becoming the highest-ranking American . cleric convicted in the Roman Catholic Church . child sex abuse scandal. Bishop Finn, 59, was charged . in 2011 with two misdemeanor counts of failing to alert authorities about a . cache of lewd images depicting young girls that were found on the computer of Reverend . Shawn Ratigan. Jackson County Court Judge John Torrence acquitted Finn on a second count of . covering up child sex abuse. Finn received two years of probation, but that sentence was suspended and . will be wiped from his record if he adheres to a set of conditions that include . mandatory abuse reporting training and setting aside $10,000 in diocese money . for abuse victim counseling. ‘I hope this begins a new chapter in . the book in this community and other communities and that, truly, children will . no longer be subjected to this kind of treatment,’ the judge said. In August, Ratigan pleaded guilty to five counts of producing child . pornography in federal court. Eight other charges were dismissed. The diocese was also charged with failure to report sex abuse and had faced . a $5,000 fine, but the cases were separated on Thursday. Prosecutors said they are . willing to drop charges against the diocese after the Finn verdict. In a statement released after the verdict, lawyers for Finn and the Diocese . of Kansas City-St. Joseph said that the bishop is grateful that the court and prosecutors . have allowed the case to be resolved without bringing it before a jury. ‘The bench trial, with a stipulation of testimony, has avoided the need for . live testimony from diocesan employees, parishioners and others. This process . has also resulted in the charges against the Diocese being dismissed by the . state,’ the statement reads. ‘The diocesan process and procedures as previously existed failed to . adequately identify the necessity to inform the Children's Division of Shawn . Ratigan's behavior in a more timely manner. For this, the bishop is truly . sorry.’ Rebecca Randles, a Kansas City attorney representing a dozen of Ratigan's . alleged victims in civil lawsuits, said it was 'an amazing outcome, getting a . bishop convicted of anything. ‘Of course we wish the diocese was also convicted, but we understand the . process and how it works,’ she said. Finn and several other officials within the diocese became aware of the pornographic . photos depicting young girls allegedly taken by Ratigan in December of 2010 when they . were discovered on the priest's laptop by a computer technician. Grave charges: Reverend Shawn Ratigan was accused in 2011 of creating and storing hundreds of pornographic photos depicting young girls . Of the hundreds of photos found, many focused on the crotch areas of clothed . children and one series showed the exposed private parts of a girl believed to . be three or four years old. Finn has acknowledged he was told in December of 2010 about the images. The . bishop also has acknowledged that a parochial school principal had raised . concerns about Ratigan's behavior around children in May of 2010. State law requires that the Division of Family Services be informed of such . evidence of abuse. Vicar General Robert Murphy confronted Ratigan about the photos, and the . next day, Ratigan was found in his garage with his motorcycle running and a . suicide note that apologized for any harm he had caused. Ratigan recovered . after being hospitalized. But even though Ratigan had acknowledged his wrongdoing, Finn did not notify law . enforcement, according to Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker. Instead, Finn sent Ratigan for a mental . evaluation and then assigned him to an area convent, ordering him to stay away . from children. Later, after the diocese received reports that . Ratigan had attended a St. Patrick's Day parade and a child's birthday party in . violation of the bishop’s orders, Finn asked a church official to hand over copies . of the photos recovered from Ratigan's laptop to police. Blame game: Finn, right, argued that he should not face charges because under the law, Vicar General Monsignor Robert Murphy, left, was the diocese's mandated reporter . Mea culpa: Bishop Finn issued an apology before learning his fate, saying that he is truly sorry for the hurt 'these events have caused' Following Ratigan's arrest, Finn made a statement to a meeting with other . priests that he had ‘wanted to save (Ratigan's) priesthood,’ according to stipulations . made at trial. Finn was indicted almost a year ago and was . slated to face a jury trial on September 24, but agreed to the expedited bench . trial earlier this week. The bishop initially was charged with one misdemeanor count, but a second . was added to acknowledge two separate time periods in which he failed to report . suspected abuse. On Thursday, he was acquitted of a charge spanning December 17, 2010, to February . 10, 2011, because the judge said there was no evidence beyond a reasonable . doubt that Finn knew about the pornographic photos. The charge on which Finn was convicted involved a period from February 11, . to May 11, 2011. Finn sent Ratigan to stay at a convent in Independence, Missouri, . during that time, which prosecutors said showed Finn knew about accusations . against the priest and the judge agreed. Finn argued he should not face charges because he was not the diocese's . mandated reporter under the law. At the time, the responsibility rested mainly . with Murphy. Before his sentencing, Finn issued an apology. ‘The protection of children is paramount. Sexual abuse of any kind will not be tolerated,’ he said. ‘I truly regret and . am sorry for the hurt that these events have caused.’ Off the hook: Prosecutors said they are willing to drop charges against the diocese after the Finn verdict . The Survivors Network of Those Abused by . Priests (SNAP) said that they applaud the guilty verdict, but wish that victims . had the opportunity to speak out in court, and had asked prosecutors to not be . sentenced right away, according to Fox Kansas City. ‘It’s huge that there finally has been a ruling in an American court that a . bishop has concealed and ignored and enabled child sex crimes,’ said David . Clohessy of SNAP. ‘We certainly think it would have been more just and more . healing if the victims of Father Ratigan’s crimes and Bishop Finn’s crimes had . a opportunity to address the court.’ The Kansas City case is among a series of prosecutions and investigations of . Catholic leaders around the country in the wake of the child sexual abuse . scandal that has roiled the church. In July, Monsignor William Lynn was . sentenced to up to six years in prison for covering up child sex abuse by . priests in Philadelphia.","Bishop Robert Finn, 59, found guilty of one misdemeanor count of failing to report child abuse .

Businessman: Super successful Chad Pike has spent huge sums on the village in an attempt to turn it into a tourist destination for wealthy Americans but locals have started a rebellion . Walking around Edington, it isn’t hard to see why the fabulously wealthy American property expert Chad Pike chose it as the place to buy a rural weekend retreat. The Wiltshire beauty spot — population 750, home to a pub and a 14th-century church built by the then Bishop of Winchester William Edington, and with spectacular views over Salisbury Plain — is a perfect example of a sedate English village. It is gloriously pretty, the lanes hemmed with pink and white wildflowers. And it hosts all manner of community events, including next month’s harvest supper. Best of all, it boasts some of the smiliest, most welcoming people you could ever meet. ‘We all say hello to one another around here,’ beams Linda Stone, 61, a retired lumberjack who has lived in Edington all her life. ‘There is a real sense of community. It’s friendly and peaceful.’ Until now, that is. Thanks to a flurry of digging and drilling, Edington is not feeling very peaceful or friendly at all. From the graveyard of Edington Priory Church, the constant hum of machinery hangs in the air. The source is Pike’s £3.5 million Grade I-listed mansion next door. After a series of bizarre local developments pioneered by the 41-year-old property tycoon, villagers are now fearing for the future of their idyll — and threatening Pike with an Asbo if the noise doesn’t stop. The saga began three years ago when Pike, who has a glamorous blonde wife, Blake, and four children, bought the house from retired businessman Rupert Cooper, who’d been there for 32 years. Christopher Parsons, 78, a retired . pilot whose home is next to Pike’s back garden, says: ‘Rupert did . everything you’d expect from a village squire. He went to parties, took . part in local activities. He was part of the community.’ The villagers were initially . intrigued by their new neighbour, and hoped he’d pick up where Rupert . left off. All they knew was that Pike was the European vice-president of . Blackstone, which handles some of the world’s largest property deals, . including Southern Cross care homes and Center Parcs holiday villages. Troubled waters: A drained lake which Pike left standing empty after an infestation of fish lice and Pike's house behind the church . Generous: He is believed to have donated thousands towards a new organ for Edington church . Welcome to Edington: Christopher Parsons has lived in the village for three decades . Christopher says: ‘There was a feeling of goodwill — I had Mr Pike round for drinks one evening. He seemed very civilised.’ Pike won over villagers by donating . £60,000 to the church organ fund. Then 18 months ago he stepped in to . buy the village pub, The Lamb. Most locals were delighted. They’d . discussed buying it themselves but were happy to make way for an . experienced developer, who renamed it the Three Daggers and added a . dining room and play area. ‘We couldn’t have done what he did,’ says Phil Davis, 56, a retired businessmen whose back garden overlooks . Pike’s property. ‘It’s gone from traditional boozer to gastro-pub, but . that’s not necessarily a bad thing.’ And at first, the hammering and . digging noises coming from Pike’s house didn’t raise concern. Adrian . Windo, 54, a computer consultant, says: ‘He was making modifications but . everyone’s allowed that, aren’t they? We believed it was in good . faith.’ Edington resident Christopher Parsons stands in front of the large hedgerow which backs onto his house and was planted by neighbour Chad Pike . It was only when some inquisitive . villagers looked on the internet to learn more about their new . neighbour, that the tide started to turn. Says Adrian: ‘We learnt that . he is partnered with a holiday company called Eleven Experience, and he . seemed to see the village as a tourist destination.’ The business, geared towards wealthy . Americans, offers ‘unique vacation experiences for those who prefer a . little adventure with their luxury’. It advertises beach holidays in the . Bahamas, skiing trips to Colorado and luxury chalets in the French . Alps. Now activity holidays in Wiltshire have joined the list. One . company video promises visitors the chance to hunt, shoot, fish and . horse-ride in Edington. A smart, young couple are seen zooming through . woodland in a giant Land-Rover and speeding off on motorbikes. Linda squeals: ‘Can you imagine? We . get plenty of walkers at the weekend, and they are welcome. They come . for the peace and quiet and they don’t cause a fuss. But now it is going . to be a load of Americans, horse-riding and driving all over the . place.’ The renovations of Pike’s properties . were soon seen as something more than modifications for him and his . family. The first problem for villagers was his lake — thought to be a . medieval carp lake fished in by Augustine monks at the Priory. Pike had . to drain it following an infestation of fish lice, and now it stands . empty — an ugly patch of grey . It is to be refilled and restocked so . visitors staying in two cottages on Pike’s land can fish. The site also . boasts a tennis court, swimming pool and brand new stable. ‘And he’s . moving in housekeeping staff,’ says Linda. ‘I mean, really!’ The Three Daggers — described on . Eleven Experience’s website as the perfect place for ‘a proper Sunday . brunch’ — is also viewed with new suspicion. Linda says: ‘He’s turned it . into a place for yuppies.’ Revamp: He has bought The Lamb pub in the village and turned it into The Three Daggers but locals don't seem to like that either . Idyllic: Edington, Wiltshire lies to the south east of Bath in England . In most villages, disputes are . usually settled over a chat over a garden wall. But the villagers . haven’t had much luck in contacting Mr Pike. Adrian says: ‘He doesn’t . really live here, he lives in London. What he’s doing is a commercial . development by stealth.' Pike’s workers are ever-present. Mr . Parsons recalls how three months ago he woke to find his garden hemmed . in by a hedge of 3m-high yew trees. ‘There was no warning,’ he says. It casts a shadow over his garden and . runs along past the house where Linda lives with her partner Andrew . Siejoke. Then the yews turn to beech at Phil’s. ‘But this is where he made his . mistake,’ says Mr Parsons. ‘Beeches are deciduous. Yews are evergreen, . and it is illegal to have an evergreen hedge that’s more than 2m-tall. It violates part eight of the Anti-Social Behaviour Act.’ Christopher has now become the . ring-leader of a local rebellion. ‘I told Mr Pike I was going to apply . for an Anti-Social Behaviour Order. He said: “If you threaten me with an . Asbo you will be the laughing stock of the village.” ’ One neighbour said they moved to the village for peace and quiet but claims that he has been disturbed by 'constant' noise from building work at Pike's home . Undettered, Christopher has written to the council. But in the meantime, another of Pike’s developments is causing bad feeling. Next door to his pub, he is building . the village’s only shop, selling fruit and vegetables grown in his . garden and other local products. Currently it is little more than a . frame surrounded by huge cranes but villagers are scathing of the . ‘gourmet boutique’. Mr Parsons says: ‘People around here don’t buy that . sort of food. He is trying to run Harrods in Edington.’ Mr Pike has also attracted ridicule . for installing a space-age security system around his property. To get . to the house, you must first press a buzzer on a keypad. Two security . cameras then whirr into action and a robotic U.S. voice says: ‘Please . wait while your call is connected.’ The ‘call’ is answered by a member . of staff. It’s not the sort of welcome Edingtonians are used to. Locals fear Parsons will turn the village into a 'theme park' as he has bought several homes there and advertised it as a holiday destination on a website with pictures of various local activities . Linda is also unhappy about a . footpath she uses to walk her Jack Russell, Holly. It crosses Mr Pike’s . land, where she says a new sign has been erected ordering dog-walkers to . put their animal on a leash. ‘It’s made Holly depressed,’ she says. Understandably, the furore is said to . have upset the Pikes. Their investment manager Giles Graves says: . ‘They’re devastated. They’re investing because they want to use the . house. As far as they’re concerned, they had gone through the proper . channels. ‘They are providing jobs to local traders and businesses.’ Mr Pike has spent much of the summer abroad, and has refrained from commenting on the unrest. No doubt he has the best of . intentions in his development of Edington — but if he is planning to . open up the village to the world, his guests might be a little . disappointed. Because Pike’s neighbours show no sign of backing down or . of extending their usually warm welcome to any of his visitors. Which would be a terrible shame, . because as Linda puts it: ‘Without experiencing the people, they won’t . really be experiencing Edington at all.’","Property expert Chad Pike bought £3.5m Grade I-listed mansion in Wiltshire three years ago .

The economic crisis is leaving the most vulnerable population in New York City on the streets. New data shows that last week alone, over 19,000 children sought refuge in homeless shelters across the Big Apple, the most since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Nationally, there are 1.6 million children that are homeless in the U.S., though accurate data for those living on the streets is hard to come by. Help: Over 19,000 children were housed in homeless shelters in New York City, the most since the depression of the 1930s. This family (pictured in 2002) is among the thousands trying to stay off the streets . A total of 19,077 children were being housed in the city's homeless shelters in addition to 26,097 adults - for a total of 45,174 total individuals, according to a report from the New York City Department of Homeless Services published on September 6. 'Since just May, more than 2,000 children have become homeless,' Ralph da Costa Nunez, CEO of the Institute for Children, Poverty, and Homelessness, told the Daily News about the 18 per cent increase compared to this time last year. 'If the trend continues, we will surely see more than 20,000 children living in shelters by Christmas - a gift that nobody wants,' he added. One 14-year-old who is homeless, told the Daily News that her mother's poor health has kept their family from securing the money they need for housing. 'It's really hard on my sisters; they're young, they have no childhood, they don’t sleep well. It’s not fair to them,' Francheska Luciano said about her three younger siblings Shanely, 7, Yadeiliz, 4, and Mileishka, 2. The Lucianos, who came from Puerto Rico in 2006, have been shuffled around from shelters in the city. 'The area where we are staying now is really bad. I can't go outside because it’s so dangerous,' she said. Growing and growing: The number of homeless children continues to rise steadily in New York. This family (pictured in December 2011) makes their way to a homeless shelter . Though this week, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg stated that life in the city is better than it was four years ago, the number of homeless in New York City has steadily grown amidst the floundering U.S. economy. Better? Mayor Michael Bloomberg (pictured in August) has said the city is better off than it was four years ago . Figures show that in August 2012, 44,328 New Yorkers were homeless, compared to 32,674 in August 2008. 'It's clear that many more New Yorkers and many more children and families are experiencing homelessness,' Patrick Markee, of the Coalition for the Homeless, told The Wall Street Journal. The economic crisis has been severe for the city, with federal data also showing that one in four New York children live in food insecure households. Food insecurity means a family lacks access to enough food, with parents having to trade-off paying for basic needs like rent or medical bills, instead of purchasing an adequate level of food for a household. 'It is clear that food insecurity is an unfortunate reality among children, senior citizens and adults in all five boroughs,' Joel Berg, the executive director of the . New York City Coalition Against Hunger, said. 'It is also clear that it is a very solvable problem,' he added, in advocating for increased access to food stamps for New York residents.","18 per cent YOY increase in children housed in homeless shelters .

Zainab is still under sedation but when she wakes, her younger sister Zeena, four, will not be there to see her because she returned to Britain yesterday in the care of two relatives.

Recovery: Zainab Al-Hilli, 7, whose parents and grandmother were murdered in their car during last Wednesday’s bloodbath in the mountains, has been brought out of her coma . Peace shattered: The scene of the shooting near Annecy in south-eastern France on Sunday. Detectives are now hunting for clues both at the secluded crime scene and in the UK . Prosecutors confirmed that Zainab, who was shot in the shoulder and savagely beaten around the head, has been brought out of her medically induced coma but it could be a ‘long time’ until she is ready to be spoken to by police. She remains the key witness to the carnage in which her father Saad Al-Hilli, 50, her mother Ikbal, 47, a dentist, and her grandmother Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, were killed at a remote beauty spot near Lake Annecy. Each was shot twice in the head in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire thought to have lasted around 30 seconds. Last night Zainab was under police guard in Grenoble Hospital, separated from Zeena, the one person she now knows, trusts and loves best in the world. Zeena was reunited with an aunt and uncle, believed to be from her mother’s side of the family, on Saturday at a secret location in the presence of an investigator.

Victim: A newly released picture of Saad Al-Hilli who was gunned down in the French Alps . Zeena’s poignant return came as it was . revealed that she escaped  uninjured after hiding behind her mother’s . skirt in the family’s BMW, where she was found by police eight hours . after they were called to the massacre scene. She has spoken to two women gendarmes, . both trained psychologists specialising in work with children, in a . room furnished in bright colours and small chairs and tables to make her . feel as comfortable as possible. Because of where she was hiding, she . did not see anything important and police say she has given them all the . information she is capable of. A police source said: ‘Officers only intended to speak to Zeena once about what she witnessed. They do not want her to go through the ordeal of having to relive the trauma of seeing her mother and father being killed again. She returned to London to be with other members of her family who will best be able to care for her needs. ‘It was felt that taking her back to more familiar surroundings is the best way forward for her to recover after probably being psychologically scarred by the terrible experience.’ The same two women officers, who work with a translator, are waiting to be given the go-ahead from medics to interview Zainab in the same way. Mr Maillaud said: ‘Zeena is still a very young girl, speaking in a childlike way. Zainab might have a lot more information. We hope she can tell us what she saw, give descriptions, the number of people, men or women, skin colours, clothing. Anything that may allow some identification. ‘We simply do not know until she awakes. But that is a medical decision which has to take priority over our investigation. It is up to the doctors, and it could be a long time before she is ready.’ Cross-Channel operation: A police officer stands guard outside the property in Claygate, Surrey as British police and French detectives search inside .

Abandoned: The girl had been locked in the flat with a plate of crisps and the TV on (picture unrelated) A mother who left her baby daughter unsupervised with nothing but a plate of crisps to feed herself, has walked free from court after a judge declared the child 'well fed'. The 20-month-old toddler had been left locked in a flat all day with crisps and a bottle of juice, while the mother went to work. The woman admitted child cruelty, but received a suspended sentence after the judge said the baby was ‘well fed’. The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told Wolverhampton Crown Court today that she had left the baby alone ‘on many occasions’ when she went to work. The child was found after a bailiff, who was attending a neighbouring home, heard crying from the flat and called the police. Prosecutor Alka Brigue told the court the child was able to roam around the flat, although the kitchen and toilet doors were closed for safety, and the TV had been left on. The woman, from Sandwell, West Midlands, was told by the judge that her reason for leaving her 'vulnerable' child unsupervised was no mitigation for serious misconduct. However, due to the fact that the flat was clean and the baby had food, the mother was not imprisoned. Judge Helen Hughes said: ‘You deliberately left your baby at home on her own. ‘You did it on many occasions and I do not accept you made proper arrangements for her care.' Freed: The woman was given a six-month suspended prison sentence at Wolverhampton Crown Court and the child was taken into care . She added: ‘But I do accept the child was well fed, the flat was clean and she had food and drink. ‘She was only 20 months old, and she was vulnerable.’ Kate Thomas, defending, emphasised that the mother had not left the child to go partying or drinking and maintained she had on many other occasions employed people to look after the toddler. The mother was given a six-month prison sentence suspended for 18 months and was placed under supervision for a year. The child has been taken into care by social services.","20-month-old girl locked in flat in Sandwell, West Midlands, while mother went to work .

Denial: Boris Johnson says he is definitely not going to return to Parliament . Boris Johnson today attempted to play down rumours sweeping through Westminster that he will take a safe Commons seat and mount an immediate leadership challenge if David Cameron fails to secure an overall majority at the next election. The Mayor of London dismissed the plot as 'complete cloud cuckoo land' but did not rule out a return to Parliament when he leaves City Hall in 2016. Mr Johnson was forced to respond today after Tory Zac Goldsmith offered his west London seat to him if the Government forces through plans for a third runway at Heathrow. He said he will 'absolutely not' be returning to Parliament while he is Mayor. It has today been confirmed he has met with Zac Goldsmith to discuss the airport issue, but a source said they 'jokingly' discussed the by-election but 'dismissed it out of hand.' 'This is all complete cloud cuckoo land,' the Mayor told London's LBC radio. 'Of course I’ve had conversations with Zac and with other MPs in London and elsewhere about how to solve the aviation problem. I’m absolutely not going to be returning to Parliament, I’ve got to do a job here in London and that’s what I want to do and it’s a massive, engrossing job.' Later he told the BBC about his plans for post-2016: 'I really think I’ll be over the hill, I’ll be clapped out.' Allies of the London Mayor, whose popularity has been boosted by the success of the Olympics and Paralympics, played down the prospect of him making a Westminster comeback before that. Their comments came despite swirling rumours of plots against the Prime Minister to install Mr Johnson. Scroll down for video . Still friends: The old Etonians looked happy today despite recent rows, as they watched the London 2012 parade together . Boost: The Mayor of London, pictured handing over the Paralympic Flag at the closing ceremony yesterday, has enjoyed a boom in popularity because of London 2012 . One Conservative MP, Colonel Bob Stewart, said two colleagues approached him before the summer break to consider a ‘stalking horse’ challenge for the party leadership that might open the door for Mr Johnson to take over. But Colonel Stewart told them to ‘get lost’. Running scared? The Prime Minister arrived back at No10 this morning after a jog, after news that Mr Johnson may be poised to challenge him . The Mayor infuriated Number Ten by going to war with Mr Cameron last week, criticising what he called a ‘fudgearama’ over increasing airport capacity. But a spokesman for Mr Johnson dismissed as ‘fanciful’ a claim that multi- millionaire Tory rebel Zac Goldsmith, who has threatened to quit Parliament if the Government goes ahead with a third runway at Heathrow, offered his south-west London seat to the Mayor. However, despite the denials from City Hall, the rumours about Mr Johnson's return to Westminster do not seem to be going away. The two men were said to have discussed . the prospect of a by-election in Mr Goldsmith’s Richmond constituency . following last week’s Cabinet reshuffle, in which Mr Cameron sidelined . ministers who are opposed to Heathrow expansion. Mr Johnson did meet Mr Goldsmith and the . by-election scheme is thought to have been ‘jokingly’ mentioned, but the . Mayor is said to have dismissed it out of hand. Mr Goldsmith wrote yesterday on . Twitter: ‘I have never offered to resign! But I did promise before the . election that I would, if the Government U-turns on Heathrow.’ But MPs who want to see Mr Johnson in . Downing Street confirmed privately that advanced discussions had taken . place on finding him a seat for the 2015 election. Mr Goldsmith’s seat is not considered . safe enough because it is a marginal. Two that have been discussed by Mr . Johnson’s supporters are Mole Valley, where veteran MP Sir Paul . Beresford might be persuaded to step down, and Henley, the Mayor’s old . Commons seat. Mr Johnson has always insisted he has . no intention of trying to oust Mr Cameron and has pledged to see out his . second term as Mayor. But while he would be heavily . criticised if he tried to combine the role of mayor and MP for an . extended period, he is due to leave office in London in 2016. That would mean the two jobs would . only overlap for a year if he made a comeback at the next general . election. One rebel MP said: ‘The aim is that Boris is in place at the . next election. If Cameron loses the election badly, he’ll resign and . Boris will stand, but if he misses a majority again and tries to stitch . up another coalition with the Lib Dems then there will be blood on the . walls. We won’t let him do it again.’ Another rebel Tory, Nadine Dorries, said: ‘We need to get Boris in and Cameron out to survive 2015.’ But Mr Johnson said he was ‘absolutely . not’ planning a return to the Commons. ‘As I said in the election about . a billion times, being Mayor is the best job in British politics and . it’s what I want to do,’ he said. After his election defeat in May, Ken Livingstone was tipped to disappear from the political world once and for all. But today he reappeared and managed to have a dig at his old foe Boris Johnson over London 2012, accusing him of having 'milked it for everything he can get out of it.' Wearing the same jacket he wore when London won the Games in 2005 when he was mayor, Mr Livingstone denied he was jealous of Mr Johnson's soaring popularity because of the Olympics. It came the night after the pair met by coincidence at the Paralympics closing ceremony, where they had a quick bicker and then Boris playfully rubbed the top of his head much to the delight of Labour leader Ed Miliband who was watching on. Speaking as Britain's sportsmen and women marched through the streets of London today, Red Ken took the chance to lay into Mr Johnson and also dismissed his chances of taking over at No.10. '[Boris Johnson] has milked it for everything he can get out of it. I . look at what we’ve achieved and the difference it’s made in the East . End. All I say to Boris is, you’ve had your fun now what are you going . to build that the next Mayor will open 10 or 12 years down the road?' 'I simply say, when I chat to Boris, don’t worry about being Prime . Minister, you can do things as big as this that will put London on the . international map again solidly in 2020.' He also dismissed Boris's plans for a Boris Island airport in the Thames estuary, saying 'it is never going to happen'.

The North London home where Pink Floyd was formed has come up for sale for the first time since the band's members lodged there in the Sixties. The three-storey house in Stanhope Gardens, Highgate, which is in need of some repair, will go under the hammer on September 20 with an estimate of £1.2million. It has barely been altered since Syd Barrett, Roger Waters and Nick Mason lived there as they developed the ground-breaking psychedelic sound that propelled them to rock megastardom. For sale: The north London home where Syd Barrett, Roger Waters and Nick Mason formed Pink Floyd is on the market for the first time since they lodged there in the Sixties . The Victorian home was owned by Mike Leonard, their influential former college tutor and landlord, until his death this year. Rock pundits say the house played a crucial role in the formation of the group that went on to record the epoch-defining concept albums Dark Side Of The Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Wall. Mark Blake, author of Pigs Might Fly: The Inside Story Of Pink Floyd, said: 'It was a very good environment for young student musicians to be living. 'It gave somewhere for them to live and somewhere to rehearse with a sympathetic landlord who did not mind about them making a noise. This is where Pink Floyd started to come together.' Mason, who became the group’s drummer, and bass guitar player Waters are believed to have moved into the downstairs self-contained flat in September 1963, while early lead singer Barrett arrived about a year later. Huge stars: Founded in 1965 the band went on the become one of the world's most popular rock groups . Barrett was put in charge of catering  — with a budget of 20p a day. Keyboard player Richard Wright also lodged at the house. The dusty interiors still retain much evidence of the avant-garde musical influences that Mr Leonard — a lecturer at Hornsey College of Art — introduced to the rhythm and blues band then known as The Tea Set. Instruments such as bongo drums, tambourines and a huge homemade xylophone lie scattered around as well as the spotlights, prisms and crystals that were an influence. In the attic there is a rare Binson Echorec 2 echo unit. The Binson was used by Barrett and later by David Gilmore to develop the Floyd sound. Time capsule: The three-storey house has barely been altered since they lived there is worth £1.2m and contains musical instruments used at the time . Mr Leonard’s workshop, where he designed and built the complex 'lysergenic' lighting systems that contributed to Pink Floyd’s image and featured in a Tomorrow’s World BBC broadcast from the house in 1968, has also survived. In a recent interview Mason said that the bonnet of his Aston Martin is buried in the overgrown garden. Chris Coleman Smith, of Savills Auctions, which is handling the sale at the Millennium Hotel in Mayfair, said the sale was a rare opportunity to buy an unmodernised family house in Highgate. 'Who knows, we might get some Pink Floyd fan flying in to buy it,' he added.","The property, in Highgate, north London, is largely unaltered since the rock group lived there .

Covered in desert dust and with a beaming smile for the camera, Raffaele Sollecito looks like a man who has had the weight of the world lifted off his shoulders in pictures taken at the 'Burning Man' festival. The ex-boyfriend of Amanda Knox attended the famous Nevada counter-culture event earlier this month ahead of a tiring schedule of television promotions for his new book which lifts the lid on his doomed relationship with the American student and their acquittal for the murder of Meredith Kercher last year. And despite being a self-confessed smoker of cannabis, Sollecito denied taking part in any nefarious activities while at the Black Rock Desert festival and the pictures suggest the Italian seemed to enjoy the massive week-long open air party. Looking almost unrecognisable, Raffaele Sollecito the ex-boyfriend of Amanda Knox smiles for the camera at the Burning Man festival in Nevada . Posting over 200 pictures of his time at . the 'Burning Man' festival to his Facebook page, Sollecito made sure . his fiends were kept up to date of his partying exploits. 'I'm good safe and reborn and I got no acid and no drugs at all. I repeat: emotions are my drugs,' said Sollecito on his page. 'This is a powerful experience, I will be back again.' Despite blending anonymously into the annual free-spirited event, Sollecito, 28, has now arrived in New York City, where he will be interviewed exclusively by Katie Couric this month to discuss the revelations in 'Honour Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox'. Stopping to have his shoes shined on the streets of Manhattan, Sollecito took a tour around the Big Apple before beginning media training for the promotion of his book which is on general release from September 18th. Raffaele Sollecito was convicted alongside Knox in 2009 of killing Miss Kercher but the pair were freed last October after their convictions . were overturned due to a lack of evidence. Attending the massive 50,000 person open air desert festival, Sollecito looks a different person from the troubled soul who appeared in court last year . The annual counter-culture festival relies on a system of barter-trade and not money to purchase goods and services while at the event . Raffaele Sollecito stands with a man dressed as a leopard with the mountains of the Black Rock Desert behind him . Raffaele Sollecito seemed to really get into the spirit of things at the Burning Man festival . Miss Kercher, a 21-year-old from Leeds University, was found . semi-naked and with her throat cut in a house she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, in November 2007. And in his new book, 'Honour Bound: My Journey to Hell and Back with Amanda Knox', Sollecito talks openly about the early days of his relationship with the American that sparked such fervid speculation over their involvement in the crime. In it, he maintains . the couple's innocence but acknowledges that their sometimes 'bizarre . behaviour' after Miss Kercher's death gave police reason for . suspicion. He describes how their romance . became a nightmare with the horror of Miss Kercher's death, the . misunderstandings that swept them up in the case, and their tabloid . portrayals as two suspects unrecognisable to themselves. Indeed since the pairs acquittal in October of 2011, Sollecito has traveled to Seattle to meet up with his ex-girlfriend and even thought about moving to the city for a job with technology giants Microsoft earlier this year. Despite speculation that the couple would reunite following their almost four-year separation, they both seem to have moved on with different partners. Raffaele Sollecito has now arrived in New York to promote his new book and to appear on Katie Couric's television program . Before the trial: U.S. citizen Amanda Knox, left, and . her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, of Italy, outside the rented . house where 21-year-old British student Meredith Kercher was found dead in 2007 . Knox, 24, is now seeing longtime friend James Terrano, a 25-year-old . musician, while Mr Sollecito was in a relationship with an Italian volleyball . player, Annie Achille, but now lists himself as single. During the investigation and trial into Miss Kercher's death Knox . became 'Foxy Knoxy' and received the brunt of the attention as she . shopped for underwear after the killing and turned cartwheels in front . of investigators. Sollecito recounts in his book how he met Knox at a classical music concert in Perugia before going on to spend the night with her. Within a week, Miss Kercher was murdered and the couple fell instantly under the spotlight of suspicion. In the hours after the gruesome . murder scene was discovered, the duo was notoriously photographed . kissing and cuddling in the street outside while police investigated. Italian authorities . later described Sollecito’s behaviour ass ‘odd’, and acknowledged the two had . no real alibi 'except each other.' Murder charges: Raffaele Sollecito, left, and . Amanda Knox, right, are pictured arriving for a hearing in Perugia's . court, in 2009; in Sollecito's book, he maintains his innocence but says . he and his then-girlfriend behaved oddly . The pair were filmed kissing, cuddling and stroking each other outside as the police were investigating the murder . They eventually told police that they had been smoking marijuana and having sex in Sollecito's apartment before falling asleep. The pair was imprisoned days after . the November 1, 2007 death of Kercher in the central Italian city. Both . would remain there for nearly four years. Brutal murder: Meredith Kercher was killed in her apartment on November 1, 2007 . An . appeals court overturned their conviction and freed them last fall, . issuing a 143-page opinion that blasted the utter lack of evidence . against them. Rudy Guede, a petty criminal who was convicted separately, remains imprisoned and is serving a 16-year-sentence.

A Tesco supermarket has had 500 of its shopping baskets stolen after a 5p charge for plastic carrier bags was introduced last year. The store in Denbighshire, north-east Wales, has just 16 baskets left following the surge in theft. Cash-strapped shoppers, who refuse to pay for plastic bags, are flogging the baskets for £25 each on eBay. The store has been hit hard since Wales became the first place to introduce a 5p charge for all plastic bags in supermarkets last October. Stolen: The Tesco store in Denbighshire, north-east Wales, has been left with just 16 baskets after shoppers have stolen them . The tax on plastic bags has seen the number given away by shops fall by up to 96 per cent, according to figures released in July. The tax's success is a vindication of the Daily Mail's Banish the Bags campaign. Local residents in the town said on Facebook the baskets were stolen because people refused to pay for bags. Lisa Thomas who started a conversation on Facebook, said: 'I went into that big supermarket in Ruthin yesterday and . couldn’t find a basket anywhere, when I asked I was told we only have 12 . left because people are pinching them because they won’t buy a bag. 'Personally I think this is disgraceful, come on people of Ruthin, if you won’t donate 5p for a bag, take your own.' The lack of shopping baskets in the Tesco store has prompted a flood of complaints from shoppers. Tommy Milner from Ruthin, Denbighshire, who is disabled and has difficulty shopping emailed the Tesco Service Team in August to find out why he couldn’t find a basket. 'They did have some but try finding one is near impossible, I have a severe disability and find shopping most difficult at times. This just adds to the stress.' Empty: A rack where there should be an abundance of baskets but the whole store has only 16 left . 'I got a phone call from Tesco customer services saying the Ruthin store has 16 baskets in total left and I am informed that one shopper was followed home. 'I was informed 400 to 500 had been stolen, not damaged, stolen, all within 12 months.' Another Ruthin resident, who didn't want to be named, said: 'When I asked today (September 6) the staff told me that they had been stolen. 'At Christmas there were 500, now there are only 11.” Ruthin county councillor, Huw Hilditch-Roberts said: 'Members of the public have been approaching me about this on a regular basis. It is a major concern.' Another resident on Facebook said he saw one customer place their full basket in the boot of their car and drive away. Tesco shopping baskets are exchanging hands on eBay for around £25 each. A Tesco spokesman admitted that the theft of shopping baskets was a problem and said: 'We are in the process of implementing measures to help stop baskets being taken from the store in future.' North Wales Police said they had not received any reports of shopping baskets ‘going missing’ from Tesco.",Shoppers flogging baskets on eBay for £25 each .

A newborn baby died from a severe brain injury after her breathing tube was dislodged in a hospital neo-natal unit, an inquest heard. There was a significant delay before staff realised the tube was displaced by which time tiny Summer Hawcroft, who only weighed two pounds and two ounces at birth, had been starved of oxygen. She suffered respiratory problems and was transferred from Barnsley District Hospital to a specialist unit in Sheffield but later died when she was just 49 days old. Tiny Summer Hawcroft died from a severe brain injury after she was born prematurely and needed the help of a ventilator . Pathologist Dr Mudher Al-Adnani told the hearing that Summer died from a hypoxic brain injury which appeared to have developed after the endotracheal tube attached to the ventilator becoming dislodged. The Sheffield inquest heard Summer was born prematurely by caesarean section after 27 weeks gestation on April 23 last year and was the seventh child of builder Stephen Hawcroft, 37, and his wife Michaela, 26, of Kendray, Barnsley. Paediatric registrar Dr Ash Kale said the infant needed resuscitation and was given inflation breaths before being incubated and then placed on a ventilator. He failed three times to insert a 2.5 . millimetre tube down Summer’s trachea to help with her breathing and had . to use a smaller 2mm tube. An . independent expert who investigated the case said he found it . 'puzzling' why staff were unable to use the larger tube which opens up . the airways more. Summer Hawcroft had difficulties because of the immaturity of her lungs and kidneys . Summer Hawcroft's parents were at the inquest to hear about the death of their baby girl . Dr Kale said as the baby was put on the ventilator he got a 'crash call' to help with another sick baby in the unit but claimed it did not affect his management of Summer. Despite her arterial blood-gas levels dipping overnight he saw an improvement and had no concern over the baby’s neurological condition. 'She had difficulties because of the immaturity of the lungs and kidneys but was making progress and going in the right direction,' he said. The doctor told Laurinda Bower, who represented Summer’s parents , that he had no specific training in incubation procedures but the standard respiratory rate had been set for Summer. That had to be reduced when the baby began over-ventilating. He conceded that incorrect settings on ventilators were a common cause of complications with babies and over-ventilation or under-ventilation could lead to brain damage. The doctor also defended only checking the baby’s blood-gas levels every three or four hours and said more frequent checks could have adverse effects such as causing anaemia. Dr Kale said he did not believe Summer merited a transfer to more specialist unit by April 25 and replacing her breathing tube would have subjected the baby to unnecessary trauma and 'caused more harm than good.' But a week later the baby’s condition had deteriorated and and in the early hours of May 4 the breathing tube became displaced and Summer was starved of oxygen. Dr Al-Adnani said his post-mortem after Summer died in her mother’s arms on June 11 showed a long-standing hypoxic brain injury but there were a number of possible causes. He said it could be not enough blood to get oxygen to the brain, low blood pressure or anaemia, something affecting the blood vessels leading to the brain or 'it could be a combination of several factors rather than single event.' Summer was transferred from Barnsley District General Hospital (pictured) to a specialist unit . The pathologist said the aftermath of the brain damage was 'quite extensive and widespread' and it was consistent with the events of May 4. After the bab7 deteriorated she suffered a cardiac arrest and required resuscitation and apparently afterwards suffered brain damage although no specific cause could be identified. Dr Al-Adnani added that the brain injury was so severe it was 'unrecoverable.' If it had happened before May 4 it should have been picked up by two cranal ultrasound scans which were carried out in the previous week. Summer’s parents had difficulty identifying her when they travelled to the Jessop Wing of Sheffield’s Royal Hallmashire Hospital where she was taken. She showed no signs of improvement and the Hawcrofts had to agree to palliative care until she died. The hearing continues.","Summer Hawcroft died from a hypoxic brain injury which appeared to develop after breathing tube attached to the ventilator became dislodged .

Freedoms gained during the Arab Spring uprisings are being whittled away and fledgling democracies are now under threat, claims a U.S. watchdog. The Crossroads Report published by Freedom House today, concludes that levels of democratic governance declined throughout the world last year. It found that gains made in the Middle East and North Africa after the uprising in Libya triggered a wave of protests across the region have notably declined. Improvements made after Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, pictured here following his capture, was ousted have not lasted according to a new report . Only Tunisia has shown an improvement in its overall governance score amongst the Middle East-North African countries surveyed. Bahrain, one of the most stable states in the region, slipped backward, while Egypt  showed only a minor improvement. Worldwide, declines in the quality of governance far exceeded improvements. The organisation judged levels of democracies by looking at government accountability and the rule of law in civil and criminal matters. The deterioration raises an alarm for pro-democracy advocates who had hoped the overthrow of brutal authoritarian regimes in Tunisia, Libya and Egypt would lead to lasting democracy. Vanessa Tucker, project director, said: 'It is unclear whether the popular dismissal of the old models of authoritarianism will translate into enduring public support for novice representative government and contentious institutional reforms.' Tunisia has improved its democratic governance since President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was overthrown . 'There are limits to citizens' patience with respect to political instability, economic disruption and physical insecurity, and the desire to return to a less chaotic environment may allow the leaders to slip back into the familiar habits of authoritarian rule.' Democratic states place significant value on the findings of the report, using the results to help them decide if a developing can country would use foreign assistance effectively. The report covers the period from April 2009 to December 2011. Four criteria were used to assess 72 countries in the survey - accountability and public voice; civil liberties; rule of law; and anti-corruption and transparency. Figures for half of the countries were updated each year, while Egypt and Tunisia were surveyed for the past two years. Freedom House says a country score of five out of a total of seven is the minimum standard for effective democratic governance, which it views as essential to an open, just and prosperous society. In the latest report, Tunisia improved in all categories led by a sharp rise in accountability and public voice, pushing its overall country ranking to 4.11 from around 2.36 before the ouster of President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. One area of concern the report highlighted was women's rights in Tunisia where it said Islamist political parties have stoked fears that existing rights would be retracted. Dictator Colonel Gadaffi who was overthrown on August 23 last year. There are concerns that countries such as Libya may return to authoritarian rule . While it uses monitors and experts on the ground and an advisory board, such rankings can be controversial accused of imposing subjective and Western viewpoints. Levels of accountability and public voice rose in Egypt after President Hosni Mubarak was ousted, but other areas did not show improvements leading to only a small rise in the country's score to 2.25 from 1.98. That despite open elections. Restrictions on the media, hostility to non-governmental organizations and efforts to restrain women's political activity through 'virginity checks' by the military were cited as areas of concern. Bahrain, saw its measures decline across the board pulling its country average down to 2.03, the level of pre-uprising Syria, from a recent peak of 3.27 in 2004. Egyptians celebrate after President Mubarak was ousted in June this year, but the claims that freedoms gained in Arab Spring countries are being lost . Elsewhere, in South America increases in violence and organised crime reduced scores in the countries surveyed. The trend included high rates of violence against journalists in Mexico and Honduras, and growing interference by organized crime in the electoral process in Guatemala and Mexico. Asia suffered major setbacks in the face of power grabs by the executive branch and ruling parties, particularly in Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Freedom of expression was also constricted as the Indonesian and Cambodian governments and others cracked down on the media. South Africa, suffered score declines from the increasing dominance of the ruling African National Congress and the government's efforts to limit media freedom. Electoral abuses in Malawi and Uganda, in addition to growing corruption in Tanzania, were also responsible for significant score drops in African countries assessed in the latest report.","Report says freedoms gained during Arab Spring risings are diminishing .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 03:22 EST, 19 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:23 EST, 19 September 2012 . One of the biggest Colombian drug lords was captured Tuesday night after building his trafficking empire for nearly two decades. Daniel Barrera Barrera, who is known as 'El Loco' or 'the Madman', was arrested in neighboring Venezuela, topping off a year of significant blows to the region's drug trade. It was the third arrest of a major Colombian drug boss in the last year. President Juan Manuel Santos said Barrera was arrested in the Venezuelan city of San Cristobal after months of multi-national cooperation that included help from the United States and other nations. Captured: Daniel 'el Loco' Barrera was caught in neighboring Venezuela but is expected to be extradited to Colombia in the coming days given that his massive drug trade is based in the country . 'The last of the great capos has fallen,' Mr Santos said, using the common term for drug lords. 'This is perhaps the most important arrest' in recent times, he said. General Jose Roberto Leon, director of the National Police, said in a telephone interview later that the 50-year-old Barrera did not resist when he was caught alone on a road in San Cristobal, which is near the Colombia-Venezuela border. General Leon said he expected Venezuela to deport Barrera, but did not know when. The New York Times reports that in addition to the Venezuelan drug police, the CIA and British intelligence officers aided the operation. While regional authorities obviously played a significant role in the takedown, the true extent of international help is slowly being revealed as the head of the Colombian national police, Major General Jose Roberto Leon Riano was in Washington at the time of the arrest in order to better facilitate communication with the Americans. Barrera was one of Colombia's most wanted fugitives. Early last year, authorities announced a $2.7million reward for information leading to his capture, but Colombian officials did not say whether any tips from informants led to the arrest. Proud of the capture: President Juan Manuel Santos (right) announced 'The last of the great capos has fallen' U.S. and Colombian officials have alleged that Barrera's gang supplies cocaine to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, which ships the drug to the United States. Barrera's arrest was the third involving alleged Colombian drug kingpins over the past 12 months. On June 3, Venezuelan authorities arrested Diego Perez Henao, 41, who had a five million US dollar reward on his head for allegedly trafficking cocaine to the United States. He was sent to Colombia a few weeks later. Last November, Maximilian Bonilla Orozco, 39, another alleged drug boss with a five million US dollar reward offered for him by the US, was caught in Venezuela. He was extradited directly to the United States in December. While his capture is clearly a milestone in his personal criminal history, it is far from his first run-in with the law. Previous find: In October 2010, Colombian police discovered $29million and 17million euros that belonged to Barrera in what was- at the time- the 'biggest seizure of drug money in this country's history' Barrera was first imprisoned in February 1990 on drug charges but he managed to escape from the Colombian prison in October of that same year. More recently, in October 2010, Colombian police discovered $29million and 17million euros that belonged to Barrera in what was- at the time- the 'biggest seizure of drug money in this country's history'. Along with taking down one of the country's top drug kingpins, Tuesday's  arrest will greatly hinder Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (commonly known as FARC). Barrera was closely associated with the group. Barrera is seen as the closest equivalent to a modern-day Pablo Escobar, with comparisons between the two drug lords being made frequently as they both developed ways to use bribery as a way to insure that they remained well-liked by prominent political figures from all sides of the spectrum. Since Escobar was killed in 1993, the widespread nature of Barrera’s trafficking lent him the title as the most notorious Colombian drug dealer.","Daniel Barrera Barrera has been major drug trafficker for over 20 years .

Students at certain American colleges are facing the beginning of a school year without initiation ceremonies at fraternities and sororities as administrators hope to dramatically cut down the amount of hazing on campus. Gone are the traditional fraternity open houses and introductory bashes at sorority houses as officials at New York's Binghamton University banned recruiting a new class of student pledges. The strong decision for a ban comes after multiple reports surfaced last year of violent hazing on their campus, prompting fears that those stories of students being forced to hold hot coals and running over beds of rocks could turn fatal like some more extreme cases at other universities. Quiet campus: New York's Binghamton University banned recruiting a new class of student pledges after a wake of complaints about hazing abuses . Hazing is not new among young college students but the well-publicized cases at Dartmouth University- where students were forced to eat vomit omelets - and Florida's A&M University - where a student on the drum band was beaten to death on a school bus - that left Binghamton administrators fearing the worst. Though there were no confirmed deaths or hospitalizations due to the hazing on Binghamton's campus, students sent cries for help to the school's officials hinting that they weren't far off. The New York Times reports that one anonymous email sent from a student to administrators told of the undisclosed lengths that his possible fraternity brothers would go to make sure he fit in. 'I was hosed, waterboarded, force-fed disgusting mixtures of food, went through physical exercises until I passed out, and crawled around outside in my boxers to the point where my stomach, elbows, thighs and knees are filled with cuts, scrapes and bruises,' the student wrote in the email. A junior female student wrote about what two of her younger friends were being put through, telling of how sorority pledges had to stand in a freezing cold shower while reciting the Greek alphabet. Others had to eat unidentified mixtures of food that were cooked up solely to make the diner throw up. At the end of the email, she wrote a plea for top-down action: 'Save the innocent and naïve who can’t seem to save themselves'. Binghamton, one of the state's best public schools located more than three-hour's drive from New York City, did just that. The abuses: Though no students came forward publicly, several complained of being 'waterboarded, force-fed disgusting mixtures of food, and made to pass out from over-exercise' According to the school's student newspaper Pipe Dreams, administrators cited an 'alarmingly high number of serious hazing complaints this spring' and 'the serious physical and psychological health risk to all involved.' as the reasons behind the decision. That said, only three of the 53 sanctioned fraternities and sororities were temporarily banned from recruiting new pledges. One of the biggest problems facing any institutional change is the fact that no students are willing to publicly come forward and complain about the happenings. In the case of Dartmouth, a former fraternity brother named Andrew Lohse wrote an editorial describing in horrific detail the ways in which pledges were treated. As a result, 27 other fraternity brothers faced charges but were eventually cleared. Previous problems: The Binghamton complaints came around the same time as well-publicized cases at Dartmouth University (pictured)- where students were forced to eat vomit omelets . While the parents of children who lived through the extreme pledging process and the students themselves may be appreciative of the drastic action, it seems that others on campus feel the decision takes away one of the touchstones of 'traditional' college life. At Binghamton, one of the biggest alleged offenders was Alpha Pi Epslion, an off-campus fraternity which is therefore only answerable to local police and not the university. The Times tells the story of how police sergeant Michael Senio went to the house to respond to anonymous complaints about hazing abuses taking place but because there was no named victim, he had no legal authority to go inside. 'I can only speculate what was going on, but we could see the basement, which was like a disgusting-looking dark dungeon with hoses and standing water on the ground,' he said.","Binghamton University in New York banned frats and sororities from getting new pledges after rash of hazing allegations last year .

Entitled: Simon Harwood (right), pictured leaving the hearing with his wife Helen, will keep his police pension despite being sacked for gross misconduct . Scotland Yard was accused of a ‘whitewash’ yesterday after the officer who attacked Ian Tomlinson was finally sacked. Simon Harwood, 45, struck the innocent bystander during the G20 protests three years ago. The newspaper seller, who staggered away before collapsing, died of massive internal bleeding. An internal disciplinary panel yesterday dismissed Harwood, who admitted gross misconduct. The panel said his actions ‘discredited the police service and undermined public confidence in it’. However, it agreed to drop the key claim that his actions directly contributed to Mr Tomlinson’s death. Although he has lost his job, Harwood - who had been suspended on full pay since 2009 - was acquitted of Mr Tomlinson’s manslaughter in July. As he has not been convicted of a crime, he will still be able to collect his full police pension, estimated to be up to £15,000 a year. Mr Tomlinson’s stepson Paul King dismissed the disciplinary hearing – the first the Met has held in public – as a ‘whitewash’. Flanked by his brother and Mr Tomlinson’s widow Julia, he said: ‘I think it’s pointless, it hasn’t proved anything to us. ‘We still haven’t got any answer from this. After three-and-a-half years I think it’s diabolical. It’s like we’re back at day one.’ The Tomlinson family has already launched a civil suit at the High Court and has been offered damages by the Met. Their solicitor said all they want is an apology. Scroll down for videos . Disciplinary action: Pc Simon Harwood (left) has already been cleared of Ian Tomlinson's (right) manslaughter .

The father of nine, who had a history . of alcoholism, died from   internal bleeding after collapsing on the . pavement minutes later. Last May, an inquest jury ruled that . Mr Tomlinson was unlawfully killed. Harwood, who had intitially been . told he would not face trial, was then charged with manslaughter. Details of Harwood’s disciplinary . record, including how he ducked ten complaints by switching forces, were . kept from both juries because they were seen as ‘prejudicial’.

'Unlawfully killed': Mr Tomlinson sits on the pavement after being shoved over by Pc Harwood during the G20 protests in 2009. Mr Tomlinson later died from internal bleeding . The allegations included a road-rage . attack, racially abusing and punching a 14-year-old girl and a series of . heavy-handed arrests. The officer, who lives in Carshalton, . Surrey, with his wife Helen and two sons, ‘retired’ from the Met on . medical grounds on the eve of a disciplinary hearing, only to rejoin . within days. Sacked: Harwood (right), pictured on his way into the disciplinary hearing, was found to have committed gross misconduct . After transferring to Surrey, he returned to the Met in 2005. Commander Julian Bennett, who led the . misconduct hearing, said: ‘[Harwood] has accepted it will be impossible . for him to ever again serve as a police officer. 'We agree, as we consider it inconceivable that he could ever hold a role within the police service again.’ Immediate dismissal was the toughest sanction available to the hearing, held amid tight security in West London. Harwood’s barrister Patrick Gibbs QC . dismissed the proceedings as a ‘show trial’ and said his client had . offered to resign twice. He labelled the direct allegation that . Harwood caused Tomlinson’s death as ‘gratuitous and provocative’, and . successfully asked the panel to drop it. But Jules Carey, who represents the . Tomlinson family, said they had been ‘cheated of an opportunity’ to . address the difference between the inquest and court verdicts. Deputy assistant commissioner Maxine . de Brunner said the panel’s decision ‘leaves no ambiguity as to how the . Met views the actions of Simon Harwood’. She stressed that he ‘does not reflect the professionalism of the majority of officers’. Deborah Glass, of the Independent .

Mark Zuckerberg has lost nearly half of his £11bn fortune after the disastrous Facebook stock market floatation. The founder of the social network has seen £4.9bn vanish from his personal worth over the last 12 months. Forbes magazine, which compiled figures of America’s richest billionaires, said that he had endured a ‘rough road’ since Facebook went public in May. Disastrous floatation: The founder of the Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg, has seen £4.9bn vanish from his personal worth over the last 12 months . The stock market price fell by nearly half to just £12 a share amid a flurry of lawsuits, finger-pointing and recriminations that will linger for years to come. According to the Forbes list of Richest Americans for 2012, Zuckerberg has lost more money than anybody else, sending him down from 14th to 36th place. In a sign of how volatile Facebook has become, last year he was the biggest gainer on the list having added £6.5bn to his fortune. In its analysis Forbes says that Facebook has ‘performed poorly’ and that it reported a net loss of £96m in July, which drove the stock price down even more. However it said that his personal fortune was still ‘impressive’ and that he remained committed to the company. Forbes said: ‘The drop isn’t likely to change the hoodie-wearing CEO’s lifestyle much. Happy couple: Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan are seen in this wedding photo on his Facebook page in May. They went to Italy on honeymoon . ‘What’s less clear: whether the young executive, who married his longtime girlfriend Priscilla Chan the day after the (floatation) and headed off for an Italian honeymoon, can right the ship and make Facebook into a winning public company.’ Zuckerberg recently gave his first comments since Facebook went public and admitted it had wasted two years by not focusing on mobile devices. 'The drop isn’t likely to change the hoodie-wearing CEO’s lifestyle much' Forbes magazine . His speech sparked a mini rally in the company’s stock price although he has already cashed out some of his wealth by offloading £697million of his own shares. Facebook’s floatation has been dubbed the worst such event in modern history after a perfect storm of technical glitches and overpricing the stock rendered it a failure. Zuckerberg, 27, has been personally sued for £1.8billion for allegedly deceiving smaller shareholders by not telling them about his private concerns. Meanwhile institutional investors were informed, giving them a chance to get out fast.","Fell from 14th to 36th in Forbes Richest Americans list .

A mother in Maryland still grieving the death of her 22-year-old son is now faced with a new unwelcome reminder of his suicide: a $14,000 tax bill. When Roswell Friend was found dead in late August last year, the government forgave his student loans and the portion of the payments that his mother Regina was expected to pay as is protocol. But not all of the payments stopped because the Internal Revenue Service considers forgiven loans to be a form of taxable income, so now Ms Friend faces a substantially higher tax bill that she won't be able to pay. Loving mother: Regina Friend (right) accrued $55,400 in loans and interest in order to help her son Roswell (left) pay for his tuition at Temple College in Pennsylvania . After originally starting college at Morgan State, Roswell transferred to Temple College where he was a popular member of the track team and had completed enough credits to graduate. He went missing in August 2011, left a note saying 'sorry guys' and a message on his Facebook saying 'I'm sorry everyone', and his body was found on the banks of the Delaware River days later. Federal policy automatically dismisses any loans taken out by students in the case of their death of permanent disability, and the loans and interest that Ms Friend had accrued- which totalled $55,400- were also dropped. Ms Friend was far from the only parent to have to rely on this regulation when their child died, as The Baltimore Sun reports that the Department of Education cancelled $2.7billion in such loans in 2011. The problem that comes with said cancellations is that the amount of those forgiven loans are taxable, and now that means Ms Friend is faced with a $14,000 payment on top of her existing taxes. Though she has a steady job in the technology department of PHH Corp, a mortgage company, both Ms Friend and her tax preparer do not know what to do about the additional costs. Tragic: Rosswell, a popular member of the school's track team, disappeared in August 2011 and his body was found on the shore of the Delaware River . 'As far as what I intend to do about it, I have no idea,' Ms Friend told The Baltimore Sun. 'I . don't think I've even seen $14,000 all at once. I don't want to give . the impression that I'm dirt poor or anything, but I do not have any . means of taking on that kind of debt.' Similar situations happened to the families of Freddy Reynoso and Amanda Greenhalgh, . students in California and New Jersey respectively who both died and . their parents were left struggling to pay the thousands of dollars of . taxes that followed the forgiveness of their loans. 'While . there are options for some borrowers, they are complicated and . confusing,' said Persis Yi, a lawyer for the National Consumer Law . Center. 'It is most unfortunate that the system is set up to wreak great havoc on borrower's lives at a time when the borrower deserves the most compassion,' the lawyer told The Huffington Post. The confusion and bills just add to the pain that Ms Friend has tried to deal with over the past 13 months. 'I don't think there will ever be closure for what happened. It's something I will have to learn to live with, but it is like throwing salt into a wound,' Ms Friend said.","Roswell Friend, 22, committed suicide shortly before graduating from college .

A shameless criminal who boasted that he was too busy running a drugs empire to be guilty of a gangland killing has finally been locked up. Milad Finn, 24, from Cheadle, Greater Manchester, was acquitted of killing 21-year-old Junaid Khan last year after he told the jury he had in fact been involved in a lucrative heroin deal at the time. Police used his evidence to charge him with drugs offences instead and he has now been jailed for six years. Gangland feud: Milad Finn, 24, from Cheadle, Stockport, was acquitted of murdering Junaid Khan, 21, last year after claiming he was too busy running a drugs empire to have carried out the killing. Police used his evidence to charge him with drugs offences instead and he has now been locked up for six years . During his testimony in August 2011, Finn boasted of making £340,000 from dealing crack cocaine and heroin and even imported material from China to help maximise his profits. Finn went free for nine months but was rearrested last May after determined detectives left smarting by the not guilty verdict obtained legal transcripts and examined his courtroom claims. They later corroborated his testimony with witnesses. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Finn was jailed for six years after he admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine, production of cannabis, converting criminal property and encouraging or assisting the commission of offences. The court heard he had been arrested for murder after 21-year old Junaid Khan was cut down in a hail of 16 bullets as he stood in the car park of a doctor’s surgery in Oldham in July 2009. Killing: Scene where Junaid Khan, 21, was gunned down in a car park in Oldham in July 2009 . In the days before the shooting the dead man had feared for his life and wore a bullet proof vest after he was named as a 'marked man' following the disappearance of a £175,000 cannabis crop. During the murder trial, Finn, from Cheadle, near Stockport, was said to be the hitman who had been paid by two brothers to kill Khan. It was claimed he confessed to carrying out the killing to a fellow gangster whilst they were 'having a moan' about police. It was also alleged he used spy-style tracking equipment to remotely stalk Khan before gunning him down. But Finn told a jury he had been helping an associate involved in another shooting at the time of Khan’s murder and knew nothing of the killing until he saw a TV news report about it in a gym. He then made 'extensive admissions' to the jury regarding his drug dealing activities to counter evidence against him. Finn said he became a drug dealer at 15 for a crime boss before setting up on his own. He went into detail about how he imported large quantities of caffeine and Benzocaine to act as mixing agents mixing agents to maximise his profits as his orders grew. Justice: Shopkeeper Mumtaz Khan, 63 - the father of Junaid Khan who was murdered in Oldham in 2009 . He said a cash haul seized at his home was drug money and not payment for the murder and that a flurry of mobile phone calls he made at the time of the killing was linked to a heroin deal. Finn said the spy equipment was part of a schemes to rob other drug dealers. He insisted to the jury: “All I did was help a friend. That’s why I’m stood in front of you.' He will now face a Proceeds of Crime hearing as a result of his confessions. Today Det Sgt Mark Lucas of Greater Manchester Police said: 'By his own admissions Finn started dealing drugs at 15 before expanding and setting up on his own. 'He quickly established himself as a prominent dealer across our region and is worryingly at ease sourcing and distributing large amounts of class A drugs. 'While we can’t quantify the amounts of drugs or cash that passed hands while he ran his criminal enterprise, the figures for both are undoubtedly substantial.' Three other men were also acquitted of Khan’s murder at the trial. A fifth suspect is holed out in Pakistan. No one has been convicted over the killing. At the time of the not guilty verdict Junaid Khan’s father Mumtaz Khan, 63, a shopkeeper, said: . 'Someone should get punished but I don’t think justice will ever be done. 'My son is no longer here. He was a good person and he was taken away from us. 'We are all going to die one day and on Judgement Day Junaid’s killers will not get away from God.'","Shameless con Milad Finn, 24, boasted that he couldn't have murdered 21-year-old Junaid Khan in Oldham because he was involved in heroin deal .

Shooting: The policeman who shot Mark Duggan (pictured) as he got out of a minicab with a loaded gun said he thought the 29-year-old was about to shoot him or one of his colleagues . The police marksman who killed Mark Duggan told a court yesterday he was ‘absolutely 100 per cent’ sure the suspect was holding a gun. In his first public account of the shooting, the firearms officer described his ‘Oh f*** moment’ when he feared he was about to be shot himself. The policeman told the jury how he shot Duggan twice as the suspect appeared to aim his gun at officers who had stopped him. The death of Duggan, 29, in Tottenham on August 4 last year triggered the riots that swept across the country in the following days. His family and friends claim he was unarmed and have demanded ‘Justice for Mark’. However the officer, known as V53, said he had an ‘honestly held belief’ that Duggan – who had been under surveillance – was going to shoot. The marksman, from the Met’s specialist armed police unit CO19, told the court: ‘The only way I can describe this is as an “Oh f*** moment”. 'He’s got a gun and he’s going to use it on me. ‘He was holding the pistol-grip of the gun. I could make out the shape, the outline, of the gun. ‘I could make out the trigger-guard and the barrel. I saw him hold the gun in his right-hand side on to his stomach. 'He then began to move the barrel away from his body. ‘I perceived this as being the beginning of him raising the gun into an aim position whereby he would shoot me or one of my colleagues.’ The firearms officer gave his account of the shooting at the trial of Kevin Hutchinson-Foster in Snaresbrook Crown Court yesterday. Hutchinson-Foster, 30, is accused of handing Duggan a gun just 15 minutes before he was killed. He denies the charge. Scene: Paramedics attend to Mr Duggan after he was shot in Ferry Lane, Tottenham, north London . Weapon: Kevin Hutchinson-Foster is on trial accused of handing Mr Duggan the gun before he was killed . The court heard how a team of 12 armed . officers in three unmarked cars were following a Toyota people- carrier . taxi that Duggan was inside. After being ordered to ‘strike, strike, . strike’, the officers brought the taxi to a sudden halt. The shooter told the court that he and another officer shouted warnings of ‘armed police’ at those inside the car. ‘Mark Duggan got out of the vehicle at . pace,’ he said. ‘He had a spring in his step, which to me indicated he . was about to run or possibly fight his way out of the situation he had . found himself in. ‘As I have shouted “armed police” Mark . Duggan has turned to face me. I perceived this as him looking for . another avenue to escape. Court: The trial of Mr Hutchinson-Foster is taking place at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) in east London . Flashpoint: Mr Duggan's death on August 4 last year sparked riots which started in Tottenham (above) and spread across the capital and the country . Gun: Prosecutors allege Mr Duggan collected the weapon from Mr Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east London, before continuing to Tottenham (above), where the riots later broke out . ‘At that time he was blocked by the . minicab to his front, he was blocked by W42 [another armed officer] to . the side, and he was blocked by a 5ft metal fence. ‘The only avenue of escape for him would have been behind him, or where I was standing.’ The officer fired one round at the suspect, which hit him on the right side of his chest. He added: ‘The gun was still in his . hand. I have seen the round impact on his right chest and he has done a . flinching movement as it’s impacted on him. 'I have reassessed and the . gun he is carrying was pointing in my direction now. I think he is going . to shoot me or my colleagues and I have fired a second round from my . MP5. This has hit him in the right bicep. Mark Duggan then fell to the . floor.’ V53’s second round went through . Duggan’s bicep and hit his colleague’s radio, which saved him from . injury. The officer added: ‘I have nothing to hide. I want to be open . and transparent and accountable for my actions.’ The trial continues.

A millionaire charged with murder has been bailed so that he can complete a £12 million business contract. Clint Spearpoint, 34, was charged with the murder of 39-year-old Anton Jardin, at a house party near to the V Festival, in Chelmsford, on August 18. The businessman from Rayleigh was at a house party, in London Road, to celebrate the end of the V Festival on the other side of the road, where he got into a fight with Mr Jardin, a graphic designer from Rayleigh, who collapsed and died in the garden of the house, near to Rose's Cafe, a court heard. Bail: Clint Spearpoint, 34, left, was charged with . the murder of 39-year-old Anton Jardin, right, at a house party near to the V . Festival, in Chelmsford, on August 18. He has been bailed until later this month . He is charged with Mr Jardin's murder alongside Sam Martin, 25, of Westcliff, who is also the boyfriend of his sister, Georgia Spearpoint. On Thursday, Spearpoint, who is the managing director of Magnolia Air UK Ltd, an air conditioning company that supplies the London Underground, appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court to apply for bail. His defence barrister, Craig Rush, said: 'There are 60 people dependent on this company, employed directly by them. 'The business has grown substantially in the past four or five years and he's grown it into a multi-million pound business. 'It's in the process of a £12 million contract that would secure the future of the company for the next seven years. It's growing fast, but it could just as quickly collapse.' On granting Spearpoint bail, Judge Christopher Ball QC said: 'The court has to assess each case on merits. 'This is one of the rare cases where I will grant the defendant bail, but in its strictest form.' Spearpoint closed his eyes and wiped away tears when he heard that he would be allowed to live at home with his wife, Louise, while on bail. Police are pictured at the scene of the house party on August 19th this year. Eight men were arrested on the night of Mr Jardin's death and they have all been bailed until September . He was ordered to report to Rayleigh police station on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings and must adhere to a curfew between 8pm and 6am. Eight other men were arrested on the night of Mr Jardin's death, and Georgia Spearpoint was arrested for perverting the course of justice. They have all been bailed until September. Sam Martin and Clint Spearpoint are both due to appear in court on October 17.

Devastated: Andrew and Claire Ashley have been ordered to rip down the £10,000 panels from the £750,000 grade II-listed property - despite insisting that they are only visible from the bottom of one neighbour's garden . Installing 18 solar panels on the back of the roof seemed the best way to go green while preserving the character of their listed home. But out of sight is not out of mind as far as Andrew and Claire Ashley’s local council is concerned. The couple have been ordered to rip down the £10,000 panels from the £750,000 grade II-listed property – despite insisting that they are only visible from the bottom of one neighbour’s garden. The panels will have ‘a significant visual impact which will diminish the special interest of the building, including its character and setting’, the council said in a report. ‘The energy-saving benefits that may be derived are not considered to outweigh the harm that would be caused.’ In addition, allowing them to remain would set a precedent which ‘could have far-reaching consequences for Wiltshire’s historic environment’. Last night, Mr Ashley, 47, a company director, said: ‘Our electricity bill has halved already – and the Government is encouraging people to do what we have done. If we have to pull them down we’ll be devastated.’ Mrs Ashley, 39, added: ‘A house on the other side of the village green where the  building is not listed has solar panels on its roof and they are completely visible from the front. It doesn’t make sense.’ The couple live in a late 18th-century home in Aldbourne, Wiltshire, with their children Hugh, eight, and Annabel, 11. The panels were installed in February but the couple applied for planning permission retrospectively. Permission to keep all 18 was refused by Wiltshire council, as was a revised application to retain 15. Out of sight? : This picture shows the solar panels on the rear roof of the Ashley family home . Neighbours Juliette and Jonathan Martin objected in a letter to the council. But yesterday councillor Chris Humphries said: ‘I think the committee was splitting hairs.’ However, Hugh Bland, chairman of Aldbourne Parish Council’s planning committee, said: ‘They are on a listed building. They are highly visible from a neighbouring property and would be setting a precedent.’ Mr and Mrs Ashley are now considering whether to appeal.","Andrew and Claire Ashley have been ordered to rip down the .

Apple are looking at launching an 'iPad Mini' later this year, bringing an eight-inch younger brother into the fold, according to a rumour from a well-placed source. Apple are notoriously secretive about upcoming products, but this leak comes from inside Samsung, a company which holds the unique position of being Apple's fiercest competitor - and one of their biggest hardware suppliers. The source from within Samsung made the 'mini' indescretion while talking to the Korea Times about how Apple spends £7billion on Samsung components, which go into Apple's iPhones, iPads and MacBooks. The leaky official said: 'The amount of the current contract [between Apple and Samsung] is around $9.7billion. 'The contract is expected to rise to $11billion by the end of this . year as Apple is planning to release a smaller iPad, probably with a . 7.85-inch screen, and to sell more of its MacBook Air PCs using . Samsung’s faster solid state drive (SSD) storage.' The iPad Mini would add variety to . Apple's one-size-fits-all approach, and would be more portable. It will . also show that Apple is prepared to break away from former chief exec . Steve Jobs' deeply-held mantras. The Apple leader, who passed away last October, publicly derided the smaller tablet model, in particular the seven-inch form-factor, which is becoming a standard for a smaller tablet. In a 2010 earnings call, he said: 'One naturally thinks that a seven-inch screen would offer 70 percent of . the benefits of a ten-inch screen. 'Unfortunately, this is far from the truth. … The reason we won't make a seven-inch tablet isn’t because we don’t want to hit a . lower price point, it’s because we think the screen is too small to . express the software.' Not a fan: Steve Jobs, father of the iPad, said a seven-inch tablet did not offer the best experience . However a segment of the market is . likely to disagree with Jobs, particularly with the rise of the eBook reader and . Android tablets which come in all shapes and sizes. Consumers like commuters and travellers . will find the size (almost) pocket-friendly, and Google are likely to . lead the mainstream acceptance of smaller tablets when they bring out . their own seven-inch Android tablet before the summer. On the other hand, the risk to Apple . is that a different-sized tablet might lead to fragmentation - where . apps and games need re-configuring by their developers to ensure they . are compatible on both versions. This has been Android's biggest issue in the last few years. Different screen sizes, different . manufacturers, different versions of the operating system and different . price-points all lead to choice for the consumer - but at the cost of . development headaches and an inconsistent experience. Indeed, one Indie developer, Mika . Mobile, decided to stop supporting Android this week, stating Android . was costing them so much in tweaking that it was swallowing all . their profits. Apple has avoided all these problems . so far by keeping full ownership of the product line, and keeping a uniform . screen size for their two big ranges, iPhones and iPad. The only major . fragmentation that occurs is as older models become obsolete. Samsung has a full complement of phones and tablets to compete with Apple, such as the five-inch Note . Samsung is a very strange bed-fellow of Apple. To the consumers, they are . arch-rivals, with the Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone competing directly . with the iPhone and being the runaway success of Android in the last . year. In the courts the fighting is even . more fierce, with Apple repeatedly trying - and sometimes succeeding - . in getting injunctions to stop Samsung selling phones and tablets around . the world, claiming patent infrigement. But in business, Samsung is one of . Apple's top suppliers - and Apple will spend up to £7billion on Samsung . parts for their products this year, according to the Samsung leak. The leak also said the . amount is expected to increase until at least 2014 under the current . terms of their contract, following a deal between Samsung and Apple's . CEO Tim Cook. The Korea Times also said that Apple . bought around £4.9billion worth of parts from Samsung in 2011 including . displays, mobile application processors, NAND flash chips and mobile . memory. You will find Samsung processors, displays and memory chips inside the new iPad. The . source continued: 'Apple’s top management still believes Samsung is the . only parts maker in the world ideally-positioned to meet all of the . critical conditions - better pricing, technologically-enhanced products, . on-time delivery and the capability to immediately respond to any . emergency situation.' However one thing Apple may not like . is the lack of discretion, as they plan the hype and launch of their new . products down to the smallest details. The source also said that Samsung's . OLED panel supplies - the type which power Samsung's top-range . smartphones - may appear in future iDevices, if Samsung is able to . output the screens in high-enough quantities. Apple's much-admired 'Retina' displays are also manufactured by Samsung. Also on the rumour mill today are . suggestions that Apple's anticipated television set - the iTV - will . launch towards the end of the year. Analyst Peter Misek said yesterday . that panel suppliers are gearing up to begin production in May or . June,and therefore the television may launch in the few months leading . up to Christmas. Apple has played in the TV market . before, with Apple TV working like a set-top box to pump videos to . flat-screens. But with the tech built inside, and Apple's respected . attention to detail and usability, the TV industry may be in for a bit . of a revolution, as Apple did before for the music, movie, TV and phone . industries.","Samsung insider leaks 'iPad Mini'

Scientists have discovered that planets do not need stars similar to our sun in order to form - implying that Earth-like planets are much more abundant than first thought. The formation of small worlds like Earth previously was thought to occur mostly around stars rich in heavy elements such as iron and silicon. However, new ground-based observations, combined with data collected by NASA's Kepler space telescope, shows small planets form around stars with a wide range of heavy element content - and suggests they may be widespread in our galaxy. A research team led by Lars A. Buchhave, an astrophysicist at the Niels Bohr Institute and the Centre for Star and Planet Formation at the University of Copenhagen, studied the elemental composition of more than 150 stars harboring 226 planet candidates smaller than Neptune. This artist's conception shows a newly formed star surrounded by a swirling protoplanetary disk of dust and gas. Debris coalesces to create rocky 'planetesimals' that collide and grow to eventually form planets . Buchhave said: 'I wanted to investigate whether small planets needed a special environment in order to form, like the giant gas planets, which we know preferentially develop in environments with a high content of heavy elements. 'This study shows that small planets do not discriminate and form around stars with a wide range of heavy metal content, including stars with only 25 percent of the sun's metallicity.' Astronomers refer to all chemical elements heavier than hydrogen and helium as metals. They define metallicity is the metal content of heavier elements in a star. Stars with a higher fraction of heavy elements than the sun are considered metal-rich. Stars with a lower fraction of heavy elements are considered metal-poor. Planets are created disks of gas and dust around new stars. Planets like Earth are composed almost entirely of elements such as iron, oxygen, silicon and magnesium. The metallicity of a star mirrors the metal content of the planet-forming disk. Astronomers have hypothesised that large quantities of heavy elements in the disk would lead to more efficient planet formation. It has long been noted that giant planets with short orbital periods tend to be associated with metal-rich stars. Kepler scientist Batalha said 'nature is opportunistic - finding pathways we might otherwise have thought difficult . Unlike gas giants, the occurrence of smaller planets is not strongly dependent on the heavy element content of their host stars. Planets up to four times the size of Earth can form around stars with a wide range of heavy element content, including stars with a lower metallicity than the sun. The findings are described in a new study published in the journal Nature. 'Kepler has identified thousands of planet candidates, making it possible to study big-picture questions like the one posed by Lars. Does nature require special environments to form Earth-size planets?' said Natalie Batalha, Kepler mission scientist at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, California. 'The data suggest that small planets may form around stars with a wide range of metallicities - that nature is opportunistic and prolific, finding pathways we might otherwise have thought difficult.' The ground-based spectroscopic observations for this study were made at the Nordic Optical Telescope on La Palma in the Canary Islands; Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory on Mt. Hopkins in Ariz.; McDonald Observatory at the University of Texas at Austin; and W.M. Keck Observatory atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Launched in March 2009, Kepler searches for planets by continuously monitoring more than 150,000 stars, looking for telltale dips in their brightness caused by passing, or transiting, planets. At least three transits are required to verify a signal as a planet. Follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes are also needed to confirm a candidate as a planet. Ames manages Kepler's ground system development, mission operations and science data analysis. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., managed the Kepler mission development. Kepler is NASA's 10th Discovery Mission and is funded by NASA's Science Mission Directorate at the agency's headquarters in Washington.","Planets up to four times the size of Earth can form around stars with a wide range of heavy elements .

The find - a 'third kind' of bond between atoms, unknown on Earth - could also unlock the secrets of ultra-powerful new computers. The find rewrites the rules of the . universe - adding a third kind of bond after the 'ionic' and 'covalent' bonds learned by schoolchildren.

Scientists have raised fears of rising sea levels after pictures showed Greenland's ice sheet has melted over a larger area than at any time in more than 30 years of satellite observations. Almost the entire ice cover of Greenland has experienced some melting at its surface this month, according to data collected by three independent satellites. The findings, described as 'unprecedented' by NASA, have stunned scientists, who say only about half of the ice sheet melts naturally during an average summer. Unprecedented: These maps show the extent of surface melt over Greenland's ice sheet on July 8 (left) and July 12 (right) One expert even suspected that the satellites had made a mistake at first, so surprising were the results. Son Nghiem, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, was analysing radar data from the Indian Space Research Organisation's (ISRO) Oceansat-2 satellite last week when he noticed that most of Greenland appeared to have undergone surface melting. He said: 'This was so extraordinary that at first I questioned the result - was this real or was it due to a data error?' Mr Nghiem checked the Oceansat-2's findings against pictures taken by other satellites, belonging to NASA and the US Air Force. Scientists found that the melting had spread quickly - from about 40 per cent of the ice sheet on July 8 to about 97 per cent four days later. NASA has released colour-coded maps showing the dramatic change between July 8 and July 12. Areas in dark pink show where two or three satellites found evidence of melting. Areas in light pink show where one satellite found evidence of melting. Greenland has seen an unusual weather pattern since the end of May. The extreme melting coincided with the last of a series of strong ridges of warm air, described by NASA as 'heat domes'. Thomas Mote, a climatologist at the University of Georgia, said: 'Each successive ridge has been stronger than the previous one.' Concerning: Icebergs float in a bay off Ammassalik Island, Greenland, in 2007. Satellite pictures have shown 'unprecedenting' melting of the ice sheet this month . The latest heat dome started to move over Greenland on July 8, staying over the ice sheet about three days later. By July 16, it had begun to dissipate. Even the area around Summit Station in central Greenland, which at two miles above sea level is near the highest point of the ice sheet, showed signs of melting. Such pronounced melting at Summit and across the ice sheet has not occurred since 1889, according to ice cores analysed by Kaitlin Keegan at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration weather station at Summit confirmed air temperatures hovered above or within a degree of freezing for several hours on July 11 and 12. Loroa Koening, a glaciologist and a member of the research team analysing the satellite data, said: 'Ice cores from Summit show that melting events of this type occur about once every 150 years on average. 'With the last one happening in 1889, this event is right on time, but if we continue to observe melting events like this in upcoming years, it will be worrisome.' NASA's cryosphere program manager, Tom Wagner, told the Huffington Post that this month's extreme melting could be part of a natural variation. But he added: 'We have abundant evidence that Greenland is losing ice, probably because of global warming, and it's significantly contributing to sea level rise.'

Knock, knock: An alien lurks behind an unsuspecting, and soon to be dead, grunt . Aliens: Colonial Marines is told through the eyes of Corporal Christopher Winter. A group of grunts are sent to investigate the USS Sulaco in search of Ellen Ripley, Corporal Dwayne Hicks and the rest of the missing soldiers who were dispatched to LV-426. Using authentic environments inspired by the films, including Hadley’s Hope itself, the game promises to immerse you in the eerie, claustrophobic world that made the film series such a blockbuster success. First off, it’s clear the game is in safe hands as Gearbox, the team behind the critically acclaimed Borderlands and Brothers in Arms games, are behind the wheel. Having seen the game in action, it looks superb – leaps and bounds above the average-at-best first-person blooper shooter, Aliens Vs Predator. Lighting, as predicted, is the star of the show – creating the oppressive, nerve-shredding atmosphere Aliens fans have long waited for. Erm, I've found something! You'll fight some old foes . We watched as the marines did a ‘sweep’ of Hadley’s Hope - the frayed wires and twisted metal are all that remains of what was once a place where families lived. Stagnant water dripped from exposed pipes as the soldiers meandered their way through the dark, bitterly cold metal maze. It was only a matter of time before their motion trackers registered movement - the haunting 'beep' stopping the patrol in their tracks. And then they came - dragging one grunt face-first through a vent - his blood-curdling echo cut ruthlessly short with an almighty thud. Aliens burst from every crack and cranny - their terrifying 'hisses' drowning out the high-pitched blasts from the solders' pulse rifles. The aliens’ animations are superb. They crawl and scamper over walls and ceilings before diving at you ferociously. There was even a brief introduction to a new breed of alien – a huge beast that chases after you – leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Thankfully, you’ll be armed to the teeth, tooled up with all the classic marine weapons. And when things get too hectic, you can call in your friends. The whole campaign can be played with a squad of up to four players, dropping in and out as necessary through self-contained missions within an over-arching narrative. There’s also an extensive upgrade system that allows players to customise their characters to play the way they want. You can earn experience to get perks, new weapons and new looks for your squad. However, the bad news is that it’s just been delayed…again. So, don’t expect to get your hands on a copy until February next year. They're coming out the walls! If things get tough, call in your friends at any time .

The companies notified . U.S. banks of a potential security breach, and they are now going through the process of pinpointing the affected accounts before contacting customers involved. Customers are urged to check their accounts online or contact their financial institution regarding any concerns they have. Visa have already provided the issuing . banks with the affected account numbers and assured customers they would . not be responsible for fraudulent purchases. Investigation: Mastercard and Visa are said to have notified all of their customers of the security breach . The companies, which are the two largest . global credit card processors, said the issue stemmed from a third-party . vendor, reportedly Global Payments, and not their own internal systems. Atlanta-based company Global Payments are being named as the third party processor where the breach occurred. Following the news, shares of the company were halted after dropping more than 9.1 per cent. Global Payments said it had 'identified and self-reported unauthorized access into a portion of its processing system' and had determined in early March that the intruders might have gained access to credit-card data. Though millions of U.S. cardholders could be affected, it does not necessarily mean their cards were used fraudulently but that the cardholder's information was accessed. Mastercard said in a statement: . 'MasterCard is concerned whenever there is any possibility that cardholders could be inconvenienced and we continue to both monitor this event and take steps to safeguard account information. 'If cardholders have any concerns about their individual accounts, they should contact their issuing financial institution.' Visa also released a statement saying their customers were victims of data theft, but said its own systems were not hacked. 'Visa Inc is aware of a potential data compromise incident at a third party entity affecting card account information from all major card brands. 'Visa has provided payment card issuers with the affected account numbers so they can take steps to protect consumers through independent fraud monitoring and, if needed, reissuing cards.' Brian Krebs, left, reported that Mastercard and Visa were contacting their customers about the breach and Avivah . Litan, right, security analyst at Gartner Research, said there are signs the data is already being used by thieves . Once a person swipes their credit card to pay, the transaction then is sent through . a chain of processing. First they are aggregated and sent to a server before the card information reaches a processor for authorization. The processor then sends the authorization request to the bank who check the details (if it is a legitimate account and if there is enough money to cover charge) and then confirm the authorization back to the processor. The current breach is believed to have occurred at the central . aggregation point where card information is calculated. The companies' statements came after the blog Krebs on Security reported . that MasterCard and Visa Inc have been alerting banks across the U.S. about a 'massive' breach that may affect more than ten million . cardholders. He told Technology Live: 'Law enforcement asked everyone to keep . it quiet so as not to disturb investigations. 'I'm hearing . now from two sources that investigators suspect Dominican street gangs . may be involved and that the fraud is focusing mostly on commercial . credit and debit card accounts.' Thousands of U.S. banks that issue credit and debit cards receive daily . alerts regarding breaches through a system referred to as CAMS, said . Thomas McCrohan, an analyst with Janney Capital Markets. Once a person swipes a card to pay, the transaction then is sent through . a chain of processing.

'Those transactions are aggregated' and sent to a server, Litan said. 'It has a lot of hops along the way' before the card information reaches . a processor. She believes the data is already being used on the street by identity thieves. She wrote on her blog: 'I’ve spoken with folks in the card business who are seeing signs of this breach mushroom. Looks like the hackers have started using the stolen card data more recently. 'From what I hear, the breach involves a taxi and parking garage company in the New York City area, so if you’ve paid a NYC cab in the last few months with your credit or debit card — be sure to check your card statements for possible fraud.' She also said that unverified reports point to a 'Central American gang that broke into the company's system by answering the application's knowledge-based authentication questions correctly.

A thug walked free from court today - despite admitting punching a female cashier in the face at a bookies after losing a bet worth just £1.30. John Eamer, 29, flew across the counter at terrified Leanne Vallis and struck her twice after she told him he had lost the 50p wager - before calmly walking away. The horrifying attack, which left the assistant with bruising and swelling below the eye, was caught on CCTV and he was later captured by police. Thug: John Eamer, who punched a woman cashier at a bookies, outside Cheltenham Magistrates' Court (left) and at the scene of the crime . This is the barbaric moment John Eamer, from Gloucester, punched a woman cashier in the face after being told he hadn't won his bet . But the serial offender - who . previously beat up a pensioner just because he sat next to him on a . bench - was spared jail. Cheltenham Magistrates' Court handed him a 12-month community order alongside 200 hours of unpaid work. The court had previously heard that Eamer had put one 50p bet on Germany to beat Portugal in their Euro 2012 clash on June 9. But the 'handicap' wager, placed at . Ladbrokes in Gloucester, meant the Germans had to win 2-0 in order for . him to collect the paltry £1.30 jackpot. In fact, Germany only beat Portugal . 1-0 in the tournament group game - but Eamer steamed into the bookies at . 10.15am the next day, convinced he had won. The gambler then flipped when Leanne Vallis, the Ladbrokes cashier behind the desk told him he was not a winner. The attack happened in a branch of Ladbrokes, on Southgate Street in Gloucester . He raged: 'I know what I f****** bet . on - I know it was a f****** winner', before being ordered out of the . bookies by the cashier. Derek Ryder, prosecuting, said: . 'Without warning the defendant leaned over the counter and punched her . twice in the face - causing her glasses to be knocked off and her body . to rock backwards. 'Leanne Vallis said she did not even . see the second blow coming after she asked Mr Eamer to leave once more - . as she did not have time to put her glasses back on.' The stunned cashier was left with heavy bruising, bleeding and swelling below her eye. Mr Ryder said: 'In 14 years she said she had never had anything happen to her that upset her and scared her. 'She said it seemed ridiculous over such a small bet.' Carole Malvern-White, defending Eamer, . said her client was convinced he had won the bet and was relying on the . money he had won for food. She added that he now showed a significant degree of remorse and regretted what he had done. 'In 14 years she said she had never had anything happen to her that upset her and scared her. She said it seemed ridiculous over such a small bet.' Derek Ryder, prosecuting . She told the court: 'This was an act . out of complete frustration, he believed he had a winning bet. He was . full or paranoia and felt that at that moment in time the cashier was . deceiving him. 'He has expressed a significant degree . of remorse and very much regrets the way he dealt with her, he has even . offered to write her a letter expressing this. 'He struggles with drugs and he had . very little by the way of funds and was relying on the money he thought . he had won to last him until he got his next benefit.' Magistrates adjourned the case for a pre-sentence report last week. He was sentenced him to a 12-month community order, with a six month drug rehabilitation requirement and 200 hours unpaid work. Chair of the bench Nicholas Negus told him: 'You will no doubt be pleased to know we are not sending you into custody. 'We are more or less following the recommendations of the probation service and giving you a community order.' Eamer, from Cromwell Street in . Gloucester - where murderer Fred West lived - was also ordered to pay . Leanne Vallis £150 in compensation alongside £50 in court costs. After the attack a spokesman for . Ladbrokes said: 'Incidents like this are always distressing for those . involved but we have excellent security procedures. 'We also have the best CCTV in the business.' Eamer was previously jailed for 15 . months in 2008 after launching an unprovoked attack on a pensioner - . just because he sat next to him on a bench. He pushed 67-year-old Michael Hannis . off the bench - sending him sprawling to the floor - before punching him . in the face as he got to his feet. Shocked passers-by called an ambulance . for Mr Hannis and as he was being taken to hospital a woman security . guard became Eamer's next victim. When she asked to have a word with him he punched her face - knocking her to the ground. Two other people were also caught in Eamer's inexplicable violent outburst before he was overpowered and arrested. He later pleaded guilty to assaulting . all four people. Eamer also forged his friend's cheques back in 2004 - . while his pal was in hospital. Magistrates ordered the defendant to pay £79.67 compensation to the Abbey National and £43 costs after he admitted forgery.","John Eamer, 29, stood to win tiny amount when he bet on Euro 2012 match .

It could be mistake for an untidy haystack - but this mammoth pile of twigs and leaves was yesterday revealed as being one of the biggest birds' nests ever seen in Britain. The enormous 10ft wide, 6ft high and 2ft deep nest was discovered in the . ceiling of a village church tower after parishioners heard bird song . during services. Tiny jackdaws are thought to have taken up to four years to build the giant structure, which was found in the ceiling of St Margaret's Church, Moreton Say, near Market Drayton, in Shropshire. It's not pretty but it's home: Jackdaws have built one of Britain's biggest ever birds nests in the roof of St Margaret's Church, Moreton Say, near Market Drayton, in Shropshire . Reverend Michael Last (pictured) is concerned the huge bird's nest could pose a fire risk to the church . A church warden who went to investigate discovered that a family of . jackdaws had squeezed in through a tiny hole left in the wall in order . to build the nest. Plans are now underway to remove the nest, due to fears about the fire risk it poses. Reverend Michael Last said: ""We first discovered it in the spring. Jackdaws like to roost and nest in . loose colonies above buildings, and are known to block chimneys with . their piles of twigs. 'When we were having evening services, you could hear birds singing in the roof. 'They have gone in through a very small opening where a grill had broken.' The nest will now be removed after it was decided it posed a fire hazard to the centuries-old parish church. Because of its size, the nest will have to be dragged across the floor of the tower before being dropped 20ft on to the floor below. 'The only way we can get it out is take it through the roof and out the tower,' said Revd Last. 'I . am not trying to un-home them but if they brought in a lit cigarette . there would be a huge fire because they have basically built a large . bonfire - and you don't know what else they have brought in.' Parishioner . James Smith, 47, said he thought the nest looked more like it should . house a prehistoric beast than a family of jackdaws. He said: 'It looks like something out of Jurassic Park - like there should be a pterodactyl living in it. 'It's . absolutely massive, it's mind-boggling to think that just a few little . birds built it up with twigs and other bits of rubbish.' St Margaret's Church in Moreton Saye where the nest was found . Jackdaws build nests in cavities in trees, cliffs and buildings - and even household chimneys. They . make nests from hair, wool, rags, bark, soil, dead grass and sticks and . they are known for picking up or stealing shiny objects to hoard. Fen . Gerry, a spokesperson for the RSPB, said: 'It really is an amazing . nest. Jackdaws are known for building intricate nests and this is . certainly the biggest one I have ever seen in my life. 'It is very unusual to see them this large.' John . Hughes, development manager at the Shropshire Wildlife Trust, added: 'Jackdaws build nests on top of nests, they will build to fit wherever . they are, but the case at Moreton Say certainly sounds exceptional.'

A criminal chasing a debt left Michael Caine’s  daughter Natasha so terrified her hair ‘turned white’, a court heard yesterday. Kevin Fox, 45, is accused of repeatedly harassing her husband Michael Hall, a millionaire property developer, at his office and at the couple’s home. The court heard the debt collector first turned up uninvited at Mr Hall’s offices in Victoria, Central London, on February 9 this year. He was said to be acting for a client who claimed a company part-owned by Mr Hall owed £67,000 to him. Court fight: Michael Caine¿s son-in-law Michael Hall, far left, is fighting in the High Court for damages and an injunction against a debt collector he claims has been 'harassing' him over an alleged £67,000 debt . Couple: Michael Hall is married to Michael Caine¿s daughter Natasha . After two more visits to the office, in which he was said to have made violent threats, the court heard he turned up at the couple’s home in Wimbledon. Although Natasha and her husband, who have three children, were out, it had a frightening impact on the family, the court heard. Yesterday, in dramatic scenes in the High Court Mr Hall, who is seeking damages and an injunction against Fox, faced the man he alleged had left his 39-year-old wife of five years terrified. Mr Hall said Fox’s unsolicited visit to their home on February 29 while builders were at work was ‘very, very upsetting’. Mr Hall told Fox, who is representing himself: ‘You were putting considerable pressure on me and my family. My wife’s hair has nearly gone white since you walked in our house.’ In a statement about the visit Mr Hall added: ‘The defendant intimidated the builders who were working on site and took it upon himself to walk around the premises, while uttering further threats of violence to the point that one of the contractors decided to leave, in fear of their own personal safety.’ Fox is then allegedly said to have commented that ‘he wished to know the layout of the property for future reference’. Michael Caine with his wife Shakira and daughter Natasha, who is married to Michael Hall. Mr Hall is fighting for damages and an injunction against debt collector Kevin Fox whom he claims has been 'harassing' him over an alleged £67,000 debt with 'menacing threats' ‘Such a comment was clearly designed to intimidate and to cause the claimant to be concerned for his personal safety,’ the statement said. Fox told the court it was ‘wholly untruthful’ that he entered the couple’s home, and said the house was ‘a derelict building site’ at the time. Mr Hall retorted: ‘It was a building site, it wasn’t derelict, it was our house.’  Fox, who denies the civil harassment claim, was jailed for seven years in 2004 for theft and possession of a firearm with intent after he and two other men stole £1.4million in gold bars from  bullion firm Johnson Matthey. The court heard Mr Hall did not call the police about the alleged harassment but instead asked former Tory MP and London mayoral candidate Stephen Norris to enlist the help of senior police contacts. Mr Norris is chairman of Obsidian Regeneration, Mr Hall’s property group. Mr Hall denied he had been trying to get Mr Norris to ‘scare’ Fox  but merely to ‘use his influence’ to resolve the situation, and added, ‘I did not want a media circus...which I have now.’ Asked why he had hired bodyguards to protect himself and his family rather than calling the police, Mr Hall told Fox: ‘I wanted to try and get you to back away.’ Michael Hall wants an injunction forbidding Mr Fox from coming within 100 yards of his west London home in Market Place, just off Oxford Street, or his offices in Arlington Street, Piccadilly (file photo) He said he had been told Fox was ‘a very dangerous criminal who had been imprisoned in Belmarsh for a criminal offence’. Mr Hall, who married Natasha Caine in 2007, said Fox’s demands for money amounted to ‘blackmail’ and added: ‘My understanding is you are an underworld enforcer and you threaten people in order to get money.’ Fox, from New Barnet, Hertfordshire, told the court that it was ‘an abuse’ for Mr Norris to speak to senior police officers on behalf of Mr Hall. ‘To be absolutely clear, you spoke to Mr Norris so he could use his influence, so he could speak to the right people,’ he told Mr Hall. ‘I don’t have that influence, I don’t know anyone who has that influence. I don’t have your money, your private investigators, don’t have your lawyers, I don’t have your millions.’ Mr Hall’s barrister Paul Emerson told the High Court: ‘My claimant says no debt is owed at all. In respect of that matter the course of the conduct is such that it amounts to harassment. There is no proper excuse for what is going on.’ Fox denies all claims by Mr  Hall that he acted in a threatening way. The case at the High  Court continues.

Chinese internet were barred from searching ‘the truth’ on its loading social media website, has been revealed. Attempts to search for the phrase were blocked on the Twitter-like site Weibo.com, which boasts 300million users. Users noticed on Thursday that if they typed in the Chinese characters for ‘the truth’, they received a message refusing to display any results. Censored: Weibo.com, China's most popular micro-blogging site with 300million accounts, barred users from searching for the phrase 'the truth' It read: ‘According to relevant laws, regulations and policies, search results for 'the truth' cannot be displayed.’ It is not known how long the phrase search was blocked and if China’s controlling Communist government intervened. A spokesman for the website insisted that the block was due to a ‘technical glitch’. However, the one-party state is notorious for actively blocking sites such as Facebook and Twitter with the so-called Great Firewall of China. Under Chinese law, social media firms are also required to self-censor. At the same time that ‘the truth’ was inaccessible, the Weibo account of the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai was also inaccessible. A search for the account said results could not be displayed and ‘relevant sensitive information or garbage content has been filtered’. Consulate officials said they did not know why their account, which sometimes comments on sensitive social issues, could not be reached. Qi Zhenyu, head of social media for iSun Affairs, a Hong Kong-based current affairs online magazine that is banned in China, said of Weibo: ‘It is not unusual but it is quite ironic this time – you can't simply block the truth.’ Burgeoning interest: Chinese internet use is expanding rapidly with sales of gadgets, including iPads (above) soaring. But the Government is fearful that it could lead to a potential revolt by its people . In the past, blocked terms have included ‘Tiananmen Square’ and ‘Bo Xilai’, the disgraced politician whose wife was suspected of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood. ‘Weibo is the most popular social media site in China and as a result suffers the highest level of censorship,’ Mr Qi told the Daily Telegraph. ‘Whenever there is a word that upsets them, they just go ahead and block [but] most of the time you can't really explain why they censor a certain word.’ It is possible that Beijing's sensitivity to internet freedom may have increased in recent days after news that the Chinese economy is growing at its slowest rate since the global recession began in 2008. They fear that the clamour for democracy could grow if people cannot see concrete economic benefits to strict control by a single political party. One of Beijing's biggest battles in its bid to control the web – and avoid descent against the regime – has been with Google. The internet giant last year axed its Chinese search engine and closed down its office in the country after becoming frustrated by censorship. Users on the mainland can still access Google searches in Hong Kong – but China censors the results. However, last month the California-based firm ruffled feathers of Beijing’s party bosses by adding  a feature that suggests alternatives for search terms that might result in blocked results.","Weibo.com users barred from searching for 'the truth'

When medal winner David Bond scooped gold at the last London Olympics over half a century ago, the event was a far cry from the all-encompassing, multi-billion pound 'Greatest Show on Earth' it is today. Now 64 years after the capital last hosted the Games, Britain's only surviving gold medal winner has described how it felt competing in the first post-war Olympics in 1948. Sporting hero Mr Bond, now 90, claimed gold as one half of the Swallow class sailing team - having taken unpaid leave from work to compete in the Games his bosses barely cared about. Proud: Mr Bond, now 90, pictured with his gold medal from 1948, said he had to take unpaid leave to participate in the last London Games . Victorious: Mr Bond and his sailing teammate Stuart Morris receive their gold medals by Sir Ralph Gore . And in stark contrast to the fever pitch surrounding London 2012, he told how holidaymakers in Britain did not even know the Olympics were on at all. Mr Bond, also known as 'dinghy', forged an unbeatable partnership with Stewart Morris, originally from Norfolk, who passed away in 1991. Unenthusiastic: Mr Bond, pictured with teammate Stuart Morris, told how British holidaymakers in 1948 did not even know the Games were going on . As he was a genuine amateur, he had to take unpaid leave from work to practice, with his employers paying no interest in his activity. The gold medallist, who now spends most of his time between living in Spain and Falmouth in Cornwall, said: 'The participants are now professionals - they work full-time on improving their sport whereas in 1948 participants were amateurs. 'You practised your sport after work and at weekends and you funded yourself. There wasn't any sponsorship. 'I took unpaid leave from my job in the aircraft industry to take part in the games and my employers weren't the slightest bit interested in why I wanted the leave.' David was born and brought up in Falmouth by his father who was also a sailing enthusiast, but unfortunately died of cancer in 1940 - eight years before his son won gold. He didn't even know he would be competing in the games until March 1948, less than three months before the start. David is now preparing to watch the Great British hopefuls at the London 2012 games gets into full flow this weekend. However, the build-up to the games is a far cry to what he was used to back in 1948. He said: 'There was very little atmosphere in anticipation of the Olympics in 1948 but it was a very different time then. 'There were a number of battleships manning the harbour and the Olympics were such an under reported local story that holidaymakers on the seaside were heard to ask: 'Who are all these young people from different countries and why are they here?' Mr Bond, from Falmouth, Cornwall, is now as excited as the rest of the nation for the start of the Olympics . Spectacle: The London Olympics, in which Mr Bond . took part in the sailing, were a far cry from the billion pound global . event that will be London 2012 .

Double-trouble: The Nationwide Building Society confirmed problems with some payments this week. Britain's biggest building society . left more than 700,000 customers out of pocket yesterday after a basic . computer error took payments from their accounts twice. An estimated 704,000 Nationwide . account holders saw cash – in some cases thousands of pounds – wrongly . snatched out of their current account. Every debit card payment was deducted as normal on Tuesday – but then taken again on Wednesday. In another blow to the UK’s . beleaguered banks and building societies, NatWest’s online service froze . yesterday, leaving up to 11.5million customers locked out and unable to . access their cash. The Nationwide error hit 50,000 people . so badly that they were forced into unauthorised overdrafts which stung . them with penalties of up to £100, had card purchases turned down or . saw cash requests at ATMs rejected. Others relying on a minimum sum in . their account risked missing mortgage payments. Nationwide blamed ‘human error’ and . said the money would be refunded this morning. But it will be up to . those who suffer a stain on their credit record to contact credit . reference agencies themselves to clear up the mess. Angry customers took to the internet . to vent their fury at the chaos. Steve Jones, from Wales, complained: . ‘My account was twice debited with £1,200 – I couldn’t get cash out at . the ATM and it says I’m now overdrawn for the first time in my life. Unbelievable.’ Yesterday’s blow emerged just weeks . after Nationwide boasted how it had received a 67 per cent surge in new . customers following the disastrous IT meltdown at RBS. It has pumped . millions into a high-profile advertising campaign tapping into the . public sense of outrage against high street banks. Nationwide praised its virtues as a . building society – where savers and borrowers effectively own the . business. However, last night experts said there was little to choose . between Nationwide and RBS in the way they had treated their customers . following the problems. Twoutrage: Customers take to social media for answers after finding payments had been taken from their account twice. Marc Gander, of consumer champion . Consumer Action Group, said: ‘This is a total laugh. Nationwide ought to . have been much more careful before it started crowing about the fact it . was different to the big high street banks.’ Nationwide said people left penniless . by the problems would be able to ask the bank for an emergency payout. But the Daily Mail received reports from readers who were turned down . when they resorted to begging staff for help or for a £10 payout to tide . them over.

NatWest’s online problems came only a . month after its reputation was damaged by a massive computer crash.

Barack Obama last night returned to New York City for a $40,000-a-head fundraising dinner which was expected to bring rush hour traffic to a standstill. The trip came just six weeks after a star-studded event at Sarah Jessica Parker's house in Manhattan which raised $4.5million for the President's re-election campaign. It is unclear how the trip, which saw Mr Obama fly to New York on Air Force One and official helicopter Marine One, is being paid for. The President's jaunt has been attacked by the state Republican Party, who described Mr Obama as the 'Campaigner-in-Chief' and urged him to focus on 'job creation and economic growth' rather than November's election. Nice to meet you! Barack Obama shakes hands with 10-year-old Madeline Jennings at JFK airport . The eagle has landed: Mr Obama disembarking at JFK on his way to the $40,000-a-head dinner . Air Force One touched down at JFK airport shortly before 5pm on Monday, and Mr Obama shook the hands of young New Yorkers who had gathered on the runway to watch him arrive. He was then whisked to Manhattan on Marine One, before travelling by motorcade to the exclusive NoMad Hotel in the city's Flatiron District. There he addressed an audience of 60 wealthy donors around 8pm, in an event believed to have raised $2.4million for his election battle with Republican Mitt Romney. Mr Obama returned to Washington DC at 10pm. In the air: Mr Obama flies over the Brooklyn Bridge in his official helicopter, Marine One . Touching down: Marine One lands at the Wall Street helipad on Monday afternoon . During the dinner, the President told . donors he thought he was likely to win the election, but stressed the . need to keep up with Mr Romney's campaign spending. 'If the election were held today, I think it'd be close, but I think we'd win,' Mr Obama said. He described his administration's . efforts to boost the struggling economy but admitted: 'Right now, the . economy is still rough enough for enough people that this is going to be . a close election.' Mr Obama added that big-spending . super PACs 'are engaging in an experiment that we have not seen in . American democracy for quite some time. They are spending like nobody's . business and focusing on negative ads.' He said the Democrats do not have to . match that spending dollar-for-dollar, 'but we do have to make sure that . we can get our message out effectively.' Heading off: The President boards Air Force One at Andrews Air Force Base on his way to Manhattan . Leaving home: Mr Obama outside the Oval Office before his fundraising trip to New York on Monday . The President is required for security reasons to travel on official aircraft with a large Secret Service following. When he is campaigning, the Democratic Party usually reimburses the cost of the travel to the taxpayer. However, . in the past Mr Obama has frequently combined fundraising trips with his . official duties, meaning that the government shares the cost with his . campaign. Republicans . have been persistently critical of the President's fundraising schedule, . arguing that he should instead concentrate on boosting the economy. Home again: The President landed on the South Lawn of the White House as he returned to Washington . Ed Cox, chairman of the New York State Republican Party, said: 'Once again, we wish the President were here to discuss job creation and economic growth, but it appears he's ""got a lot on his plate"". 'It's been six months since President Obama's Jobs Council last met publicly - during which time he's attended well over 100 fundraisers and played 11 rounds of golf. 'Instead of focusing on creating jobs, the Campaigner-in-Chief is focused on saving his own with a $40,000 per person fundraiser tonight at a ritzy Manhattan hotel.' In June, Mr Obama went to Manhattan for a pair of campaign events which raised a total of $4.5million. One was hosted by Sarah Jessica Parker and Anna Wintour at the Sex and the City star's home, while another was at the Plaza Hotel and featured a performance by Mariah Carey.","Gridlock in New York after President touches down in Air Force One .

The wife of a disgraced Chinese diplomat accused of murdering a British businessman has 'already been found guilty' before her trial begins, analysts believe. Gu Kailai, 53, wife of the formerly popular politician Bo Xilai, is accused with an aide, Zhang Xiaojun, of killing 41-year-old Neil Heywood with poison in November last year. It is understood that they fell out over a money issue and the former lawyer believed the businessman, a long-time associate of the family, threatened her son’s safety. 'Guilty': Gu Kailai, wife of China's former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo, has already had her fate decided after being accused of killing British businessman Neil Heywood . But analysts have predicted that Mrs Gu's fate has already been decided before it reaches the Hefei court, The Daily Telegraph reported. The trial, which the Chinese government have not commented on, is now meant to work in 'reverse' - with the trial reflecting the already decided decision. Professor Willy Lam, a China expert from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told The Telegraph that he believed it would be practically 'impossible' for Mrs Gu's defence team to overturn the decision. The Telegraph reported that Chinese government sources implied Communist Party leaders were anxious about shows of public support for Mrs Gu’s husband, Mr Bo. The source said that Beijing will . send hundreds of security personnel and plainclothes police officers . around the Hefei Intermediate People’s Court in the Anhui province. However, because of her husband's position, experts predict she will not receive the death sentence, should she be found guilty. Disappearance: China's former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai (right) and his wife Gu Kailai (left) have not been since they were detained following the death of their long-term associate . British businessman Neil Heywood was initially thought to have died form alcohol abuse, but then officials began investigating and suspected poison could be involved . Bo Xilai, 63, the former Communist Party chief in the city of Chongqing who was once considered a strong contender for membership of the nine-member Politburo Standing Committee and possible future leader of the country. He was sacked from his position in March after allegations surfaced linking Mrs Gu to Mr Heywood's death, and he remains under investigation by the party over corruption claims. Mrs Gu was detained in mid-April and neither she or her husband have been seen since. Their son, Bo Guagua, 24, is believed to be in the United States after graduating from his master’s degree in public policy at Harvard earlier this year. Mr Heywood's death in a Chongqing hotel last November was initially ruled accidental, and put down to alcohol abuse, though friends said that Mr Heywood was not a big drinker. But murder suspicions came to the fore after a former Chongqing police chief visited a US consulate in China and divulged information allegedly linking Mrs Gu to Mr Heywood's death. It was later suspected that he might have died from cyanide poisoning. The case has convulsed China's political world ahead of the expected handover of power to a younger generation of leaders at the Communist Party's five-yearly National Congress in Beijing this autumn. UK diplomats have been given permission to attend the trial, it was disclosed today. The Foreign Office said British officials will attend the trial which begins on August 9 in the eastern city of Hefei. Pedestrians stand outside the Hefei City Intermediate People's Court in Hefei, Anhui province, where the government are reportedly anxious that people will protest at the trial . It is considered unusual for foreign observers to be granted access to such politically sensitive court cases in China. 'We can confirm that British diplomats will attend the trial,' said the Foreign Office. A spokesman said: 'The details of the ongoing investigation are a matter for the Chinese authorities. 'However we are glad to see that the Chinese authorities are continuing with the investigation into the death of Neil Heywood. We are dedicated to seeking justice for him and his family and we will be following developments closely.'","Wife accused of poisoning British businessman after he 'threatened her son's safety'

Feeling the pressure: Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy indicated the country could be on the verge of accepting a bailout . Spain is inching closer to a sovereign bailout to save its economy but the country is cagey about the prospect of harsh austerity measures like the ones introduced in crisis-hit Greece. Spanish Prime Miinister Mariano Rajoy indicated for the first time that the country could be ready to seek EU aid. However, he said he first wanted to know the conditions attached to such a deal and the form the rescue would take. At a news conference on Friday - the . first he has attended after the weekly cabinet meeting since he took . power in December - Rajoy said no decision could be taken until further . details are agreed. However, he said he was ready to do what is best for the country. Many analysts believe a bailout for . Spain is inevitable, but this is the first time Rajoy has publicly . acknowledged it. Even as recent as Thursday Rajoy avoided speaking on the matter. During a press appearance with Italian Prime Minister . Mario Monti, he three times declined to say whether he would seek aid . and trigger a concerted action of the European Central Bank and the . European Union rescue funds to bring down Spain's borrowing costs. However, he said today: 'I will do, as I always do, what I believe to be in the best interest of the Spanish people.' Referring to a comment made by European Central Bank . president Mario Draghi that the bank was examining non-conventional . measures to defend the euro, Rajoy said: 'We still don't know what these . measures are.' Riot police battle with protesters in Athens in the wake of Greece's economic meltdown. The country is having to take austere measures as part of the bailout deal . There were violent demonstrations in the Greek capital as the full extent of the economic crisis were revealed . He added: 'What I want to know is what these . measures are, what they mean and whether they are appropriate and, in . light of the circumstances, we will make a decision, but I have still . not taken any decision.' Last week independent auditors calculated that Spain's troubled banks could need as much as 62 billion euro - £50billion - in new capital. Deputy . Bank of Spain governor Fernando Restoy noted that this worst-case . scenario was far below the 100 billion euro fund that the 17 countries . that use the euro have made available to rescue Spain's banking sector, . which is struggling under toxic loans and assets.

Under . a policy document agreed between the three parties, the government will . also seek to extend unemployment benefits and limit public sector . lay-offs. The document . was submitted for approval at a meeting between the . leaders of the conservative New Democracy, Socialist PASOK, and . Democratic Left parties. It is likely a difficult negotiation with Greece's eurozone partners, in particular paymaster Germany, will take place.

Britain’s economy will soon grind to a halt and a recovery is still years away, the Bank of England warned yesterday. It slashed its growth forecast for the year to zero, partly due to the effect of ‘storm clouds’ in the eurozone. It predicted growth of 0.8 per cent as recently as May – revised down from the 2 per cent forecast made last year. Scroll down for video . Uncertain: The UK is struggling to recover ground lost when recession hit in 2008 - confirming a double-dip . As the Bank published its inflation . report, Governor Sir Mervyn King poured cold water on the prospect of an . interest rate cut from the historic low of 0.5 per cent. He said: ‘It is not going to make the difference between having a recovery and not having a recovery.’ Instead, . he urged eurozone leaders to get to grips with the debt crisis tearing . through the single currency bloc, describing it as ‘a black cloud of . uncertainty’ over the global economy. Gloom: Governor Sir Mervyn King said the economy will not grow during 2012 . ‘It’s a saga that goes on and on and . on,’ he said. ‘The idea that we have come to the end of it is . unrealistic. There is still a long way to go. 'Anyone . who pretends to know what’s going to happen in the euro area over the . next two or three years is simply not being realistic.’ A Treasury spokesman said the Bank cited the eurozone as ‘the biggest single threat to the UK recovery’. It comes as former deputy governor of . the Bank of England John Gieve told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that . the Bank should have done more, sooner, when the credit crunch struck . five years ago today. Last month the Bank of England injected an additional £50 billion into . the economy through its quantitative easing programme bringing the total . stock to £375billion . He said the Bank was slow to realise . that exceptional measures were needed, adding: 'We'd expected a . correction in the markets, not a total meltdown'. Meanwhile, Sir Mervyn admitted he has no idea when a robust recovery will finally get under way. ‘We will get back to the same growth . rates that we experienced before the crisis, but it’s quite impossible . to know over what time period,’ he said. The economy is ‘healing’ but it will be ‘a long, slow process’ and the full recovery ‘may lie some years ahead’, he added. Chancellor George Osborne said the . Government must give ‘110 per cent attention and effort and energy to . getting the economy moving’. David Cameron admitted Britain’s . plunge into its longest and deepest downturn for more than a century has . been ‘disappointing’, but added: ‘We just have to roll up our sleeves.’ Economists described yesterday’s . inflation report as one of the most depressing ever, with predictions of . economic growth peaking at just 2.25 per cent in 2014 and 2015. This is the lowest ‘peak forecast’ in the quarterly inflation reports since the Bank was granted independence in 1997. George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank, said: ‘This is a material shift in Bank of England thinking. 'The Bank is not confident that we are going to see a return to the growth levels seen before the crisis.’ Sir Mervyn, who retires next June, . said: ‘We are navigating through rough waters and storm clouds continue . to roll in from the euro area. Deflated: Rampant price rises have fallen away and the Bank now believes inflation will fall below target in the coming years . ‘Output has been at best broadly flat . over the past two years, and has continually disappointed expectations . of recovery. Unlike the Olympians who have thrilled us over the past . fortnight, our economy has not yet reached full fitness.’ However, he added that the squeeze on family finances was finally ‘coming to an end’ as the cost of living falls. The consumer price index measure of . inflation, which was as high as 5.2 per cent in September, has more than . halved to 2.4 per cent and will continue to drop, he said. The Bank’s report states that CPI is ‘more likely than not to be around or a little below target [2 per cent]’ for some time. Experts warned that . weaker-than-expected growth will force the Chancellor to borrow even . more than planned as tax receipts slump. Graeme Leach, chief economist at the . Institute of Directors, said: ‘If the Bank’s view on the economy comes . to pass, the Chancellor faces a very rough road with the public finances . as he tries to cut the deficit.’ Rachel Reeves, shadow chief secretary . to the Treasury, said: ‘It is clear that we cannot go on with the same . failing plan from this Government. 'The Chancellor’s policies aren’t only causing short-term pain, but long-term damage to our economy too.’ However, when asked if it was time . for the Government to ditch its attempts to tackle the deficit and adopt . a fiscal plan B, Sir Mervyn said: ‘No.’ The Bank’s report also opened the . door to a further round of quantitative easing, on top of the . £375billion it has already unleashed in a desperate bid to spark a . recovery.","Economy will soon grind to a halt and recovery is a long way off Bank warns .

Tory MP Aidan Burley used Twitter to criticise Friday night’s ceremony as ‘leftie multicultural c***’. But the Prime Minister said Mr Burley had confirmed his belief that Twitter could make politicians appear foolish as it encouraged them to put their unconsidered thoughts into the public domain, stating: ‘I did once say something about people who use Twitter, particularly politicians, and I think in this case I was absolutely spot on. I think what he said was completely wrong. It was an idiotic thing to say.’ The prime minister has called Aidan Burley's, right, criticism of the opening ceremony 'completely wrong' and 'idiotic' Cannock Chase MP Mr Burley, who was sacked last year as a ministerial aide after he took part in a Nazi-themed stag party, has since tried to say his comments were misunderstood. He insisted: ‘I was talking about the way it was handled in the show, not multiculturalism itself.’ Mr Cameron’s intervention drew criticism from other Tory backbenchers.Nadine Dorries tweeted: ‘If DC can keep quiet when his public school pals have expenses spotlight shone on them, should do the same when new backbencher messes up.’ Stewart Jackson said: ‘Surely PM should have risen above criticising his own MP re: Olympics opening ceremony?

Like, I didn’t agree and will be having a quiet word.’ Spectacular ceremony: Performers enact the work of the NHS and Great Ormond Street Hospital in front of the rising spectre of Lord Voldemort from the Harry Potter novels . Mr Cameron admitted yesterday that there were aspects of British life that people would have liked included in the ceremony that were absent but insisted: ‘We can’t all be art director.’ On a visit to the Olympic Park, he added: ‘I thought  that it was a brilliant effort to bring together our past, our future and the vibrancy of our country.’ When he was first shown the images of the Queen meeting James Bond at Buckingham Palace before appearing to parachute into the stadium, Mr Cameron said it brought a ‘tear to his eye’, adding: ‘It was every bit as good in its execution as it was in its creation.’ He added that he had known about the Queen’s spectacular role for some time, as he had seen her on the day of filming. Mr Cameron also denied claims that ministers had wanted to cut parts of the ceremony over fears its content was too Left-wing, saying: ‘It is not about politics. 'We all celebrate the NHS. We all think James Bond is fantastic. We all revere the Queen.’ But he revealed that he had discussed the ceremony with director Danny Boyle.

'A friend ran down and put him in the recovery position and he was still alive at that point. He wouldn’t have jumped though. I don’t know exactly what happened.' He added: 'I’ll just remember his cheeky smile, he was a really popular lad and it just shows with all the flowers which have been left here over the past three days. It’s such a shock, I still can’t get my head around it. ' Family friend John Flanagan, 51, said: 'I think he’d been dangling over the edge and hanging over and then when he’s tried to get back over he has lost his footing and fallen to the ground catching the fence underneath. It’s just been a tragic accident. Accident: Kyle was described as a 'good lad and a joker'. He fell from this parapet at 2am on Saturday morning . 'I just can’t believe it.

He had everything going for him, I still can’t believe it, I only saw him a few days ago and he was his usual happy self. 'He was never down, even if he was he’d never show it. He’s like to go out with his mates and there were loads of them. He was really popular. Happy family: Kyle (far left) when he was younger with his father Jimmy (centre) and other siblings . 'He’d just finished secondary school and was looking forward to what was next. He was going to college to study sport. He was really good at rugby and loved football too. 'I think he would have liked a career in rugby. My mum and dad are in pieces, they are with him every day at the hospital.' Another sister Leigh said: 'When we got the call it was 3am in the morning saying that Kyle had fallen. I felt sick to the stomach but I thought that he’d pull through. We went to the hospital and all his family was there. Friends: Lee Bailey, 16, Sean Dockerty, 18, Leighton Brown, 19, and Carlton Ellison, 18 with tributes on Kyle's favourite jumper.

A champion angler who suffers from narcolepsy has been forced to hire a minder to stop him from drowning. The disorder means Phil Hunt, 60 from Beechdale, Notts, can't stop himself from falling asleep. He has dozed off in public, in the back of taxis and once had to be fished out of a river after nodding off during an angling contest. Fisherman Phil Hunt from Nottingham has suffered narcolepsy since 2003 . Mr Hunt is so scared he'll drown the next time he tumbles into the water, he now wears a lifejacket on the riverbank and makes sure he's accompanied by a strong swimmer. The former university lecturer explained: 'People think I'm mad because the last place someone who falls asleep a lot should be near is water but I love fishing - it's my life. 'I take sensible precautions and always make sure I have a friend who can swim to keep an eye on me from the riverbank just in case. 'The other anglers sometimes wonder what's going on when I've clearly got a bite but I don't reel the fish in because I'm slumped asleep in my chair. 'I've only fallen in once which was more embarrassing than anything else. My mate soon pulled me out and I dried off and carried on fishing."" High price: The condition cost Mr Hunt his job as a university lecturer . Mr Hunt's condition means he has dozed through entire angling contests, but it hasn't stop him landing dozens of trophies for his club. But despite missing out on numerous big catches he has still landed dozens of trophies for his fishing club. Phil was diagnosed with narcolepsy in 2003 after he became hooked on prescription painkillers following a botched operation on his colon. The condition is sparked by strong emotions such as laughter, sadness or stress. Phil took up angling again in a bid to control his condition because of the relaxing nature of the sport. But after joining the Crown Inn fishing team in Beeston, Notts., Phil won dozens of competitions and is now their best angler. But his condition has had a debilitating effect on his private life and the strain ended his marriage of 12 years. On another occasion, Phil even fell asleep in the back of a taxi with his eyes open - causing the driver to rush him to hospital because he thought he was dead. He said: 'The driver couldn't wake me up and thought I was dead. I woke up when he was trying to wrestle me out of the taxi and into a hospital. 'He was shocked when I woke up in his arms with a start. But I explained I had narcolepsy and he took me home. 'He still charged me the extra fare though - I couldn't believe it.' He was even forced to quit his job as a university lecturer after he fell asleep in front of his students who believed he was drunk. Phil was trained to guard the Queen and patrolled in a bearskin at the trooping of the colour outside Buckingham Palace in the 1960s before serving in Northern Ireland. He retired in the 1990s and became a computing lecturer at Nottingham University until he was struck down with narcolepsy. Dr William Kinnear, a consultant physician at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: ""It is a very rare but fascinating disease which blurs the line between dreams and consciousness. 'The cause of the disorder has been linked to the lack of a hormone in the brain called hypocretin. There are effective drugs on the market to help with this very rare disorder.'","Phil Hunt has suffered the disorder since 2003 .

Two people have been killed and at least seven others remain missing after three Ugandan helicopter gunships crashed into Kenya's highest mountain in bad weather. The Russian-built Mi-24 'Hind' helicopters were travelling to Somalia to help fight al-Qaida-linked . militants when they crashed on Sunday. Rescue workers today recovered two dead bodies and continue to search for at least seven soldiers and airmen around the crash sites in the rugged landscape of Mount Kenya. Scroll down for video . Survivor: Lt. Col. Chris Kasiji, a senior Ugandan air force pilot lies next to the wreckage of his helicopter which crashed into Kenya's highest mountain on Sunday . Simon Gitau, deputy warden of Mt. Kenya National Park, said rescue workers saw two bodies outside of one . helicopter that crashed and burned. He said he did not know if other . bodies were inside the wreckage. 'We did not search through the wreckage because it was still burning and smoldering,' Gitau said. Five personnel were rescued from a second crash site discovered on Tuesday, Gitau said. A third Ugandan military helicopter . that crashed was found on Monday and the occupants rescued. No one was . killed in that crash that wrecked the aircraft beyond repair and only . one injury was reported. Wreckage: Three heavily armed Russian-built MI-24 'Hind' gunships crashed in rugged terrain on Sunday . A total of four Ugandan military helicopters were en route to Somalia to fight al-Qaida-linked militants . Search-and-rescue teams reached . one of the crash sites Tuesday at around 12,000 feet up Mount Kenya, . said Brigadier Francis Ogolla, the commander of Kenya's Laikipia Air . Base near Mount Kenya. He told a press conference that the other . helicopter was spotted from the air at the edge of a cliff. Ogolla said the helicopters had taken . off in formation from Laikipia Air Base at around 4:50 p.m. on Sunday . en route to the northern Kenya town of Garissa, where the helicopters . were to refuel before proceeding to Somalia. One hour later only one . helicopter landed in Garissa and the pilot said he had lost . communication with the other three, Ogolla said. Weather around Mount Kenya- Africa's . second tallest peak at 5,199 meters (17,057 feet) - can be erratic. Heavy clouds and wind would be common this time of year, with . precipitation coming in the form of rain or snow. The three helicopters that crashed were Mi-24 gunships. The fourth helicopter that landed safely was an Mi-17. Ugandan . President Yoweri Museveni ordered an investigation to be led by his . brother - a retired army general - in a sign of how serious Ugandan . authorities are taking the loss of lives. Neither . Kenyan nor Ugandan authorities could yet say why three of four military . helicopters making the trip crashed. Ugandan officials said preliminary . information indicated that bad weather was responsible. Mount . Kenya - Africa's second-highest peak - has been shrouded in clouds even . as rescuers tried to locate the wreckage from Sunday's crashes. One . point to be investigated will be whether the pilots took the wrong . flight path. Concerns were raised in Uganda that the well-trained crew . flew too close to Mount Kenya. A Ugandan official insisted that there . was nothing wrong with the helicopters. Rescue workers tend to a survivor at one of the crash sites approximately 12,000 feet up Mount Kenya . Bad weather was reported around Mount Kenya- Africa's second tallest peak - at the time of the crash . The three helicopters that crashed were Russian made Mi-24 gunships. A fourth helicopter that landed safely was an Mi-17 transporter . 'They were inspected... and found to be airworthy,' Jeje Odongo, Uganda's deputy minister of defense, said of the Russian Mi-24 helicopters. Odongo said that all the crew had been trained by the U.N. and that 'they all passed the competence tests' before flying out of Uganda. Odongo said the trip to Somalia had been planned three months in advance and that the aircraft have been used over the years for missions, including the hunt for the notorious rebel leader Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army. Kenyan wildlife rangers and army soldiers carry a dead body from one of the crash sites . A Ugandan government spokesman said the trip to Somalia had been planned three months in advance. He insisted the helicopters were in good condition and had recently passed safety tests . The unexplained crashes will set back efforts by a multinational African force to battle Islamist militant group, al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaida. The U.N. Security Council in February approved funds for nine transport helicopters and three attack helicopters to be used by African Union forces in Somalia. The AU troops have been fighting al-Shabab for years without the use of helicopters. The Ugandan military forms the bulk of the African Union forces in Somalia. Ugandan and Burundian forces pushed al-Shabab out of Mogadishu about a year ago. Helicopters will further aid their counterinsurgency efforts. Kenya and Burundi have also dispatched to troops to fight al-Shabab, which neighboring countries view as a regional threat. The Islamist militants are now concentrated in the southern coast town of Kismayo, which is likely to be the next scene of serious fighting. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, when longtime dictator Siad Barre was ousted by warlords who then turned on each other.

But a survey has revealed one in three think their local doctors are now so busy that they could be misdiagnosed. The poll suggests these fears are well-placed with a quarter saying they had been wrongly diagnosed or knew someone who had been over the past five years. However, only 56 per cent of those currently registered with a GP said they would be confident enough to challenge their doctor if they thought they were wrong. Unconvinced by the diagnosis? Nearly half of those surveyed said they wouldn't challenge their GP if they thought they were wrong . Young adults were surprisingly even less likely to challenge their GP, with 64 per cent of 18 to 24 year-olds saying they wouldn't feel confident enough to speak up. 'We’re all aware that GPs are under pressure; they are often overstretched and despite the level of skill that exists in this field, probably only have the capacity retain around 200 conditions and diseases in their memory out of the many thousands that exist, said Jason Maude, founder of Isabel Healthcare, which commissioned the survey of more than 2,000 adults. 'This research suggests that there is a need to support and better equip both GPs and patients to help achieve a quicker and more accurate diagnosis through more effective communication and collaboration.' The average GP consultation in England lasts just seven minutes, so to save time doctors advise patients to try get to the point quickly and be truthful - however embarrassing this may feel. They also suggest you do some research at home but to arrive with a one-page summary of your findings rather than reams of information. To this end Isabel Healthcare has developed an online symptom checker that allows patients to research possible diagnoses based on their symptoms. Isabel Healthcare claim their symptom checker is 95 per cent accurate compared to 50 per cent for 'Dr Google' The designers say the checker works by searching a database of 6,000 diseases and is far more accurate than Google in predicting an illness. So searching for the symptoms - 'itchiness', 'back ache' and 'red rash' suggests drug allergy, contact dermatitis and Lyme Disease. Clicking on the condition takes you to other online sources with extra information, helping you to eliminate unlikely causes. Sir Graeme Catto, President of the College of Medicine and former President of the GMC, said: 'During my time as President of the GMC, I saw many cases of unfortunate diagnostic error. 'With so many conditions and diseases that can be easily missed when assessing patients, there is a critical need for modern technology such as the Isabel Symptom Checker to help patients better understand the possible diagnoses that could be causing their symptoms and work in collaboration with their GPs.'

Missing schoolgirl 12-year-old Tia Sharp's body was found in her grandmother's house, but why did it take seven days to find it? Police have admitted 'human error' meant officers failed to discover the body of Tia Sharp in her grandmother's house one week after her disappearance. More than 100 officers were assigned to the case, yet had no success in locating her for seven days, even though she was found in Christine Sharp's house - the first location the police were called to. Day after day the police searches saw little progress, even the addition of highly-trained sniffer dogs, who were brought into the house, failed to find any trace the 12-year-old. The blunders have caused a wave of criticism of the police who today apologised to Tia's mother for their handling of the case. In a statement South-East London Area Commander Neil Basu said: 'An early review has been conducted and . it is now clear that human error delayed the discovery of the body . within the house. 'We have apologised to Tia's mother that our procedures . did not lead to the discovery of the body on this search.' He told the press conference at New Scotland Yard today: 'It is important that we explain more about the circumstances of the searches. 'Four scene examinations were conducted of the property. The first followed immediately from the missing person report that was received on Friday 4 August. An initial visit was made to assess the situation and examine the property. This visit was not regarded or viewed as a full search of the property. 'The second visit was a full search of the property with the consent of the occupiers. This was conducted on 5 August over a period of two hours. All parts of the premises were searched including the location where a body was discovered, five days later, on Friday 10 August.' 'A third visit was undertaken on 8 August. This was not a search, but the attendance of a body recovery dog to assist the investigation team in their enquiries. 'It is not appropriate to comment further on aspects of the criminal investigation currently being conducted but our investigation was such that it was decided that a further intrusive search needed to be undertaken - it was that search, yesterday, which resulted in the discovery. 'On behalf of the Metropolitan Police I apologise for the distress and concern this delay will have caused.' Specially-trained sniffer dogs were brought into Tia Sharp's grandmother's house to help find clues. Yet they did not find her body until two days after the dogs were used . Christine Sharp's house, the eventual scene of Tia's body, was searched on several occasions by forensic officers . Neighbours . in the New Addington estate where Tia lived have already expressed . their disappointment in the police's performance, saying they felt let . down. Retired . Scotland Yard Commander John O'Connor is the most senior figure so far . to go public with criticism of the way the case has been handled. 'The police should have gone into that house quicker. Clearly Hazell should have been treated as a suspect from the off. he was the last person to see Tia alive,' he told The Sun. 'if police have enough evidence to bring in sniffer dogs, then they have enough evidence to pull the place apart. It's unforgiveable they didn't do that.' 'You can't rely on a dog - you need human beings. They haven't done very well. That child should have been found much quicker.' The alarm was first raised over Tia's disappearance on the evening of Friday August 3 when she did not appear for her dinner. The police, some diverted from Olympics duty, with the help of local residents, began searching the local area on Saturday 4 August. A whole hoard of police were involved in looking for Tia, with some even pulled off Olympics duty to find her . Police teams searched bins in the area of Tia Sharp's disappearance and stopped local collections taking place . On Sunday 5 August a pair of glasses were found in a nearby street which was cordoned off. The glasses were later discounted. Monday saw police begin to look through CCTV footage of of trams and buses between New Addington and Croydon, where Hazell said Tia was headed. The next day saw specialist police search woodland known as Birchwood, The search included garages, sheds, outhouses, and a local school. Refuse collections were then withdrawn in the local area to help the search. Sniffer dogs were sent into Christine Sharp's house on Wednesday 8 August, specially trained to detect blood and evidence of composition. It was on this day when Hazell was interviewed as a witness. The search returned to Christine Sharp's house on Friday 10 August, and this was when the body was eventually found. VIDEO: So many forensic officers outside the house...

The father of a gifted student who died after being chased into the path of a bus by a gang told of his fury yesterday as three yobs were cleared of killing him. Ezekiel Amosu, 17, fled in terror after being confronted by hooded thugs armed with wooden planks and bricks who allegedly attempted to steal his mobile phone as he walked home from a piano lesson. The A-level student, who dreamed of studying music at Oxford University, attempted to outrun them as the gang gave chase throwing rocks at him. A 17-year-old boy was accused of sticking out a foot to trip up Mr Amosu, causing him to fall into the path of a bus after one of the other attackers yelled: 'Stop him'. The church-going teenager was crushed under the wheels of the bus and died instantly on January 24 last year. But this week the 17-year-old defendant was cleared of manslaughter after claiming that the victim ran into him and tripped up by accident. Two other teenagers aged 13 and 16 were also cleared at the Old Bailey, while two boys aged 16 and 17 were convicted of manslaughter. Yesterday the victim's father Bon Amosu, 70, said the family were devastated by the verdicts. He paid tribute to his son, who was in the top sets for his A-levels at Leyton Sixth Form College and had ambitions to study music at Oxford, following in the footsteps of his sister Rachel, who won a Fulbright scholarship to Washington University after graduating from Oxford. She now lives in Rio de Janeiro, where she has launched a successful music career. Mr Amosu said: 'We are not looking for revenge, vengeance belongs to God, but we were looking for a deterrent. 'A deterrent would have meant taking them off the streets and putting them in prison. In prison they would at least have had a chance to change their ways and rethink their lives. 'Instead three of them will be back out on the streets and they will probably do something like this again because they think they can get away with it. Forensic officers examine the scene where Ezekiel was hit by a bus in Forest Road, Walthamstow, east London . 'I feel sorry for the next family who go through what we have been through. 'In a way I feel sorry for those boys. One of them was just 13, what an age to live like that.' He told the Evening Standard: 'Next month he would be going to university. 'He had set his heart on that and I have no doubt he was going to succeed. He was the youngest of my children and the tallest, he was great fun to be around, and we will never forget him. 'I do not believe that those boys wanted to kill Ezekiel, but their actions resulted in his death. 'But they are the losers. Ezekiel would have made music they would have enjoyed, but now they haven't got that. Now there's only silence.' Prosecutors alleged that the gang had tried to mug the victim and his friends, but the defendants were cleared of attempted robbery. The bus that hit the teen as he tried to escape from the gang who had chased him . Ezekiel's friend who is now 18, described the moment they were attacked in Walthamstow, East London. He said: 'They were asking Ezekiel questions, and the one with the plank goes, “ah, I feel like a bully” and asked Ezekiel what phone has he got, and the other two were kind of hyping it - just trying to big it up. 'Then I ran because I was panicking - I just ran. 'When I got home I got a phone call saying one of them guys pushed Ezekiel in front of a bus.' The victim, who loved music and basketball, was described by friends as the 'kindest guy known to anyone' in tributes on Facebook after his death. The first trial collapsed in January this year when a 13-year-old prosecution witness texted the defendants to arrange to change his evidence. A forensic officer kneels down to examine the side of the bus. Ezekiel died 'almost instantaneously' It emerged that he had also told his stepmother that he agreed the robbery could go ahead if he got a 'cut' of the proceeds. On Monday, the 13-year-old was cleared of manslaughter, two charges of attempted robbery and perverting the course of justice but was convicted of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. A 17 year-old boy was convicted of manslaughter and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. He was cleared of two charges of attempted robbery and perverting the course of justice. A second 17-year-old, who was accused of tripping up Ezekiel, was cleared of manslaughter and walked free from court. A 16-year-old was convicted of manslaughter but acquitted of two charges of attempted robbery, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perverting the course of justice. Another 16 year-old was acquitted of manslaughter, two charges of attempted robbery, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and perverting the course of justice. The three convicted youths, who cannot be named for legal reasons, will be sentenced next month.","A-level student Ezekiel Amosu was hit by bus after being chased by the thugs in January last year .

Jaguar Land Rover has created 1,000 new jobs by shifting its Merseyside factory to 24 hour production to meet soaring foreign demand for its vehicles. The Indian-owned firm will introduce a night shift at the Halewood plant beginning Monday bringing its total number of workers to 4,500 -  three times the number employed there just three years ago. More than 30,000 people are understood to have applied for the new posts with trial night shifts already underway. Jobs boost: Land Rover has created 1,000 jobs at its Merseyside plant on the back of soaring foreign demand for models including the Range Rover Evoque which was designed in collaboration with Victoria Beckham . Demand from abroad for the company's Evoque and Freelander models has soared with more than 80 per cent of the vehicles made at the firm's three UK factories now being exported to China, Brazil and Russia. The Evoque, a small 4x4, which was designed in collaboration with Victoria Beckham, has been particularly successful with nearly 90,000 already sold since it went into production last year. The model is particularly popular in China, where a rapidly expanding middle class has fuelled demand for foreign-built luxury cars. Owners hope the introduction of the night shift will greatly reduce waiting times and boost profits. Halewood Operations Director, Richard Else, said: 'Our new recruits have worked hard during their assessments and extensive induction training. 'Many have also worked a number of trial night shifts during July, to ensure we get off to a great start today. 'I am delighted to welcome our new colleagues as they come on-board to help us meet customer demand for the Range Rover Evoque and Land Rover Freelander. 'Moving production to three shifts and working 24 hours a day will allow us to significantly reduce the time a customer has to wait for their new Range Rover Evoque.' A night shift at the Halewood factory will start next week with over 30,000 people applying for the new posts .

Raymond Roth, 47, the man who is believed to have faked his own drowning to claim the life insurance policy, was arrested again for calling his estranged wife after being released from jail. Evana Roth filed a restraining order against her husband after he reappeared following a massive search at Jones Beach, where he was last seen entering the water for a swim on July 28. Police spent thousands of dollars searching for him, only to find him driving on a South Carolina highway. He was arrested and released on $100,000 bail, ordered not to make contact with Mrs Roth. He disobeyed the court order, allegedly phoning Mrs Roth repeatedly from an anonymous number and whispering 'You know who this is' to his terrified wife. Roth's attorney claims the man was just looking to discuss the sale of their house. Arrested: Raymond Roth is escorted by law enforcement officers after being arrested after he allegedly faked his own drowning at a New York beach in a scheme to collect on a life insurance policy . Hurt: Roth's wife Evana said she has received numerous phone calls from him despite court order of protection . 'It's like having a ghost call,' Leonard Leeds, Mrs Roth's attorney told the MailOnline. 'She was horrified. She's terrified. Obviously, this is somebody unpredictable. You think you're married one day and the next day that person is a total stranger.' Roth surrendered to police at South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, Long Island, yesterday. He pleaded not guilty to charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident. After posting $100,000 bail, he went home and promptly phoned his wife, despite court order specifically prohibiting him from doing so. Mrs Roth, who has been overwhelmed by the dramatic events that have unfolded in  the past few weeks, answered a call from an anonymous number, thinking it was a friend or family member. 'She said ""Who is this?""'  her attorney, Mr Leeds, told the MailOnline. 'He said, ""You know who this is,"" and she hung up.' Roth then called the house at least three more times, Mr Leeds said, leaving his wife bewildered and afraid. Up for sale: Roth had put his Long Island home on the market days before he faked his death and was allegedly calling about the sale . Scrum: He was arrested at a hospital where he was receiving psychiatric treatment for depression . Cost: Tens of thousands of dollars were wasted searching for Roth at Jones Beach, Long Island . 'It was eerie, I was scared and I started to shake,' Mrs Roth told the New York Post. 'She went from mourning him to fearing him,' Mr Leeds said. The two have been married for 12 years. Mrs Roth has filed for divorce since the incident. But Brian Davis, Roth's attorney, said that his client just wanted to discuss the sale of their home and had no intention of harassing Mrs Roth. 'She went from mourning him to fearing him.'Evana Roth's attorney, Leonard Leeds . Voicemails obtained by the Post appear to indicate that that was the nature of at least one call. 'Um I’m just calling to tell you, you know I still love you. And I know you still love me,' Roth said to her voicemail. 'We do have a house to sell. We need to get together on the subject or sell it or let the bank take it -- one way or another.' Despite the evidence, Mr Roth plead not guilty to charges of criminal contempt and posted bond at $10,000. Charges: Roth was arraigned on Wednesday afternoon on charges of insurance fraud, conspiracy to commit insurance fraud and falsely reporting an incident . 'Scheme': Roth's son Jonathan, left, and his attorney Joey Jackson after his appearance in court on Tuesday on charges that he helped his father to fake his death. Jonathan claims he was coerced . He was reported missing by his son on . July 28 at Jones Beach. The elder Roth was later reported to be in . Florida and got a speeding ticket in South Carolina. His son, 22-year-old Jonathan, was arrested last week. According to court documents, the pair conspired to get more than $50,000 in life insurance money. But Mr Davis said his client was not aware of an insurance scam and blamed the man's son. 'My client's intent was to disappear, not to cash in on a life insurance policy,' Mr Davis said. He added that Jonathan Roth is the one who tried to cash in on the policy just days after reporting his father's disappearance. 'It was never my client's intent to make a claim,' he said. Days after his disappearance, Raymond Roth was reported to be at a resort in Orlando, Florida and on August 2, he was stopped driving at 90 mph in Santee, South Carolina. When police ran his name, they saw he was listed as missing, but Roth said he was driving back to New York and the officer let him continue. Found: Roth left his shoes, wallet, clothing and phone on the beach when attempting to fake his death . Caught: More than a week after his disappearance, Roth was pulled over for speeding in South Carolina . But he failed to show up to a scheduled meeting with police and his attorney claimed he had in fact been admitted to hospital with depression. Jonathan Roth, 22, is free on $10,000 bond. He has pleaded not guilty to conspiracy to commit insurance fraud, filing a false report and other charges. Court papers show he 'was fully aware that his father never walked into the water and had in fact driven off in his own personal vehicle'.. He faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty. The younger Roth's attorney, Joey Jackson, said his client and his father had a 'strained' relationship and claims he was coerced into going along with the scheme - which Mr Davis has denied. He also claimed he feared for his life after his father left him a threatening voicemail when the scandal went public. 'Listen, tough guy. You say you’ve been to the Marines and you can kill and everything else. When I get back, you are gonna do just that. One of us is going to die,' Roth allegedly said. Raymond Roth's wife, Evana, said her husband had not told her of the scheme, and handed over emails she found on the family computer that implicated her stepson. In one dated the day before he vanished, the elder Roth told his son to contact him at an Orlando resort to update him on developments following his disappearance. 'This is a terrible nightmare that I just want to wake up from,’ said 43-year-old Evana last week. 'Why did he do this? I think I’m just numb.’ Raymond Roth had put the family's home up for sale just days before he vanished, and Evana Roth also said her husband had recently been fired from his job in New York City. Police estimated that an air and sea search for Roth cost tens of thousands of dollars.","Raymond Roth disappeared on July 28 during swim with son in Long Island .

But the usually serene chess community has been rocked by allegations that a mother and her three schoolboy sons, representing England at a European youth tournament, were subjected to a barrage of racial abuse. Even worse, the abuse is alleged to have come from members of the English delegation who were supposed to be supporting Muslim player Yousuf bin-Suhayl, 13, and his brothers Ibraheem, 10, and Ieysaa, aged seven. Yesterday the siblings’ parents, Sohale . Rahman and Tomasina Contu, told how tensions became so heated the family . had to be escorted back to their hotel by police. Claims: Ieysaa bin-Suhayl (left), his brother Ibraheem (second from left), mother Tomasina Contu (second from right) and other brother Yousuf were allegedly abused during a chess tournament . The English Chess Federation is now probing the astonishing claims of physical, verbal and racist abuse at the European Union Youth Championships in Mureck, Austria last week. It is claimed that two parents of other English children in the tournament were harassing and abusing Miss Contu in the stands. One of those involved is said to have forcefully grabbed Yousuf by the chest, causing him to bleed. The family, from Marshland St James, Norfolk, had travelled to central Europe so the three boys could represent their country in the chess competition during their school holidays. Mr Rahman, 43, also said that the boys were not provided halal food, as requested before the competition, and were given cold boiled eggs and ‘bits of bread’ to eat while other team members indulged in a buffet. The English Chess Federation is now probing the astonishing claims of racist behaviour within the usually serene game community. Mr Rahman said: ‘I pleaded with the English Chess Federation (ECF) to take action for the security of my family but in vain. We believe the ECF has failed in their duty of care.’ The ECF have said they are taking the allegations very 'seriously'. Andrew Farthing, ECF chief executive, said: “We are aware of certain allegations which have been made concerning the behaviour of some of the members of the English delegation at this tournament. ‘The federation is taking the situation very seriously and are investigating if there is any truth in the allegations and witness statements are currently being sought.’ Mr Rahman, said his wife and eldest son Yousuf bin-Suhayl, 13, cannot sleep properly after being ‘bullied’ at the championships. Tournament: The brothers were allegedly abused at a chess competition held in Mureck, Austria . They spent the whole trip, which cost the family £3,000, sat at a separate table from the rest of the English party as they were always drinking alcohol. He believes Yousuf, who got an A* in A Level maths at the age of 12, should have won the competition, but he came third. He said: ‘My wife and eldest son cannot sleep - they are traumatised. It was bullying. ‘The other parents said my wife was not educated because she chooses to cover her head. ‘They told her to F*** off. They would stand in front of her. And ask ‘where do you think you are going?’. ‘They set out to intimidate her. ‘One parent said ‘what is that stench’ after she had walked into the room. He added: ‘She was stuck because the people she was trying to complain about where socialising with the people she needed to complain to.’ The worst incident was when a mother grabbed Yousuf on his chest leaving bleeding nail marks. Mr Rahman said: ‘That is child abuse. All he did was walk around her.’ Mr Rahman said no Halal food had been arranged for his family or provisions for them to eat at times to fit in with Ramadan fasting. He said: 'The first day at dawn there was no food. And the place where the food was kept was locked.’ He added: ‘My wife and I felt helpless as parents being unable to feed our children.’ He has complained to British police and Norfolk Police are arranging to take a statement from him. He said: 'We just want justice.' A spokesman from the English Chess Federation said: The ECF has completed a thorough investigation into the events that took place at the European Union Youth Chess Championships in Mureck, Austria. 'The investigation obtained statements from eye-witnesses.  It concluded that the allegations of racist or Islamophobic abuse and of a physical attack are unfounded. The report found that there was a disagreement amongst the families of the England team that resulted from complaints of perceived disruptive behaviour by individual children.  There is no evidence that racism or religious intolerance played any part. 'The claims concerning provision of suitable food during the event are inconsistent with both the facts and the extensive efforts made by the tournament organisers, hotel management and ECF Head of Delegation to ensure that the requirements of all members of the England delegation were met. 'The ECF takes any charge of racism or religious intolerance extremely seriously and we absolutely condemn discriminatory behaviour of any kind. The ECF is also committed to the safety of all competitors who take part in tournaments at home and abroad.'","Yousuf bin-Suhayl, 13, and his brothers Ibraheem, 10, and Ieysaa, aged seven, were abused while representing England, it is alleged .

A representative of the Jordanian government, counsellor Rulan Samara from the London embassy, told the court: 'His majesty the King of Jordan (King Abdullah the Second) was inquiring about the matter and was asking about all the details.' Three members of the Jordanian Paralympic squad charged with sex offences will not be taking part in the Games, organisers have confirmed. The three men – two wheelchair power lifters, including a bronze medallist from the Beijing Games, and a trainer – are accused of sexual assault and voyeurism against women and girls during a training camp in Northern Ireland. Earlier this week a court granted the men bail with sureties of £5,500 each, enabling them to travel to London to compete. But Locog said today that the Jordanian Paralympic Committee had withdrawn the men from their team for London 2012. Omar Sami Qaradhi, 31, Faisal Hammash, 35, and Motaz Al Junaidi, 45, all members of the Jordanian power-lifting squad, are now returning to Jordan after the country’s king began looking into the case. ‘We have been informed by the Jordanian National Paralympic Committee that they will not be entering the athletes in question into the London 2012 Paralympic Games,’ said a Locog spokewoman. ‘The athletes have returned to Jordan.’ The three team members are flying to the Jordanian capital, Amman, today. The men are due back in court in Northern Ireland on October 18. Motaz Al Junaidi, 45, who won bronze at the Paralympics in Beijing, is accused of sexual assault. Team-mate Omar Sami Qaradhi, 31, faces three charges of sexual assault, two against a child, and one of voyeurism after allegedly entering a women’s changing room at the Antrim Forum leisure centre where the squad was training. Police said he was identified by a girl aged 14, who claimed that on August 18 she posed for photos with him before he groped her between the legs in Antrim town centre. Trainer Faisal Hammash, 35, is accused of inciting two girls to engage in sexual activity. Mr Cahir said he was merely photographing the girls in the Antrim area.

Accused: Trainer Faisal Hammash (back with hood) was arrested along with Omar and Motaz in Antrim on Monday night . Applying for bail, Tony Cahir, solicitor for the three accused, said Al Junaidi was born with polio. Mr Cahir said Qaradhi had not had any legs since birth and was incapable of sexual gratification. The three were released on combined . bail and sureties of £5,500 each after appearing at Coleraine . Magistrates’ Court in Co Londonderry. They have to make weekly contact with the Jordanian embassy in London before their next appearance in court. In granting bail, district judge . Richard Wilson said he accepted the argument that the embarrassment . should they fail to reappear in court would outweigh the resulting . financial loss. He added: ‘I trust the assurances that have been given to me by the ambassador are such that that would not be required.’ The Jordanian team has been training . in Antrim, about 22 miles from Belfast, in advance of the Paralympic . Games starting next week. Arriving for hearing: Omar (left) was allegedly identified by a girl aged 14 who claimed that on August 18 she posed for photos with him before he groped her between the legs, while one of the alleged victims made claims against Motaz (right) after police had begun their investigation and several days after the disputed incident .

The Jordanian delegation arrived in . Northern Ireland on August 8. The alleged offences took place between . last Thursday and Monday. The Jordan Paralympic Committee said it felt ‘regret and shock’ at the charges but that they had confidence the defendants would get a . fair hearing. But following the accusations, the Jordanian Paralympic Committee said it would not have been appropriate for them to have taken part in London 2012. 'The president and board of the Jordanian Paralympic Committee (JPC) decided that, although the case will not be heard again in court until October 18, it would be inappropriate for the accused athletes to compete at the London 2012 Paralympic Games, so they will be sent home to Amman,' said a committee statement. It added: 'We have a zero tolerance on any misconduct and will continue to work closely with the Northern Ireland authorities to assist in their investigation.

The 55-year-old, a keen naturist who holidays at clubs for those of a similar inclination, defended his hobby yesterday, saying there was nothing anti-Christian about it. Scroll down for video . Taking a leaf out Prince Harry's book?: Reverend Bob Horrocks is both a Church of England vicar and a practising naturist. The Bolton-based 55-year-old will appear in a TV documentary about attitudes towards the naked human body. ‘If someone sees a body uncovered, people think that’s somehow sexualised and they shouldn’t be looking at it,’ he said. ''They snigger - they are made to feel uncomfortable because it’s not part of their normal existence. ‘So much of advertising is persuading . people they are not sufficient in themselves, and yet God has gifted us . with the bodies we have.’ The reverend, the vicar of Seven . Saints, Farnworth, Bolton, discovered naturism after straying on to a . nudist beach while on holiday on the Canary Island of Fuerteventura six . years ago. Naked before God: Reverend Horrocks says the Bible doesn't condemn but celebrate nakedness. ‘I felt set free. But then, being a . Church minister, I thought, “Is this right?” I researched the Bible and I . found there was a lot of positive stuff – there is nothing condemning . simple nakedness. 'It was part of life at the time of Jesus. It’s something I would’ve loved to have discovered when I was a lot younger.' But parishioners with a more traditional approach to clothing won’t find the vicar in the nude. ‘I mostly enjoy naturism on holiday,’ he said. ‘The English climate doesn’t lend itself too well to it!’ Mr Horrocks volunteered to take part in a TV documentary as chair of the Christian Naturist Fellowship.

She may have been just three and at the helm of a toy boat, but the same wistful gaze to the horizon is plain to see. As this picture taken in 1953 shows, Princess Anne’s love of sailing began at a young age. Earlier this week, the Daily Mail revealed the princess is indulging her passion for all things nautical by splashing out £500,000 on a bespoke yacht. Playtime: A three-year-old Princess Anne pictured at the helm of her toy boat on a trip to Malta in 1953 . The photo of the young princess was taken in Malta aboard HMS Gambia when the Queen and Prince Philip paid a visit with Anne and Prince Charles. Bernard Weeks, 78, then a leading seaman in the ship, kept a copy as a souvenir. He said: ‘We built two wooden boats and the children had a great time pedalling up and down on deck. We also dressed up as pirates and threw a birthday party for Charles.’ Princess Anne and her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence are investing in a Rustler 44 yacht. The princess has yet to reveal the name of the customised vessel, which is believed to have been built to exacting specifications and include twin cabins, a large galley and lounge areas. The real thing: Anne with her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence on the high seas . Keen sailor: Princess Anne has always loved sailing, competing in various races including the British Steel Challenge in 1992 (pictured). She also won the 1971 European Eventing Championship in her recently sold boat . Her last yacht was called Blue Doublet after the horse that carried her to victory in the 1971 European Eventing Championship. It seems unlikely, though, that she will name the new vessel after her daughter Zara’s horse High Kingdom, which helped her to a silver medal during the Olympics. An associate of the princess revealed: ‘It will be called something very Scottish. Anne loves Scotland and wanted a name that celebrated a part of the world that she adores.’ Princess Anne and her husband spend most of their holidays cruising around Scotland, where their new yacht will be moored. The princess is also a keen pharologist – someone who studies lighthouses – and has vowed to see every one in the country. Royal's latest purchase: Princess Anne bought a new Rustler 44 yacht similar to this one but is yet to reveal the name of the customised vessel . In time for Olympic celebration: Anne and husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence will have the boat in time to celebrate daughter Zara Phillip's Olympic achievement, winning silver in in the equestrian team event . Her old yacht, a Rustler 36 which was on . the market for more than eight months, was recently sold for a sum . believed to be not far short of its £95,000 asking price. The Blue Doublet came with a bill of . sale signed by the couple and a brass plaque acknowledging that the . yacht was bought for the Princess Royal. It has a tiny galley kitchen . and a white plastic toilet. But it won’t be going far – its new . owners are believed to be planning to keep it near its old berth in . Ardfern, Argyll, where Princess Anne will moor her new vessel, as they . live in the area. The ‘beautifully cared for and . professionally maintained’ yacht  failed to attract a single bid in the . first six months after it went on sale. At the time, Simon Jones, a director . of Rustler Yachts, told the Daily Mail that Princess Anne’s teak yacht, . with blue velour furnishings, was a good investment.

Mr White estimated that Maureen Tritto has worked at the lanes for the last two years while her Facebook page listed her working behind the Gennaro's snack bar counter since 2008. Any sign of the couple having a troubled marriage was disguised from both their Facebook pages by Wednesday night. Maureen Tritto described herself on her own page with: 'fabulous husband ... gorgeous children .... incredible job .... amazing family ... that's life in a nut shell ... and I'm loving it!!!!' Life together: Pictured at his birthday, the couple appear to show no sign of previous foul play between them with Maureen Tritto describing him as a fabulous husband . 'I go in for coffee a lot; she's really nice,' local bowler Wilbur Koenig told SILive.com. He said he arrived to the scene just in time to witness Armando Tritto's vehicle pealing out of the parking lot. 'I walked in there and somebody said Maureen's husband shot her,' Mr Koenig said. Frank WIlkinson whose family owns the bowling alley told the paper that there were only three staff members present during the incident. Dozens of police cars responding to the scene scanned the entire building for any other potential threats left behind. Speaking with NewYork1, a Rab's Country Lanes employee called the shooting an isolated domestic issue. 'Thankfully nobody was in the building, nobody was hurt and, you know . what, the community knows we're here. We really appreciate our family . and those that come around ... We're . all about safety and we provide a safe environment and that's what . we're about.'","Armando Tritto entered bowling alley on Staten Island, New York, firing at least three shots toward his estranged wife working at the snack bar .

"By . Leon Watson . PUBLISHED: . 13:57 EST, 30 August 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 14:00 EST, 30 August 2012 . A police officer accused of attacking his pregnant ex-girlfriend told a close friend he had only been in the relationship for sex, a court heard today. PC Paul Perdrisat said fellow PC Matthew Cherry was annoyed Caroline Craft fell pregnant despite being on the pill. The jury heard Cherry, 35, confided in Mr Perdrisat that he only wanted to have a child in a loving relationship - and he did not love Miss Craft, 27. PC Matthew Cherry, 35, allegedly punched and kicked fellow officer Caroline Craft several times in the back and stomach as she cowered on her bathroom floor . That was despite Cherry knowing his girlfriend, also a police constable, had believed it was a serious relationship, Mr Perdrisat said. Cherry also told his shocked colleague he wanted Miss Craft to have an abortion and asked how he could induce a miscarriage, the court heard. Just weeks later a man in a balaclava, dark hoodie and gloves burst into Miss Craft’s ground floor flat and carried out a frightening and bloody attack. Miss Craft - who was six months pregnant - was punched and kicked several times in the back and stomach as she desperately tried to protect her bump. She was left 'bloodied and bruised' and needed hospital treatment but later gave birth to a healthy boy who is now 15 months old. Her attacker showed 'no interest' in valuable items, such as laptops, a television and jewellery, Winchester Crown Court heard. Witnesses: Lodger Carla Hutchings (left) said her 'jaw dropped' when Cherry, 35, revealed he wanted his former lover to lose their baby. Cherry (right) is pictured outside Winchester Court . Prosecutor Matthew Jewell said there was 'compelling' evidence Cherry had carried out the 'savage' attack in Bournemouth, Dorset, on March 24 last year. Mr Perdrisat, who worked with Cherry at Dorset Police for around six years, said: 'Matt was not happy with the pregnancy. 'He did not want a baby in his life at that stage. One of the reasons was that he wanted to bring up a baby in a loving relationship. 'He did not feel he was in a loving relationship. He was having sex with Caroline but said he did not love her and did not want to settle down. She did. Having a baby was not in his plan - he said it would ruin his life.' Describing one day when he was on patrol in a police car with Cherry, Mr Perdrisat said: 'We were talking normal chit chat when there were a couple of seconds silence. 'He then asked me, and I remember word for word, ""Perds, how do I bring on a miscarriage?"". 'I was shocked. My initial reaction was ""You can't say something like that"". It went quiet and we then carried on the chit chat.' Cherry told another work mate he felt physically sick for being 'tricked' into having a child, the court heard today. He said news of the pregnancy left him unable to sleep and eat and he had not cried so much since his father was ill. However, he later told the same colleague - Sgt Colin Neve - that he intended to fight for full custody so he could see his baby's first steps and smile. Cherry and Miss Craft's relationship 'disintegrated' when she refused to have an abortion and he moved out of the flat a short while later, selling it to her for £145,000. Miss Craft had been at home alone and expecting a visit from an estate agent on the morning of the attack, as she hoped to sell it on. She opened her door shortly after 10am expecting it to be the agent but a masked attacker forced his way in. The attack only came to an end when the estate agent arrived and rang the intercom to Miss Craft's flat, causing the attacker to flee. Prosecutor Mr Jewell said the attacker was 'forensically aware' and his escape route indicated he knew the flat well. Miss Craft's housemate was on a short holiday in New York at the time of the attack and had written about her break on Facebook, where Cherry could have seen it. A trainer footprint of a size 10 Nike Dart V was found inside the flat and a box for the same model was later found at Cherry's new home, the court heard. Furthermore, a Panasonic vacuum cleaner carried by the attacker was of 'similar appearance' to one kept in a communal cupboard at the home of Cherry's brother. And Mr Jewell said Cherry had a history of aggression. Cherry and Miss Craft were both officers with Dorset Police and had met in May 2010. She has told the court she slept with her arms wrapped around her bump and with her back turned to Cherry after he threatened to punch her in the stomach. And their former housemate said Cherry had told her he had considered hitting Miss Craft. Cherry, now living in Southampton, Hampshire, was arrested on October 12, 2011, and denied the attack. He said had been nowhere near the address that day. He denies one charge of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial continues.

Moody moggie: Ginny Murphie says her cat Teddy Bear can be moody but is generally very docile and sweet-natured with humans . Meet Ginny Murphie the owner of the 'Essex lion' who this week revealed her less-than ferocious feline is actually just a pussycat. Her three-year-old cat Teddy Bear sparked Britain's biggest safari hunt earlier this week when terrified holidaymakers thought they'd seen a lion - but it was in fact Teddy on an evening stroll through a stubble field. Today, former fitness instructor Mrs Murphie said her 3ft long Maine Coon isn't like a lion at all - just very docile and loves nothing more being doted on. She said: 'He's the boss of the . dog but he's quite docile and sweet-natured with humans.' Mrs Murphie was away in Liverpool when the story about the 'Essex lion' broke on Sunday evening. The 50-year-old watch the drama unfold on television - but as she watched the police . cars racing to the scene near her home in St Osyth, Clacton on Sea, Essex, she had a sneaking feeling that her very own 'big cat' was behind the saga. Mrs Murphie said Teddy Bear's five minutes . of fame hadn't gone to his head - although he has been happily posing for photos. She said: 'He's been . sleeping and he's been very tired but he's out at the moment. 'He was superb with the film crew yesterday and he loved having his photo taken. He absolutely loved all the attention, but it's not gone to his head.' When Mrs Murphie bought her cat three years ago she hoped he'd stay indoors and keep her company after she was diagnosed with liver cancer. But she was in for a shock as Teddy Bear discovered a passion for the outdoors - possibly triggered by Mrs Murphie's dog Billy who she says relentlessly insists on playing with him. Roaming round gardens and paths near her home she soon realised he loved nothing more than stalking for prey and took a shine to one particular field. She said: 'He likes . that field, it's his field, and he goes hunting for hares all the time. 'Sometimes he disappears for . two or three days, but he always comes back, but he spends a lot of time . out. He's a bit of a sulky cat because the dog gets all the attention. Sometimes he does get in a strop.' She added: 'He's only . lion-like with the dog, he hisses at him and the dog irritates him . immensely as he always wants to play with him.' On the prowl: Teddy stalks through a stubble field yesterday just days after he was mistaken for the Essex lion . Mrs Murphie said she knew straight . away Teddy was responsible for the safari hunt when she saw the blurry . photo of the 'lion' taken by witnesses. The Maine Coon, also known as American Longhair, is one of the oldest natural breeds in North America. They are renowned for their size and are known as the 'gentle giants' of the feline world, and have a rectangular body shape and a long flowing coat. They can weigh up to 25lbs and are not considered fully grown until they are four or five years old. They have a beard around their necks which can look like a lion's mane and long hair around their legs and chest. Unusually for cats they also enjoy playing with water. She said he's been mistaken for a fox before, adding: ‘All my friends were joking . that it must be Teddy. When I saw the photo I recognised him straight . away. The way his ears were and his head. It's definitely him.’ Armed officers and two police . helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to . run, were scrambled in a bid to track down the wild animal following Sunday's reports. Workers . from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the . fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were . temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre. Mrs Murphie, married to engineer Dave, 51, . said she realises now how Teddy, with his ginger mane, could have been . mistaken for a lion. She said: 'I've just looked across the field now and I can see a white cat and it looks huge. It's a question of perspective.' The mother-of-three added: ‘We thought it had to be . Ted as he’s the only big gingery thing around there and he does tend to . wander into that field.’ 'As we were away he probably went into the field to sulk. Here, kitty kitty: Mrs Murphie, who is battling liver cancer, says this is definitely her cat Teddy and she knew it was him as soon as she saw the picture. She said from a distance he can look quite big . Pet lover: Ginny Murphie cuddles up to her giant ginger moggie Teddy Bear. She was away in Liverpool when her cat sparked Britain's biggest safari hunt after holidaymakers though they'd seen a lion in Clacton, Essex . ‘From a distance, because he has a light coloured mane he does look a little lion like. I can see why someone would think that.' Teddy is a Maine Coon which is the biggest breed of domestic cat and can grow up to 25lbs. Mrs Murphie is waiting for an important update on her cancer this week and might have to . raise £50,000 for a new treatment called immunotheraphy which is . available in Germany and could help fight her disease. Roar! The feline likes to boss dogs around but is very sweet-natured with humans and enjoys hunting hares . She said: . ‘I got him because I wanted some comfort and he has been brilliant. What’s happened has really cheered me up, it is quite amusing.' Despite Mrs Murphie’s certainty as to . the culprit in Operation Pussycat, however, there remain several . witnesses who remain equally convinced that the creature they saw was . much more than just a little kitty. First to spot the animal was Denise . Martin, 52, a warehouse worker from Canvey Island, on holiday at Earls . Hall Farm with her husband Bob. Big cat? Teddy Bear is so large and ginger that he's been mistaken for a fox before - but never a lion . Playtime: Teddy Bear is a three ft long Maine Coon - the largest domestic cat - and Mrs Murphie said she can understand why people might think he was a lion from a distance. She said she enjoys playing in this field . ‘There . was some smoke from a bonfire, but it cleared I could see this shape in . the field, so I got the binoculars out,’ she said yesterday. ‘I said to my husband, “What do you make of that?” He said, “That’s a lion.” We weren’t scared at all – it was excitement. ‘You . don’t often see something like that in the wild. At one point time it . sat up and looked at us and we could see its ears twitching. It knew we . were there and it sat down and started cleaning itself.’ Searching: Police were seen patrolling areas around Earls Hall Farm in St Osyth (pictured), near Clacton, Essex .","Former fitness instructor Ginny Murphy says her pet cat Teddy Bear is 'very sweet nature and docile'

A cannabis dealer who embarked on a 'life of Riley' can keep his haul of luxuries - after claiming he paid for them with his £14,400 a year in state handouts. Jobless Daniel Sharples, 27, claimed extra welfare payments due to his epilepsy but topped up his benefits by buying and dealing in cannabis - and then splashed out on a range of electrical goods. When police raided his house, officers discovered it was stuffed with high value electrical goods, including a large fridge freezer, a 47-inch flat screen TV worth £700 with surround sound systems, an Xbox and a DVD player. They also found two expensive leather sofas in the lounge and designer clothing and footwear and a Dyson vacuum cleaner. Sharples had also had a £44 a month Virgin subscription for his TV and had a gym membership for himself and his unemployed brother Jordan, 21, who was said to be his carer. At Burnley Crown Court, Lancashire, Sharples claimed he paid for everything in the house and for his cannabis with his income support, housing benefit and carers allowance and with the help of his mother, who assisted him financially when he was 'struggling.' But despite him facing having the luxuries confiscated under Proceeds of Crime laws a judge was told police and prosecutors did not want to pursue it - with no reason given for the decision. Mr Recorder Nick Clarke, QC, said he was . 'stuck with' the prosecution’s decision not to have a proceeds of crime . investigation and said his hands were tied - but he did rule that Sharples made the money from drug dealing. Police believed it would not be worthwhile investigating whether it could seize all of Sharples's household luxuries as officers had already confiscated £1,000 in cash they had found in his pocket. It means Sharples will still be able to enjoy the expensive goods when he is freed after serving just four months of his eight month jail term after he admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply . The money and drugs were confiscated. Earlier the court heard police went to Sharples’ home in Burnley last September and found four men - one of whom was under the influence of cannabis. Living the high life: The jobless cannabis smoker said his state handouts paid for his luxurious lifestyle, which included flat screen TVs, Dyson hoovers and an Xbox console (his possessions are not pictured here) The officers discovered 140 grams of cannabis worth £1,400 in different parts of the house, but mostly in a TV unit in the lounge and in a kitchen cupboard and also 32 bags. Sharples also handed the police a £1,000 bundle of bank notes from his pocket, telling them there was 'just over a grand' and had pointed to the TV unit, saying there was cannabis in it. Sharples was interviewed and told officers he used between £20 and £30 of cannabis a day but claimed he paid for his heavy drugs habit and the luxury items from his benefits and with the help of his mother. He said his brother was his carer, received carer’s allowance and had no other income. Sharples admitted to smoking ten cannabis joints a day - but said he did not profit from the habit (pictured posed by model) The hearing was told each month, . Sharples had £300 in housing benefit, £660 in income support and £275 in . carer’s allowance, paid into his bank account. He . was said to get a higher level of benefits because of his disability. His monthly outgoings, including his cannabis habit, a £44 Virgin . subscription, gym membership and £340 rent, came to about £1,300. The defendant had claimed he paid for his heavy drugs habit and the luxury items from his benefits and with the help of his mother. Sharples had admitted possessing cannabis with intent to supply, on the basis he would sometimes sell drugs to friends only at cost price and didn’t make a penny. But a trial was held over the facts in which the prosecution had successfully argued he must have been making money as he was living beyond his means and there was no other explanation for his lifestyle and the cash. David Macro, prosecuting, said ' It doesn’t make sense for him to be simply giving cannabis to friends at cost price. He hasn’t got enough money coming in from his benefits to pay for his cannabis habit. Burnley Crown Court was told about the cannabis smoker's lavish lifestyle - but did not confiscate his haul of luxuries . 'Clearly the defendant must have been profiting from drug dealing. There is no other explanation for the lifestyle and the cash.' Giving evidence, Sharples said he was on medication for his epilepsy and suffered seizures often. He said he tried to buy cannabis in bulk to get it cheaper. Sharples said he smoked 10 joints a day and mixed cannabis with cigarettes. He told the court : 'I only put a bit of tobacco in, as nicotine kills you.' Sentencing the judge Mr Recorder Nick Clarke, QC, said he was 'stuck with' the prosecution’s decision not to have a proceeds of crime investigation and added: 'There must have been a commercial element, to enable him to live a lifestyle beyond the means provided by the state.' 'Benefits are not intended to fund a drug habit of between of £150 to £200 a week. The benefits were intended to provide for the necessities of life, to ensure that he is clothed and fed and provided for.' 'You sought to minimise the extent of your drug dealing to try and explain away all the expensive goods at your home. 'You suggested you borrowed money from your mother from time to time, but it was apparent the figures did not add up. The judge said Sharples had been caught red-handed, had 'lied comprehensively' to the court about the circumstances in which he had been supplying cannabis and his financial circumstances. Reorder Clarke said Sharples’s epilepsy had not interfered with what was 'otherwise an active and luxurious lifestyle.' The judge continued: 'The public would be appalled if epilepsy were allowed to excuse you a jail sentence when you were still able to go a gym and enjoy all the trappings of a drug dealer’s lifestyle.'","Jobless Daniel Sharples splashed out on expensive electrical goods, gym membership and furniture .

A middle-class couple who claimed thousands of pounds in state benefits had enough money to privately educate their son, a court heard. Gaye Williams, 38, pretended she was a single mother and claimed council housing and tax benefits as well as income support while her husband, Glyn, was earning as much as £1,500 a week. At an earlier hearing at Gloucester Crown Court, she admitted three offences of obtaining benefits by dishonestly failing to disclose that her husband was living with her. Mr Williams pleaded guilty to three offences of possessing criminal property - benefit money which was claimed by his wife and paid into his account. They appeared in court again on Friday after Judge Jamie Tabor had given them six months to save up to repay a significant part of the loss of more than £11,500 - and avoid prison sentences. The court was told that Mr Williams, 47, was in a position to repay £2,500 to the Department of Works and Pensions but Mrs Williams had been unable to work since the matter came to court - and was living on reduced benefits. The couple, formerly of Oakle Street, Churcham, Gloucestershire, were now living apart, said Sabhia Pathan, for Mr Williams. He had worked 'extremely hard' to save money towards repayment, she said. Steve Young, for Mrs Williams, said she had been unable to work since the case came to court and the benefits she receives did not meet her outgoings. Mr Young said she had been effectively blacklisted and could not get a job because of 'grossly inaccurate press reports.' Judge Tabor told Mr Williams that he had been working extremely hard and had done all that he could have expected to earn money to repay the loss. He said he should ensure that the payment is made to the Department of Work of Pensions by September 11 and that way avoid a prison sentence. The judge ordered that a pre-sentence report be prepared on Mrs Williams. He adjourned the case until September 11, when the couple will be sentenced. At . an earlier hearing, the court was told that the couple were maintaining . a common household, despite Mrs Williams claiming she was a single . mother. Mrs Williams ran two cars, one of them a . 4x4 and the couple bought an expensive Dogue de Bordeaux dog (file picture) - which . cost about £1,000 and paid for their son to go to a private school .

A husband and wife who used money from a fraudulent £10 million investment scheme to fund their extravagant lifestyle have been jailed. Scheming John and Linda Hirst enjoyed luxury holidays and lavish wedding celebrations in Las Vegas and Majorca with the proceeds of the Ponzi scheme which 'decent, trusting' people had poured their savings into. John Hirst was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court to nine years for his part in the fraud while his wife was told she would serve two-and-a-half years in jail for money laundering. Richard Pollett, an accountant who was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud, was jailed for six-and-a-half years. Fraudster John Hirst, seen here with his wife Linda, have been jailed for their roles in a multi-million pound investment scam . Judge Jonathan Durham-Hall QC told John Hirst and Pollett: 'You are through and through common criminals. What you did, and what makes this case of the utmost gravity, was brutal, callous and cruel. 'You are corrupt.' Judge Durham-Hall said: 'This was an appalling and shocking course of conduct in which so many were targeted and so many have, in effect, had the remainder of their lives shattered and ruined.' The judge said those targeted by the pair were mainly ordinary, hard-working people who put their pensions and savings into the scheme after being promised huge returns and a risk-free guarantee. Many were elderly or divorced and all were decent and trusting, he said. Judge Durham-Hall spoke of the men's greed and desire to live the high life in Majorca. Prison: John Hirst, left, was sentenced at Bradford Crown Court to nine years for his part in the fraud, while Richard Pollett, right, an accountant, was jailed for six-and-a-half years . 'It did involve money-laundering on a grand scale, high living, lavish lifestyle,' he said. 'It was sickening to see the display of extravagance at your wedding to Linda, where many of the investors you were defrauding were being entertained on the most grand scale with the use of their own dishonestly-acquired money.' Sentencing Linda Hirst, 62, the judge . said: 'You did, from June 2006 onwards, enjoy the most profligate of . high standards of living, jet-setting here and there, cruises here and . there, and, of course, Mr Hirst liberally showered you with money and . jewels.' John Hirst, 61, . from Brighouse, West Yorkshire, served a two-and-a-half-year prison . sentence in the early 1990s after being convicted of a similar . investment fraud involving miners’ redundancy payments. Shameless spenders: The couple held a huge £100,000 wedding . event and party at this luxury hotel in Majorca for friends and . family, using other people's money . After his release from jail, he later moved to Majorca and set up the Ponzi scheme in 2001. He presented himself as a wealthy expert investor with a background in the financial services and promised investors he would invest their money in the US Dow Jones Index, with minimum returns of 18 per cent. Instead, he used the money for his own benefit, including paying for his wedding to Linda in Las Vegas in 2006 and a lavish wedding celebration in Majorca costing around £88,000. The scheme began to fall apart in 2009 when the demands for the withdrawal of money exceeded the amount being invested. Of the £10 million invested into the scheme, only around £4 million has been repaid. The wedding planner who organised a £100,000 . celebration for fraudster John Hirst and his wife Linda said it . was the most expensive party she had ever thrown. The now-estranged couple and their adviser . Richard Pollett would rub shoulders with their victims on golf courses and at . Rotary Club dinners, all the while siphoning off money. After the case, wedding planner Julie Bussell, . who gave evidence during the trial, told how she arranged the Hirsts' £100,000-pound wedding celebration in Majorca after they had already tied the . knot in Las Vegas at a cost of more than £90,000. The court heard that during the weekend in . June 2006 guests enjoyed a golf competition, a ladies' pampering session and a . barbecue as well as the wedding party itself. John Hirst had also paid for some family . members to fly in for the celebration. She said: 'They had a . really fabulous venue in a five-star hotel. It was a really luxury wedding . with everything they wanted.' A Serious Fraud Office investigation began in November 2009 after a complaint from one of the 120 investors. Judge Durham-Hall said John Hirst also imperiled members of his own family by trying to involve them in the scheme. His solicitor son, Daniel Hirst, and Linda Hirst’s daughter, Zoe Waite, were cleared of money laundering charges at the trial earlier this year. John Hirst pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and two counts of money laundering at the beginning of the trial. Pollett, 70, from Poole, Dorset, was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud. The court heard that he invested and lost his brother’s life-savings and those of his best friends and clients who trusted and respected him as a professional chartered accountant. Judge Durham-Hall said: 'You are a desperately greedy man, dazzled by John Hirst, envious of his lifestyle and wanting some for you at any cost.' Linda Hirst from Woking, Surrey, was found guilty of three counts of money laundering a total of around £750,000, and one count of evading a liability by deception. She is no longer in a relationship with John Hirst. Linda Hirst, wearing a pink zip-up . cardigan over a black top, sat impassively next to Pollett throughout . the sentencing proceedings, while John Hirst sat apart from his two . co-defendants. None of the three showed any emotion when they were jailed. Speaking . outside the court after the sentencing, Charles Dewey, one of the . investors in the scheme, described the trio as evil and said he had been . left with nothing. 'It’s had a huge effect on us really, it’s made me doubt people from a trust point of view,' Mr Dewey, from Somerset, said. 'The . destruction of trust is a very nasty lesson to learn aged 50, together . with I’m now having to start life again like a student.' He . added: 'This man has taken £300,000 from us, we’re now left with . nothing. We’ve got nothing to our name now, we’re living on benefits . with two children. It’s a very difficult situation.' He . added: 'That man has ripped our lives apart. I think they’re evil . people. I’m very relieved that, at long last, justice has been made to . bear on him.'

A Silicon Valley suburb is quietly transforming from a sleepy community of summer cottages and apricot orchards into an ultra-affluent utopian society for tech executives. Los Altos, California, before best known as the place where Steve Jobs built the first Apple computer, is changing thanks Sergey Brin, Google's 38-year-old billionaire co-founder. Brin is reportedly revamping the city . in his own image by bankrolling a real estate investment firm that has . been scooping up properties in the municipality of about 30,000 people. Revolution: An investment firm reportedly bankrolled by Google, Inc. co-founder has been known to offer below-market rents to tenants who open up the kind of stores it'd like to see in town . 'Los Altos is being transformed,' Ron Labetich, a longtime Los Altos real-estate broker, told The Wall Street Journal. Passerelle Investment Co. is causing a stir in Los Altos by renovating properties and, in some cases, charging below-market rents to mom-and-pop businesses that cater to the tech set making their home there. But Brin, who is reportedly worth about $17billion, is not alone. The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, a nonprofit created by the late Hewlett-Packard Co. co-founder and his wife, has also kicked in to the effort as well, The Journal reports. California Cool: Sergey Brin, Google co-founder who is reportedly worth some $17billion, is spearheading a real estate revolution in Los Altos . The developments include plans by Passerelle to build a hotel and office space on a property it co-owns with the city of Los Altos . Passerelle Investment Co. is 'now the 500-pound gorilla downtown,' Los Altos Mayor Val Carpenter tells The Journal in a recent story on the topic, adding that the firm's moves have 'energized' the town. You can get a sense of what Passerelle has in mind for the once-sleepy town from its website, where it states its philosophy in utopian terms. 'We approach real estate development from a socioeconomic perspective. Our investment analysis weighs financial return as well as social and environmental benefit,' the firm says. 'Ownership...requires a heightened sense of obligation and responsibility. Decisions go beyond one’s own portfolio because they affect the community, surrounding commercial and residential space, fellow building owners and the future of the downtown.' Brin, who makes his home in nearby Los . Altos Hills, has, through Passerelle, purchased at least a half-dozen . properties in the town in the last three years, The Journal reports. So . far, the firm has reportedly brought in businesses that cater to . families, such as a children's bookstore, a children's ""playspace"" and a . cafe called Bumble that has a supervised children's play area and . sandbox. He also told The Journal the firm has lent a helping hand to some tenants, including himself, by temporarily reducing rents when city construction clogged up a nearby street, making it harder to reach the stores. Putting His Billions To Work: Brin is reportedly revamping Los Altos's landscape one property at a time by brankrolling a real estate investment firm . In the Thick of It: Los Altos is adjacent to Mountain View, Calif., home of Google, Inc. headquarters. Brin, meanwhile, lives in neighbouring Los Altos Hills . Admittedly, Los Altos's real estate revolution is taking place apart from Brin's efforts. Forbes reportedly recently ranked the city as the 24th-most expensive ZIP code in the entire U.S. with the average home being hawked for more than $2.5 million. The town's ethnic makeup is reportedly 70.6 per cent white, 0.5 per cent African-American, and 23.5 per cent Asian, according to the 2010 Census. The town boasts just under 11,000 homes, of which the vast majority are families of about three people. The town also boasts some of the best public schools in the U.S. with a large per centage of students eventually matriculating to top universities. Frederic Sischka, owner of Fast Frame . of Los Altos, a picture-framing shop in a large building bought by . Passerelle in 2010, told The Journal the firm has helped to prepare Los . Altos for the recent influx of younger parents with kids. 'The Passerelle crowd had a vision that there needed to be things for younger people to do,' he reportedly said. City officials told The Journal they were willing to work with Passerelle to draft proposals for redevelopment of a parking plaza jointly-owned by both the city and Passerelle. Kid-Friendly: The 'Passerelle set,' as one local referred to people connected with Brin's firm, has been encouraging child-friendly mom-and-pop shops to set out a shingle in the company's properties . Transformation: Once known as a summertime haven of orchards and quaint cottages, Los Altos is now home to one of the most affluent ZIP codes in the entire U.S. City council members have been more skeptical about the firm's separate proposal to replace 18 parking spaces with a public 'gathering space' behind one of its buildings. Los Altos is also the beneficiary of other downtown real-estate ventures. Earlier this summer, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation opened its modern, energy-efficient headquarters building in downtown Los Altos. Labetich told The Journal the city's leaders set the stage for downtown's rebirth several years ago when they increased the height limit of commercial buildings in the district and expanded the sidewalk areas in front of stores, among other infrastructure improvements. He also noted to the paper that other developers are trying to build a shopping area downtown or are planning dozens of townhouses and condos nearby.

The young woman who was crushed to . death when a 13-feet high concrete window frame fell on her as she walked past was named this afternoon. Shoppers watched in horror as Amanda Telfer was . fatally injured as she ate a banana while passing by a construction . site on Hanover Square, off Oxford Street in central London last Thursday evening. Poignant floral tributes were left for Ms Telfer, including one with a note saying 'sorry we couldn't save you', just metres from where the giant frame that killed her lay for several days. Tragedy: . A police tent was put up where a window fell on top of Amanda Telfer as she passed by Hanover Square, just off . Oxford Street, in central London . She was pronounced dead on the pavement last Thursday evening despite attempts by an air ambulance, two cycle responders, two ambulance crews and members of the hazardous area response team to save her life. The frame was so heavy that it took ten people to lift it off her, witnesses said. Police are working alongside the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to try to establish what happened, while a post-mortem was carried out on Saturday. The emergency call was made by a man delivering electrical cables to the area. He said that the woman was 'flattened', and that he thought he saw her 'draw her last breath'. The 999 operator told him to get closer and probably saw the moment she died. 'Her eyes were open and I saw her hand move and then I think I saw her last breath and then the light went out: she'd gone,' he said. 'You'd have more chance of winning the lottery than that happening to you. 'She was in exactly the wrong place at the wrong time.' Shock: . The accident happened as workmen were installing windows at a new . multi-million pound six-storey office block. Ambulance crews rushed to . the scene and battled to save the woman but she was declared dead . The construction company running the site, Westgreen Construction Ltd, said this morning they would do 'whatever is necessary' and called it a 'terrible accident.' Witnesses claimed the ‘very . heavy’ window had been left ‘propped’ on a wall on the ground floor, . and that  barriers guarding the building site had recently been removed. The accident happened at 11.30am in . Mayfair’s Hanover Square, which houses some of London’s most expensive . offices. An art gallery is on the ground floor and the Vogue building, . the headquarters of publisher Conde Nast, is opposite. Dario Motti, 65, said the 12ft-high . frame had been propped up against a wall before it fell on the woman. ‘I . saw the frames delivered,’ he added. ‘They were so heavy they . were lifted in by crane.’ Taped off: Police officers were stationed around the scene where a woman has died after she was struck by a falling window pane . Investigation: The Health and Safety Executive launched an investigation into the tragedy and shocked witnesses took to Twitter to express their horror and the freak accident which was caused by high winds . A man delivering electrical cables to another building, who did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the frame off the woman . Kohei Matsumoto, manager of a nearby . Itsu sushi restaurant, added: ‘Two of my team members saw a girl turn . left into Hanover Street. She was eating a banana. ‘The next thing they saw was this . window frame falling down on her. She didn’t scream – it happened so . quickly.’ A man delivering electrical cables to another building,  who . did not want to be named, said that it had taken ten people to lift the . frame off  the woman. ‘I heard this incredible loud bang,’ he said. ‘I turned round and the frame was on the ground. I was hoping . it was a coat underneath – but then I saw an arm. ‘There was a woman who said she was a doctor who wanted to perform CPR, and somebody was giving her mouth-to-mouth. ‘Her eyes were open and I saw her hand . move and then I saw her last breath, and then the light went out – . she’d gone.

A major operation was under way last night to remove the bodies of 17 pilot whales which died in a mass stranding off the coast. The whales, including three calves, perished despite hours of frantic efforts by rescue workers to keep them alive until they could be released back out to sea. The stricken animals were hosed down and covered in wet blankets and sheets for several hours to try to cool them down and keep them hydrated until high tide. Scroll down for video . Horror: Dead pilot whales litter the shore as rescue workers survey the scene after the mass stranding near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife . Grim: Emergency Service workers were unable to help save 16 pilot whales after they beached near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife . By the time it arrived at 4.30pm on . Sunday, only ten of the whales – beached at Fife in Scotland for around . 12 hours – had survived. They were re-floated, but one more of the group died yesterday on rocks nearby. Last night the remaining nine were . seen off North Queensferry, heading westwards.  This is shallow water . where they may be gathering strength following their ordeal. But rescuers warned of a great risk . to the whales if they remained there at low tide and were hoping they . would head north to deeper waters. An investigation is under way to try and find out what caused the whales to beach. Shocking: The scene of horror that greeted rescuers was described as 'like an aircraft crash' as more than a dozen whales lay dead on the beach near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife . Mr Jack, who was among 50 people . who helped rescue and re-float the 10 whales, said: 'It has been quite traumatic . for the pod, members of every generation have gone and they will have to . re-build their pod. 'I would imagine there would be a period of grieving, they are very intelligent animals and they will possibly grieve.' He . added: 'They are very sociable animals and they have a very, very tight . family bond and if one comes ashore they will all come ashore.' He said: 'The pod will always try to . protect its sick, it's a natural instinct for a sick whale to come . ashore, we think, as they can't lift their head to breathe in the water, . and if they're on land they don't need to struggle. It's only a theory. But the rest of the pod will follow suit. They are very sociable . animals.' Mr Jack said the pilot whales, some . of which were 20-feet long, can only survive for about 12 hours on the . shore before they start to die. He explained: 'Beyond 12 hours they . are no longer viable, their muscles break down and that releases toxins . in their internal organs.' He said: 'It was mayhem, we had to forget the dead ones and concentrate on what we could save. They seemed to sense that we were there to help them. They never showed any aggression. Help: Members of the emergency services attempt to refloat pilot whales after they beached near Pittenweem off the coast of Fife . 'Once we righted them they were okay. They swam away so fast we couldn't keep up with them.' Vets used wet blankets and sheets to keep the 10 whales alive, give them shade and keep them cool. Two breached again but were re-floated by scores of volunteers. The BDMLR said in a statement this morning: 'All ten whales have now been reported as having left the harbour. The two that had turned back re-stranded but BDMLR volunteers were able to get them straight back into the water. 'One was in difficulty and listing to . one side, but the whales from the main pod swam beside it, physically . keeping it upright until it could right itself. Once it was balanced and . able to swim without support, the pod all swam strongly out towards . open water. 'It is . hoped that they will turn north soon to return to the deeper water but . observers along the southern coast of the Forth are on alert if they are . seen again.' Lifesavers: Teams of specialist vets steer a stranded pilot whale towards deeper water . Post-mortem examinations will now be carried out to find out what caused them to come ashore. A coastguard spokesman said: 'Vets . from the Scottish Agricultural College were at the beach last night and . will come back this morning to carry out post-mortem examinations on the . dead whales to try to find out what caused them to come in to shore. 'They will be looking to see if any . of the whales were ill or injured and came to shallow water for a rest. Once they have found out what they can it will be up to the council to . remove the carcasses from the beach.' Forth Coastguard was alerted to the incident shortly after 7am, with initial reports suggesting a mass stranding of dolphins. Teams . of volunteer medics from BDMLR were sent to the area, with specialist . rescue pontoons being moved to the location from across Scotland, . Newcastle and Cumbria. Frantic efforts: Emergency services attempt to rescue a large number of pilot whales who became stranded . Major operation: Dozens of specialist vets waded into the water in an attempt to refloat some of the surviving whales . Ordeal: Despite the best efforts of emergency services sixteen of the whales which beached did not survive their ordeal . Gareth Norman, area co-ordinator for the British Divers Marine Life Rescue, said the scene was 'like an aircraft crash.' The group of 26 pilot whales became stranded at Pittenweem, near St Andrews, Scotland . 'It was like an aircraft crash scene. We had 24 medics here with our pontoons, there are four vets, . Anstruther RNLI, police, coastguards - everybody did everything they . could to save those whales. 'Pilot whales have a habit of beaching. One strands and the others tend to stick together.' A further 24 pilot whales, possibly from the same pod, were in the shallows three miles along the coast at Cellardyke, but have not been seen this morning and are not stranded. Mr Jack said: 'We are monitoring them - but they have not stranded. 'It has been a fantastic effort by . what seems hundreds of people. 'We managed to herd the pilot whales back . out to sea using our pontoons. Two came back but we have got them out . again. 'We are hopeful all the ten will . survive - but I would say the chances are 50-50. It is up to the animals . now. People here certainly couldn't have done more - they were . magnificent.' The incident drew a large number of . bystanders to the scene, prompting the coastguard to urge the public to . stay away to allow rescue teams to carry out their duties. Many people volunteered to help but were told they could not because of health and safety reasons. Coastguard teams from St Andrews and Leven, Anstruther lifeboat, and Fife Police also assisted with the incident.

Rescue bid: Vets from British Divers and Marine Life Rescue were in a race against time to save as many of the beached whales as possible . In July last year 70 pilot whales that stranded in the Kyle of Durness in Sutherland. The Cetacean Stranding Investigation . Programme probed the cause of what is believed to have been Scotland's . largest ever beaching of pilot whales. Some 25 of the 70 whales died. In May last year, around 60 pilot . whales appeared in Loch Carnan, South Uist, although they left the loch . after one of the mammals died. Another dead whale was later found on an . island in the loch. A post-mortem examination suggested the first had died of infection. At the end of October in 2010, other pilot whales almost got stranded in Loch Carnan. Less than a week later 33 whales, believed to be the same group, were found dead on a beach in Co Donegal in Ireland. Pilot whales are known to prefer deep water but come inshore to feed on squid, their main food.

Grieving Heather Hyndman, 47, from Castleford, West Yorkshire, said she had faced 'a wall of silence' from Greek authorities since her 20-year-old daughter Chelsea's death in 2010. The enormous blunder was the first time she had heard from them about the trial, she claimed.

Miss Hyndman's mother Heather, 47, has hit out at Greek authorities over trial of Mr Walker, pictured . Miss Hyndman's boyfriend Luke Walker, 24, from Brierly Hill, West Midlands, is charged with causing her death by actual bodily harm. His trial will begin on October 16. Mrs Hyndman said: 'The Greek court said it was nothing to do with me because I’m not a witness. It’s my daughter, how can it be nothing to do with me?' 'The Greek police haven’t spoken to me once.' Mrs Hyndman also accused the Greek and British authorities of failing to support her. She said: 'The Foreign Office has just given us a list of English-speaking lawyers. We wrote to our MP Yvette Cooper, but she said she was unable to help and sent us a list of phone numbers. We’ve been told someone will meet us on  the first day of the trial but then we’re on our own.'

Miss Hyndman had gone to work as a waitress and Mr Walker a barman in Malia, Crete, a resort famous for late-night parties and heavy drinking sessions. The fun-loving girl was admitted to hospital in Heraklion - the island's largest city - suffering from severe abdominal pain. She was transferred to another hospital for an emergency operation but died of ruptured internal organs, which Greek prosecutors allege were caused by beating. Mr Walker was initially charged with murder but it was downgraded. He denies causing Miss Hyndman’s death, claiming her injuries were caused in a fall. He was released on bail in October 2010 on the condition he remains in Crete. Mrs Hyndman, who plans to fly to Malia with her partner, Neil Lorriman, and their family, said: 'I’ve always said I’ll go with the evidence but there are so many unanswered questions. I just hope we can get some answers.' 'Some days are worse than others, like when it was her birthday last week.' 'I’ve got my other daughter Mia, who’s eight, so I’m lucky I’ve got her to wake up for. Sometimes I don’t think it’s real and she’s just going to walk through the door. We miss her.'

Police said that her estranged boyfriend, Christopher Ehlen, discovered Cochran’s van parked outside his house late last night, and immediately alerted authorities. Scroll down for video . Grim task: Authorities investigate the horrific murder scene as they load one of the bodies onto a truck; mother Lisa Cochran and her three young daughters were found dead early this morning . Jefferson County Sheriff Glenn Boyer told MailOnline that deputies were contacted by Ehlen, the estranged boyfriend, around 12:30am this morning at his home near De Soto, about 45 miles south of St. Louis. He told police officers that he saw his ex-girlfriend’s van in the driveway, but she had filed an ex parte order on him. Sheriff Boyer said: ‘He didn’t want to violate the order, so he left, and called the police.’ An officer at the scene was about to make a grisly discovery. The sheriff continued: ‘(An) officer approached the van, expecting to contact his estranged girlfriend. 'A short distance from the van, found the deceased body of the mother of the three children. All had been shot in the head with a shotgun.’ Lisa Cochran was found a short distance away on the porch, with a bullet wound to the head. According to the sheriff, the girls have been identified as 22-month-old Faith Ehlen, the daughter of Christopher Ehlen, 10-year-old Autumn Cochran, and 11-year-old Alyssa Cochran.

At one point, Cochran wrote: ‘I can’t go on like this.’ Officers recovered the shot gun from the porch where they found Cochran, and later said that the young mother had purchased it on August 29 from a Wal-Mart in Arnold.

Tragic: Xavier Somerville, right, a freshman at Purdue University, has died after falling from a fifth-floor balcony during a rowdy party . The life of an 18-year-old Indianapolis college freshman came to a tragic end on Monday when he plummeted to his death from a fifth-floor balcony trying to evade police during a rowdy party, according to police. The Marion County Coroner's Office confirmed the death of Xavier Somerville, who graduated from Lawrence Central High School just a few months ago and was enrolled at Purdue University. Police officers investigating a noise complaint in an apartment building near the Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis campus discovered a party where minors were drinking alcohol. Witnesses told police that Somerville . was scared and tried to escape so as not to get in trouble with the . law, but ended up falling off the balcony, according to Fox59. Officers . were dispatched at 3am to The Avenue Apartments near West 10th Street . and University Boulevard. Upon arrival, they heard loud music and noise . coming from a fifth-story unit. According . to a police report, a frantic guest at the party met police at the door, saying . that Somerville had just fallen from the balcony. The responding officer went to the first floor and found Somerville sprawled on the sidewalk unconscious and bleeding. Popular: Somerville, fourth from left, graduated from Lawrence Central High School, where he played soccer and was homecoming king . Witnesses told police the 18-year-old . got alarmed when he heard officers at the door and tried to swing from . the fifth floor down to the floor below, but lost his grip on the . bannister and fell. The freshman was rushed to Wishard Hospital, where he died from his injuries a short time later. Six people at the party were cited for alcohol-related violations, including 22-year-old Benjamin Trester, who was ticketed for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. Five other people under the age of 21 were cited for possession of alcohol by a minor. However, Somerville’s mother, Vicke, does not believe that her son was among the people consuming alcohol at the party because he had gotten in trouble for underage drinking in the past and was aware what would happen if he were to get caught again, according to the Indianapolis Star. Party scene: Officers were dispatched to The Avenue Apartments in Indianapolis after receiving a complaint about loud music and noise . Deadly fall: Witnesses say Somerville tried to swing from the fifth-story balcony to the fourth in an effort to escape police, but lost his grip and plummeted to his death . Somerville had pleaded guilty to a . DWI charge in July in connection to his arrest in April. A Marion . Superior Court clerk said that his 365-day sentence was suspended and . Somerville was placed on probation. Under the conditions of his probation, Somerville was required to submit to random testing. ‘He knew he had to call in every evening and submit to random urine samples,’ his mother told the paper. ‘He knew that — I know he didn't fall because he was intoxicated.’ According to Vicke Somerville, her son tried to escape not because he violated his probation by consuming alcohol, but rather because he was afraid to be spotted at a party where other minors were imbibing. Vigil: About 60 of Somerville's friends gathered outside the building where he died to remember the 18-year-old . On Monday night, about 60 of .

Just before his death, Somerville received a bid to pledge Sigma Chi fraternity. ‘We lost a great person and a great future brother,’ said Sigma Chi President Mark Back. ‘He was one of the most impressive freshmen we met this year during the process and he was well respected and liked by our chapter.’ Purdue University spokeswoman Jeanne Norberg released a statement to RTV6 following Somerville’s death which read: ‘Our hearts go out to Xavier's family and friends. A promising future has been cut short, (and this is) a tragedy for all of us.’ At the vigil on Monday, LaBarre said he had received a message from Somerville’s parents urging their son’s friends to learn from their mistakes and correct them.","Xavier Somerville graduated from Lawrence Central high School, where he was homecoming king .

Michael Keenan, who was convicted in 1988 for the stabbing death of 19-year-old Tony Klann in a Cleveland Park, had the murder charge against him dismissed by a judge. The dramatic turn in events began yesterday, when the clean-shaven 62-year-old was ready to plead guilty to involuntary manslaughter charges in a bid to get out of jail. Free at last: Michael Keenan, 62, is again free after a judge dismissed a 24-year-old murder charge against him . Murdered: Tony Klann was 19 when his body was found washed up in Doan Creek; Keenan maintained his innocence the entire time he was on death row . Cuyahoga County judge John Russo dismissed the aggravated murder count against 62-year-old Michael Keenan after determining evidence that could have exonerated him was withheld from his trial attorneys. He set Keenan’s bond at $5,000, a low sum that the Cleveland Plain Dealer notes will allow him to leave prison very soon. Keenan’s co-defendant Joe D’Ambrosio was freed in 2010 by a judge citing the same reason. A federal judge ruled in 2006 that prosecutors in D’Ambrisio’s murder trial withheld vital bits of information that could have exonerated him. Keenan was convicted twice of killing Tony Klann in a Cleveland park and then dumping his body in Doan Creek. Scene of the crime: Authorities said Klann was murdered in Cleveland's Rockefeller Park . Keenan's attorney says a priest who befriended the co-defendant helped uncover evidence favourable to both men. Released: Joe D'Ambrosio was on death row until a judge exonerated him in 2010 . A federal judge in April had ruled that Keenan must be retried or the verdict set side. Throughout the two decades he spent on death row, he and D’Ambrosio maintained their innocence. A man named Eddie Espinoza pleaded guilty to manslaughter in connection to the teenager’s death for a reduced sentence. He was sent to prison in 2001, and died eight years later. He testified against them, saying that Keenan slit Klann’s throat while D’Ambrosio stabbed him.

"By . Rob Davies . PUBLISHED: . 11:45 EST, 9 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 02:22 EST, 10 September 2012 . If you think your tax bill must be a mistake, you could well be right. Well over half the complaints made against the taxman are upheld by HM Revenue & Customs’ own internal complaints system. Of 58,110 complaints received in the year to the end of March 2011, HMRC found against itself in 57 per cent of cases, while its performance is getting steadily worse, according to internal data. Grievances submitted by individuals and small businesses range from poor treatment by HMRC staff to delays and errors in the tax bill. In the wrong: Well over half of complaints about the taxman were upheld, according to HM Revenue & Customs' own internal complaints system . ‘The number of cases where HMRC has admitted it got something wrong is remarkable,’ said George Gillham, legal director at law firm Pinsent Masons. ‘It suggests that if you make a complaint to HMRC, they’ll probably decide you’re right, at least in part.’ He said many taxpayers are unaware that they can use HMRC’s internal complaints system to reclaim substantial sums, even if their tax bill is correct. Other reasons to claim money back include mistreatment by HMRC staff and errors which force taxpayers to incur financial costs. ‘Many complaints result in HMRC writing a tax liability off or offering compensation - and quite a lot of money can be at stake,’ said Mr Gillham. ‘HMRC is prone to making errors. It’s unfortunate, but it’s true.’ He blamed budget cuts for reducing the amount of skilled employees on HMRC’s ‘frontline’, as well as the ‘massively increased complexity’ of the tax system in the past fifteen years. Many of the complaints concern HMRC’s Debt Management Office, which chases taxpayers who deemed to owe money to HMRC. The DMO does not judge whether HMRC is right to claim the money back and some taxpayers have complained that it has pursued innocent people in a ‘heavy-handed’ manner. ‘The DMO aren’t there to negotiate, so even if HMRC has made a mistake, the DMO won’t back off until it has what it’s been asked to retrieve or been informed of a mistake by HMRC,’ said Mr Gillham. Getting it wrong: Complaints against the HMRC, whose London Headquarters are pictured, ranged from errors with tax bills to poor treatment by staff . ‘It’s a very unpleasant and distressing experience.’ The lawyer said complaints about HMRC were on the increase, partly due to a growing tendency to use private sector contractors for debt collection. Even complaints that cannot be resolved internally by HMRC and go instead to an independent adjudicator are increasingly decided in favour of the taxpayer, the figures show. In 2011-12, HMRC paid £363,954 in compensation and dropped tax demands worth £968,782, meaning it made errors that cost it £1.3m. By comparison, mistakes cost HMRC just £470,608 in 2005-06, the first year after the Inland Revenue was merged with HM Customs & Excise. ‘For performance to get worse over time is incredibly disappointing,’ said Mr Gillham. An HMRC spokesman said: ‘HMRC serves millions of people every year, and received just under 75,000 complaints in 2011/12. ‘About 2 per cent of these complaints were investigated by the Adjudicator, indicating that we successfully resolve the vast majority of complaints we receive from customers. ‘HMRC takes complaints very seriously; we want people to be able to tell us when we make mistakes and our service falls short. ‘Complaints not only allow us to put things right for the individual but also tell us where we need to learn lessons and improve our services for all our customers.’ ADD: The HMRC spokesman added:’We are making real improvements to our customer services, boosting staff in contact centres by 1000 and turning around post faster than ever. Such improvements will reduce the level of complaints going forward.’ The HMRC spokesman added:’We are making real improvements to our customer services, boosting staff in contact centres by 1000 and turning around post faster than ever.

"By . Petronella Wyatt. PUBLISHED: . 16:17 EST, 8 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 04:49 EST, 29 September 2012 . Broken arm: Petronella Wyatt's mother Verushka has been hit twice by cyclists . On August 16, my mother was hit by a Lycra lout. She was crossing the road when a youth on a bicycle shot a red light, knocked her to the ground and left her with a broken arm. Yesterday, a friend telephoned to ask about her health. 'She would be feeling better,' I replied, 'if she hadn't been hit by another bicycle the other evening.' I could hear a convulsion in his voice. It sounded like stifled laughter. He could not repress a gurgling sound before he managed to compose himself to express sympathy and shock. 'Again? How awful!' But it isn't amusing. My mother is elderly. She was shopping in London's Regent Street when she was hit by the first cyclist, who failed to stop. He didn't even look back. Kindly passers-by dragged her seemingly inert body on to the pavement and called an ambulance. The hospital said she was lucky to have survived. As it is, the bones in her right arm are so badly broken they will never heal properly. Then three days ago, just as she was regaining some strength, she crossed a street near her home in North London to buy bread. Once again, a hit-and-run cyclist struck. This time my mother nearly lost the sight in her left eye. And her broken arm sustained such serious damage that she may have to undergo a lengthy operation. Look out: 'Male cyclophiles are becoming a blot on our highways' If my mother had been hit twice by a car in a similar space of time, the general reaction would have been one of horror and outrage. The anti-car lobby has portrayed motorists as evil, greedy killers of the innocent and destroyers of the planet. Cyclists, on the other hand, are heroes, particularly in the wake of  our Olympic triumphs. Consider dashing Bradley Wiggins and glowing  Victoria Pendleton. And to many of us, there is something charming about bicycles. They conjure up images of Edwardians in tweed knickerbockers, and our own irrepressible and endearing  Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. But this halcyon haze enveloping cyclists hides a disturbing truth. Concerned daughter: Petronella Wyatt wants a change in the law . The majority are safe – but not all. There are rogues: Lycra louts whose intentions are as low as the meanest hit-men. In 2008, I had my handbag stolen by a gang of youths on bikes. This is not to deny the guilt of many motorists who drive irresponsibly, and the fact that every year innocent cyclists lose their lives as a result. But the police have established, in conjunction with the Transport Research Laboratory, that half of all collisions between bicycles and cars are the fault of the cyclist. I have seen cyclists on the pavement and on the wrong side of the road. Others fail to signal, overtake on the inside and ignore traffic lights. They either don't have lights or fail to use them. They ride in the gutters and weave in and out between cars. Some ride when fatigued or drunk, and many have failed to learn how to control their bicycles. There are training courses for cyclists but only one in 100 enrols. This is in sharp contrast to the position of the motorist, who, since 1935, has had to be over 17 and capable of passing a stringent test . In 1934, 7,343 people were killed on the roads despite there being only 2.4 million vehicles in circulation. Today there are more than 30 million vehicles in the UK, yet the number of fatalities in 2011 was 1,901. Aside from the dangers, male cyclophiles are becoming a blot on our highways. They are weirdly obsessive about their mode of transport and fuss endlessly about their appearance. Bent over handlebars in their garish Lycra armour and insect-shaped-helmets, cyclists see themselves as Lancelots – but look more like Richard III with a chamber pot on his head. People undergo a strange transformation when they take up cycling. Four years ago I bought a Pashley bike. To paraphrase My Fair Lady, 'Let a cycle in your life, and you invite eternal strife.' As I wobbled along London's roads, nearly hitting every pedestrian and car in sight, I was petrified and  hysterical, screaming every shrewish curse I knew . Reckless: 'A law that will force cyclists to take a proper test is long overdue' After three days, disgusted with myself and unwilling to commit manslaughter, I rode on to the kerb – deliberately – and fell down. I then hailed a taxi and put my bike inside. I have never cycled since. Urban England is not suited to bicycles. There are no wide boulevards  to separate cars and cyclists as in  Paris, Rome and Madrid. A law that will force cyclists to take a proper test and abide by the Highway Code is long overdue. My mother might have died last week. Many others unlucky enough to become involved with reckless cyclists do. I am sure that Bradley and Victoria would concur: It's time  we put a spoke in their wheels.","'A law that will force cyclists to take a .

The artist who created the 'HOPE' poster that came to symbolize Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign was sentenced Friday to two years of probation and 300 hours of community service by a judge who cited his charity work. Shepard Fairey hugged his lawyers, was kissed by wife and shook hands with friends and supporters after his sentence was pronounced. The government had said in a presentence memorandum that Fairey, 42, should serve some time for destroying documents and fabricating others in a civil lawsuit he brought against The Associated Press in 2009. No prison term, it said, would send a 'terrible message' to others who might engage in similar conduct. Sentencing: Shepard Fairey, left, leaves Manhattan Federal court today with attorney, Dan Gitner after he was sentenced to two years' probation and 300 hours of community service . Long face? Shepard Fairey, center, leaves Manhattan Federal court in New York Friday today . 'After spending a great amount of time, energy and legal effort, all of us at The Associated Press are glad this matter is finally behind us,' AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said in a statement. 'We hope this case will serve as a clear reminder to all of the importance of fair compensation for those who gather and produce original news content.' Prosecutors had told U.S. Magistrate Judge Frank Maas in Manhattan that Fairey had 'both an ideological and financial motive' to alter evidence in his favour after basing his poster on one of the AP's photographs. They said he did so over several weeks, engaging in behaviour that 'cannot be dismissed as remotely impulsive or the product of a moment of bad judgment.' 'This was not a mere failure to preserve documents,' the government wrote. 'This was the intentional destruction of evidence and the intentional manufacture of false evidence. The defendant knew exactly what he was doing when he created the fake documents and sought to destroy the deleted documents.' They noted that revenues at three companies he controlled doubled from roughly $3million in 2007 to $6million in 2009 while he was honoured repeatedly, including being chosen to design the official poster of Obama's 2009 inauguration and commissioned to create the cover image of Obama for Time magazine's 2008 Person of the Year, which was displayed in an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery. Too similar: A poster of President Obama, right, by Shepard Fairey is shown with this April 27, 2006 file photo of then-Sen. Obama by AP photographer Mannie Garcia at the National Press Club . Defence attorneys argued that a prison term was not warranted, noting that the misdemeanour charge carries a potential of only six months in prison. They said Fairey is contrite and noted that he settled his civil case with the AP on unfavourable terms that included sanctions. The government outlined in its court papers that the deal required Fairey to pay the AP $1.6million, with an insurance company contributing about $450,000 of that amount. Iconic: The image became iconic in the 2008 election, left, and earned Fairey many honours, including the image being displayed at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, right . In their sentencing memorandum, defence . lawyers described Fairey as a devoted husband and father of two young . daughters who runs companies that employ almost 30 people and who serves . as the creative force behind a clothing line that employs another 80 . people. They called his crime the 'worst mistake of his life' and said he altered evidence 'not to better his chances of winning the lawsuit or to enrich himself, but out of fear of embarrassment.' The lawyers wrote that Fairey, who has diabetes, has already suffered 'significant damage to his reputation,' adding that an Internet search of his name 'now produces results not just about his artistic and civic accomplishments, but also many web sites degrading him for his misconduct.'","Shepard Fairey used AP photo to create iconic Obama 2008 'Hope' poster .

Dr Aloke Basu had cataracts in both eyes when his Porsche 911 Carrera hit great grandmother Shirley Watkins, 74, as she crossed the road in Southend, Essex, in February 2010. The 67-year-old told Basildon Crown Court he 'didn’t see' the widowed mother-of-two and was jailed for two years for causing death by dangerous driving in May last year 2011. Disgraced GP Aloke Basu (left) has been struck off the medical register after running over and killing pensioner Shirley Watkins (right) in his Porsche. A tribunal heard he had failed to inform the DVLA of his poor eyesight. A medical tribunal has now banned Basu from practising medicine in the UK following a two-day hearing in Manchester. The . tribunal heard how Basu had ignored advice from two eye specialists . stating he must make the DVLA aware of his chronic glaucoma and . short-sightedness. His . eyesight had deteriorated to such an extent that one of his eyes could . not read the top line of a standard eye test chart from just 20 feet . away. A person with normal eyesight can read the line from ten times that distance - 200ft. Basu, from Thorpe Bay, Essex, did . not attend the tribunal but argued that he felt his condition was . 'stable' and denied evidence that eye specialists had advised him not to . drive. Scene of the crash: Basu was found to have been visually impaired when his Porsche ploughed into the pensioner in Southend, Essex .

In a letter, the discredited doctor said: 'As far as my knowledge is concerned my condition was stable and I was never advised by my consultant not to drive. 'If I felt that my eyesight fell below the legal standards on the day of the accident, I wouldn’t have got behind the wheel of my car.' Basu had been a well-respected GP at Shoebury Medical Centre before the fatal crash but on Wednesday the Medical Practitioners’ Tribunal Service ruled he must be struck off the General Medical Council register. Dr Harvey Marcovitch, who chaired the panel, ruled Basu’s actions had brought the profession into disrepute. He said: 'The panel is satisfied the matters underlying Dr Basu’s conviction involved a serious departure from the standards of behaviour which the public is entitled to expect from a doctor and diminish the public’s trust in the profession. 'In the panel’s judgment, Dr Basu’s conduct was fundamentally incompatible with his continuing to be a registered medical practitioner.'

From the start of the match windy conditions disrupted play causing the net sensor to go off in the opening game. Cool it: The umpire appeals for calm as Murray and Berdych argue at the net after the Scot's hat was blown off his head . Then, with World number 4 Murray on break point in the fourth game, he raced towards the net and as he successfully reach a short ball his white baseball cap flew off. Berdych failed to get Murray's response however, and umpire Pascal Maria initially awarded the point to Murray. Berdych, who has a winning record against Murray, then approached the umpire and argued he had been put off by the flying hat and the pair became engaged in an argument. Murray also approached the chair and could be heard asking Berdych if was certain he had been distracted by the flying hat. He repeated: 'I'm just asking if you're 100 percent sure.' Maria decided to replay the point and an attempted lob by Murray sailed out of the court giving Berdych the break of serve. A furious Murray then hit a ball in anger, grabbed the hat and dumped it on the sideline, saying 'nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.' But, although Murray went on to lose a tight . first set, it was he who ultimately coped with the conditions better, surviving a . fightback in the fourth set from Berdych to win 5-7, 6-2, 6-1, 7-6 (9/7) in three hours and 58 minutes. It will be the 25-year-old's second . consecutive grand slam final after his Wimbledon loss to Roger Federer . and his second US Open final, with his first experience of a major . showpiece coming here in 2008, when he also lost to Federer. Roaring success: Andy Murray reached his second US Open final and fifth grand slam showpiece . Talking about the conditions . afterwards to CBS, Murray said: 'You have to focus for every point. The . chairs were flying onto the court, it was hard to serve. 'It's some of the hardest conditions I've ever played in and I come from Scotland so that's saying something.' He added: 'From the end of the first . set I was in control. At 3-0 in the fourth I had three break points, but . from the far side of the court it was very tough so I got broken in the . next game. I just tried to hang in there and I did a good job at the . end.' The result also means Murray will . overtake Rafael Nadal to become the new world number three, but most . importantly it gives him the chance to claim his first grand slam title. Beaten: Berdych lunges in vain as a shot from Murray whizzes past him . Murray will meet either defending . champion Novak Djokovic or Spain's David Ferrer in the final and, asked . if he feels this is his time after winning Olympic gold, Murray said: 'I . hope so. You can never say for sure, I know how hard these tournaments . are to win. David and Novak are top, top players. 'When the conditions are like this, anything could have happened. I'll give everything in the final.' Murray went into the match as the favourite by ranking and experience at the latter stages of grand slams but also knowing Berdych had won four of their six previous matches. The big-hitting Czech had also served notice of what a threat he would be by blasting past Federer in the quarter-finals. The wind was certainly the winner in the early stages as the stands slowly filled up and planes roared overhead. Murray piled the pressure on Berdych in a lengthy third game and got the break when the sixth seed drilled a forehand just wide. Murray thought he had saved a break point in the next game but Berdych protested he had been distracted by his opponent's hat blowing off and, after a heated exchange between the two men and umpire Pascal Maria, the point was replayed and the Czech broke back to 2-2. Berdych was struggling with his ball toss to such an extent that at times he was serving at little more than 80mph but he was certainly hitting the ball cleanly off the ground. Nice finish: Murray wins a point with a cool shot at the net . Holding serve into the wind was the . main problem and Murray was furious with himself that he did not put . more pressure on his opponent in the 11th game. That left him serving to stay in the . set for a second time and he could not manage it, the Scot struggling to . keep his cool as Berdych broke through with a mighty swipe of his . forehand. Murray was clearly fired up and . immediately had three break points at the start of the second set, . taking the second when Berdych pushed a forehand long. The Scot seemed to be enjoying himself . a bit more now, taking on the challenge instead of being frustrated by . it, and he broke again to lead 4-1. On the attack: The powerful Berdych won the first set, but Murray's nous won through . Berdych held to force the third seed . to serve out the set, but no sooner had Murray thrown the ball up for . his first serve than a gust of wind blew his chair and racquet bag . across the court. The Czech laughed at the impossibility of playing tennis in such conditions but on they went and Murray duly wrapped up the set. The Scot, who was being watched by . countryman Sean Connery, began the third set as he had the second, with a . break of serve, as Berdych shot an exasperated look towards his . supporters. Murray's greater variety and tactical . acumen suited the conditions much better than the Czech's raw power and . another break for 3-0 gave him a firm hold on the match. Serving up a treat: Murray's craft and guile was there for all to see across four compelling sets . Mentally, Berdych seemed to have gone . walkabout and, although he saved four set points at 1-5, a fifth arrived . and this time the Czech drilled a forehand just long. Berdych's hopes of making a second . grand slam final were hanging by a thread, and they took another hit . when Murray broke again in the second game of the fourth set. The sixth seed stopped the run of . games against him at five, saving more break points, and that seemed to . revitalise him as he then created a rare opening on the Murray serve and . took it. All smiles: Ivan Lendl shares a joke with Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears . Suddenly it was a match again, albeit . one that was still very much in the third seed's hands, but if he was . going to win it in four sets it would have to be in a tie-break. Murray was unfortunate that he started . the game at the more difficult end and Berdych raced into a 4-1 lead, . but the Scot recovered the deficit when they switched ends, levelling at . 5-5 with an angled backhand return. Blustery: Berdych observes as chairs and debris are sent in all directions by the wind . Berdych played a good point to move . 6-5 in front but Murray saved the set point and then brought up his . first match point only to see the Czech fire down an ace. Berdych erred with his forehand, . though, to give Murray a match point on his own serve, and another . mistake from the Czech sent his opponent leaping around the court in . delight. The second semi-final between Novak Djokovic and David Ferrer in the Arthur Ashe Stadium had to be postponed due to the heavy rain. Keeping cool: Connery was an involved spectator .

Armin Wand III, 32, of Argyle, Wisconsin, faces three counts of first-degree intentional homicide, three counts of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and one count of arson in connection with the fire. Lafayette County Circuit Judge William D. Johnston set his bail at $200,000 per count. Grave charges: Armin G. Wand III, 32, left, and his brother Jeremy L. Wand, 18, are accused of starting a house fire that killed Armin Wand's three young sons and injured his wife . Investigators have accused Armin Wand III’s brother, Jeremy Wand, 18, of helping with torching the residence. He faces three counts of first-degree intentional homicide, two counts of attempted first-degree intentional homicide and one count of arson. The judge set his bail at $200,000 per charge as well for a total cash bond of $1.2million. A criminal complaint states that Jeremy Wand, at the direction of his brother, locked two of his nephews in their rooms after setting the fire around 3am on Friday. Armin Wand gave conflicting reports to investigators about whether the boys could be heard yelling as the fire progressed. An autopsy later found all three children died of smoke inhalation . According to the criminal complaint, Armin Wand lived in a rental house in Argyle, a village of 850 people about 45 miles southwest of Madison, with his wife, Sharon Wand, 27, and their four children. He told state agents in an interview he started talking with his brother early last week about killing his family in a fire to collect on their life insurance policies. Wand told the agents he wanted to make . a 'fresh start', the complaint said. He said he was tired of his family . living paycheck to paycheck and listening to his wife’s complaints about . wanting more money. She also was contemplating divorce, he said. Jeremy . Wand told investigators his brother offered him $300 from the insurance . payout if he helped him, the complaint said. Together they set the . house on fire early Friday morning as the rest of the family slept, the . complaint said. The couple’s three boys, seven-year-old Allen, five-year-old Jeffrey and three-year-old Joseph died in the blaze.

The girl wasn’t seriously hurt, but Mrs Wand suffered burns, the complaint said. A beam also fell on her, and her unborn baby died as a result of her injuries, the children’s grandmother told the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper. Sharon Wand remains in a Madison hospital in critical condition with third-degree burns to 70 per cent of her body.

Benefits bosses have apologised to a war veteran and his 11-year-old daughter who were forced to live in his car for a month after a payments blunder. Christian Lewis, 32, and his daughter Caitlin found themselves homeless after they were denied housing benefits and other allowances they were entitled to.

The incident happened after Fermin Recalde’s family had brought him a fresh set of clothes to wear during his trial, where he stands accused of stabbing his girlfriend to death. While the clothes were being held up for routine inspection, Recalde’s lawyer snapped his underwear on her cell phone, according to witnesses.

During a break, Anya Cintron Stern promptly posted the picture to her personal Facebook page. Mistrial: A judge ruled that the photo of the underwear undermined the case and declared a mistrial (file photo) The 31-year-old allegedly wrote a mocking caption besides the photo suggesting that Recalde’s family believed the animal print underwear was 'proper attire for trial'. Although Stern’s Facebook is only open to her friends, someone who saw the photo reported it to the judge, who declared a mistrial.

A respected oceanographer who was among the first scientists to explore the sunken wreckage of the Titanic is facing up to 20 years in prison after 22,000 child porn images were found on his computer. Hard drives belonging to Dr William Kenneth Stewart were seized by investigators in Florida, U.S., and later found to contain the enormous stash of indecent images of children. The 62-year-old, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to one count of receiving child pornography, is due to be sentenced tomorrow at West Palm Beach federal court. Stewart earned his doctorate in oceanographic engineering at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and spent 16 years with the renowned Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) - one of the world's most respected marine research facilities. In 1986, the year after the wreck of the Titanic was discovered by Dr Robert Ballard - also a WHOI scientist - Stewart was part of an expedition to further explore the doomed liner, and is understood to have operated a remote camera that captured footage of the wreck from an underwater research pod. He had been chief scientist and chief consulting engineer at the South Florida Water Management District in West Palm Beach since 1999. Stewart's lawyer Dean Wilbur told the Orlando Sun Sentinel the case had been 'devastating' both to his client's professional career and to his family. In a letter to the courts ahead of the sentencing tomorrow, Stewart's ex-wife said: 'Despite the hype, vilification and connection promoted in media and politics, I believe (as is supported by research) that receiving and viewing obscenity is very different from perpetrating it. Victoria K Tauxe wrote that, while she did not wish to imply that receiving child pornography was a victimless crime, 'he did not directly hurt anyone'. Impact statements written by victims of child pornography were also filed with the court. 'Regardless of whether they directly abused children themselves, reveled in the images of suffering, or persuaded others to abuse children on their behalf (to provide images of the abuse) each participant has a responsibility for the effects,' one statement read. Wreckage: Stewart was among the first scientists to explore the wreckage of the Titanic just a year after it was discovered . Stewart studied engineering at  Duke University and marine technology at Cape Fear Technical Institute - . both in North Carolina - before going on to study ocean engineering at . Florida Atlantic University then obtain his PhD in oceanographic . engineering from MIT in 1988. Erika Fitzpatrick, spokeswoman for . the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, confirmed to the Sun Sentinel . that Stewart was a student in the MIT/Woods Hole joint program between . 1982 and 1988. He stayed on at Woods Hole as assistant scientist from . 1988 to 1992, and associate scientist without tenure from 1992 to 1998. The wreckage of the Titanic was . discovered by a joint U.S. and French expedition led by Woods Hole . scientist Robert Ballard in 1985.

Recovering from the shock, the two men discovered that nurse practitioner Manacci had come to the aid of Mr Gronowski once before, when he had been injured in a fishing accident eight years earlier. Good Samaritan: Christopher Manacci came to a stranger's aid, only to find out he had already saved him once before . The miraculous event occurred last Saturday when Christopher Manacci had been driving in Auburn Township, Ohio and saw a van by the road struggling with a flat tyre. ‘I dropped my wife off and decided that I’d bring him a can of Fix-a-Flat for his tyre so he could make it to a gas station,’ Mr Manacci told Fox8 News.

A mysterious circle of ancient stones looming high over the Wiltshire countryside, prehistoric Stonehenge is one of Britain's most spectacular sights. But taking your eyes off the A344 to gawp at the view as you drive past the towering monoliths could come at a price. Stonehenge has topped a list of sights around the country most likely to cause awestruck drivers to have an accident - with the Angel of the North and the Blackpool Tower also responsible for many a swerve or bump. Distracting: Over a quarter of drivers surveyed said the sight of Stonehenge had distracted them to the point of peril . The study showed that a third of drivers in the UK have had a minor accident or near miss after taking their eyes off the road to admire a landmark or view as they passed, often causing hundreds of pounds worth of damage to their cars. Stonehenge . Angel of the North . Blackpool Tower . Scottish Highlands . Big Ben/Houses of Parliament . Windsor Castle . Tower Bridge . Clifton Suspension Bridge . Cheddar Gorge . Severn Bridge . It seems nowhere in the country is as diverting to drivers as the curious circle of Stonehenge, with over a quarter of people surveyed admitting the ancient monument had them distracted to the point of danger, and 13 per cent confessing to a minor accident or close shave. Research showed Stonehenge can lure a driver's gaze up to three times in a single passing - for up to 3.74 seconds of staring each time. The famous 66ft Angel of the North in Gateshead, which towers over the roads into Tyneside, was named as the second most dangerous view for drivers, with 11.5 per cent of motorists reporting a prang or a near miss as they gazed at the sculpture. Third on the list was Blackpool Tower, with 11.3 per cent of drivers surveyed reporting a minor accident as a result of concentrating on the iconic tourist attraction instead of the road. The Scottish Highlands, Cheddar Gorge in Somerset, and London's imposing Houses of Parliament are also potentially dangerously distracting to drivers, according to the research carried out by More Than Motor Insurance. The study also showed that drivers slow down dramatically as they pass landmarks in order to get a better look. In . all, 14 per cent of motorists surveyed said they had been so spellbound . by some sights they slowed down by up to 27mph - increasing their . chances of being rear-ended by another car behind. Drivers . taking advantage of scenic routes are now being encouraged to park up . to admire a spectacular view rather than risk taking their attention off . the road. Dangerous view: The spectacular Angel of the North in Gateshead has lured the attention of many a passing driver off the road . Historic Windsor Castle was sixth on the list of dangerous views, distracting ten per cent of passing drivers, while Tower Bridge in London was at number seven and caused nine per cent of motorists to tear their gaze from the road. Clifton Suspension Bridge in Bristol was at number eight, with Cheddar Gorge at nine and the Severn Bridge at number ten in the table. Janet Connor, managing director of the insurance provider, said: 'We're often encouraged by travel guides and even our friends and family to take the scenic route. But until now the perils of admiring the world beyond the windscreen had not been fully explored. 'The UK is blessed with some amazing sights and landmarks, but as this research suggests, motorists need to resist the lure of taking their eyes off the road and staring at those sights while driving. She added: 'Our advice to motorists is simple: to avoid having an accident while appreciating the view, park up and enjoy it safely.' Eyes on the road: The Scottish Highlands are the fourth most distracting view to passing drivers, according to the research .

Critics for years have vilified the church as a heretical and dangerous cult and questioned its murky finances and how it indoctrinates followers, described in derogatory terms as 'Moonies.' Moon is survived by his wife and 10 of their 13 children. But his eldest son Hyun Jin, the chairman of UCI, which owns the UPI news agency, did not attend the funeral. Church officials did not give details about why he was not there. VIDEO: Thousands gather for 'moonie' church founder's lavish funeral .","Rev.

Doctors are to be offered cash ‘bribes’ to slash the number of patients they send to hospital. GPs have been promised financial incentives of up to £26,000 for their surgery if they take certain measures to reduce referrals. Every time a doctor sends a patient to hospital for a scan, consultation or operation, the local NHS trust is charged for the cost of their treatment. Controversial: Doctors are to be offered cash 'bribes' to slash the number of patients they send to hospital. This is a file picture of Northwick Park Hospital in London . The trusts are trying to save money by urging GPs to cut the numbers of so-called ‘inappropriate’ referrals. But leading doctors, including members of the British Medical Association, say it is ‘unethical’ to pay doctors for effectively withholding treatment. Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the GP committee at the British Medical Association, said: ‘There is no way that paying doctors for withdrawing treatment is acceptable. ‘It produces obvious conflicts of interest. You cannot ever have the patient in front of you think that it’s in your interests not to treat them. ‘It’s not just me that thinks this – I’ve yet to find someone who thinks it’s a good idea. I don’t sense overall enthusiasm. ‘I’m very concerned that these schemes are happening.’ Fears: Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the GP committee at the British Medical Association, said it is not acceptable to pay doctors for withdrawing treatment . Under a scheme proposed by Harrow Primary Care Trust, in North West London, doctors have been promised up to £4 for every patient in their practice if they follow certain steps aimed at cutting referrals. The amount of money each practice gets depends on the number of patients on its books and whether it meets  all of the ‘referral’ targets that are set by the PCT. To get the full amount, practices must follow a number of steps, which include reducing their referrals by up to 10 per cent. They must draw up lists giving details of the name of the patient referred, the reason they were sent to hospital and the GP who ordered it. The practice must also nominate a GP to scrutinise every patient referral to hospital, to ensure they are ‘appropriate’. The scheme covers all referrals, ranging from patients sent for scans to rule out possible cancer to those needing to see a specialist for a hip or knee replacement. If a practice meets all the criteria it will get £4 for every patient on its books. If it only fulfils some, it may get just £1 or £2 per patient. An average-sized practice with 6,500 patients stands to earn a maximum of £26,000 extra, provided it meets all the targets. Doctors could then decide to spend the money as they wished, on better facilities for the surgery or to increase their salaries, for example. The number of referrals varies hugely between practices depending on whether the local NHS trust has policies to try to limit them, patients’ average age, and their illnesses. But a surgery with 6,500 patients is likely to send between 650 and 1,300 to hospital a year. A spokesman for Harrow PCT said the proposals were still ‘under discussion’ and had not yet been implemented. The PCT also insisted the scheme was meant to be in patients’ ‘best interests’ and that they were trying to improve care while making the best use of NHS money. Other trusts and clinical commissioning groups – organisations of GPs, which will in future be responsible for designing local health services – are also offering money to practices that cut referrals, although the rewards are not as high. Changes: GPs have been promised financial incentives of up to £26,000 for their surgery if they take certain measures to reduce referrals. This picture is posed by a model . At Hardwick Clinical Commissioning Group, in Derbyshire, practices are offered 25p per patient, up to around £1,600 in total, if they cut referrals. Luton PCT, in Bedfordshire, is also proposing to offer practices extra funding to cut referrals, though the details are still being drawn up. A spokesman for Harrow PCT said: ‘This proposed scheme is about improving the clinical quality of referrals in the patient’s best interest. ‘The scheme is explicit in stating that patients must be referred where clinically appropriate at all times and that the process will ensure the best and most rapid treatment for that patient.’ Although the NHS has been protected from cuts to its budget, it has been ordered to make £20billion of savings by 2014 by running more efficiently. Whitehall officials say the savings are necessary to ensure there is enough money to care for the increasing elderly population. But in the face of such stringent targets, many NHS trusts have resorted to trying to slash referrals, rationing certain treatments and cutting back on the number of staff. Some trusts are trying to reduce spending by sending patients to other surgeries or clinics which offer scans or specialist services such as physiotherapy, rather than sending them to hospital, because it is cheaper.","Local NHS trusts are trying to save money by urging GPs to cut the numbers of so-called ‘inappropriate’ referrals .

'Dangerous situation': Mark Duggan (pictured) was shot by police marksmen as he got out of a minicab with a loaded gun and motioned as if he was about to shoot, a court has heard . Mark Duggan was preparing to aim a gun . when he was killed by police in a shooting that triggered the summer . riots last year, a court was told yesterday. Officers said the suspected gangster . started to ‘bring round’ the converted black pistol ‘as if to shoot’ before they opened fire. The weapon, a BBM Bruni Model 92 held . in an adapted black sock, was found on a grass verge nearby with a . single 9mm bullet in the magazine. Dramatic details of the confrontation . were revealed at the trial of an ‘associate’ accused of passing him the . gun just 15 minutes earlier. Kevin Hutchinson-Foster, 30, faces . claims he handed over the gun in a women’s shoe box while a police . surveillance team waited nearby. The death of Duggan at the hands of . police triggered rioting that spread like wildfire across English cities . over four nights in August last year. It is the first time police have revealed what happened when a team of armed undercover officers surrounded his minicab. Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said Duggan had been under surveillance by the Metropolitan Police for two days when he was killed. He said police officers followed him . as he travelled to meet Hutchinson-Foster outside his girlfriend’s house . in Leyton, East London, on August 4. When his minicab moved on they decided . to launch a ‘hard stop’ operation, intercepting the vehicle and . arresting 29-year-old Duggan. Mr Brown told Snaresbrook Crown Court that events took place ‘very quickly’ in Ferry Lane, in Tottenham, North London. He said: ‘The armed police surrounded the cab. As Mark Duggan got out he was seen to have a gun in his hand ... ‘The police marksmen were in no doubt . that this was as dangerous position as possible - gun in hand, and he . was seen to bring it round as if to shoot. ‘The gun was found to be loaded with a bullet and Mark Duggan was shot. He fell to the ground fatally injured. ‘From that moment until the ambulances and helicopter ambulance arrived they sought to resuscitate him but to no avail. ‘The gun was found on the grass bank that runs along the side of Ferry Lane. It was still in the sock.’ Scene: Paramedics attend to Mr Duggan after he was shot in Ferry Lane, Tottenham, north London . Mr Duggan was handed the weapon just 15 minutes before he was killed, a trial has heard . The jury was told telephone analysis, . forensic evidence and witness accounts link Hutchinson-Foster with the . gun and his meeting with Duggan. Mr Brown said he repeatedly called him and evidence from their phones and the minicab’s GPS laid bare their movements. The gun was found in a black sock with . the toe ripped to expose the barrel and the heel opened to allow access . to the cocking lever, the court was told. Forensic tests revealed it was covered in DNA from Hutchinson-Foster and a second man, barber Peter Osadebay. Hutchinson-Foster admitted attacking . and pistol-whipping Mr Osadebay during an attack at a hairdressing salon . in Dalston, East London, six days earlier. CCTV images showed how the two men . rowed before Hutchinson-Foster returned with the gun, pointing it at his . victim’s chest and hitting him over the head with it. Flashpoint: Mr Duggan's death on August 4 last year sparked riots which started in Tottenham (above) and spread across the capital and the country . Mr Brown said the gun was originally . held in a cardboard yellow and black River Island shoe box belonging to . Hutchinson-Foster’s girlfriend. When it was examined Duggan’s fingerprints were found on it in a position which showed he must have opened it, it was claimed. Mr Brown told the jury it was not . their task to decide ‘the rights and wrongs of the shooting of Mark . Duggan’ as these will be addressed in an inquest next year. He said: ‘They were tragic events in . Ferry Lane, on any account. But the issue for you, the jury, in this . case is who supplied the gun to Mark Duggan.’ Prosecutors allege Mr Duggan collected the weapon from Kevin Hutchinson-Foster in Leyton, east London, before continuing to Tottenham (above), where the riots later broke out . Hutchinson-Foster, of no fixed abode, . denies selling or transferring a prohibited firearm to Mr Duggan between . 28 July and 5 August last year. He told police he was attacked by up . to ten men, including Duggan, and was hit on the head with the gun . several days before the two incidents.

Semi-naked women yesterday protested outside Downing Street to demand justice for rape victims ahead of a 'SlutWalk' march on Saturday. The group called on the Prime Minister to ensure the criminal justice system takes rape and sexual assault cases more seriously. The controversial 'SlutWalk' movement began in 2011 . after a Canadian policeman caused an outcry by telling a group of . students that women should 'avoid dressing like sluts' in order to avoid . being sexually assaulted. It prompted protest marches by women wearing very little. Scroll down to watch the protest . Protest: Women stand in little more than underwear outside Downing Street . Demonstration: The women read out a prepared statement calling for more rape prosecutions . Hundreds of women are expected to take part in the London march this weekend - the latest protest by the movement which now has a worldwide following. Yesterday, around a dozen protesters braved the chilly autumnal weather in their underwear to protest opposite Downing Street to send a message to David Cameron. Student Anastasia Richardson, 18, said: 'All the failings of the police and courts, they are only allowed to happen because there is not proper supervision at the top, because rape is not being made a priority within the justice system.' She claimed that only seven per cent of reported rapes resulted in a successful prosecution and added: 'Rape is essentially legal in this country. That is very much his (Mr Cameron’s) responsibility to stop.' Spreading the message: The campaigners hope to increase support with another march on Saturday . Claims: The SlutWalk movement says police and the courts do not take rape crime as seriously as they should . Criticism: Prime Minister David Cameron (left) is accused of not doing enough to ensure rapists are jailed. Kenneth Clarke (right) did little to help with controversial comments about rape last year . Ms Richardson, from London, added: 'We want the police and courts to make rape more of a priority so more rapists get convicted. 'We want the police to take more care when they investigate cases because what we are seeing at the moment is evidence is lost, police don’t look at CCTV footage for example before it’s destroyed.' She also urged the Crown Prosecution Service to take more cases to court. Last year, then Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke sparked debate on the issue in this country when he declared that some rapes are more serious than others. He suggested there . were differences between 'serious', 'proper', 'forcible', and 'date . rape', as well as consensual sex with underage girls. Challenged that 'rape is rape', whatever the circumstances, the Justice Secretary replied: 'No it's not.' Outrage: Protesters taking to the streets last summer after the SlutWalk campaign started . Statement: Marchers in New York walked in their underwear and one even went topless last summer to make the statement that . women should be able to wear what they want without risk of sexual . attack . Reaction: The march was organised after an NYPD . officer 'advised' women not to wear short skirts . Date rapes, Mr Clarke insisted, 'vary extraordinarily from one to another'. In fact, the law makes no distinction between so-called date rapes or attacks by strangers. He was later forced to apologise but in subsequent appearances, he said a 'classic' rape was when a stranger . grabbed an 'unwilling' woman from the street and should draw a sentence . of 'ten years plus'. Since the SlutWalk movement began in 2011, it has aimed to highlight a culture of blame aimed at victims of sex crime instead of the attackers. Thousands of members of SlutWalk have already marched in cities across the U.S and Canada to display anger at the original comments made by police officer Michael Sanguinetti in a health and safety talk to students at Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto. The London march in June from Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square was organised through SlutWalk's London Facebook page and attended by around 5,000 people. Worldwide: The SlutWalk movement began in . January last year after a Toronto policeman said women should not dress like . 'sluts' if they wanted to avoid rape . Variety of costumes: Some protesters wore jeans and T-shirts, while others wore a lot less last summer .","Rape campaigners say justice system must take sex crimes more seriously .

A ten-year-old girl has been left unable to walk, talk or feed herself after being struck down by a mystery condition five years ago. Brianna Skriver was an active little girl until she contracted an illness which has confined her to a wheelchair and left doctors baffled. Brianna, who lives in Davenport, Florida with her mother and brother, was recently accepted as one of only 100 people onto a study which re-examines undiagnosed conditions. Devastating: Brianna Skriver, ten, has been confined to a wheelchair since falling ill with a mysterious condition five years ago which left her unable to walk or talk . Her mother Tammy Skriver told MailOnline that five years ago, her daughter had started regular kindergarten, played soccer, loved to dance and run around on the playground with her friends. Tammy, a single mother, said: 'I started noticing that her run was different and . I went to the doctor to ask for a referral to a neurologist.' Initially doctors believed that Brianna had ADHD and prescribed her medication which her mother said left her daughter lethargic, wetting herself and with slurred speech. Finally a referral by a neurologist saw Brianna being treated at Duke Medical Center in North Carolina at the age of six. Tammy said Brianna, now ten, has . undergone rounds of painful and invasive testing including skin and . muscle biopsies, blood tests, spinal taps and scans. Everything has come back normal or negative, leaving doctors unable to ever reach a diagnosis. The ten-year-old stopped being able to swallow food last May and now must use a feeding tube. Tammy said: 'Day to day, it's . extremely hard. Brianna is extremely frustrated and often has outbursts. I'm on a fixed income and it is difficult to work in between making . different doctors' appointments along with occupational and physical . therapy. 'My Dad, who is a retired Vietnam veteran, is here to help out but I mostly look after Brianna alone.' She added: 'Going from having a normal healthy child who is active and laughing, to a child that cannot walk or talk or tell me her pains is excruciating,"" Full of life: Brianna, pictured several years ago, was always an active child according to her mother Tammy before an unknown illness left her unable to walk and talk . Devoted: Tammy Skriver, a single mother-of-two, now takes care of her daughter full-time at the family's home in Florida . Brianna was accepted by the National Institutes of Health's Undiagnosed Disease Program last year as one of only 100 new cases. The Institute is flooded with thousands of requests for help each year. Doctors extensively retested Brianna but were once again unable to diagnose her condition. They have suggested a genetic mutation may be causing her illness  - but DNA research could take years to complete. Brianna has an older brother Austin, 16, . who has never displayed signs of the condition. Tammy added that no . one in her family has ever been diagnosed or shown symptoms of a genetic disease . A glimmer of hope came when Tammy came across the story of six-year-old Carli Breytenbich who came to North Carolina from South Africa for treatment for a condition with similar signs to Brianna's illness. Carli's condition had vastly improved while staying at the Ronald McDonald house in Charlotte after she was put on a carefully monitored diet and given vitamin supplements. Tammi believes that an IV treatment given to six-year-old Carli could work for her daughter - but she is unable to access the expensive medication which costs  $1,800 every shipment as Brianna is only covered by Medicare. A veterans' charity has so far donated a ramp to give the family wheelchair access to their Florida home. The family is fundraising to care for Brianna and work to find a cure for her via the Facebook page Friends of Brianna. Donations can be made via a PayPal link on the page or by visiting Wells Fargo branches and asking to donate to the account Friends of Brianna Inc.","Brianna Skriver has been confined to a wheelchair after contracting illness 5 years ago which doctors have never been able to diagnose .

Professional: Four 'cutting explosives,' imported from the United States, were placed inside the old ship as part of its carefully planned sinking . A team of specialists had filled the 86m long vessel with 'cutting' explosives which would send it safely to the bottom of the sea about three miles off of Alvor, in the southern Algarve. The equipment was imported . from the US and put in place by a team from . Canadian Artificial Reef (CAR) Consulting, who specialise in this type of work. The group has previously sunk ships as artificial reefs in other parts of the world, including off the coast of Spain, New Zealand and Australia. The vessel had been carefully filled with 220 tons of concrete before it was sunk to ensure it came to rest in the correct position. Sinking ships for use as diving sites is a skilled process aimed at making them as safe as possible for use by people and for the marine environment. Ships are purged of oils, hydraulic fluids, and other dangerous chemicals and much of their superstructure is removed. The inside of ships are normally gutted of all parts that corrode quickly, and would be dangerous to divers if they came loose. Some parts can be sold for scrap including materials such as copper wiring. Sinking feeling: Smoke billows from the ship's funnel as it begins to take on water following the blast .

'As I pursue the #NFL, the #UFL will be a . vessel to gain experience, and prepare me for a possible mid season . pick up or next NFL season!' Banks wrote on Twitter. Banks was 16 and had just been offered a scholarship to USC when Wanetta Gibson accused him of sexual assault and kidnapping in 2002. He . was on the way to the school office to talk about his college . applications when he bumped into Gibson, a fellow student, and they went . to a stairwell to make out, his attorney Justin Brooks said.

Banks . maintained they had not had sex and all sexual contact had been . consensual. Yet his then-lawyer encouraged the . promising student to plead no contest to the kidnap and rape charges, . warning Banks he could get 41 years to life in prison if convicted. Expecting he would serve just 18 months instead, he followed the advice and pleaded no contest - and was put behind bars for nearly six years - but he never lost sight of his NFL dream. He told ESPN he has been seriously training since last October,: 'After all I’ve been through these last 10 years, I can still do some things that will impress you.'

'One of life's beautiful people': New mother Kirsty Treloar was stabbed 29 times by violent ex-lover Myles Williams . A young mother was stabbed to death by her 'violent and controlling' ex-lover in front of their baby daughter, just hours after he promised not to hit her again. Myles Williams, 19, broke into Kirsty Treloar's family home and stabbed her dozens of times on January 2 this year, after she told him she did not want to see him. The teenager knifed his victim's sister and brother as they tried in vain to protect their 20-year-old sibling at the house in Hackney, east London, before dragging Miss Treloar into his car and driving away. A court heard how Williams, of Clapton, pulled up when he came across a friend a short distance away and told him: 'I just stabbed my girl and she ain't breathing,' before casually smoking a cigarette. He then dumped Miss Treloar's body behind some wheelie bins, abandoned his car and fled. Mere hours before the attack, Williams had sent Miss Treloar - who had given birth to their daughter weeks earlier - a text message to tell her his new year's resolution was not to hit her again. Williams is facing a life sentence after being found guilty of murdering the trainee nursery nurse following a trial at the Old Bailey. The jury was told how the teenager sent a text to Miss Treloar on New Year's day which read: 'Okay wer all gud now and my new yrs ressy is that i aint going to hit u again and i won't hit u 4 this yr next yr the yr after that the next yr after that.' 'Violent and controlling': Myles Williams was found guilty of murdering Kirsty Treloar at the Old Bailey . Crispin Aylett QC, prosecuting, said of the message: 'This can only be described as a conditional new year's resolution. It ended the following morning.' Miss Treloar - who had tried 'many . times' to cut all ties with abusive Williams - replied to his text at . 6.30am on the morning of January 2 and told him she did not want to see . him. The teenager then . forced his way into her east London home and launched himself at Miss . Treloar, who was holding their baby daughter. After . hitting his ex-girlfriend several times Williams launched a frenzied . knife attack, stabbing Miss Treloar 29 times and wounding her sister . Gemma, 24, and brother Dean, 23, as they tried desperately to intervene. 'Family ripped apart': Kirsty Treloar's sister Gemma, left, and brother Dean, right, photographed outside the Old Bailey, were both wounded as they tried to protect their sibling from her violent ex-boyfriend Myles Williams . The court heard how Gemma Treloar was stabbed in the arm as she pleaded with Williams not to take her sister - described by the Sheffield University student as 'one of life's beautiful people'. When Dean Treloar tried to defend his sisters Williams stabbed him three times in the chest. Williams then dragged his wounded ex-girlfriend to his car, drove a distance of two miles, then stopped to speak to a friend and buy cigarettes. The pair stood next to the car smoking before Williams dumped the young mother's body and fled. Scene: Myles Williams, 19, burst into Kirsty Treloar's family home in east London on January 2 and stabbed her 29 times . The court was told how Williams and Miss Treloar met in early January 2011 while he was working sweeping the streets outside Hackney Job Centre. Miss Treloar briefly moved in with the 19-year-old but the relationship quickly turned sour due to his 'violent and controlling' nature and she returned to the family home in Hackney. In a witness statement read out in court, Miss Treloar's mother Pamela Dabney said her daughter had obtained a child care qualification and was looking forward to her life as a new mother and to working with children. 'Myles Williams has taken a decent, loving, close family and ripped us up,' she said. 'The last year of Kirsty's life was made a living hell by someone who was jealous of her relationship with her family and friends. 'Kirsty tried many times to cut all ties but unfortunately she felt she had no means of escape.' Williams was found guilty of murdering Kristy Treloar and of wounding Gemma Treloar and Dean Treloar. He is due to be sentenced on Wednesday.

"Comes days after new BBC director general, George Entwistle, vows to put more older women on TV . By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 10:09 EST, 22 September 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:18 EST, 22 September 2012 . Outspoken: Miriam O'Reilly has attacked the BBC over its attitude to older women . Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly has launched a scathing attack on the BBC - claiming she was greeted with a 'hostile attitude' upon returning to the organisation after winning an employment tribunal against them. Ms O'Reilly won her case for age discrimination against the BBC after she was dropped from the popular TV series three years ago. But she claims she continued to be treated unfairly when she returned to the organisation to present Crimewatch Roadshow and was forced to leave just nine-months into a three year contract. This latest accusation comes shortly after the new director general of the BBC, George Entwistle, vowed to put more older women on shows. In a 1,800-word letter to the BBC's head of complaints, Ms O'Reilly argued that all apologies and offers of work from Mr Entwistle and his predecessor Mark Thompson were just 'a PR damage-limitation exercise'. According to the Guardian, she wrote that it was 'clear that I was not going to receive fair treatment' and alleged that a member of the production team 'appeared to be on a mission to humiliate and undermine my confidence'. She continued: 'On one occasion he was cueing me as 'Hayley' during a live broadcast and laughing. 'When we came off air and I asked him why, he said it was because I reminded him of Hayley Cropper, a transsexual character in Coronation Street. I objected but the following day a picture of Hayley Cropper had been stuck to my sound pack for all to see.' Making changes: New BBC director general George Entwistle, left, has vowed to increase the number of older women on TV while the former director general Mark Thompson, right, has also previously admitted the BBC has too few . Mr Entwistle said not enough had been done to promote female experts or ensure that they took part in news programmes. He said: ‘We have made real progress in actively looking for, and finding, great female experts to front our big factual shows, but it’s not enough, and the world will always be profoundly demanding of the BBC on this question, and it should be. ‘The Today programme struggles because we are dealing with party politics as it is, dealing with the world as it is, and that’s a very male place. What the BBC often reflects is the way the world is.’ In an interview with the Radio Times, he claimed progress had been made with female presenters such as Mary Beard of Meet the Romans and Lucy Worsley of Antiques Uncovered. And the director-general said he would love to see the return of Miriam O’Reilly, the presenter who won an age discrimination case against the broadcaster after she was dropped from Countryfile. So her latest remarks will comes as a bit of a blow. Ms O'Reilly also complained that she not been invited to take part in discussions on ageism on BBC shows following her employment tribunal win. She wrote: 'This cumulative action is not what one would expect of a fair and balanced BBC, but it clearly shows the level of animosity which exists and which has denied me my career. 'I won my case unanimously, but the attitude of some executives following my return to work shows a contempt for the law. The way I've been treated isn't worthy of the BBC, or what the BBC stands for.' A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has apologised both privately and publicly to Miriam for what happened to her and, as an organisation, we have made sure we learned lessons from it. As recently as this week George Entwistle said he would welcome Miriam back to the BBC if she had a great idea for a programme – the same challenge he has laid down to programme-makers nationwide. 'It would not be right however for Miriam to appear on every single debate about ageism across the BBC as it would risk limiting the range of voices and opinions that audiences could hear.'","Comes days after new BBC director general, George Entwistle, vows to put more older women on TV ."

A married father of two-year-old twin boys that collapsed and died while playing cricket at Lord's, tragically died of natural causes. Philip Standing, 30, had just bowled his second over at the seven-a-side team-building session with colleagues from Lloyds Bank and LPG law firm when he sat down, feeling unwell. Moments later the accountant from Caterham, Surrey fell off his chair face first and began convulsing on June 28 at the indoor centre at the famous cricket grounds in St John's Wood, London. Family left behind: Philip Standing, right, died of natural causes at Lord's indoor cricket centre, leaving behind his wife Kate Standing, left, and two-year-old twin boys Ben and Oliver, centre . Despite being treated by paramedics, doctors and friends he died in hospital just over an hour later. A post-mortem found that Mr Standing, who was largely healthy and loved sport, suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and had a history of high cholesterol. At Westminster Coroner’s Court, colleague Brenda Fleming said in her witness statement that the match had been ‘light-heated,’ and ‘not very energetic.’ She said: ‘Philip had recently bowled his second over and moved around the field to change position before he left the field to sit down. ‘Although the hall was very warm this seemed unusual because the game was not very energetic. 'Only moments before leaving the field he was chatting and joking and had not shown any signs of feeling unwell. ‘Someone gave him a bottle of water . but before he managed to drink it he dropped it and fell face-first off . the chair he was sitting on. He fell face-first and did not use his arms . to stop him. ‘He was convulsing... he was breathing and groaning at this point.’ At the hearing: Mr Standing's family, including his wife, second from left, and his mother Sue Standing, third from left, heard how his post-mortem revealed he suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and had a history of high cholesterol levels . His teammates put him in the recovery position and called 999 while one attempted CPR. Ms Fleming said blood was on his lips and that he improved slightly after chest compressions were performed but ‘zoned out’ shortly afterwards. Paramedic James Chapman said Mr Standing had no pulse and was not breathing. He and colleagues performed CPR and used a defibrillator on him as they drove to St Mary’s Hospital, West London. His teammates followed in a taxi, but Mr Standing died before they arrived at the hospital. Accident and Emergency Doctor Julian Redhead said a team of medics treated Mr Standing who was suffering a heart attack when he arrived at hospital. He said: ‘Unfortunately the attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and the patient was declared to have died at 7:55pm.’ Coroner Jean Harkin ruled a verdict of . death by natural causes. She paid tribute to Mr Standing, describing him . as ‘a young, well-liked, very sporty man who loved sport and was . playing it when he had a cardiac event’. Bonding session: Mr Standing was rushed to St Mary's Hospital after the 'light-hearted' cricket game at the indoor centre at Lord's Cricket Ground, pictured, but died just over an hour after he collapsed . She said: ‘It is a very tragic loss of life. The cause of death given is heart disease, as a result of (a coronary artery problem) and hypercholesterolemia.’ His GP, a Dr Corey described Mr Standing as ‘slightly overweight’ and that his cholesterol was slightly higher than average at 7.1 in January this year but that he had declined drugs to treat it and brought it down to 6.04 by May. A microscopic examination of his heart during the post-mortem showed that showed areas of inflammation and a plaque build-up. A report by pathologist Dr Michael Osborn described Mr Standing as suffering from a ‘sudden cardiac death due to coronary artery disease’. He said: ‘He has a history of hypercholesterolemia, which is significant.’ Westminster coroner’s officer, Kim Bedwell, said Mr Standing met wife Kate while studying at Warwickshire University in Coventry, where he obtained a first class degree in maths. The pair married in 2007 and Mrs Standing gave birth to twin boys in 2010. Ms Bedwell said: ‘From an early age he developed a love of all sport. He was a good all-rounder but his favourite sport was football, something which played a very big part in his life. ‘Philip achieved a lot in his short life and will be remembered for his generosity of spirit, innate modesty and sense of style.’ He then climbed the corporate ladder at top firms KPMG and Ernst and Young, before being seconded to Lloyds banking group in 2012.","Philip Standing died from a sudden cardiac arrest after playing cricket at a team-building session .

Letitia Baldrige, White House Social Secretary to former first lady Jackie Kennedy, has died aged 86 . Jackie Kennedy’s social secretary and etiquette expert, Letitia Baldrige, has died at the age 86. The queen of manners, who educated America on everything from how to eat gracefully to the art of letter writing, passed away on Monday at the Sunrise at Fox Hill nursing facility in Bethesda, Maryland. According to her longtime friend Mary M Mitchell, she had severe osteoarthritis and cardiac complications. Before joining the Kennedy White House to help her friend and fellow Vassar alumna, the former Jacqueline Bouvier, Ms Baldrige served as the public relations director at Tiffany & Co. She was reportedly the company’s first female executive. As part of the Kennedy administration she was responsible for organizing and issuing invitations to glittering social occasions and state dinners. She left her post in June 1963, less than six months before President John F Kennedy’s assassination. Explaining the reason behind her resignation, she said that she ‘ had had it,’ with the long hours and demands of the job. However, in a 1964 interview for the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, she remembered the Kennedys as perfectionists and the president as an exemplary manager. Ms Baldrige, known as Tish, recalled: ‘He was like a wonderful department store manager who goes through the store and knows everybody’s name and knows how all the departments work and knows how to wrap packages better than the wrappers in the wrapping department.’ Letitia Baldrige, standing left, looks on as a smiling Jackie Onassis throws the dice as she plays 'Counterstrike' with the game's inventor, Roger Tuckerman in 1975 .

She went on to found Letitia Baldrige Enterprises, a public relations and marketing firm, which had offices in Chicago, New York and Washington. And since the late 1970s, she became known for her memoirs and books on etiquette, notably her updated version of The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette in 1978. When her face appeared on the cover of Time magazine the same year, she was hailed as the nation’s ‘social arbiter’ of ‘new American manners’. Ms Baldrige was born on February 9, 1926, to the future Republican congressman Howard Baldrige and his wife Regina and spent her childhood in Omaha. It was at Miss Porter’s private school in Farmington, Connecticut, that she first met Jacqueline Bouvier. From the start she was an admirer of the future First Lady. She wrote later: ‘Her classic good looks were complemented by her sense of style. Nothing ever looked wrong on her.’ Ms Baldrige is survived by her husband, Robert Hollensteiner, their two children,  Clare and Malcom, and seven grandchildren.

Accused: Graham Lawler managed to take the deceased's purse after tricking the police officer present to leave the room . An undertaker is facing jail after swiping a purse from the corpse of a woman less than an hour after she died. Grahame Lawler carried out the crime when he was called to remove the body of the 78-year-old from the living room of her home. A court heard he conned a police officer into leaving the room for a moment so he could get his hands on her purse. Lawler, who committed the crime while employed by Co-operative Funeralcare, managed to swindle her credit cards and details of her PIN number. The 37-year-old, who once served in the armed forces, stole Muriel Swift’s purse containing £200 while he was preparing to escort her body to a mortuary. He pleaded guilty to the theft at a hearing at Cambridge Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday, where he represented himself. The case has now been committed to Cambridge Crown Court for sentencing at a later date, where Lawler could face being jailed. Lawler, who has now stopped working for the funeral home, claimed he carried out the theft as 'a way out' from the 'nasty and horrible things' he had seen at work. He said: 'For six-and-a-half years I have been in this job and have seen some very vile nasty and horrible things. 'Decomposed bodies, people that have been run over, things like that. 'I saw the purse, I did take it and I thought it was the way out. 'I have never done anything like this before and I’m sorry.' Cambridge Magistrate’s Court heard a police officer arrived at Mrs Swift’s home on July 6 and checked the deceased’s handbag to trace her next of kin. Lawler, of Fulbourn, Cambridgeshire, then asked the police officer to pass some paperwork to his colleague outside - giving him the 10 second window he needed to carry out his crime. During proceedings the charge was changed from theft from a person to theft from a pending estate. He had originally been due to appear in court on Monday but failed to turn up and went on the run. A 'despicable' crime: A spokeswoman for The Co-operative Funeral Care said they are 'pleased Mr Lawler admitted his guilt' and that he has since left their employment . A warrant was issued for his arrested and Lawler handed himself into police on Wednesday before being taken straight to court that day. Prosecutor Philip Alcock, said: 'This was in the strictest sense a gross, gross breach of trust, particularly as he was trusted by the officer, who was comfortable leaving him there for 10 seconds. 'It must have left him wondering ""if I can’t leave the undertaker in the presence of the deceased, what can I do?""' The police officer later noticed the purse was missing from the bag and told colleges to apprehend Lawler who was then arrested while at the mortuary in Papworth Hospital, Cambridge. Lawler was found with the purse stuffed up his sleeve and cash cards with PIN details written on pieces of paper.

She says of the 15th-century coaching inn: 'It was a lovely little pub and having read the sign, I imagined hundreds of them dotted all over the country. 'I came up with this mad idea of visiting them and then I discovered an app called CaskFinder which I realised could easily help me track down scores of Red Lions.' At every pub she visits, Cathy poses for a photograph and usually downs her favourite tipple - a half pint of ale. Smile! Cathy poses for a photo at every pub she visits . What have I signed up for?

She’s also collected a huge array of souvenirs from landlords including beer mats, glasses, pub t-shirts and menus. The length of her visits vary - from just half an hour in her lunch break to weeks away on trips dedicated to visiting as many Red Lions as possible. If the pub has its own accommodation, Cathy tries to stay the night to get the 'complete experience'. So far Cathy’s furthest trip has been from her home in Preston to the Red Lion at Penzance, Cornwall - a 750-mile round trip. By the time Cathy finishes her pub pilgrimage, she will have visited hostelries as far apart as Aberdeen in the north to Cornwall in the south. Good progress: The adventure began in April 2011 .

She uses a yellow highlighter to cross off the pubs as she visits them. 'But I have sadly found about 10 per cent of them closed when I get there because they have simply gone out of business. On weekends Cathy will visit several Red Lions, and during the week she sometimes pops out for a swift half at lunch . Keeping trim: Thanks to her job as a personal trainer, Kathy doesn't need to worry about knocking back a few pints and the odd pub lunch . 'I call these Dead Lions and cross them off on my list with a red highlighter. 'It’s a sad state of affairs but many pubs are struggling these days.

'I try to check opening hours on the internet but if I get there and find the times have changed I have to go back.' Cathy travels by train or car, sometimes with her daughter, and often with different friends and family members. 'At first, my friends and family thought I was crazy but they have been won over very quickly - now they enjoy travelling with me. 'A bit rough': Cathy will always stay for a photro, even if she doesn't want to linger . 'We sometimes turn our visits into a holiday or day trip, stopping over for the night if they have nice accommodation. 'The amount of time we spend at each pub really varies.Some of them are really nice and offer a great lunch but others are a bit rough so we nip in and out.' 'I always have a drink and pose for a photograph to keep as a reminder of my visit. Make yourself comfortable: On other occasions the committed pub-crawler will stay the night . 'Some landlords give me a memento too, such as a beer mat, menu or t-shirt, which I keep in a special file at home. Cathy varies her drinks, depending on whether she has to drive, but her job as a personal trainer means she doesn't have to worry about downing a few pints of ale. 'Thankfully, I can enjoy the drinks and lunch knowing my work keeps me active and will burn off the calories. I don’t have a beer belly.' Historic: The popularity of the Red Lion name dates from 1603, when King James I ordered the red lion of the Scottish Royal Arms to be displayed on buildings . Cathy says the most quirky was in Dittisham, Devon, where the pub is also the village post office, souvenir shop, grocery store and bed and breakfast. She has already visited a Red Lion in Dubai and New York and vows to continue her tour abroad once she has conquered the UK. 'There are also a lot of Red Lions around the world, nearly everywhere there is a large ex-pat community. Flying the flag: Cathy wants to look further afield for Red Lion pubs in British expat communities . 'I hope to visit all of them too. 'I must also book a flight out of Gatwick at some point because they have a Red Lion in their departure lounge.' Paul Nunny, from Cask Marque, said: 'The British pub is so engrained in our psyche that some people are driven to do these brilliantly unique things. The lion is very common in coats of . arms, second only to the cross. The red lion was a personal badge of John of . Gaunt, founder of the House of Lancaster whose lands encompassed Cathy's . home town of Preston. The most common origin is probably . from the Royal Arms of Scotland. When the crowns of England and Scotland . were united with the accession of James I and VI in 1603, all public . buildings were ordered to display the red lion as a badge of loyalty to . the house of Stuart. According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the eight most popular pub names in the UK are: . 'I think what Cathy is doing is fantastic. I hope she achieves her goal of visiting every Red Lion in the world.' According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the Red Lion is the most common pub name in the country, with a history dating back centuries.

Art experts will this week claim that Leonardo da Vinci completed a version of the Mona Lisa some ten years before the famous painting which now hangs in the Louvre in Paris. Known as the Isleworth Mona Lisa, the painting is a slightly larger size than the famous portrait and has long been the subject of debate over its authenticity. However, the not-for-profit Mona Lisa Foundation, which was set up to conduct research into the work, is planning to put forward 'historical, comparative and scientific evidence' that will prove once and for all that the painting is by the Italian renaissance artist. A fair likeness: Art experts claim the Isleworth Mona Lisa (left) is an earlier version of The Mona Lisa (right) The claims of the Swiss-based consortium which owns the painting are supported by Professor Alessandro Vezzosi, who has set up his own art museum in Vinci. He will present evidence alongside Professor Carlo Pedretti of the Armand Hammer Center for Leonardo Studies at the University of California. The Isleworth Mona Lisa was discovered shortly before the First World War by Hugh Blaker, an English art collector, while looking through the home of a Somerset nobleman. He bought the painting and took it to his studio in Isleworth, London, from which it takes its name. Art critics conjectured that Leonardo had in fact painted two portraits of Lisa del Giocondo, with one hanging in the Louvre and the other now with Mr Blaker. He in turn sold it to an American collector, Henry F Pulitzer, who in turn left it to his girlfriend. On her death, it was bought by a consortium of unnamed individuals who have kept it in a Swiss bank vault for 40 years. But despite claims the Isleworth Mona Lisa is indeed the work of Leonardo da Vinci, Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of the history of art at Oxford disputes this. On display: Leonardo da Vinci's The Mona Lisa hangs at the Louvre Museum in Paris . Enigma: Did Leonardo da Vinci, as shown in this self portrait, complete an earlier version of his famous work, The Mona Lisa? 'So much is wrong,' he told The Sunday Times. 'The dress, the hair and background landscape. This one is also painted on canvas, which Leonardo rarely did.' Like the majority of his works, The Mona Lisa in the Louvre is in fact painted on wood. And while the lady in the Isleworth Mona Lisa does appear to be a younger version of the model in the more famous painting, Kemp said this did not prove the two were produced by Leonardo da Vinci. 'She might look younger but this is probably because the copyist, and I believe it is a copy done a few years after the Mona Lisa, just painted it that way,' added Mr Kemp.","Experts will claim this week that Leonardo da Vinci completed a version of the Mona Lisa ten years before the famous painting in the Louvre .

A power outage caused by Superstorm Sandy destroyed years of scientific research at a New York hospital, it emerged today. The New York University Hospital saw its generator fail at about 8.30pm on Monday as ferocious winds ravaged the city. At least 200 patients, including 20 babies in neonatal intensive care, were evacuated when it became clear that the hospital's emergency generator also failed to kick in. Paramedics evacuate patients from New York University Hospital after a power outage during Superstorm Sandy on Monday evening. It has now emerged that years of scientific research at the hospital has been lost . But now scientists have discovered that years of research kept at the hospital's Smilow building on East 32nd St has been lost. 'This does not equate to a loss of life, but it is extremely disheartening to see years of research go down the drain,' a source told the New York Daily News. Many valuable preagents, including special enzymes, antibodies and DNA strands, that were generated by scientists and stored at between -80C and -20C have been destroyed. Thousands of genetically modified mice, used by scientists for research into cancer and other diseases, drowned when the flood waters struck. It is understood that it took years to produce the mice. During the height of Monday's storm, dozens of ambulances lined up around the block outside NYU Hospital, to transport its patients to other hospitals around the city. Without power, there were no elevators, meaning patients had to be carefully carried down the stairs to safety. In line: Ambulances waited around the block to evacuate patients from NYU Hospital after the power failure . Huge operation: Medical workers assist a patient into an ambulance during the evacuation . The power cuts came about soon after the massive storm made landfall in southern New Jersey. Consolidated Edison cut power deliberately to about 6,500 customers in downtown Manhattan to avert further damage. Soon, huge swathes of the city went dark. Among those evacuated from NYU Hospital was Julie Alemany, who went into labour at around 6pm on Monday, just as New Yorkers braced themselves for Sandy’s arrival onto land. When the power went, the 34-year-old was told she would need to evacuate, despite the painful contractions that were ripping through her body. ‘I said “I can’t run!”’ she said, describing how she begged for pain relief until she was given a low-dose epidural by the light of a cell phone held by her husband. She was placed on a sled and haphazardly carried down the eight flights of stairs from the hospital by headlamp-wearing security guards. She eventually gave birth in Mount Sinai Hospital shortly after midnight on Tuesday morning.","New York University Hospital's generator failed at 8.30pm on Monday .

If you’re a fortysomething woman, live in the South East, are educated to GCSE level, earn less than £20,000 and have been married for less than seven years then you’re a classic case for an affair, the latest research shows. Men indulging in covert affairs are more likely to be in their late forties or fifties, live in the South East, have a degree, be self-employed, earn between £20,000 to £30,000 a year and be married for less than seven years. The latest research shows that being married for less than seven years and in your forties makes you most likely to have a secret fling . The survey investigated which ages, professions, regions, length of marriage and other lifestyle factors are most prolific in people who cheat on their partner. For both men and women, more than half had been married for less than seven years before they thought about seeking an affair, with eight to 14 years of marriage being the second most category and the numbers steadily declining the longer a couple had been together. Men who are self-employed are most likely to have a secret fling followed by those in executive management. For women, the most common cheaters are among housewives, followed by secretaries. There also seemed to be a link between affairs and how much people earn. Below £20,000 was the most common salary bracket (50 per cent for women and 29 per cent for men) and between £20,000 to £30,000 was second most common. For women, it's their naughty forties when their eyes wander but for misbehaving men it's their fifties . For men only though, there was another spike in those who earn over £60,000. For women, it is during their forties when their eyes wander, with 24 per cent of women looking for an affair aged between 41-45 and 21 per cent aged 46-50. For their male counterparts 19 per cent of cheaters were aged between 46-50, 18 per cent were aged 51-55 and 16 per cent between 41-45. Men who are self-employed are most likely to have a secret fling followed by those in executive management . The most well-behaved age category were the 18-25s. Where you live could also dictate your secret lustiness. The South East outnumbered all the other regions by a long way (39 per cent of women and 34 per cent of men). The Midlands was next most common for men and the South West came in second place for unfaithful women. Ireland and Scotland were the regions with the lowest number of forbidden liaisons. Having two children, it seems, doesn’t bode well on fidelity with 37 per cent of philandering women and 30 per cent of philandering men having two children with their established partner. But having none at all also seems to lend itself towards forbidden trysts (30 per cent of men and 28 per cent of women embarking on affairs were child free). According to maritalaffair.co.uk, which conducted the research, the most overwhelmingly common reason for cheating, which out beat any other category five-fold, was lack of intimacy. While many may not openly admit so in front of their partners, a significant majority of both sexes agreed that an affair could save a marriage.","Those who live in South East most likely to cheat .

Death: Grandmother Hilary Rees blamed herself for the death of her two-year-old grandson who drowned in her garden pond while she slept on the sofa having had eight pints of cider . A grandmother whose toddler grandson drowned in her garden pond while she had fallen asleep drunk took a fatal overdose just two days after attending the memorial of his death, an inquest heard. Hilary Rees, 45, had consumed eight pints of cider when she was supposed to be looking after Daniel Rees-Smith, two in June 2010. She was babysitting the toddler at her home while his parents, Charlotte Rees-Smith, 20, and Andrew Marshall, 22, went to the pub. But Hilary passed out drunk and when his parents returned they found Daniel face down in the pond. Rees, Rees-Smith and Marshall were arrested after Daniel’s death and admitted child neglect charges over a 13 month period. They walked free from court after a judge gave them suspended prison sentences because of the 'heavy burden' they would have to bear. But an inquest at Avon Coroners Court yesterday heard how Rees was later found dead at her home after taking prescription drugs and drinking heavily. Rees died on May 5 this year in her Bristol home two days after a family memorial to mark his 4th birthday - two years after his death. She was found dead after telling family she would be 'better off dead' and taking a cocktail of booze and painkillers. The inquest were told that Rees had a history of alcohol and psychological problems and had previously tried to take an overdose in April. Tragic: Daniel Rees-Smith, 2, died after drowning in a garden pond, whose family neglected him . Shame: Hilary Rees was asleep on the sofa when Daniel died, and took a cocktail of drugs and alcohol to end her life two years later . In a statement Hilary’s daughter Charlotte - Daniel’s mum - said she had received a number of text messages from her the night before her death. She said: 'At about 8.53pm I received a text from her telling me that she loved me. 'I thought that was strange because she doesn’t normally tell me, she told my brother Josh too. 'She sent another message telling me that everyone would be better off is she was dead and everyone blamed her for the death. 'She also told me she wouldn’t do anything stupid.' Accident: The toddler died in the garden of this Bristol home in May 2010 . Rees, Rees-Smith and Marshall were all spared prison after admitting neglecting the toddler at Bristol Crown Court in July last year. His Honour Judge Maddison told the trio losing Daniel had already given them a “heavy burden” to carry. After Daniel’s death, Rees told police: 'It’s my fault - I have killed my grandson. I was meant to be looking after him.' Court: His parents Charlotte Rees-Smith and Andrew Marshall (pictured), as well as Mrs Rees, were arrested and later admitted child neglect charges . Rees was found dead at her dining room table, surrounded by empty medication blister packs and a half drunk pint of cider on May 7. Daniel would have turned four on May 2 - a milestone marked by his friends and family during a poignant memorial gathering on May 5. Rees, daughter Rees-Smith and friends blew balloons with the number four written on them, which were released to the sky. After the inquest Josh Rees-Smith said his mum was deeply loved and would be deeply missed. He said: 'My sister and I are really deeply upset about the fact we have now lost so many family members in such a short amount of time. 'We are gutted mum can’t see her new 8-month-old grandson grow up and spend his first Christmas with his family. 'Despite everything that has been said in the papers she was no pariah as everyone has made her out to be. 'She did a good job raising me and my sister regardless of any demons she had in regards to drinking.' He said his mum was afraid to leave the house and had used every back road possible to avoid people when she had gone out. He added: 'She was a lovely woman and was deeply loved and will be deeply missed.' Assistant Deputy Coroner Dr Peter Harrowing recorded a narrative verdict. He said: 'Hilary Rees was found dead at her home address on May 7. 'She had a known history of drug and alcohol abuse and the GP refers to a known suicide attempt.' During their appearance at Bristol Crown Court prosecutors told how Daniel was left alone with the grandmother up to four times a week. She regularly fell unconscious on the sofa - leaving little Daniel to wander alone - and admitted growing cannabis plants in the loft of her foul smelling house. A serious case review after the case found that authorities were aware of problems with Daniel’s family before he was born. But chances to deal with them were missed due to failures by a number of agencies, including social services, Bristol City Council and Bristol’s youth offending team. Bristol Safeguarding Children Board made six recommendations for 'lessons to be learned' from Daniel’s death.

"By . Tamara Cohen and Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 08:49 EST, 29 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 13:58 EST, 29 October 2012 . A ban on the import of ash trees was today imposed in a bid to tackle the spread of a 'devasting disease' which threatens to wipe out 80million British trees. The ban will prevent ash plants, trees and seeds coming into the UK, and movement restrictions will stop trees from areas infected with Chalara ash dieback being moved elsewhere in the country. It comes after 100,000 trees thought to be carrying the fungal infection were felled and burned and the scientist in charge of tackling its spread warned it would 'change the countryside significantly.' Forest favourite: One of Britain's 80 million ash trees, which could soon be wiped out . Announcing the ban, Environment . Secretary Owen Paterson said: 'This is a very serious disease that . demands action to stop its spread.' Work was already under way to tackle . the disease, he added, including monitoring of trees in infected areas . to ensure early detection and trade bodies had encouraged members to . observe a voluntary moratorium on imports. The ban, which follows an eight-week . consultation which showed strong support for such a move, is being put . in place before the main tree planting season gets under way in mid . November. 'By working together we can protect our native trees from this devastating disease,' Mr Paterson said. Unions at the Forestry Commission last year warned MPs that cuts would leave damage their chances of fighting tree diseases. In a submission to the Commons' science and technology committee they warned a 25 per cent budget cut would hit the agency's ability to detect the spread of disease. According to the Guardian, a leaked staff consultation document from February last year said: 'There is no capacity to deal with costs of disease or other calamity.' Conservationists welcomed the ban, but . warned that the problem facing ash trees was symptomatic of a wider . problem and accused the Government of failing to prioritise protecting . woodlands. Sue Holden, chief executive of the . Woodland Trust, said: 'Ash dieback is only one of numerous tree pests . and diseases present in the UK. 'With more than 15 separate pests and . diseases listed on the Forestry Commission website as already present, . it is crucial that the wider issue is tackled.' Professor Ian Boyd, who is in charge . of the government task force set up to deal with the ash dieback crisis, . yesterday warned the disease's appearance in Britain is 'a disaster for . our ash trees'. Professor Boyd, chief scientific . adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, told . the BBC his team were considering the kind of emergency measures used to . tackle foot and mouth. 'With plants we don't have as instant a . reaction ... as we do with animal pathogens. And maybe we ought to be . moving in that direction,' the Guardian reported him as saying. He added: 'Ecologically it is going to . change the countryside very significantly. Parallels have been made . with Dutch elm disease of the 1970s. This is not good news for the . countryside.' Fungus: Ash dieback can lay undetected for years before killing trees . The fungal infection, which ravaged . other European countries before spreading to the UK, kills 90 per cent . of the trees it affects. Desperate measures are being taken  to . protect Britain’s 80million ash trees, which support wildlife as well . as the £10billion timber industry. Experts believe it may already be too . late to prevent an environmental catastrophe on the scale of the Dutch . elm disease outbreak that destroyed 25million trees in the Seventies and . Eighties. Ministers have been criticised for . failing to act earlier when the parasite was first detected in a nursery . in February. It is now feared to have spread to 20 sites. Mary Creagh, Labour’s environment . spokesman, said the Government – which only opened a consultation on ash . dieback with businesses and scientists last month – had been ‘asleep on . the job’. The disease was found at the start of . the year in a consignment of 2,000 trees imported from the Netherlands, . most of which had already been sold by the time the infection was . detected. Countryside crisis: The fungus now poses the greatest threat to British woodland since the 1970s . Last week the first cases in mature . trees were confirmed in East Anglia. Saplings in Leicestershire, . Yorkshire, Buckinghamshire and Scotland have also been affected. Ash dieback’s microscopic fungus – . chalara fraxinea – infects the leaves, bark and wood of ash trees, . causing them to develop black spots and cankers, and then wither and . die. Stop dieback: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is 'ready to go' on the ban which has been blamed for the introduction of the fungus in Britain . Owen Paterson, the Environment . Secretary, said yesterday: ‘We will be introducing a ban on imports. I . have already prepared the legislation and we are ready to go.’ The . movement of saplings around the country will also be strictly . controlled. A task force of 100 people from the . Forestry Commission and other bodies are now tracing all ash imports . into the UK for the past five years – at thousands of sites – in an . attempt to trace when the disease first arrived here. Ash dieback has devastated mainland . Europe, from where more than a million of Britain’s ash trees have been . imported over the past two years. It has all but wiped out common ash . species in Denmark, Poland and Lithuania. A survey has found 20 ‘suspicious’ sites in Britain, but they are yet to be confirmed by scientists. Stuart Burgess, of the Forestry . Commission, said it was a race against time to detect new cases before . the falling of autumn leaves made them very difficult to track. There are concerns that the fungus may . have been lurking undetected for several years, as it can take this . long before it becomes apparent. Scientists are not certain how it . spreads, but they suspect it is carried by rain, wind or insects. About 58,000 trees have been burned in Scotland so far, with a further 40,000 destroyed around the rest of the UK. The Horticultural Trades Association . said it first raised the issue of ash dieback in 2009, when it called . for import restrictions. At that stage the disease was thought to be . caused by a fungus already endemic in Britain, making a ban ineffective. It has since been discovered that the fungus is a new one. Tim Briercliffe of the HTA said it was . ‘hugely disappointing’ that the Government had not acted more quickly. National tragedy: Timber is a £10 billion a year industry threatened by the ash dieback disease crisis . ‘We are looking for Defra to provide compensation for growers that have suffered as . a result of this,’ he added. Steve Marsh, of the Woodland Trust, . said: ‘We feel this hasn’t been taken as seriously as it should. We . should have an emergency summit like we had with foot and mouth disease. 'This could rip massive holes in our landscape – it kills the tree, so . it could easily be as bad as Dutch elm disease.’ Dame Fiona Reynolds, the outgoing . director-general of the National Trust, warned that an outbreak in the . UK could be ‘horrific’. ‘We’re just praying that this ash dieback can be . understood, and managed, quickly,’ she said. Harry Cotterell, president of the . Country Land & Business Association, said it was a ‘great pity’ that . an ash tree ban was not announced earlier in the year to prevent . further imports from Europe, where the disease is rife. Mr Paterson denied that the Government . had taken too long to act, saying a ‘detailed process’ would be carried . out at 1,000 sites to identify where trees had come from. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said: 'As soon as the first case was . confirmed in February, we immediately began to trace its source, so we . could get it under control and minimise the spread of the disease. 'We immediately arranged for any . infected trees to be destroyed. 'We held urgent talks with the industry . about the impact of Chalara Fraxinea resulting in a voluntary import . ban. 'I announced last week that a ban on the import of ash trees and . movement controls within the UK would come into force on Monday, . well before the planting season begins. 'I have set up a new plant health task . force which will look at further ways to prevents pests and diseases . from entering the country in the future.'","Government criticised for taking so long to act against killer tree fungus .

The body of 12-year-old Pierre Barnes is thought to have been found off the Riviera Coast - five days after he went missing while exploring a holiday resort. Divers discovered the body this afternoon on the seabed on the French island of Porquerolles at 4pm British time. It is understood to have been identified by his parents after being recovered following an extensive search of the island. Pierre Barnes, pictured here with parents Stephen and Florence Barnes, went missing on Saturday afternoon while on a bicycle ride . His British father Stephen Barnes, a company director from Grantham, Lincolnshire, and his French mother Florence raised the alarm after Pierre failed to return as night fell in 100mph winds and mountainous seas. More than 100 French firemen, Gendarmes and soldiers plus volunteers scoured the island for three days without finding any sign of the boy. His cycle with its chain derailed and one of his shoes were found near a cove which he had told his parents he wanted to visit. Mayor of the town of Hyères on the French . mainland Jacques Politi said this afternoon that the theory that Pierre . met with an accident was the most probable in what he described as . ‘hostile weather conditions’. Tragic: Rescue teams have discovered a body after a five-day search . Identification: It is thought that Pierre's parents have since identified the body found on the seabed . Divers discovered the body on the seabed on the French island of Porquerolles at 4pm British time . Prosecutor Xavier Tarabeux revealed that sniffer dogs brought in to search for him had all led their handlers to the sea shore close to where the bike was found. This led them to believe that Pierre had probably been swept out to sea by a wave. Pierre was the youngest of four children who had gone to the island for a week’s half term break and were staying in rented accommodation. In a television interview Mr Barnes . said this week that three days after his disappearance, the family were . starting to come to terms with the fact that he was probably dead. He described his youngest son as a ‘cheerful little fellow' who was doing well at school and loved Doctor Who. When he went off on his bike ride he was wearing his favourite dressing gown , a rugby shirt and jeans. Speaking to the Daily Telegraph before his body was identified, 57-year-old Mr Barnes said he . was confident the body would prove to be that of his missing son. He told the paper: 'I have been informed by the police that they have found a body on the island. 'I will go and identify it within the next two hours but I have no doubt it is Pierre.'

A Conservative MP was today ordered to pay compensation to her best friend after sacking her from her constituency office. Penelope Nurick was awarded a payout after Claire Perry, MP for Devizes, let her go in a ‘staff reshuffle’. Mrs Nurick backed Mrs Perry to stand for the Tory party before she won the seat in 2010, and worked in her office for two years. Claire Perry, Tory MP for Devizes, was told to . pay £1,296.68 to best friend Penelope Nurick after sacking her from her . constituency office . But in February this year, she was sacked and replaced by another employee. Despite being best friends, Mrs Nurick then started legal proceedings claiming she had been ‘unfairly dismissed’ Mrs Perry. Today, judge Jenny Mulvaney ruled in her favour, and ordered the MP to pay her ex-secretary £1,296.88. Mrs Perry, is the MP for Devizes and was elected during the 2010 General Election. She is pictured outside Number 10 handing in a petition requesting a block on pornographic websites. Judge Mulvaney said there had been an ‘absence of consultation’ and there had been discussion about whether Mrs Nurick would be considered for the new job. She said: ‘It was conceded by the respondent that the dismissal of the claimant by reason of redundancy was unfair and so I find. There was clearly an absence of consultation. ‘Although the respondent considered whether the claimant should be offered the role to which Mrs Reay was appointed, no discussion of that possibility took place with the claimant. ‘In addition no notice of the meeting at which she was informed of her redundancy was given and she was not informed of her right to be accompanied at that meeting.’ The judge said that if a ‘fair procedure’ had been followed and Mrs Nurick had been consulted there was a ‘100 per cent likelihood’ that she would have lost her job anyway. The compensation of £1,296.88 reflected the length of time that Mrs Nurick’s employment might have been extended in order to enable a fair redundancy procedure. Mrs Perry told the tribunal in Bristol that she was forced to fire her friend when senior advisor, Christopher Jones, left his job in November 2011. The MP said she was unable to replace Mr Jones and so decided to split his extensive job role between her London and Devizes offices. She hired Tamara Reay - who was able to cover both policy and ‘surgery only’ roles - in her Devizes office at the expense of Mrs Nurick. Mrs Perry told the hearing: ‘It was clear from our early experiences that she [Mrs Nurick] would struggle with more responsibility. ‘The claimant required a lot of managing and support, particularly in the IT area and all of this led me to believed that this would not be something she would not be able to do, she would be incapable. ‘I could not afford to keep Mrs Nurick on doing a surgery only job and employ someone to do a local policy job. I found someone who could do both.’",Worked for two years and supported her through election in Devizes .

A district nurse who wrote explicit fantasy stories ‘based on her job’ including one about having sex with a terminally ill patient faces being struck off. Kathleen Pugh, 53, worked with seriously ill housebound patients across Lancashire when she published ‘Angel with Black Wings’, which describes a nurse seducing a patient before killing him with a lethal injection in his own home. It was part of a collection of stories called Aristocracy Or Not And Other Stories, which the 53-year-old promoted at her clinic and even sold to patients and staff. Kathleen Pugh is facing a misconduct hearing after publishing the novels in 2010 . A misconduct hearing today found her guilty of writing the book, advertising it at work and distributing it to patients and colleagues. The panel is now considering if Pugh is fit to work as a nurse - but she has already told the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard she wants nothing more to do with the profession. She quit her job at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust in Lancashire in June last year when bosses launched a disciplinary hearing after reading the book. The nurse worked for Oldham Community Health Services under the trust, giving care to housebound patients including some who were seriously or terminally unwell. One patient who bought the book from Pugh said she was ‘disgusted’ by the story, which mirrored her work as a nurse. Pugh told a local newspaper she had based some of her story on her work, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. ‘There are points of the story which detail actions taken by a district nurse, having sex with a patient and also killing them’, said Paul Pretty, for the NMC. ‘The nature of those parts of the passages directly correlates to the role Ms Pugh was employed in.’ Her collection of short stories was published in 2010 by Author House . Bosses at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, where Pugh works, believe her fitness to work is impaired after reading the book . Today panel chairman Fiona Freedland said after finding Pugh guilty: ‘Given the subject matter of the story, which relates to sexual activities between a district nurse and a dying patient, the panel takes a serious view of her actions in distributing it to a member of staff and a patient. ‘This was further compounded by Mrs Pugh’s actions in advertising the book containing the story on posters within the workplace. ‘She abused her privileged position for her own ends.’ The book, published by Author House in 2010, includes the tale of Angela Diablo, a 'shapely' health visitor treating a dying patient for pain relief who fantasizes about having sex with her. ‘I was concerned by the content of the book, which appeared to be based on her work as a district nurse’, said team leader Susan Kearns, Pugh’s line manager. ‘There was a story about a dying patient in a dream-like fantasy world. Kathleen Pugh denies all the charges against her but did not appear at the misconduct hearing . ‘The nurse has sex with him before administering a lethal injection.’ Mrs . Kearns said medication mentioned in the story is used by nurses like . Pugh, and she was responsible for patients in the community in similar . circumstances to the character in the book. ‘One patient who bought the book told me she didn’t like it and was disgusted by it’, Mrs Kearns said. ‘She told me she had bought the book from Kathleen. ‘I . was quite shocked really, that she even knew about it, and I didn’t . realise that Kathleen was discussing the book with patients.’ Pugh . is accused of putting up posters in the clinic at Royal Oldham Hospital . advertising her book, handing copies to patients and staff, and selling . the book to at least one patient, the hearing was told. Mrs Kearns said Pugh put up a poster in the clinic’s reception area which stayed up for around a month, and initially had a work contact number for anyone looking to buy a copy. ‘It wasn’t appropriate that people should be ringing up about something personal to the district nursing office’, she said. ‘She was obviously trying to sell it, but I felt it would make the district nurses look like they were promoting the book.’ Pugh refused to take part in the NMC hearing, but admitted putting up posters at work featuring a picture of her in her nurse’s uniform advertising the book. The book, which is still available online, is described as a ‘selection of stories that will spark the curiosity of many an avid reader’. Pugh says the tales show a ‘world of romance, passion, empathy, and compassion’ from the 19th century to present day. Pugh denies putting up posters at work and contests that her fitness to practice as a nurse is impaired. The hearing continues. An extract from one of the short stories 'An Angel with Black Wings' describes a dying patient's fantasies with a nurse who is treating him for pain relief. In the story patient Andrew describes dreams in which 'shapely' Angela Diablo visits him in the night for sex before injecting him with drugs to hurry his death - despite his protests. It reads: . '""Oh Andrew. Tonight you will be mine. I will ease your pain. With my kiss and love making! I will give you comfort in your last hour."" 'He didn’t see the syringe appear from behind her as she . jabbed it into him causing him pain and then nothing. The clear liquid injected into his shoulder. 'Her tears now flowing... '""I am sorry Andrew, it had to be!"" holding the limp Andrew is her arms.'","Kathleen Pugh, 53, published a collection of stories including one in which a nurse seduces and has sex with a dying patient .

First it was the Calendar Girls, now it is the the Calendar Boys as a vicar and members of his congregation show a little bit more than normal  – but it is all for a good cause. The Reverend Alan Jewell and a number of his regular church goers defrocked for a calendar to raise much needed funds for their place of worship. Inspired by the famous Women's Institute calendar, Rev Jewell and his 17 helpers hope their arty black and white pictures will provide money for St Nicholas Church in Halewood, Merseyside. Striking the right note: The Rev Alan Jewell poses with his guitar in a field as he raises money for St Nicholas Church in Halewood, Merseyside . Doing their bit: A member of the St Nicholas congregation strips off and washes a car for the calendar . Lord of the manor: Olly Harrison poses next to his tractor on Prescot farm for the calendar . Calendar boy: The Rev Alan Jewell came up with the idea to shoot a calendar . A wide range of members of the . community volunteered their services, including a farmer, a dancer, two . firemen and a retired policeman all baring everything for the cause. Rev Jewell said: ‘I keep bumping into people and they either have a copy or they want to know where to buy one. 'Most people think it’s hilarious, which is what it was always intended to be.' Profits from the calendar will help pay for replacement bells and repairs to the church tower. Simon Brown, who had the idea for the calendar, said a generous donation meant that printing costs had been covered. And thanks to Cambike Photography in Runcorn which donated its services for free, all profits are going straight to the fund. Mr Brown said: 'Sales are going really well. We’re hoping we can cover the cost of at least one of the new bells.' Most of the pictures were taken over several months earlier this year on Olly Harrison (Mr August)’s Prescot farm. Hat's your lot: Two men cover themselves with their hat . Hand on the ball: Two men from the community strip off and play football . Fixing the tractor: The profits from the calendar will go towards St Nicholas Church . As well as shots in wheat fields and climbing into tractors Olly said a sandy beach had been created from a pile of grain and a patch of grass outside the office had doubled as a football pitch. He said: 'It was really hard finding a big enough patch of grass. We had to move the tractors across the gates so people wouldn’t see.' Emergency services: A member of the congregation poses with a policeman's helmet . Wood choppers: A couple of younger men in the community show off their skills . Boat ride: A member of the congregation strips off on the water . Olly said the whole thing had been much more complicated than everyone had realised but he praised the work put in by photographer Chris Campbell. He said: 'When I asked Chris to give us a hand he was only meant to be supervising equipment. Where are my clothes? A naked cyclist looks at a map for April's picture .

MATT PHILLIPS – Blackpool flyer has the pace on the flanks Warnock is looking for and scores goals. Wanted by Southampton in summer. CLINT HILL – almost joined Leeds in the summer and now ready to make the break with QPR in January and link up again with his former boss. Leeds manager Neil Warnock will be handed funds for a January spending spree when the club's prospective new owners GFH Capital take the reins. The Bahrain-based investment bank have provided Leeds chairman Ken Bates with the necessary proof of funds and are locked in advance talks aimed at concluding a transaction that was first mooted in May. In a development that will allay any misgivings among Leeds supporters, Sportsmail has learnt that they have also provided details of separate funds that have been earmarked for urgently-needed new signings. The star and his car: El Hadji Diouf and his £70,000 chrome Cadillac Escalade 4x4 in Manchester yesterday. Leeds boss Neil Warnock has been promised the funds to sign Diouf on a permanent deal . Glittering performance: Diouf can expect an increase to his £5,000-a-week Leeds salary . Pocketing the cash: Leeds manager Neil Warnock can go shopping in January . Though the exact amount remains a closely-guarded secret, for fear of inflating prices, Warnock has been assured he can have the pick of his New Year transfer targets. In a show of faith based on his track record for taking teams up from the Championship, he has been told no reasonable request for a January signing will be turned down.

'Nightmares': The schoolgirl says she is so haunted by memories of the pain she caused that she now suffers from 'reverse post traumatic stress disorder' (picture posed by models) A school bully has opened her heart about how she drove a classmate to suicide… and the devastating effects it has had on her own life. The schoolgirl, now grown up with children, says she is so haunted by memories of the pain she caused that she now suffers from 'reverse post traumatic stress disorder'. Speaking on condition of anonymity, the woman says she picked on one girl, called 'Gina', with such venom that she moved schools to begin a new life. But Gina apparently never recovered from the torment and later committed suicide in high school - a fact the bully only learned years later when trying to track her down to apologise. 'There are no words to describe how monstrous I was,' she told Emily Yoffe, agony aunt for American website The Slate. 'If I inflicted half as much physical assault in my adulthood as I did to . her as a teen, I would be locked up for a very long time.' She says she only realised the effects she must have had on her victims when her daughter, who she had aged 19, 'experienced some minor bullying' at school. She saw how 'tormented' her daughter was and realised what she did to her classmates were 'way worse'. So she made it her 'mission' to track down all the people she bullied in a bid to make amends for the pain she caused them. It was a task made easier by the proliferation of social media such as Facebook and Friends Reunited. She said most responded to her contrition 'with forgiveness', she would never be able to say sorry to the person who deserved it most - because she had killed herself having moved to a new school. 'I have very good reasons to believe that she switched schools because of . me,' she said. 'I have . nightmares about what I did to her - it's like reverse PTSD where I . remember the awful things I've done to others.' She managed to get hold of Gina's mother's email address but is yet to find the 'guts' to make contact. 'What would I say,' she added. 'I know this sounds gutless but I'm also scared of any legal consequences I might face after I own up to my actions.' Tragic: Last week, Felicia Garcia, 15, from Staten Island, new York, threw herself under a train as her horrified classmates watched, after posting pictures on the internet of herself with apparent bruises on her lip . There have been a spate of bullying related suicides in recent years across America. Just last week, Felicia .

In 2010, a global report on school violence identified bullying as the biggest problem in U.S. school playgrounds.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) around a fifth of high school students in the U.S. said they had experienced . repeated, intentional bullying. Marci Hertz, an adviser at CDC's Division . of Adolescent and School Health, said: 'Younger kids are more likely to be bullied and prevalence tends to be . higher in middle school.' She said girls are more likely to be bullied at school than boys. Cases of bullying have become so high that CDC treats it as a public health issue.","She picked on one girl, called 'Gina', with such venom that she moved schools to begin a new life .
