"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . A former San Antonio rapper has been executed for murdering a recording studio owner in a bloody robbery. Ray Jasper was injected with a lethal dose of pentobarbital Wednesday for the November 1998 stabbing death of 33-year-old David Alejandro. He was officially pronounced dead at 6:31pm, after addressing his daughter in his last statement. 'To my family, we are one. To my beautiful daughter, the . best thing that ever happened to me. I love you endlessly. I am . you and you are me forever,' Jasper wrote in his last words, according to a statement released by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Put to death: Jasper (left) was put to death today for the 1998 murder of recording studio owner David Alejandro (right) No one from either his family of the victim's was present to witness the execution. Alejandro's family decided to spend the evening together in San Antonio instead. Jasper had acknowledged he slit Alejandro's throat to steal equipment from the San Antonio studio during a recording session, but insisted it was his two accomplices' more than 25 stab wounds that killed the studio owner. Co-defendant's Steve Russell and Douglas Williams were spared the death sentence and are currently serving life sentences. Jasper's execution was the third in Texas this year. Another is set for next week before the state begins using a new batch of pentobarbital obtained through a different pharmacy. The injection came after lawyers for Jasper, who was black, argued a black potential juror at Jasper's San Antonio trial in 2000 was questioned and disqualified improperly because of race. Jasper's execution Wednesday night follows the publishing of an essay he wrote on the American judicial and penitentiary systems that was posted on Gawker. Gawker initially reached out to all death row inmates with scheduled executions this year back in December 2013, and Jasper decided to respond. His original essay was published on the site in January, and they republished it two weeks before his death. Not there: Alejandro's parents Minnie and Eddie Alejandro decided not to attend the execution today, and instead spent the evening together in San Antonio . In the letter published March 4, Jasper reflected on his perceived flaws of the justice system - and even compared prisoners to slaves. 'Under the 13th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution all prisoners in America are considered slaves,' he wrote. 'We look at slavery like its [sic] a thing of the past, but you can go to any penitentiary in this nation and you will see slavery [...]People need to know that when they sit on trial juries and sentence people to prison time that they are sentencing them to slavery.' Jasper's indictment described his experience of race and the judicial system, even citing the words of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur. 'When I walked into prison at 19 years old, I said to myself ""Damn, I have never seen so many black dudes in my life,""' he said. 'I mean, it looked like I went to Africa. I couldn't believe it. The lyrics of 2Pac echoed in my head, ""The penitentiary is packed/ and its filled with blacks.""' Referring to young African Americans, Jasper writes that in order to overcome inequalities they  'have to be exposed to something new' and ignore rap stars like Jay-Z and Rick Ross. 'Their minds have to be challenged, not dulled, he says. 'They know the history of the Crips & Bloods, but they can't tell you who Garvey or Robeson is. They can quote Drake & Lil Wayne but they can't tell you what Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton has done.' Jasper also said that jail sentences given to first-time offenders are a form of  'oppression.' 'There are guys walking around with 200 year sentences and they're not even 30 years old,' he said. 'Its [sic] outrageous. Giving a first time felon a sentence beyond their life span is pure oppression.' Jasper's letter even alleged that heavy sentences may be delivered as a result of the prison-industrial complex. 'The other side of the coin is there are those in the corporate world making money off prisoners, so the longer they're in prison, the more money is being made,' he said. 'It's not about crime & punishment, it's about crime & profit.'","Ray Jasper was convicted of murdering recording studio owner David Alejandro in a 1998 robbery .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Nearly 1,000 women and girls in Pakistan were murdered in 2011 in honour killings, worrying figures have revealed. A new report by Pakistan's leading human rights group has revealed at least 943 women were killed last year by their fathers, husbands or brothers for damaging their family name. Ninety-three of those killed were minors. However, the true number of those killed is thought to be far higher. Many cases are thought to have been covered up by relatives and sympathetic police officers, the report revealed. Dishonour: The report highlighted the worrying scale of violence suffered by many women in conservative Muslim Pakistan . The figure of 943 was an increase of more than 100 the previous year in 2010. The . Human Rights Commission of Pakistan's annual report highlighted the . worrying scale of violence suffered by many women in conservative Muslim . Pakistan, where they are frequently treated as second-class citizens and . there is no law against domestic violence. The report said: 'At least 943 women were killed in the . name of honour, of which 93 were minors,' wrote the Human Rights . Commission of Pakistan in its annual report.' It concluded: 'Throughout the year, women were . callously killed in the name of 'honour' when they went against family . wishes in any way, or even on the basis of suspicion that they did so. 'Women were sometimes killed in the name of ""honour"" over property disputes and inheritance rights.' In Pakistan, women are frequently treated as second-class citizens and there is no law against domestic violence . Despite progress on better protecting . women's rights, activists say the government needs to do more to . prosecute murderers in cases largely dismissed by police as private, . family affairs. The report also said the police in Pakistan were often a 'coercive force' against women, with officers rarely investigating questionable deaths. This refers to the frequent newspaper reports of young women committing suicide following arguments with family members about their choice of friends. Police often take accounts of these deaths at face value and rarely look at the circumstances in more detail. The Commission said some victims were . raped or gang raped before being killed and only 20 of the 943 killed . were reported to have been provided with medical aid before they died. Most of those killed died at the hands of their brothers and husbands. The report revealed seven Christian and two Hindu women were among the victims and about 595 of those killed in 2011 were accused of having 'illicit relations' while 219 of marrying without permission. The Commission reported 791 'honour killings' in 2010.","Report by Pakistan's leading human rights group reveals at least 943 women were killed .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Sales are soaring of foods free from ingredients such as nuts and wheat that are said to cause allergies and other illnesses. Increasing intolerance to wheat, dairy and nuts means they are being removed from breads, biscuits, milk and other foods on our shelves. Latest figures show that despite the premium price tag for these items, the ‘free from’ food market has grown by 50 per cent in just two years. Consumers are abandoning foods containing wheat and nuts such as bread over allergy fears . Data from market research firm Kantar shows the market is worth £360 million, up from £240 million in 2012. Tesco, which is launching a range of products including a nutless peanut butter to capitalise on the growing appetite, says the boom is being driven in particular by products free of wheat and its protein gluten. The products, which can cost up to eight times as much as standard  versions, include breads, cereals and cakes in which wheat-based flour is replaced with gluten-free flour from rice, corn or other sources. Other foods are being sought out by those intolerant to lactose or whose children are allergic to peanuts. Retail giant Tesco has even started selling nutless peanut butter because of the demand for allergy conscious products . But while many are being bought by people with a genuine medical problem, it is feared the bulk of the rise is being fuelled by the ‘worried well’. Portsmouth University researchers found that nine in ten Britons who believe they have a food allergy or intolerance are perfectly healthy. The researchers concluded that although 20 per cent of adults – about 10 million – claim they are unable to eat foods from milk to mustard, fewer than 2 per cent actually have a problem. They blamed internet searches, self-testing kits and celebrity food fads for the epidemic of make-believe allergies and intolerances.","Consumers are turning their backs on food they believe is making them sick .

"By . Bianca London . Waris Dirie with her Sacla Women of the Year Campaign Award, after the ceremony at the InterContinental Hotel, central London. She has fronted campaigns for Chanel and Revlon and even starred in a James Bond movie. But Waris Dirie really caught the world’s attention in 1997 when she opened up about her horrific female genital mutilation (FGM) ordeal. She has since campaigned tirelessly against the practice and now her efforts have been recognised in the form of a Woman of the Year Campaigning award. Waris, now 48 and living in Poland . with her four children, was just five years old when she was subjected . to FGM in her home country of Somalia. She . was then forced into marrying a 60-year-old man when she was just . thirteen, a threat which left her no choice but to flee to Mogadish, . where she had family. She . later moved to London to live with relatives and worked in a local . McDonald's before getting her big break when she was scouted by a . fashion photographer in the 1990s. Her career as a supermodel went from . strength to strength and she starred in Chanel campaigns and even made a . cameo appearance in James Bond movie, The Living Daylights. But her life was fickle. ‘I thought, . “This is b*****t, fake. I couldn’t sleep one more night knowing the . truth about what was happening to girls,’ she told The Guardian. And that’s when she decided to speak up. In a candid interview with Marie Claire . at the height of her fame in 1997, Waris revealed her dark past whereby . she was subjected to FGM and left to recover in a makeshift shelter . under a tree for several days. She has since set about saving other . young girls from enduring what she suffered. She has since been appointed a UN . special ambassador and set up her own charity, Desert Flower Foundation, . to help protect girls against the practice, which involves partial or . total removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. Scroll down for video . Waris Dirie really caught the world's attention in 1997 when she opened up about her horrific female genital mutilation (FGM) ordeal. The practice – which many believe . leaves a girl ‘clean’ in preparation for her marriage - usually happens . before girls reach the age of fifteen but can be performed on babies at . birth too. It causes intense pain, risk of infection and can even lead . to fatal childbirth later in life. Despite . being illegal in the UK, FGM is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 . women dealing with the after-effects and more than 20,000 young girls . thought to be at risk. Worldwide, . more than three million women have been subjected to FGM, many of whom . come from East African countries such as Uganda, Kenya and Somalia. Rudimentary tools are often used to perform the operations, like these . found in Kenya (pictured left). The procedure is often performed on . young girls like nine-year-old Fay Mohammed (pictured right). Those countries, many of which are part of the Commonwealth, are at the heart of Britain's FGM problem, and as a result, the majority of British women to suffer FGM are part of the UK's 600,000-strong ethnic African community. When people fled from Al Shabab in Somalia or Idi Amin in Uganda, many came to the UK - bringing with them local traditions, including FGM. Despite . being illegal in the UK, FGM is on the rise with an estimated 66,000 . women dealing with the after-effects and more than 20,000 young girls . thought to be at risk . But East Africa isn't the only place where the practice is widespread. Women in Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Yemen and others are also highly likely to be forced to undergo FGM. ‘If a white man or woman saw a white child that is mutilated, there would be screaming. I guarantee it would end. This is abuse against a child, so to say it’s to do with your religion or race, it’s all wrong. This is about child protection,' said Waris. Waris wants the issue to be debated on TV, in the media and by politicians and maintains that, by having it out in the open, we can fight it. Her campaign work is endless. Last month she opened the first medical centre in Berlin that will offer FGM sufferers reconstructive surgery and she hopes to roll this initiative out to Kenya, Ethiopia, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Hometown: Women carry their malnourished children as they queue at a mobile medical facility at the Hiran IDP settlement in Galkayo, northwest of Somalia's capital Mogadishu, where Waris grew up . Campaigner: Waris, pictured holding the trophy of the German Africa Award of the German Africa-Foundation, which she received during a ceremony in Trossingen in 2000, wants to put an end to FGM and (R) in a modelling shoot . Waris, a five times bestselling author who writes on the topic of FGM, said she was 'honoured' to receive her Women of the Year Campaigning Award this week. Baroness Helena Kennedy QC, president of Women of the Year, said: 'Waris is a very worthy recipient of this Women of the Year award. Her astonishing bravery and commitment to this cause has  brought this horrific crime against girls and women to the world’s attention. 'She provides hope and inspiration to victims that one day this abhorrent practice will be eradicated.' 'I can't turn back, not now I'm almost there. You just have to keep going until one day it will come to an end,' added Waris.

"By . Wills Robinson . A 'talented' teenager who stood up at a council meeting to speak out against gun crime has been shot dead at a house party. Ravon Jordan, 19, made a speech to local officials in Fayetteville, North Carolina, about gun violence and the crime-riddled apartment complex Cambridge Arms. Just six weeks later, he was  killed during a vicious gun battle between rival gangs just four miles away from the violent property. Scroll down for videos . 'Talented': Ravon Jordan, 19, spoke up against gun at a council meeting in Fayetteville, North Carolina. Six weeks later he was shot and killed during a shootout between gangs outside a house party . Scene: He was shot along Raeford Road, just four miles away from the violent Cambridge Arms . According to the Fayetteville Observer, he was hit while sitting in a car with friends outside the party. Police are now searching for a number of suspects who are said to have fired 70 shots between them during the confrontation. They have released CCTV footage of a group of men standing in a petrol station  hours after the shooting. Ravon spoke softly to local officials during his two-minute public forum spot in May. The youngster approached the podium, after being welcomed by the city clerk, and said: 'I came to speak on behalf of Cambridge Arms. 'I feel that due to lack of security and lack of care for people who pay their bills and have to live there, I believe that Cambridge Arms should be shut down. 'I don't think as a resident you should be paying for your grave site. You shouldn't be paying to be killed or murdered in your own house. 'When you move into a house you shouldn't expect to die. Since I have known about the Cambridge Arms, there have been four murders due to gun violence. 'It's crazy. Security guards notice you playing music or standing outside. But they don't notice gun shots or broken windows . 'It is just very backwards in the mind. If I heard gun shots, first thing I am calling the police. 'If I hear music, it is probably just someone in the house cleaning up, probably taking a shower. Suspects: Police have released CCTV of men in a petrol station believed to be connected with the shooting . 'I feel like it was a great loss for our family and those who have lost someone because of a lack of security at Cambridge Arms. 'The lack of the thought given to the people who pay their bills and people who live there. I just wanted to say, I think they should be shut down. 'It's no excuse for you to have as many problems in your apartment complex as they have had.' The audience in the chamber started to laugh when he concluded by saying: 'Like my sister said, changing the name is not going to change the violence at all. 'You could still put lipstick on a pig but it is still going to be a pig at the end of the day.' Councilman Larry Wright has said the teenager's words resonate around the community. 'The violence can spread quickly from one neighborhood to the next neighborhood, and I don't think we can pinpoint one area,' he said. 'But we need to pinpoint those few that [are] making it bad for the many. 'Now I feel we're obligated and responsible as community leaders and the community at large to hear that young man's voice from the grave, if you will.' The Fayetteville Police Department said they have already received information in relation to Jordan's death, but they do not have anyone in custody.","Ravon Jordan, 19, spoke at a council meeting in Fayetteville, North Carolina .

"By . Rosemarie Lentini . A Mexican military helicopter involved in an anti-drug smuggling operation flew into America before shooting at two US Border Patrol agents yesterday. KVOA-TV reported the chopper fired over Tohono O’odham Indian Nation in the Arizona desert, before flying back to Mexico early Thursday morning. The agents were not injured. Border Patrol Tucson Sector union president Art del Cueto said Mexican officials 'contacted US authorities and apologized for the incident' which occurred between midnight and 6am. Location: Authorities said the Mexican military helicopter fired two shots over Tohono O'odham Indian Nation in the Arizona desert near the border, before flying back to Mexico early Thursday morning . US Border Patrol spokesman Andy Adame confirmed the report, saying the 'Mexican law enforcement helicopter' fired two shots 'while on a drug interdiction operation near the border'. He said the incident was under investigation. Sebastián Galván, a spokesman for the Mexican Consulate in Tucson, told AP the office was gathering information but did not have any details yet. This was not the first time the Mexican military has veered across the international boundary. In January, US border agents confronted two heavily armed Mexican soldiers who crossed 50 yards inside Arizona, the Los Angeles Times reported. A standoff ensued, but nobody was hurt. In 2011, more than 30 uniformed Mexican soldiers in military vehicles crossed the Rio Grande without authorization in an incident that was believed to be inadvertent. According to a recent Washington Times story, the US Department of Homeland Security says that Mexican police or troops have crossed over the border around 300 times during the last decade, and were armed in around half of those incidents.

"By . Ryan Gorman . Dead: Hernan Gutierrez was killed when his body was pulled completely through a wood chipper . The Florida man who died Monday after falling into a giant wood chipper wanted to start his own roofing business, according to his girlfriend. Hernan Gutierrez, 42, was working Monday with two other men near a Davie home when he somehow ended up inside the machine. It then pulled his entire body through and instantly killed him, police said. Girlfriend Karen Gamez-Pereira told the Sun-Sentinel that he 'didn't deserve to die' that way and wanted to leave landscaping for his own roofing business. 'It is horrible to think of,' she said. 'He didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody in this world deserves to die like that. I'm in shock.' Police arriving at the scene were horrified and needed grief counselors to cope, according to reports. Gutierrez came to the U.S. from Guatemala 14 years ago, she said, and hoped to one day earn enough money to introduce her to his family back home. She will meet them when she travels this week to Central America for his funeral. 'Our plan was to marry,' she said. 'His dream was to save his money, buy a truck and start his own business. 'For me, he was everything. A good man, a good husband.' Horrifying: The mulch inside the truck is shown covered in blood after the man's body was pulled through the wood chipper . She recalled receiving the horrifying news from one of Guiterrez's coworkers. 'He just kept saying, 'You have to be strong,' said the grieving woman. 'He could hardly talk.' Gamez-Pereira described him as 'always happy, hard-working, humble, with a great sense of humor.' She said many questions are still left unanswered. Both she and his family want to know how and why this could possibly have happened. 'It was a hot day,' Gamez-Pereira said. 'Maybe he was exhausted. Maybe he fell. We don't know.' Tree Techs owner Rafael Toledo told the paper he is 'sorry and saddened by what happened,' but declined to comment further, citing the investigation. Police are unclear on many details surrounding the shocking late afternoon incident, but footage from the scene showed the mulch covered in blood after the man’s body passed through the massive wood chipper. He was working to clear brush when he died, officials said. Cheryl Appel, who lives nearby, told the paper she saw a landscape worker in an orange vest running down the street shouting. ‘He was obviously extremely distraught, yelling and flailing his arms around, screaming’ to another co-worker at a nearby fence and ‘collapsed against it, his knees buckled. Mortifying: A police officer stands at the mouth of the killing machine . ‘He looked like he was in shock,’ she added. ‘It was obvious something happened.’ Emergency responders were on the scene shortly after. Police do believe it was an accident, but were still shocked by the grisly death. I've been in police work 20 years. I've never seen anything like this,’ Davie Police Captain Dale Engle told the Sun-Sentinel. ‘It was a gruesome scene.’ Authorities are not commenting on the investigation other than to acknowledge the wood chipper is in their possession.","Hernan Guiterrez, 42, died when his body was pulled completely through the giant wood chipper .

"By . Hugo Duncan Economics Correspondent . The Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney, pictured has defended the 2.5 per cent rise in interest rates . The cost of a typical mortgage could jump by nearly £175 a month over the next three years, homeowners were warned yesterday. The Bank of England suggested interest rates are likely to rise to 2.5 per cent by early 2017 – five times the current level of 0.5 per cent. Such an increase would add £174 a month – or £2,088 a year – to a typical £150,000 standard variable rate mortgage. Although the move would benefit the millions of savers who have been hit by record rock-bottom rates since March 2009, many cash-strapped households are ‘vulnerable’ to higher borrowing costs. The central bank’s Governor Mark Carney said a rise of 2.5 per cent would cushion the blow because it is still half the average rate of 5 per cent seen before the financial crisis. There would be no fast return to pre-downturn levels, said the Canadian, adding: ‘The old normal is not the new normal. ‘The new normal is materially lower than the old normal.’ His comments came as a series of reports suggested the economic recovery is broadening. The Office for National Statistics said gross domestic product, the total size of the economy, rose 0.8 per cent between January and March. Business investment – which is seen as crucial to a balanced and sustainable recovery – jumped 5 per cent in just three months and was 10.6 per cent higher than a year earlier. A separate report by polling group GfK showed consumer confidence in May was at its highest level for more than nine years. Martin Beck, of economic forecasters the EY Item Club, said: ‘It looks like the UK growth engine is now firing on all cylinders.’ Households have frequently been warned that interest rate rises are imminent as the economy strengthens. Mr Carney, who was this week criticised for behaving like ‘an unreliable boyfriend’ for sending out mixed messages about when rates will go up, said the exact timing is not important. ‘The big picture is where interest rates go in the medium term, because if I am taking out a mortgage, that is what I care about,’ he said. The Bank of England suggested interest rates are likely to rise to 2.5 per cent by early 2017 ¿ five times the current level of 0.5 per cent . Mr Carney said 2.5 per cent rates are ‘not inconsistent’ with a full recovery. However, he said any increases will be ‘gradual’ and ‘limited’ – fearing that families struggling with mortgage repayments will harm the economy by reducing their spending. Figures from the Land Registry yesterday also showed the emergence of a ‘two-speed’ housing market between London and elsewhere in the UK. Average prices in the capital grew 18.5 per cent to £439,719, compared with a rise of just 0.9 per cent in the North East to £99,319.","Cost of a typical mortgage could jump by nearly £175 a month in three years .

"By . Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent . Stressed: Parents and carers - who already have the right to ask for flexible working - could lose out to those with less pressing responsibilities . Britain's 30million workers will have the right to demand flexible hours from Monday – even if they just want a lie-in or time off to pursue a hobby. They will not have to give a reason why they want to be off at certain times and companies have been told they cannot judge requests on merit. It means parents and carers – who already have the right to ask for flexible working – could lose out to those with less pressing responsibilities. A request from a mother who wants to start work later so she can take her children to nursery will carry no more weight than one from a colleague simply wanting to spend a bit longer in bed. Bosses expect to be hit with a deluge of requests which must be considered in the order received. Astonishingly, government officials have told business groups that if employers receive conflicting requests which they cannot honour they should ‘put the names in a hat’. Adam Marshall, director of policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, said  the new rules meant that those with stronger claims to flexible working could lose out. He said: ‘The new rules make it harder for employers to prioritise requests. They cannot prioritise one employee over another, whereas before you could prioritise those who had childcare responsibilities or carer responsibilities  for example.’ When the measures were first announced by Nick Clegg in November 2012, businesses warned they would lead to more red tape. Many firms already offer flexible terms, but there are fears that the new rules could lead to a string of legal actions. There are also  concerns that the ‘right to ask’ for flexible working will be confused with a ‘right to have’. Phil Orford, chief executive of the Forum of Private Business, said: ‘Our members recognise the benefits of flexible working and wherever possible have sought to work with employees to provide flexible working options. ‘However, extending the right to request flexible working to all employees will simply make the consideration process the employer needs to follow more complicated and time-consuming and only add to the administrative pressures already felt by many small business owners.’ Flexible working laws were first introduced in 2003. Currently they mean firms must consider requests from parents with children under 17 and from those with caring responsibilities for elderly parents or other dependents. Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson, pictured said extending the right to request flexible working will help to create a shift towards more modern workplaces . But from Monday, all workers will have the same ‘right to ask’ after they have been in a job for six months. They can make one request a year and businesses can only refuse under eight specific reasons, such as if the change creates additional costs or does not fit with customer demand.Employees who are unhappy with the decision can appeal. Lib Dem business minister Jo Swinson said: ‘Extending the right to request flexible working will help to create a cultural shift towards more modern, 21st century workplaces where working flexibly is the norm. ‘Firms that embrace flexible working are more likely to attract and retain the best talent and  reap the benefits of a more motivated workforce. ‘Employees will benefit from being able to balance work with other commitments in their lives. It also helps drive a cultural shift where flexible working becomes the norm.’","Britain's 30million workers will have the right to demand flexible hours .

"By . Daniel Martin . Outdoor weddings could be legalised under plans to allow non-religious groups to carry out marriage ceremonies. Couples would be able to tie the knot in the open air under a proposed law change to allow humanists to conduct marriages. The controversial policy could lead to green campaigners or even Masons being allowed to have their own ceremonies on mountain tops and river banks. A controversial policy could lead to green campaigners or even Masons being allowed to have their own ceremonies on mountain tops and river banks. File picture . Some have even claimed Star Wars fans would be able to hold ‘Jedi’ weddings under the new regime. At present there are only two types of marriages in England and Wales - religious ceremonies in churches and other buildings; and civil ceremonies typically in registry offices, but now increasingly in hotels and other registered venues. Last year the Government was forced by a Parliamentary defeat to agree to a consultation to allow a third category of weddings - those for non-religious ‘belief’ organisations such as the British Humanist Association. The law states that most weddings in England and Wales have to take place in a building. But the Ministry of Justice said yesterday that, if humanist weddings are allowed, all restrictions on where they can take place may have to be lifted. The proposal is contained in an official consultation paper, published by the MoJ yesterday. It suggests strict criteria organisations would have to meet to qualify, in an effort to allay fears that the change could open the way for ‘Jedi’ weddings. The law currently states that most weddings in England and Wales have to take place in a building. File picture . But it raises the prospect of eco-groups, Freemasons or societies dedicated to particular schools of philosophy such as existentialism being able to apply to conduct ceremonies for their followers. Ministers have not committed to introducing the new category of wedding but promised to carry out a consultation on the idea during last year’s parliamentary debates on gay marriage. The paper points out that unlike religious groups, organisations such as humanists do not have their own buildings. That creates legal difficulties because the system of solemnising marriages in England and Wales is based on buildings – either places of worship or venues such as a hotels or stately homes – being registered for weddings. It suggests a series of possible solutions including allowing approved groups to conduct weddings ‘anywhere meaningful to the couple including outdoors’. Unlike in Scotland, where humanist weddings are already conducted, outdoor marriages are not legally recognised in England and Wales. But a rarely used exception dating back to 1753 already exists, allowing Quakers and Jewish groups to conduct outdoor weddings. The consultation paper suggests extending that to non-religious groups but notes that some faith groups or people having civil weddings might see this as ‘unfair”’ Amber Hunter, senior tutor at the Wedding Planner School, said: ‘I think this would be very popular. ‘People want the spiritual element but not necessarily the religious element and this would give people what they want and is probably more in line with the way people see the world today.’ A spokeswoman for the British Humanist Association said: ‘In the context of current marriage law, giving legal recognition to humanist marriages is not controversial, would meet a genuine public desire, and would have a negative effect on absolutely no one in society. ‘It would only go on to improve the married lives and happiness of thousands of couples who wish to have a humanist marriage.’ Simon Hughes, the justice minister, said: ‘The Government considers marriage to be one of our most important institutions and believes it is right for couples to have the choice of a religious or secular marriage ceremony. ‘As we committed to do during the passage of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, we are now consulting on whether the law should be changed to allow non-religious belief organisations to conduct legally valid marriage ceremonies. ‘The Government welcomes the views from interested groups and individuals across society.’","Couples would be able to tie the knot in the open air under a proposed law change to allow humanists to conduct marriages .

"By . Corey Charlton . Animal welfare officers were called out to rescue a iguana stuck up a tree - only to discover it was a stuffed toy. A woman spotted what looked like a lizard in a tree near Miller Academy in Thurso in the Highlands yesterday. She alerted the Scottish SPCA, who had to break the news to the concerned caller that it was a cuddly toy which had been nailed to a branch. This photo of a stuffed toy was discovered by a woman and mistaken as being a genuine iguana. It prompted a concerned call to the Scottish SPCA, who were pleased to tell her it was simply a stuffed toy nailed to a tree . Senior inspector Audrey Gunn said: 'The lady was shocked when I told her it wasn’t a real iguana as she thought she’d seen it blink. 'I think someone must have nailed the toy to the tree as a joke and I can see why it fooled her.' The 'iguana' has been taken in by Ms Gunn’s colleague Mandy McIntyre, a reptile enthusiast who works for the charity. The soft toy iguana, which has now been removed, was spotted on a tree near Thurso, Caithness in Scotland . She said: 'It was a nice surprise to find there wasn’t an animal in danger in this case and I must admit it gave Mandy and I a bit of a giggle. 'Although this incident turned out to be a false alarm, we’d always encourage people to give us a call if they think an animal is in need of help.'","Scottish SPCA called to scene after woman reported iguana stuck up a tree .

"By . Corey Charlton . Real ale enthusiasts are raising their glasses after a rare opportunity to craft beer barrels has come up for the first time this century. Renowned brewer Theakston's is taking on an apprentice cooper to help them make and and repair the traditional oak casks they use to store and transport their classic ales. Classed as one of the rarest jobs in the real ale industry, the lucky individual will be the only apprentice brewery cooper in the country. Only one person will be chosen to learn from Jonathan Manby, pictured here working in his specialised field . Dying art: The role of cooper is considered one of the rarest jobs in the real ale industry, and the successful applicant will be taught by Mr Manby, the country's last remaining brewery-employed craft cooper . The cooper profession dates back centuries and the tools used handed down through generations . The chosen one will undergo a three to four year training period in order to produce, re-make and repair the family-owned brewery's wooden casks. They will learn the craft from Jonathan Manby - who joined Theakston's as an apprentice himself in 1995 - and is the country's last remaining brewery-employed craft cooper. Mr Manby, 39, makes hundreds of oak casks each year for licensees that insist on having their ales served that way. He also demonstrates his skills in the North Yorkshire brewery's cooperage - which is one of the highlights of Theakston's visitor centre tour - and at fairs, festivals and shows all over the country. The profession of cooper is said to require strength, intelligence and skill, with the finest barrels holding liquids . The last time Theakston's brewery advertised for a cooper position was 19 years ago in 1995 when Mr Manby, who has now become the cooper teacher ready to pass on his knowledge, was the successful applicant . As a finishing touch, the barrel is branded with writing identifying it as created at Theakston's in Masham . Cooper Mr Manby, pictured with the finished products - 66 traditional small casks that each hold 36 pints . Brewery director, Simon Theakston said: 'We are very proud to be one of the last breweries in the country to supply our ale in wooden casks and also to be preserving an ancient and skilled art. 'Tradition is respected not only in the brewing industry but in thousands of pubs throughout the country. We know consumers strongly approve of the idea of beer served from wood and we plan to continue that tradition. Traditionally, a cooper is someone who makes wooden, staved containers with flat ends that are bound together with metal hoops. Historically, this included casks, barrels, buckets and tubs, with the containers used for holding a range of items including milk, gunpowder, flour and tobacco. The profession dates back to Roman times and was considered one of the most important medieval trades, evidenced by the appropriation of the word 'cooper' as a surname into a number of different languages. However, the prevalence of modern metal and plastic casks, as well as timber shortages, has seen the number of coopers in England drastically reduce in the past 50 or 60 years. It is thought there are no master coopers left in England - a rank attained only when one has successfully trained an apprentice. 'We have been using wooden casks since the company was founded by my great, great grandfather 187 years ago. 'The last time we advertised for this position was in 1995, and Jonathan Manby was the successful applicant. 'Watching Jonathan at work is fascinating and he uses the same methods and tools to create casks that coopers have used for hundreds and hundreds of years. 'The growing popularity of our cask ales means that Jonathan now requires another pair of hands to help him in his important job. However, coopering is a skill that cannot be learned overnight, and the training period can take up to four years. 'It is hard work, but the lucky applicant will know they are in a unique position - that of being the country's only brewery-employed apprentice craft cooper.'","Brewery responsible for much-loved Old Peculier ale seeking new talent to learn the coopering trade - how to make wooden barrels .

"By . Julian Robinson . Police are to re-consider launching a criminal investigation into the the payday lender Wonga, it has been revealed. City of London Police will look again at whether the company should face a probe after it sent fake legal letters to pressure customers into paying up. The case was discussed a year ago but it was previously decided that it should be left to regulators so the 45,000 consumers affected would not be delayed in receiving their compensation. Police could reconsider launching a criminal investigation into the payday lender Wonga, it has been revealed . But the force says that now that the Financial Conduct Authority’s investigations have concluded and a compensation agreement has been reached, it will 'be reassessing whether a criminal investigation is now appropriate'. Earlier this week, Wonga said it had agreed with the regulator to pay £2.6million in compensation for the letters it sent from non-existent law firms. City of London Police said in a statement: 'In March 2013 the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) met with the City of London Police to consider their (OFT’s) investigation into Wonga and whether it should be referred to the National Policing Lead for Fraud. 'The interests of the consumer were at the forefront of these discussions and directed the decision that the most appropriate course of action was for the OFT to continue to investigate as regulator focusing on but not limited to the consumer credit act, legal services act, and unfair trading regulations. 'Now that the regulator’s investigation has concluded and a compensation agreement has been reached with Wonga, the City of London Police will be reassessing whether a criminal investigation is now appropriate.' The Law Society has already stepped up pressure for a criminal investigation to be held into Wonga. Wonga said it had agreed with the regulator to pay £2.6million in compensation for the letters it sent from non-existent law firms. Pictured is an image from one of Wonga's adverts . The society, which represents around 160,000 solicitors across England and Wales, said it has asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate Wonga and consider whether any offences, such as blackmail or those under the Solicitors Act, have been committed. It has also called on City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to hand over copies of its investigation. The FCA confirmed it had been contacted by the society but declined to comment further. Law Society chief executive Desmond Hudson said: 'It seems that the intention behind Wonga’s dishonest activity was to make customers believe that their outstanding debt had been passed to a genuine law firm. 'It looks like they also wanted customers to believe that court action undertaken by a genuine law firm would follow if the debt was not repaid.' A spokesman for Wonga said earlier today that its focus is on compensating customers who received the 'unacceptable' debt collection letters.","Police to re-consider launching criminal investigation into the payday lender .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A man who was part of a mysterious yoga retreat - likened to a cult - has been found dead in the mountains in Bowie, Arizona after fleeing the sect with his wife and succumbing to exposure. The grisly death is just the latest . twist in a story that involves a Princeton-educated monk, his forbidden . wife and a stabbing in the desert. Search and rescue teams found Ian Thorson's body in a cave alongside his wife, Christie McNally, who was delirious and thirsty. Six weeks earlier, they had been ordered to leave the Diamond Mountain retreat after she revealed in one of her lectures that she had stabbed him with a knife 'by mistake'. Mysterious end: Ian Thorson, left, has died after fleeing a Buddhist retreat with his wife Christie McNally, right. They camped in the Aizona mountains where Thorson died of exposure and dehydration . While police do not suspect foul play in his death, it raises questions about the secretive group with which the couple were involved. At the Buddhist Diamond Mountain retreat, nearly 40 adherents pledged to meditate for three years, three months and three days. Their only communication was by paper and pen. It was run by a divisive Princeton-educated monk and McNally's former husband, Michael Roach, whose teachings have been rejected as unconventional by some, including the Dalai Lama. Roach, who had previously run a diamond business worth tens of millions of dollars, raised eyebrows for promoting Buddhist principles as a path to financial success, the New York Times reported. Yoga teacher Matthew Remski described . the leader as a 'charismatic Buddhist teacher' who he respected until . his popularity 'turned him into a celebrity'. Others have . cited concerning initiation ceremonies. A former volunteer, Sid Johnson, . told the Times that his involved 'kissing and genital touching'. Another claimed she had blood drawn from her finger. Divisive: Roach's teachings and rituals have been called into question. He and McNally lived in a yurt together, right, for years before she left him for Thorson, their attendant . Another of his questionable practices was his secret marriage to McNally, which is forbidden by Buddhism. It lasted more than a decade and ended in 2010 - a month before she married Thorson. The couple met in New York city when he was her teacher. Despite the 20-year age gap, their friendship became something more - and they vowed never to stray more than 15ft from each other. Roach and McNally had lived together in a yurt throughout a three-year retreat he had promoted from 1999, but they claimed they were celibate and kept the marriage secret from others. But, as Page Six Magazine reported, his version of celibacy was also questionable. 'We are not allowed to have sex, but in yoga there are practices that involve joining with a partner,' he said. 'They are secret, and you are not . allowed to disclose them. You might think of them as sex, but their . purpose is to move inner energy. It takes very strict training.' Together, the couple wrote books and presented lectures around the world. Scene: Thorson and McNally were asked to leave the retreat, pictured, after she revealed she had stabbed him 'when her martial arts practice went wrong'. They escaped to the mountains . When the marriage came to light, . Roach said he and his wife came from Christian backgrounds so they . wanted to carry out a Christian partnership, as well as a Buddhist one. He added that he wanted her to be able to legally claim his possessions if he passed away. But the union garnered derision from Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman, father of actress Uma Thurman, who said he should renounce his monastic vows - but Roach refused. The Dalai Lama's office called it . 'unconventional behaviour' and refused to see him when he travelled to . India with his students in 2006. But . in 2009, McNally left Roach for Thorson, a young student who had once . served as their attendant. After, Roach was seen dancing in Manhattan . clubs with Russian models. He said of the break up: 'You should . see your partner as an angel who came to teach you. I look at Christie . that way - the education is finished and now she is teaching a new . person. If you try to see it that way, it helps your heart to hurt . less.' Criticism: Buddhist scholar Robert Thurman, left, and the Dalai Lama, centre, both turned their backs on Roach after it came to light that he had married . Her union with . Thorson seemed far from simple. In a lecture before they fled, she . admitted he had become violent and she had stabbed him. She used a knife the couple had been given as a wedding present, but later claimed she was practising martial arts and it went wrong. He suffered three stab wounds to the chest. In a letter written after they left . the retreat, she wrote: 'Of course it was an accident! I would never do . harm to anyone’s body on purpose, least of all my holy husband, who I . adore.' She explained: 'We . were simply fooling around, like children playing with their father’s . samurai sword, unaware that eventually someone is bound to get hurt.' After the incident, they were given five days to leave, but they left immediately. In her letter, McNally said they were . not ready to re-enter the world so were going camping on land next to . the retreat 'to get our thoughts settled'. Tragic: Thorson, right, was found by a search-and-rescue team in a cave after McNally, left, raised the alarm . When members of the retreat searched for them, they hid in a cave. The people also left water for them, knowing they were around, but the couple fell ill and could not retrieve it, authorities said. On April 22 at 6 a.m. - six weeks after they left the retreat - McNally sent a distress signal to Diamond . Mountain from a transmitter she had been carrying. When caretakers could not find the couple, they called 911. A search-and-rescue team from the Cochise County Sheriff’s Office found Thorson had died from dehydration and exposure, and his wife was weak and delerious. Three of . Diamond Mountain’s caretakers set out to look for her and Mr. Thorson, . but could not find them. Around 8 a.m., the caretakers called 911. The retreat will end on April 3, 2014. Of its original 39 participants, 34 remain.","Ian Thorson died from exposure after fleeing Buddhist retreat with his wife .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Police were called to a salon to settle a dispute over hair dye after an enraged woman refused to pay for her treatment. Suzanne Zahran rushed to Alan Rene salon in Blackburn, Lancashire, on Wednesday after a home dye kit went wrong. Two stylists spent several hours trying to fix the henna - which had apparently burned her hair, leaving it red, brown and blonde - and agreed to finish the job with a second appointment the next day. Strong arm of the law: Five police officers were called to Alan Rene salon in Blackburn, Lancashire, to settle the dispute after Suzanne Zahran refused to settle her £107 bill for her hair dye . But when they presented her with a bill for £107 at the end, she refused to pay, claiming she preferred it before. Eventually, as the dispute escalated, the salon called 999 - and five officers - including three PCSOs - arrived at the scene. The team negotiated with the pair for 15 minutes before telling them it was a civil matter to be settled in court. New do: Ms Zahran leaves the Alan Rene salon after refusing to pay - two stylists spent hours over two days working on her hair colour . Hairdresser Hafiza O’Connor said: 'It’s actually cost us money to do her hair. It was a disaster because of some henna she had used. 'She had brown roots, very dark red in the middle and blonde ends. We explained that fixing it was a big job, at least £100 and we couldn’t guarantee the result. 'We got it looking really good, but she . just refused to pay. Throughout the entire process she had been trying . to haggle with us. A cut and blow dry alone is £35 and a bottle of . prelightner is £10. One colour foil is £35 and she had needed two.' Mrs Zahran, a medical technologist at Blackburn Hospital, tried to leave the salon on Wednesday night without paying for the first half of her dye, the salon said. The next day, she did not show for the next three-hour appointment then later called saying her hair was falling out. Eventually she came in to have it fixed - but declared she would not pay. Ms O'Connor said: 'The first appointment needed two of us and we spent four hours on it. We were open late but she needed to go and she wanted to leave without paying. 'However we asked her to pay £54 for the first stage. 'The next day she didn’t show for an appointment we had set aside three hours for. Then she called us up saying her hair was falling out. 'Of course I was panicked and I opened up the shop for her on my day off. But there was nothing wrong with it. Hair wasn’t even coming off onto the brush.' Mrs Zahran’s husband Fayez Zahran, also a medical technologist, said: 'She was very upset and her hair had been falling out. What's all this then: Two police officers and three PCSOs negotiated with the pair for 15 minutes before telling them it was a civil matter to be settled in court . 'There . had been nothing wrong with the henna dye, she had just fancied a . change of colour. She had showed the hairdresser the picture she wanted . and the result was nothing like it.

"By . Jonathan Wilson . In Walthamstow, the sky was red with fireworks. In the suburbs of Paris, the streets were packed in celebration. In Algeria itself, the whole country reached a frenzy of euphoria. Algeria has waited a long time for this. They should have reached the second phase of the World Cup in 1982; finally, 32 years on, a draw against Russia took them out of the group for the first time. That 1982 side lives on in the romantic imagination as one of the great what- might-have-beens. Four years earlier, Tunisia had beaten Mexico to become the first African side to win a match at the World Cup, but that achievement was nothing to the shock of  Algeria’s win over West Germany in Gijon. Past glory: The Algerian coach and players celebrate victory in 1982 when they beat West Germany . Revenge: Algeria were knocked out despite winning in '82 after the 'Anschlus' - now they want revenge . They then lost to Austria but beat Chile and would have gone through with any result other than a narrow West German victory over Austria in their final game — a match played after Algeria’s last game. West Germany, of course, won what became known as the Anschluss match 1-0 and Algeria, in the cruellest circumstances, were out. ‘We have not forgotten,’ Algeria’s Bosnian coach Vahid Halilhodzic warned before the tournament. He also has unfinished business at the World Cup. He was part of the Yugoslavia squad in Spain, but was largely kept out of the side by Safet Susic, who coached Bosnia at this World Cup. Then he should have taken Ivory Coast to the 2010 World Cup, only to be sacked following defeat to — coincidentally — Algeria in the quarter-final of the Cup of Nations. His side took the lead with a minute to go, only to concede an injury-time equaliser and then a winner two minutes into extra-time. The rest of the world — Algerians included — may be surprised by what the country have achieved, but Halilhodzic has always given the impression that he expected progress to at least the round of 16. Delight: Algerian fans around the world, and particularly in France, celebrated widly last week . Diaspora: Many of the Algerian team,  were born in France where last-16 qualification was celebrated . ‘I’ve succeeded wherever I’ve been,’ he shrugged. He won a league title and an African Champions League with Raja Casablanca. He took Lille to promotion and then into the Champions League. He saved Rennes from relegation. He won the league with Dinamo Zagreb. He is as irascible as he is intelligent, but he has been successful. He is also utterly his own man. Halilhodzic retired from his playing career following the death of his mother. During the Yugoslav War, he returned to Mostar to defend his home and remained even after being wounded, only leaving after Croatian nationalists threatened his life, eventually destroying his home. He has a clear idea of how football should be played and has reshaped the Algerian game to that image. When Algeria shocked West  Germany they were an attractive side based around the direct attacking play of the likes of Rabah Madjer, Lakhdar Belloumi and Salah Assad. Success: Vahid Halihodzic has taken Algeria further than many outside the country expected . Unique: Halihodzic, who has had a difficult relationship with the World Cup, is confident in his own abilities . Costa RicaGroup D was supposed to be three giants plus Costa Rica, yet it was the Concacaf side who came top of the group. Their method is simple: pack men behind the ball and look to break using the playmaking ability of Bryan Ruiz and the lone front-running of Joel Campbell. MexicoMexico were a shambles in qualifying, with Miguel Herrera their fourth coach in 12 months. But they got to Brazil in the end, and they have been defensively sound and neat in possession, inspired by the goalkeeping of Guillermo Ochoa and the calm of Rafael Marquez, 35. Nigeria‘One day I will be in charge of Nigeria, and then they will know what a coach is,’ said Stephen Keshi in 2006. He has been as good as his word, ending a 19-year trophy drought by winning the Cup of Nations then leading them to the last 16 of the World Cup. The star is Emmanuel Emenike. USAFootball in the United States is improving, but few would have picked them to get past Portugal and Ghana. They are extremely fit and have a tremendous spirit and, if they were fortunate to beat Ghana, they were much the better side in drawing 2-2 with the Portuguese. They retained that reputation through the Eighties when they were regular contenders for the African Cup of Nations before finally winning it on home soil in 1990. The civil war of the Nineties broke up that side, though, and more recently Algeria have become more noted for the sort of dour defence they demonstrated in drawing 0-0 with England at the last World Cup. Halilhodzic, though, has unleashed the attacking instinct of Algerian football. They are good to watch again and the coach must take credit for that. The other key figure in the creation of this side has been the president of the football federation, Mohamed Raouraoua. Moment of joy: Islam Slimani headed home against Russia to send Algeria into the last 16 for the first time . Not only did he work with tremendous energy to keep football alive during the worst days of the war, but he lobbied FIFA to change their rules on national eligibility. As a result, Algeria have been able to draw from the vast diaspora to the extent that 16 of the 23-man squad were born in France. As ever, results outweigh all else, and if Algeria could shock Germany and gain their revenge for 1982, every member of the side would be celebrated wherever there are Algerians.","Algeria were knocked out of 1982 World Cup when West Germany and Austria played out match with 1-0 result that put both through .

"By . Quentin Letts . Not many Tories attended Questions to Vince Cable’s Business Department. Perhaps they find it hard to stomach Lib Dem Vince at the despatch box. Yet that seems unlikely. Mr Cable is, in the Chamber, a polite, agreeable figure, quite unlike the incorrigible schemer lurking behind the arras. Maybe Tories stayed away because they are driven nuts by one of their own frontbenchers, Matthew Hancock? This M. Hancock is not the one with the beard and florid kerchiefs who has been caught up in such lurid goings-on in Portsmouth. That M. Hancock is 68-year-old Mike, formerly Lib Dem, now Independent. Matthew Hancock, 35, entered Parliament in 2010 and is tremendously zingy and smells faintly of Haliborange tablets and Nivea shaving gel, and due to his upbeat nature is tipped to be Tory leader . This one is Matthew, 35 going on 29. He is tremendously zingy and smells faintly of Haliborange tablets and Nivea shaving gel. He entered Parliament in 2010 via a safe seat in Suffolk (its previous MP was tossed a peerage). Having scorched through both Oxford and Cambridge, young Hancock became close to George Osborne. Within five minutes he was on the Public Accounts Committee. In 2012 he became Minister for Skills, Enterprise and (dread phrase) Lifelong Learning. It will be a surprise, not least to Master Hancock himself, if he is not Tory leader by 2020. His upbeat manner is suited to his job. He is the sort of person who, on entering the dayroom of an old people’s home, will spank his palms and say ‘right, troops, what’s the plan of action today?’ House of Commons Speaker John Bercow gives no impression of liking Mr Hancock . If you went on holiday with Mr Hancock he would likely have you out doing star jumps on the beach before breakfast. He is a doer, a delver, a tireless Tigger. Yesterday he was ‘delighted to tell the House’ – with fizzy eyes and much emphasis on the ‘light’ and ‘tell’ – that the Government was ‘well on track’ to establishing two million apprenticeships. Indeed! Only that very dawn had come news that 1.8million such posts have now been achieved. He imparted this statistic with such relish that it was almost as if he personally had met every single one of those young apprentices. And their parents. Speaker Bercow gives no impression of liking Mr Hancock. He utters his name with what sounds like sarcasm – ‘Min-i-ster Hannnncock’, dripping with fake gravity. The Speaker also cut in on the end of Mr Hancock’s replies, chivvying him, letting it be known that the content of his replies was of sparse significance to the Chair. Envy? Bercow himself never went far as a frontbencher. Mr Hancock, too shrewd to give Bercow the satisfaction of open irritation, looked at the Speaker with the waggy smile of Basil Brush. ‘Thank you very MUCH, Mr Speaker,’ he said. And he patted the despatch box with his palms, familiar as an old pro. Bercow grimaced. Many Tories talk about ‘our long-term economic plan’ but they manage to load the slogan with self-knowing. Labour is still wailing that David Cameron should have known that Andy Coulson, left, was bad news . Mr Hancock bellowed it forth, believing it. He talked about something called ‘The Trailblazer Process’ as though we would all be familiar with that great enterprise. Jack Lopresti, a decent, soft-spoken Tory from the Bristol area, asked about apprentice aerospace workers at Filton. Mr Hancock swooped to announce, with zeal, that apprenticeships at Filton were up by 60 per cent. The man was, and is, a marvel, relentlessly, exhaustingly, manically optimistic. No wonder his backbench elders find the young pup a trial. Later the House heard of dreadful misdeeds by Jimmy Savile. Officialdom wrung its hands and wished it had known he was a wrong ’un. It must have missed a book I wrote in 2008 which hinted, as heavily as the libel lawyers would permit, that Savile was a groping fraud. Meanwhile, Labour is still wailing that David Cameron should have known Andy Coulson was bad news. I sometimes wrote for Coulson when he was an editor. I always found him bright, civilised and grown-up. The way he has conducted himself this week, stoical in his bleakest hour, gives me no reason to change that view.","Matthew Hancock predicted to be Tory leader by 2020 .

"By . John Drayton . Thousands of USA supporters packed fan parks across the country on Thursday to cheer on the team during their last Group G clash against Germany . With Butler Field in Chicago full of people 15 minutes ahead of the big kick-off, the support Jurgen Klinsmann's side have received from home fans during this tournament shows just how big football is becoming Stateside. Those packed inside will have been disappointed with the 1-0 defeat at the hands of Germany but will have been delighted to progress after Portugal's 2-1 win over Ghana wasn't enough to see Cristiano Ronaldo and co go through. VIDEO Scroll down to watch footage of American fans' wild World Cup celebrations . Full support: Americans packed one Chicago fan park 15 minutes before USA's clash with Germany .

National heroes: The fans are heavily backing their team and thought they would win the World Cup . Passionate: The USMNT's players have shown passion that has inspired their supporters have in Brazil . For a nation that would usually consider . the Super Bowl as the competition to decide football's world champions, . the United States have come a long way in terms of the way they view . 'soccer'. This . summer's World Cup in Brazil looks to be the first one that really has . US fans hooked - a whole 20 years on from when they hosted the . tournament on their home soil at USA '94. For . once, rather than struggling to drum up support for the USMNT (United . States Men's National Team), fans are being turned away from fan parks . as Americans attempt to drink in the relative successes of their . national team on the big stage. A pre-tournament survey, carried out across 19 Brazil-bound countries, showed US supporters as fans of one of only four nations that expected their team to win the World Cup - alongside early favourites Argentina, Brazil and Spain. Celeb support: Will Ferrell, who counts himself as a Chelsea supporter, was seen geeing up fans at an event . Here and there: Two of the USA's 196,838 ticketholders in Brazil cheer the team on against Portugal . Big moment: John Brooks' last minute header sent USA fans - and players - into hysteria . Dejected: For a nation that calls the sport soccer, fans were hard hit by Portugal's late eqauliser . And the . fans are embracing the success. Over seven years on from when David . Beckham's move to LA Galaxy heralded a new era - that didn't quite work . out - for soccer in the world's third largest country by population, . football, as it is increasingly being referred to, is finally capturing . the imagination of the fans. Even the absence of Landon Donovan - considered a national hero in soccer terms - has not dampened the enthusiasm. Chicago's . fan park - laid on for the Portugal game - has a 15,000 person capacity . but had to turn fans away, such was its popularity. Videos . of fans celebrating John Brooks' last-gasp winner against Ghana have . been doing the rounds on YouTube and are on a par with videos of English . fans reacting to goals - although they have had less to cheer about . this year. Big story: Soccer is now front page news in the states - including their 1-1 win over England in 2010 . No country aside from the host nation took up more tickets than the USA's 196,838 for the finals while viewing figures are at an all-time high and beginning to even rival those of America's traditional sports. While the MLS still does not quite have the same level of popularity at the USMNT - it is improving. This year's television viewing figures were low but next year Beckham will launch his own new Miami-based MLS side, while David Villa represents arguably the States' biggest coup following his sign for Manchester City's sister club New York City FC. Chelsea legend Frank Lampard might follow the Spanish striker. Coach Jurgen Klinnsman has penned a letter for fans to print out and hand in at work to help them get the day off for what he calls 'for an important cause'. For supporters in the US, real football is finally becoming important. Adopted nation: Klinsmann's print-out letter designed to be handed in by American's at their workplaces . Top man: Clint Dempsey, the USMNT's captain is becoming a popular figure in the States . Madness: Fans in American gear react to a goal in a Rio de Janeiro fanzone - thousands have travelled over . USA fans erupted in fan parks and bars when John Brooks scored the winner against Ghana but despaired when Cristiano Ronaldo set up Silvestre Varela to equalise for Portugal and deny them qualification after two games. A win or draw against Germany would guarantee a place in the next round and might see even more emotional scenes.","United States supporters pack out fan parks to cheer on team during 1-0 defeat to Germany .

"Lucan Battison was suspended from a New Zealand Catholic school after he refused to cut his long curly hair but he can keep his hairstyle after winning his fight in the high court today . A student has won his High Court battle to keep his hair long after he was suspended from school because he looked 'unruly'. Lucan Battison, 16, was sent home last month from St. John's College, in Hastings, New Zealand, for not adhering to the rule that states students must keep their hair ‘short, tidy, off their collars and out of their eyes’. Principal Paul Melloy told Lucan he could return once he had his hair cut - but the student argued his naturally curly hair would look 'boofy' if cropped and he was prepared to wear it tied back in order to comply with the school's standards. But New Zealand High Court Judge David Collins ruled that Lucan’s actions did not warrant suspension as his conduct was not harmful to his fellow students. He also said the school had not provided enough clarity on the hair rules to ensure students complied with them. When the case began, the teen’s lawyer, Jol Bates, likened Lucan to Martin Luther King Jr for standing up for his rights. Judge Collins made a point of commenting on Lucan’s character, noting he received a civil bravery award in March for participating in the rescue of two young women who nearly drowned in dangerous ocean conditions. After St John's College student (right) was suspended by principal Paul Melloy the matter was taken to the High Court at Wellington for a judicial review. The teenager is pictured with his lawyer Jol Bates (left) on Monday . He also mentioned that Lucan represented St. John's in rugby and loved attending the school, in part because 'his faith was important to him'. Meanwhile, although the school did not approve of Lucan’s hairstyle, it described him as a ‘nice young man’. Judge Collins said that one of Lucan’s lawyers had tried to provide the school board's disciplinary committee with statements from two hairdressers, one of whom said Lucan's hair was already short and would ‘look like ""an untidy afro'' if it was cut shorter,’ but that the committee apparently chose not to accept the testimony. Parents Troy Battison and Tania Doidge said in a statement that their son had never broken the rules because his bun kept his hair off his collar and out of his eyes. 'In 2014, when girls' hair lengths at school aren't questioned, why should the rules be different for boys?' his parents said. 'The criticism we have received as parents has been hurtful and unnecessary.' In a statement issued by the school, Mr Melloy said the school was naturally disappointed about the decision made in Wellington. ‘The Board of Trustees are taking time to consider the judgment made by Justice Collins in terms of its impact, both on our school and on other schools,’ it said. Mr Bates said his client was standing up for his basic human rights, challenging authority and following in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr . Mr Bates said Lucan had been sporting the same hairstyle since he became a student at the Catholic college three years ago .","A judge ruled New Zealand schoolboy Lucan Battison does not need to cut his hair before returning to class .

"By . Leesa Smith . and Aap . Virgin has returned nine Embraer 190 airliners back to service after the aircraft model was grounded on the discovery of a fault with bolts that hold the plane's engine in place. This in turn prompted a worldwide alert after Virgin discovered the fault during heavy maintenance carried out on Wednesday night and Thursday. This news comes as the airline is currently in serious recovery mode at Sydney Airport after a power outage shut down the entire T2 domestic terminal for three hours today. Virgin has returned nine Embraer 190 airliners (such as the model pictured) back to service after the aircraft was grounded on the discovery of a fault with bolts that hold the plane's engine in place . The Brazilian manufacturer issued an ‘alert service bulletin’ to all airlines operating the Embraer 190 after being informed of the problem by Virgin. The issue relates to bolts that hold the engine onto the engine pylon, which is attached to the plane's wing. A full inspection of its fleet of 17 Embraer 190 aircraft found faults with nine of them, which were grounded while repairs were carried out. ‘We identified the initial issue with the bolt ... we advised the manufacturer and the manufacturer has sent out a notification,’ a Virgin spokesman told AAP on Friday. ‘These aircraft have since undergone the necessary precautionary repairs and have since returned to service,’ the airline said in an additional statement. ‘At Virgin Australia, the safety of our aircraft is our highest priority and we have been in regular dialogue with Embraer regarding this alert.' The Civil Aviation Safety Authority was also informed of the matter. The Embraer 190 is slightly smaller than a Boeing 737 and is used by Virgin to service regional and metro routes across the country, including Brisbane to Sydney, as well flights to Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands.","Nine Embraer 190 planes were grounded on the discovery of faulty bolts that hold the plane's engine in place .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . It’s a question that internet communities have fought over for eons: is ‘gif’ pronounced like the world ‘gift’, or ‘jif’, as the maker recently said it should be said? Thankfully the public consensus on this and 43 other tech-related words of phrases has been revealed in a survey of 1,000 people by eBay Deals. From the most popular terminology for a portable computer to the way most people describe the internet itself, some surprising results are revealed in the survey. Interactive results below . In a survey of 1,000 people eBay Deals asked how they say popular tech words and phrases, such as the correct terminology for an animated image (pictured). Other questions revolved around how they refer to the internet and also what the correct word for a portable computer is . Taking a look at some of the most intriguing results, the correct terminology for a data stick that plugs into a computer was up for debate. While 60.8 per cent described it as a flash drive, 8.39 per cent called it a memory stick and 6.65 per cent a jump drive. Portable computers were less contentious – 91.89 per cent agreed they were called a laptop. Lol - 60.89 per cent . Hahaha - 17.23 per cent . LMAO - 11.39 per cent . ROFL - 3.74 per cent . ROFLMAO - 3.46 per cent . Other - 3.28 per cent . The correct terminology for a device to change the channel on a television was another interesting battle. In this instance 65.45 per cent opted for remote, 21.97 per cent said remote control and 5.83 percent went for clicker. Elsewhere the influence of Apple was evident in what people called a mobile digital media player. While 47.30 per cent referred to it as an MP3 player, 48.57 per cent of the 1,000 people surveyed said they called it an iPod. The pronunciation of some words may seem to be set in stone - internet for example - some people still insisted on different ways to say it, perhaps comically - in this instance 'interwebs'. Click on the arrows above to browse through different categories such as remote controls, the internet and Wi-Fi to see what people call them . Is it a remote, a remote controller, a clicker or a controller? In the survey 65.45 per cent of people opted for remote, 21.97 per cent went for remote control, 5.83 per cent said it was a clicker and another 5.83 per cent said it was a controller . Meanwhile 54.88 per cent referred to ‘@’ as the ‘at’ symbol, while 33.73 per cent said tag and 9.3 per cent said it was a mention, as seen on Twitter. Google’s domination of the search market was evident, with a huge 83.14 per cent saying ‘Google it’ was the correct phrase to use when searching for something online. Using ‘Ask Jeeves’ was preferred by just 1.82 per cent of respondents. The correct terminology for a personal phone seemed to indicate the majority of survey respondents were American - 58.8 per cent said it was a cell phone and just 5.01 per cent referred to it as a mobile phone. And finally, the correct way to pronounce the word meme also proved controversial. While 47.63 per cent opted for ‘meem’, 30.93 per cent of people surveyed went for ‘me-me’ and 20.44 per cent went for ‘mem’.","A survey of 1,000 people by website eBay Deals tackled terminology .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . When Google Streetview came on the scene in 2007, the level of detail it provided astounded the world. But that was nothing compared to what the search engine could be offering in a few years, according to experts. The tech giant recently acquired Skybox for $500 million (£295 million), and the satellite firm has hinted its technology could potentially be used to predict when Apple's next iPhone will launch. Scroll down for video . Google-owned Skybox is already measuring the amount of trucks outside the Taiwanese electronics group Foxconn (Google Maps image pictured) every week to try and determine when the next iPhone will be released. It said an increase of trucks around the building may suggest the phone is being shipped . SkySat-1, which was launched in November, captured up to 90-second video clips at 30 frames per second. Satellites . today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution, . but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than . traditional satellites. The circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100w light bulb. The . U.S. group, Skybox Imaging, is now planning a constellation of 24 . satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of the . Earth. SkySat-2, an identical version of SkySat-1, is scheduled to launch in 2014. According to a report by Christopher Mims in Wall Street Journal, an analyst at UBS found out that if he looked at satellite images of parking areas of Wal-Mart stores, he could predict the company's sales figures. Skybox hopes to achieve a similar result using far more powerful data. ‘We think we are going to fundamentally change humanity's understanding of the economic landscape on a daily basis,’ co-founder Dan Berkenstock told Mims. Berkenstock added the firm is measuring the amount of trucks outside the Tawainese-electronics group Foxconn, for example, to find out when the next iPhone will be released. However, the firm did not reveal its predictions for this date. California-company Skybox can also determine how much oil is being pumped out of the ground in Saudi Arabia by using satellites to monitor overground storage tanks. By 2016, the Californian company will be able to take full images of the Earth twice a day, at a resolution that was, until recently, illegal to use for commercial purposes. Satellites today are capable of taking imagery clearer than a metre in resolution, but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites. Shown here is a view of Abu Dhabi . This image is a screen grab from a video created by French site nowhereelse.fr. It features an industrial model of the iPhone 6 handset, believed to have been made to help case and accessory makers ensure their products fit the new design. Satellite imagery could help reveal when it will be released . By the time its fleet of 24 satellites launches in 2018, Skybox will be able to image the entire Earth at a resolution capable of capturing real-time video of vehicles. Skybox has already hit the headlines for capturing the first HD video footage of Earth from its tiny satellite - which many dubbed at the time as being 'like live Google maps.' Satellites today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution, but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites.

"By . Tim Shipman . Russia could seize the whole of Ukraine in three days, Nato’s supreme military commander warned yesterday. US Air Force General Philip Breedlove said Vladimir Putin has built up a force on Ukraine’s borders that is big enough for a full-blown invasion and ‘ready to go’. He spoke as diplomatic concerns grew over the Russian strongman’s failure to pull his forces back after seizing Crimea – despite pledging to do so. But intelligence chiefs warned Nato that . the 40,000 troops on the border could invade the rest of Ukraine within . 12 hours of a Kremlin order. General Breedlove said: ‘This is a very . large and very capable and very ready force.’ Vladimir Putin sent troops into Crimea after Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich was toppled in February . He said it had aircraft and . helicopter support, field hospitals and electronic warfare capabilities – . ‘the entire suite that would be required to successfully have an . incursion into Ukraine, should the decision be made’. He added: ‘We think it is ready to go and we think it could accomplish its objectives in between three and five days.’ Russia said it regretted the tone of Nato’s comments as a throwback to the Cold War. ‘The language . . . rather resembles the verbal jousting of the Cold War era,’ foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said. Russia has said it will not invade Ukraine, but Mr Putin sent troops into Crimea after Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich was toppled in February. He has said he will protect ethnic Russians in nearby countries. There have been pro-Russian demonstrations across east Ukraine, with crowds asking to be saved from ‘fascists’ they say have taken over in Kiev. Moscow wants these areas to have more autonomy, a move bitterly rejected by the new government, which says it would break up Ukraine. General Breedlove warned that Moscow . might seek to invade eastern Ukraine, establish a land corridor to . Crimea, seize the Black Sea port of Odessa or even seize land to connect . Russia to Transdniestria, the mainly Russian-speaking, separatist . region of Moldova to the west of Ukraine. Build-up: Russian solders prepare to move a Russian T-72 tank at the Ostryakovo railway station near Simferopol, Crimea, on Monday . On the move: Russian armoured personnel carriers pictured heading into Crimea in February . Nato foreign ministers meeting in Brussels this week asked military commanders to draw up plans to reinforce Nato members in Eastern Europe. Nato will hold joint exercises with countries in the area and is looking at the readiness of its rapid reaction force. Its Secretary General Mr Rasmussen said: ‘If Russia were to intervene further in Ukraine, I wouldn’t hesitate to call it an historic mistake. That would lead to further international isolation of Russia. ‘It would have far reaching consequences . for the relations between Russia and . . . the Western world. It would . be a miscalculation with huge strategic implications.’ U.S. Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe (second left), speaks to colleagues during a meeting  in Brussels yesterday . The warnings came as Viktor Yanukovich announced he was ‘wrong’ to invite Russian troops into Crimea. The ousted president said he has met with Mr Putin and still hopes to see him hand the region back. ‘Crimea is a tragedy, a major tragedy,’ he said. ‘We must . . . search for ways to return to Crimea on any conditions.’ Russia annexed Crimea last month following a rushed  referendum held after Russian troops took the region. Ukraine and the West have rejected the move as illegal.","US General Philip Breedlove warns Russia's troops are 'ready to go'

"By . Jaya Narain . If you punch a punk or kick a metaller in Manchester, you could soon be hauled before the courts and charged with a hate crime. Greater Manchester Police is set to become the first force in Britain to recognise attacks on members of alternative subcultures. So now assaults on goths, emos, punks and heavy metal fans and other minority groups will be officially labelled as hate crimes. The force will record such incidents as hate crimes in much the same way it officially recognises attacks on people due to race, religion, disability, sexual orientation or transgender identity. Scroll down for video . Inspiration: Greater Manchester Police has made the change in policy following the murder of Sophie Lancaster in 2007 . The move comes after goth student Sophie Lancaster, 20, was killed after she and her boyfriend were brutally attacked in a park. Sophie was a goth who had upwards of . 20 piercings in her face, lip and nose and liked alternative music stars . like Marilyn Manson. She and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, . 21, were set upon without provocation as they walked through a park in . Bacup, Lancs in 2007. A gang of youths, drunk on cider, . lager and peach schnapps, kicked Mr Maltby unconscious before two of . them turned on Sophie Lancaster. Will classifying them as hate crimes reduce the number of attacks on goths? The student, who was due to start an . English degree at university a month later, was attacked as she cradled . her boyfriend's head in her lap. She suffered horrendous head injuries . and was rushed to hospital where a photo was taken of her battered and . bruised face which became a symbol of ‘Broken Britain.’ Afterwards the gang celebrated their . attack on the goth — or ‘moshers’ - by telling friends: ‘There’s two . moshers nearly dead up Bacup park - you wanna see them - they're a right . mess.’ Sophie survived for 13 days in . intensive care before her family made the heartbreaking decision to have . her life support machine turned off. Greater Manchester Police will be the first police force in the UK to recognise alternative sub-culture such as Goths and Emos. The move follows the brutal death of goth student Sophie Lancaster . Sophie's boyfriend Robert Malty was also brutally attacked in the park. Now the GMP will seek to protect those who are part of an 'alternative sub-culture' Her killers, Ryan Herbert, 16, who . admitted murder, received a 16-year minimum term while Harris, who was . convicted after a trial, was given a minimum of 18 years. Three other boys from the area . admitted beating Mr Maltby, 21 – brothers Danny and Joseph Hulme, 16 and . 17, and Daniel Mallett, also 17. They were jailed for between four and . six years. In the wake of her death, Sophie’s . mother, Sylvia, set up the Sophie Lancaster Foundation which dedicates . itself to wiping out intolerance and prejudice in all walks of life. Garry Shewan, assistant chief . constable in Greater Manchester Police (GMP), said: ‘Sophie’s tragic . death brought forward a need to recognise that there are many other . victims of hate crime that should be protected by law. Murderers: Ryan Herbter, left, and Brendan Harris, right, led a gang of teenagers who beat 20-year-old Sophie Lancaster to death because she was dressed as a goth . ‘While we have worked with the . foundation for some time, I am proud to say we are now the first force . in the country to officially record alternative subculture as a sixth . strand of hate crime motivation. ‘Hate crime ruins many people’s lives . and in some cases can tragically cost lives. We work with many . organisations to raise the awareness of what hate crime is and how . victims can be supported and we will continue to encourage our . communities to challenge it, report it and help us to stop it.’ Sylvia Lancaster, founder of the . Sophie Lancaster Foundation and Sophie’s mum, said: ‘It is a very proud . day for me personally and the rest of the team. ‘It is a validation of the work we have undertaken in the past five years and hopefully other forces will follow GMP’s lead.’ Mr Shewan added: ‘The launch of this . new strand of recordable hate crime is a major breakthrough. We are able . to officially recognise that people who wish to express their . alternative sub-culture identity freely should not have to tolerate hate . crime – something that many people have to endure on a daily basis.’ Greater Manchester Police said it . recognises alternative subculture as a broad term to define a strong . sense of collective identity, values and tastes. Distinctive style, clothing, make-up, . body art and music preference will fall under an ‘alternative umbrella’ and will include goths, emos, punks and metallers - though it could also . include other groups. The Sophie Lancaster Foundation works . with police forces and politicians to ensure individuals who are part of . sub-cultures are protected by the law.","Greater Manchester Police becomes first in country to adopt new policy .

"By . David Kent . League One side Doncaster have a new celebrity owner after a takeover by former chairman John Ryan and One Direction singer Louis Tomlinson was announced. A spokesman for Ryan said that the deal had been completed and would be explained in detail at a press conference in London on Thursday. Twenty-two-year-old Tomlinson is a global star as one member of five-piece boy band One Direction and is a lifelong fan of his hometown club. VIDEO Louis Tomlinson Doncaster takeover complete . Done deal: One Direction star Louis Tomlinson has completed his joint takeover of Doncaster Rovers . Fan: Tomlinson is a lifelong supporter of Rovers and even appeared for their reserves last season . He played for their reserve side . against Scunthorpe earlier this year and had been close to a takeover . before, but a move was twice delayed because of negotiations over image . rights. They have now been resolved and Ryan's spokesman said: 'It's done, the takeover is complete.' Ryan, who ended his 15-year association with Rovers in November, will be the lesser known of the two men but will doubtless be the more hands-on. The businessman has extensive football experience and oversaw Doncaster's rise from non-league to the Championship as well as their move from Belle Vue to the Keepmoat Stadium before stepping aside in November to allow Terry Bramall and Dick Watson to take over. Pop: Tomlinson's (second left) image rights caused the takeover to be stalled on two occasions . Return: John's spokesman has confirmed the deal, saying: 'It's done, the takeover is complete.' The initial snag had related to . Tomlinson's image rights, which are owned by his management team and . would entitle them to a share of any money generated from the use of his . image or name. They believe . that interest in the club will increase as a result of Tomlinson's . ownership and it is understood they battled for a share of any extra . revenue made through merchandise and extra ticket sales. Tomlinson . signed on as a player at the start of the season in a move to make . money for the Bluebell Wood charity and turned out in front of nearly . 10,000 fans for the reserve team in February. By . a strange quirk, Ryan has also played for Doncaster, with the then . 52-year-old having brought himself on as a substitute in a 4-2 win . against Hereford which came after his club had sealed promotion from the .

"By . Freya Noble . Two men officially became the first same-sex couple to legally marry in Australia on Friday. The only catch was, as soon as they stepped outside the British consulate in Sydney where the ceremony took place, their partnership was not recognised under Australian law. One half of the history-making couple said despite being the first to marry abroad under new British marriage equality legislation, he and his husband were simply trying to adhere to tradition. Scroll down for video . Gordon Stevenson (left) and Peter Fraser (right) have become the first same sex couple to marry abroad under UK marriage equality law . 'Far from trying to break down marriage we are trying to join it. We're trying to join that tradition,' Gordon Stevenson, 61, said after the ceremony. In March same-sex marriage became legal in England and Wales, and the marriage equality laws are now extended to 24 other countries, including Australia. Couples can wed if at least one of them holds a British citizenship, which is why Gordon Stevenson and Peter Fraser were married within the walls of the consulate. Their marriage, which took place in the UK consulate in Sydney, is not recognised under Australian law . The couple are proud to be the first worldwide to marry abroad under the British legislation . The happy couple urged the government to reconsider their marriage equality laws . Mr Fraser and Mr Stevenson both hold dual British-Australian citizenships and have lived Down Under for 19 years, but both donned traditional Highland dress for the wedding in a reference to their their Scottish heritage. Peter Fraser revealed that though he was proud to be half of the first couple to marry in a UK consulate worldwide, he hopes it wont be long until his marriage is properly recognised in his home country. 'While I do feel so proud and really privileged to be the first in what I'm sure will be many couples here, I am also conscious that now we've left the consulate and gone outside our marriage will not be recognised here, under Australian law,' he said. Mr Fraser (right) said he and husband Mr Stevenson (left) shouldn't have been forced to seek the protection of another country's law . The men married wearing traditional Highland dress as a nod to their Scottish heritage . Having lived in Australia for 19 years, the men hope they don't have to wait too long for their marriage to be legal in their home country . 'I hope soon also that all Australians will be able to marry the person that they love here in Australia with their family and friends around us as we have done, but without the need to seek to protection of the laws of another country.' Despite not wanting to politicise his big day too much, Mr Stevenson urged the Prime Minister to take the lead from other nations and think back to his own wedding day 'and all the joy and love' that he and his wife experienced. 'And then I would ask him, would you not also want that for us... And for everybody that wants to be married, regardless.","Peter Fraser and Gordon Stevenson wed at the British consulate in Sydney .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Veteran Dolphins players have been accused of forcing newer recruits to fund their lavish lifestyles including $30,000 dinners and trips to Las Vegas. According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald on Sunday, the alleged bank-rolling is behind Jonathon Martin's shock leave of absence from the team last week. ESPN claims lineman Richie Incognito got Martin to contribute $15,000 to help finance a trip to Vegas last summer, even though he didn't attend. However, Incognito quickly disputed the report on Twitter. Bullying claims: Miami Dolphins Guard Richie Incognito, right, has been accused of bullying younger players though he denies the claims . Meanwhile, the Herald reported that one unnamed young player had coughed up so much cash to veterans that he's gone broke. Reporter Adam Beasley tweeted: 'Recently, a younger player was handed the tab for a $30,000 team dinner. The rookie minimum this year is around $400.000.' Two tweets from Jared Odrick and Will Davis support the accusation. 'Everything tastes better when . rookies pay for it,' Odrick tweeted on November 2, while Davis wrote 'I . just seen a dinner bill for $30,000... WOW #RookieNight' The team came out on Sunday labelling the accusations of bullying 'speculation.' They added that their number one concern was Martin's health and well-being. 'The Miami Dolphins, including Coach Joe Philbin and Jonathan's teammates, have been in communication with Jonathan and his family since his departure from the club and continue to be in contact. Our primary concern for Jonathan is his overall health and well-being,' the statement read. 'As an organization, we take any accusations of player misconduct seriously. The notion of bullying is based on speculation and has not been presented to us as a concern from Jonathan or anyone else internally. The reports that the NFLPA is investigating our players are inaccurate. Additionally, the NFL offered its assistance during this time, which we appreciated and gladly accepted. We will continue to make Jonathan's health and well-being a focus as we do with all of our players.' After ESPN reporters Chris Mortensen and Adam Schefer's latest story, Incognito took to Twitter to rubbish the claims against him, writing '@AdamSchefter Stop slandering my name. You hide behind 'sources' who are not man enough to put their name behind the BS you report.' Leave: Miami Dolphins tackle Jonathan Martin, 24, pictured, had taken a personal leave of absence from the team which has been blamed on the persistent teasing of his teammates . Three minutes later, the player . added: '@AdamSchefter This is the second time you have tried to drag my . name through the mud with with lies.' It was first reported on Friday that tackle Jonathan Martin had taken a personal leave of absence from the team because of persistent bullying and teasing at the hands of certain teammates. Martin, . nicknamed 'Big Weirdo' by some teammates has apparently been plagued by . bullying since joining Miami as a 2012 second-round draft choice. The . latest taunts prompted Martin to leave Dolphins headquarters on Monday . after a group of players stood up and left when he tried joining them . for lunch. The incident caused Martin, 24, to finally reach his limit and walk out, reports FOX Sports. Martin is receiving professional assistance for emotional issues. A person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press that Martin is with relatives and doesn't have any problems with the coaching staff. Educated: The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University . The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin is Stanford-educated and the son of two lawyers who attended Harvard University. He played in last Sunday's loss at New England, then missed practice during the week. He was replaced by Tyson Clabo in Thursday night's game against Cincinnati. A second-round draft pick from Stanford, Martin started every game at right tackle as a rookie last year. He switched to left tackle this season, then moved back to the right side last month in a reshuffling of the Dolphins' struggling offensive line. 'You can approach this two different ways,' Martin said regarding his latest position switch at the time. 'You can go in the tank and be one of those guys that moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a professional and play as hard as you can. My mindset is I'm going to go out there and do whatever I can to help the team win.' Pass protection has been a problem for Miami all season. Ryan Tannehill went into the Bengals game with an NFL-high 32 sacks, and the Dolphins (3-4) were saddled with a four-game losing streak. Martin's agent didn't respond to requests for comment. The walkout raises questions about Martin's future with the franchise. The NFL Players Association is monitoring the situation and has made inquiries into determining what has happened with Martin, a source told FOX Sports. Martin, posted a message on Facebook that read, in part, 'Happy Halloween! Don't believe everything you read.' The message also reportedly added, 'Opinions are like (expletive), everyone has one.'","According to reports on ESPN and in the Miami Herald, the alleged bank-rolling is partly behind Jonathon Martin's shock leave of absence from the team last week .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The secrets to becoming a billionaire have been laid bare by a new report, and the bad news is it is not easy. Living in Hong Kong helps, and so does being well-educated and working in a country where the lawyers speak English. But a study into the 1,000 people who have earned more than $1billion warns budding entrepreneurs making your fortune is ‘hard, risky and tough’ and almost certain to fail. The guide to becoming a SuperEntrepreneur gives seven tips on turning an idea into a billion dollars. It draws on the experiences of Larry Page and Sergey Brin who founded Google, Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson and retail tycoon Sir Philip Green. Analysis by the Centre for Policy Studies found the UK does not even rank among the top 10 countries for producing billionaire entrepreneurs. The studiy looked at nearly 1,000 self-made men and women who, according to business magazine Forbes, have earned at least $1billion. There were a total of 22 British billionaire entrepreneurs between 1996 and 2010. Self-employment is higher in areas with more SuperEntrepreneurs . Higher tax rates lead to fewer SuperEntrepreneurs . It is easier to do business where there are more SuperEntrepreneurs . SuperEntrepreneurs  are more likely to have top degrees . 1. Entrepreneurship is hard, risky and tough. There is a good chance that you will fail in your attempts to create the next Google . 2. Entrepreneurship . is often knowledge intensive. It is no coincidence that Larry Page and . Sergey Brin, whose academic research explored the mathematical . properties of the internet, were the ones that founded Google . 3. Entrepreneurship . is a numbers game. If you only start one company, and pursue a single . business idea, you are much more likely to fail than your neighbour, who . tries a number of different ideas over a long period of their life. 4. Entrepreneurship . is increasingly specialised, and supported by an infrastructure. If you . have a great idea, and can attract the aid of venture capital, you will . be much more likely to succeed . 5. Entrepreneurship . is more common in certain industries than in others. You can . potentially become a billionaire pursuing almost any business idea, but . are much more likely to succeed if you do so in a rapidly growing (and . novel) field – as biotechnology and IT have been during the past . decades. 6. Entrepreneurship typically requires industry experience. Steve Jobs worked at Atari before founding Apple. Microsoft founder Paul Allen worked as a programmer for Honeywell . 7. Entrepreneurship . requires scaling up. Edison gained over 1,000 US patents not merely . through his own work, but by creating the first industrial research . laboratory . According to the analysis, Britain . produced one entrepreneur for every two million people. By contrast Hong . Kong produced almost three entrepreneurs for every million, Israel 1.7 . per million and the US 1.3 per million. However, the study suggested Britain was still better than most eurozone countries when it came to producing successful entrepreneurs - beating Germany, Spain, France and Italy. The report by Dr Nima Sanandaji found personality is one of the most important attributes to becoming a successful SuperEntrepeneuer. These include creativity, work ethic, ambition, optimism, self-confidence, leadership qualities, adaptiveness, drive to achieve, tolerance of ambiguity, resilience, tolerance of stress, decisiveness, ability to deal with failure, a high energy level and good social skills. Dr Sanandaji warned the burden of high taxes and red tape is preventing Britain from breeding enough globally successful entrepreneurs. In an article for The Daily Telegraph he urged the Government to cut capital gains tax and scrap the top 45p tax rate. He also criticised Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith for suggesting the Coalition's welfare reforms were encouraging more people to start successful businesses. Last week Mr Duncan Smith hailed Britain's ‘entrepreneurial spirit’ after the Bank of England highlighted figures showing a record 4.5 million people are self-employed. But Dr Sanandaji wrote: ‘The Work and Pensions Secretary was conflating self-employment with entrepreneurship. In reality, the two phenomena are quite different. ‘The Coalition's benefit reforms may well promote self-employment, which is a good thing in itself. But it is wrong to suppose that reducing benefits will do much for entrepreneurship. ‘In order to do that, the Coalition should turn its attention to cutting business and personal tax rates and taking the axe to red tape.’","Report looks at why some countries better at breeding SuperEntrepreneurs .

Mr Osborne is due to make a joint appearance today with David Cameron in Manchester, where he will say: ‘We need a Northern powerhouse. ‘Not one city but a collection of cities sufficiently close to each other that they can take on the world.’ The Chancellor will argue that although the cities’ combined population of 9million is similar to that of London, poor transport links are holding back their potential. He will go on to say that the Government is considering new east-west high-speed rail connections. At the moment, it is quicker to travel the 283 miles from London to Paris by train than it is to travel less than half that distance between Liverpool and Hull. Train services between Sheffield and Leeds currently take around 40 minutes for a journey of 38 miles. However a journey of a similar distance between London and Reading only takes 27 minutes. And Manchester and Sheffield are 38 miles apart, but it takes over an hour and 20 minutes to drive between them. In that time you can get from Southampton to Oxford – nearly twice the distance. Mr Osborne is hoping to build up the Conservative Party’s appeal outside their Southern heartlands and show that the high-speed 2 rail line from London to Manchester and Leeds is just the start of a regeneration process which will extend across the country. The Government has already agreed to £600million worth of rail improvement schemes around Manchester, including work on the trans-Pennine route from Liverpool to Hull. Mr Osborne will say: ‘There  is a hard truth we need to address – the cities of the North are individually strong, but  collectively not strong enough. The whole is less than the sum of its parts. ‘So the powerhouse of London dominates more and more. That’s not healthy for our  economy. It’s not good for our country. We need a Northern powerhouse to provide jobs, opportunities and security.’ High-speed super-city: Making a joint appearance with David Cameron, Osborne will argue poor transport connections hold back potential of Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Sheffield . Mr Osborne will go on to say: ‘We need to think big. We need an ambitious plan to make the cities and towns here in this Northern belt radically more connected from east to west – to create the equivalent of travelling around a single global city. As well as fixing the roads, that means considering a new high-speed rail link.’ Labour’s Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘Nobody will believe that the Tories can deliver the jobs, growth and investment which we need for the north of England.’ But Jim O’Neil, chairman of the Cities Commission, said: ‘This is a really important speech by the Chancellor opening up the path to genuine devolution of power and ideas to our northern cities. ‘I welcome his boldness in  calling for faster, more effective communications between key cities that will allow them to operate as large economic hub.’ And former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine, who has advised the Government on urban regeneration, said: ‘Let us use economic recovery to spread wealth to every corner of our country. Nowhere is better placed to lead the rebalancing of the UK than the North. The combined might of great cities like Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds and the talent of the people who live there must have the chance to lead this vital part of our country.’ n David Cameron’s enterprise adviser has backed Labour’s claim that there is a ‘cost of living crisis’ in Britain. But Tory peer Lord Young of Graffham,who once served in Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet, said people have always struggled with living costs. He told Sky News: ‘The cost of living crisis has always been with us, and you mustn’t underestimate that.’","The Chancellor set to propose investing in northern cities Monday .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Ukip has been forced to scrap a freepost address - after receiving packages containing blood and faeces. Nigel Farage's anti-EU party, which is currently leading the polls for the European elections later this month, has been inundated with packages from hostile voters. The party used a freepost address on a leaflet for a campaign in Norwich in 2010 in a bid to drum up support. Nigel Farage is growing in popularity ahead of this month's crunch European elections - but he is also extremely divisive . But the address was leaked on the internet - allowing opponents of Mr Farage and his party to bombard the address with letters and packages which Ukip would have to pay for. A campaign began for people to send anything heavy to the address - such as bricks or bottles of water. Other people sent flyers, leaflets and household junk. Twitter has been inundated with pictures of various packages sent to the Ukip freepost address in a bid to rack up a huge postal bill for the party. One voter sent a huge Dostoevsky novel using the service complete with Farage's face taped over the picture of 'The Idiot'. But over the weekend the Ukip's Bexley branch confirmed the freepost address had been cancelled. On Twitter the local party posted a memo which read: 'You may be aware that there have been incidents of inapproriate mail items being sent to a UKIP Freepost address. 'This includes items which are prohibited (such as blood/human faeces) and present a health and safety risk both to you and our Royal Mail colleagues. The hostility to Mr Farage was exposed when he was egged by a protester in Nottingham . 'The Freepost address for UKIP has been cancelled.' One angry Ukip supporter wrote: 'What kind of person sends faeces or blood to a political party? Are people OK?' Despite hostility to the party, Ukip is currently on course to beat the Tories and Labour in this month's European elections. A poll in The Sunday Times put Ukip on 29 per cent, one point ahead of Labour, with the Conservatives in third. A second poll for The Sun on Sunday had Ukip three points ahead of Labour.","Nigel Farage's party targeted by hostile voters after address leaked online .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The Terminator films may have been onto something with their terrifying use of liquid-metal exoskeletons. In what could be precursor to the films, a Chinese lab recently announced it has been able to use liquid metal to repair severed nerves. A team at Tsinghua University in Beijing said the futuristic technique could someday improve current methods of nerve repair in animals and humans, while preventing long-term disabilities. The researchers are hoping to find out whether the liquid metal will prevent nerve repair. One tentative idea is to only place the liquid metal around the peripheral thick area of the nerve and then include growth factors - a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating cellular growth - in the thinner microchannels . When a nerve is severed, the muscles at one end of that nerve are cut off from signals from the brain, and essentially immobilised. This can potentially lead to atrophy, a process in which the nerves waste away. To prevent this, neural signals still need to be sent from the brain over the gap in the severed nerve as it heals. The most common way of doing this is to use a solution of salts called Ringer's solution that copies the function of body fluids, according to a report in CNET. But metal could be a better way of conducting those signals, according to the research. The Terminator films may have been onto something with their terrifying use of liquid-metal exoskeletons. In what could be precursor to the films, a Japanese lab recently announced that it’s been able to use liquid metal to repair severed nerves. Pictured is Robert Patrick as T-1000 in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgement Day . When a nerve is severed (left), the muscles at one end are cut off from signals from brain and essentially immobilised.  This can potentially lead to atrophy, causing the nerve to waste away. To prevent this, neural signals still need to be sent over the gap in the severed nerve as it heals.  A healthy nerve is shown on the right . Scientists believe the metal is likely to work well in surgery as it remains liquid at body temperature. More tests are needed to see if it is safe for humans . The team in Beijing tested the liquid metal on a severed sciatic nerve connected to the calf muscle of a bullfrog. The sciatic nerve begins in the lower back and runs through the buttock and down the lower limb of the bullfrog. Scientists applied a pulse to one end of the nerve and measured the signal that reached the calf muscle, which contracted with each pulse. They then cut the sciatic nerve and placed each of the severed ends in a capillary filled either with liquid metal or with Ringer’s solution. The pulses were re-applied and the scientists measured how they moved across the gap. The pulses that passed through the Ringer’s solution tended to degrade, while the pulses passed readily through the liquid metal. ‘[Ringer's] Solution could not be competitive with the liquid metal in the performance as functional recovery channel,’ the researchers wrote. They believe that metal, known as metal alloy gallium-indium-selenium, is also likely to work well in surgery as it is liquid at body temperature. However, the material still needs extensive testing to see if it is safe to use in the body. The team now plan to make special conduits for reconnecting severed nerves that contain liquid metal. The researchers are also hoping to find out whether the liquid metal will prevent nerve repair in some way. One tentative idea is to only place the liquid metal around the peripheral thick area of the nerve and then include growth factors - a naturally occurring substance capable of stimulating cellular growth - in the thinner microchannels. Actor Robert Patrick famously portrayed the T-1000, a liquid-metal robot which repaired itself. Last year, more than 20 years after the 1991 film Terminator 2 was released, Spanish scientists claimed to have developed the world's first self-healing polymer that can spontaneously rebuild. The new material has been labelled ‘Terminator’ by researchers, who said it could help improve the lifetime and security of plastic parts in anything from electrical components to houses. The discovery - revealed in the Royal Society of Chemistry’s journal Materials Horizons - was hailed as the first polymer that restores itself without intervention, reported United Press International. The researchers from the Centre for Electrochemical Technologies in San Sebastian said that after being cut in two and the pieces pushed back together, one sample 97 per cent healed in two hours. The single piece was unbreakable when stretched by hand, according to scientists Alaitz Rekondo, Roberto Martin, Alaitz Ruiz de Luzuriaga, German Cabanero, Hans Grande and Ibon Odriozola. They said: ‘Such a material presents near quantitative self-healing efficiency at room-temperature, without the need for any external intervention such as heat or light.’","Scientists tested the liquid metal on a severed nerve in a bullfrog .

Representing your country at the World Cup is one of the greatest honours a footballer can receive but it seems the pride of playing at this summer's tournament is making players emotional. After Neymar was spotted crying as Brazil's national anthem played ahead of their 0-0 draw with Mexico on Monday, Ivory Coast midfielder Serey Die is the latest player to have broken down in tears ahead of kick-off. Die and his team-mates stood full of . pride as the Ivory Coast national anthem began to play ahead of his . side's Group C clash with Colombia on Thursday evening but the 29-year-old soon burst into tears. Emotional: Ivory Coast midfielder Serey Die bust into to tears during his country's national anthem . All too much: Serge Aurier, Cheick Tiote and Didier Zokora all had to console the midfielder before kick-off . Proud moment: Die's World Cup appearance comes just a year after making his international debut . Sporting a blond mohawk, Die tried to keep a stiff upper lip in an attempt to belt out the words but just couldn't control his pride at representing his country at such a huge occasion. Defender Serge Aurier and former Tottenham man Didier Zokora were quick to console Die before the match got underway while Newcastle star Cheick Tiote put an arm around him. Die revealed the reasons for his tears on Instagram and said: ‘It was just the emotions of pride . to be Ivorian and serve my country that have made me cry because I [never] . thought [for] a day [I would] be at that level.’ However, having dried his eyes and taken to the field, Die was again the centre of attention during the first half. In action: Die gets stuck in to make a challenge on Colombia's Juan Cuadrado early on in the first half . After Colombia were awarded a free-kick by referee Howard Webb following Die's tussle with Juan Camilo Zuniga, the Ivory Coast man swiftly fell to the floor with his hands over his face before letting out a roar of frustration. BBC's World Cup host Gary Lineker tweeted: 'May well have just seen one of the worst and oddest dives in World Cup history from Die Serey. Have a look at halftime.'

"By . Kieran Corcoran . Revenge: Gillian Stokes, a 44-year-old tuck shop worker, pulled doughnuts on the grounds of the private school that used to employ her and attacked the caretaker with a fire extinguisher . A tuck shop worker who attacked a school caretaker with a fire extinguisher then pulled 'doughnut' stunts in her car while fleeing from police has been spared jail. Gillian Stokes, 44, carried out her bizarre revenge on Shrewsbury School in Shropshire last Friday after winning an unfair dismissal case against her former employers. Stokes breached a restraining order to come back to the £30,000-a-year school, a court heard, where she caused £500 damage by hitting a wall, then drove her car over a historic cricket pitch on which Shrewsbury alumnus Charles Darwin once played. She admitted assault, criminal damage and breaching a restraining order at Telford Magistrates' Court yesterday, and was given a six-month suspended prison sentence. Magistrates heard that Stokes arrived at the school in a fury, shouting obscenities at members of staff. When she spotted caretaker Jonathan Taylor in a corridor, the court heard, she pushed him with both hands before grabbing a fire extinguisher from the wall and swinging it. On the first occasion she missed Mr Taylor but hit a wall causing £500 worth of damage, but on the second occasion she hit the top of his leg. She then set the fire extinguisher off in his face from just two feet away and fired the foam at his eyes before fleeing the building. When outside she climbed into her Nissan Duke and fled across the school grounds to avoid police who had been called by concerned staff. Officers pursued her across the historic cricket pitch after she abandoned the car. When one caught her, she was tackled to the ground and arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and assault. Bid for freedom: After attacking the caretaker with a fire extinguisher, Stokes drove her car partway across Shrewsbury School's cricket pitch (pictured) before being apprehended by police . Prestigious: Stokes was sacked from the £30,000-a-year school, and later won an unfair dismissal trial against them . Prosecutor . Abigail Hall said: 'On Friday June 20 Mr Taylor was at work at the . school in his office when he heard a staff member shouting down the . corridor. 'He heard staff saying that Gillian Stokes had gone upstairs. He states ""I ran upstairs to see what was going on. '""Gillian was in the corridor, she was very agitated shouting and swearing telling me to f**k off"". 'He states that she began pushing him with both hands holding him on the shoulders. 'He . then managed to get behind the defendant. He states the defendant . pushed him out of the way. The defendant picked up a fire extinguisher . and swung it at him. 'The defendant missed and hit the wall, causing £500 of damage. 'The . defendant then swung the fire extinguisher again. This time it hit him . on the top of his left leg. She then discharged it straight in to his . face from two feet away. 'The . force knocked his glasses off and it went in his left eye causing a . lot of pain. He states he did seek medical attention but no serious . damage has been caused to his eye.' The . court heard Stokes also swore at the police officer who arrested her . after a short chase across the cricket field - saying 'f**k off you . c**t' and 'f**k off c**ksucker' at him. As well as the six-month sentence for breaching her restraining order, Stokes was handed a two-month suspended sentence for assault and a one-month sentence for criminal damage. All three will run concurrently. 'Problems': Defence lawyers for Stokes said the bizarre revenge was prompted by her sacking . She was also ordered to pay £250 compensation to Mr Taylor, £250 to Shrewsbury School, £85 costs and an £80 victim surcharge. Chairman of the bench Sally Themans said: 'Regardless of how aggrieved you feel about your treatment and how wronged you may feel you cannot and must not go on to a school property from which you have a restraining order and create havoc the way you did last Friday. 'It’s very serious. It was a deliberate breach of a court order. To let a fire extinguisher off in somebody’s face could have caused a lot of damage. 'You are not going to prison but it is hanging over you, so any breach and there would be no choice but to implement it. 'That restraining order is there for a reason, just don’t go anywhere near that school otherwise you will be back here and will be in prison.' Stokes was handed a restraining order banning her from going to the school in November last year. Paul Nicholas, defending, said all her offending related to her dismissal from Shrewsbury School last year. Once a schoolboy: The cricket pitch which Stokes drove over was once used by Charles Darwin, an alumnus of the school . He added: 'This lady would not have been before the courts if it hadn’t been for what occurred at her old employer. 'That’s the only problem in this lady’s life. She was at that school for 17 years. It has been a torrid, torrid time for her.' Last month an employment tribunal heard Miss Stokes claim she was unfairly dismissed because of trade union activity. The tribunal also heard that she claimed to have been sexually assaulted by a female colleague. Miss Stokes won her case, but was not awarded the £24,000 compensations which she sought. Speaking after the case, school spokesman Kathy Campbell said Stokes was spotted performing ‘doughnuts’ in her car shortly before she attacked Mr Taylor. She said: 'She did briefly and rather unexpectedly enter the school fields on Friday. 'Pupils were practising on the cricket pitch at the time. She turned up in defiance of an injunction banning her from the premises. 'She did several high speed laps of the cricket pitch in her car and performed several doughnuts. 'Because her car has personalised number plates we knew immediately who it was and alerted police. Teachers led the pupils to safety. Everyone was shocked but it was dealt with in a calm and swift manner. 'We are taking extra security measures to ensure she cannot come back to the school and locking the gates. You don’t want someone who is in an irrational state driving their car onto the school grounds when there are children around. 'Our groundsman is not happy. It is a historic and beautiful cricket pitch... Charles Darwin probably played on it.' Stokes, of Shrewsbury, Shropshire, refused to comment outside court.","Gillian Stokes, 44, worked at Shrewsbury School, Shropshire for 17 years .

Students come to her with questions about their examination results, while concerned mothers consult her about their daughters' prospects for marriage. 'I feel very good. I had a nice talk with her. I am really happy. I'm happy I came here,' said sixth grade student Mohammad Osama after meeting Mumtaz. For older people, Mumtaz takes them back to memories of their own from childhood encounters with the creature. 'I saw it during my childhood about 40 or 45 years ago.

Brady said: 'There are often a number of factors, genetic, . environmental, viral, that could be playing a role.' The star, who fought a six-month . battle . with the disease from August 2010 until January 2011, had initially . believed that it was his years of smoking and drinking that had lead to . the illness. However, in a new interview the 68-year-old said that the particular strain he had suffered with was caused by human . papilloma virus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted disease in the US. Douglas made the frank admission about how he developed the illness during an interview with The Guardian newspaper when he was asked if he had regretted smoking and drinking in the past. Douglas candidly replied: 'No. Because without wanting to get too . specific, this particular cancer is caused by HPV, which actually comes about from cunnilingus.' Douglas, . who is married to Welsh actress Catherine Zeta-Jones, was diagnosed . with cancer in August 2010 after a walnut-sized tumour was found on his . tongue. Brady said there are hundreds of different types of HPV virus and that in most cases it does not cause damage. The risk is so low, he said, that he does not believe people should worry or change their sexual practices. Fighting back: Michael in November 2010, when he was battling cancer . His health troubles . started just a few months after his eldest son Cameron - from his first . marriage to Diandra Luker - was jailed for drug possession and dealing. The actor admitted he initially believed his disease had been triggered by the stress over his son's legal troubles. He explained: 'I did worry if the stress caused by my . son's incarceration didn't help trigger it. 'But yeah, it's a sexually . transmitted disease that causes cancer. And if you have it, cunnilingus . is also the best cure for it.' Douglas was diagnosed with stage four of the disease and underwent an intense course of chemotherapy and radiation. Eventually, he was given the all-clear, although he still has to undergo check-ups with doctors every six months. However, the actor is optimistic he has conquered the disease once and for all. 'With this kind of cancer, 95 per cent of the time it doesn't come back,' he said. Family man: Michael with his wife Catherine Zeta-Jones and their two children Dylan and Carys . More than 20 years ago, Michael was hospitalised for an addiction, which many reports at the time claimed was to sex. However, he has since denied that he was a sex addict, insisting that he was being treated for alcohol abuse. Last year Cancer Research UK said that the rising rates of HPV-positive cases of oral cancer could be linked to oral sex. World Health Organisation figures have also linked HPV to more than 5 per cent of cancers worldwide. HPV . can be passed between men and women by genital contact, most often . during vaginal and anal sex. It may also be passed on during oral sex . and genital-to-genital contact. It can be passed on between straight . and same-sex partners - even when the infected person shows no symptoms. Last year, Professor Margaret Stanley of Cambridge University said boys must be given the vaccine for HPV as well as girls. The jab has routinely been given to 12 and 13-year-old girls since 2008 and protects against the virus. She said that to not protect them against a host of cancers, including tumours of the tongue, tonsils, head and neck, would be unethical, unfair and socially irresponsible. Professor Stanley explained: 'Obviously cervical cancer is the big one but in Europe and the United States and Australia, places that have got cervical cancer screening programmes, cervical cancer is very well controlled. 'But the other cancers - cancers of the anus and increasingly the tonsil and tongue - there is no screening for them and no way of detecting them until they are proper cancers and they are more common in men than in women.' The professor said that boys, like girls, should be vaccinated at the age of 12 or 13, before they are sexually active. Human papilloma virus (HPV) is spread through sexual contact and is more usually associated with cervical cancer in women. It is the most commonly sexually transmitted infection in the U.S. HPV can be passed between men and women . by genital contact, most often during vaginal and anal sex. It may also . be passed on during oral sex and genital-to-genital contact. It can be . passed on between straight and same-sex partners—even when the infected . person has no signs or symptoms. The cervical cancer jab given to 12 and 13-year-old schoolgirls aims to cut their odds of the cancer by protecting them against the virus. Although most mouth and throat cancers are normally blamed on drinking and smoking an increasing number of cases that occur around the tonsils and back of the tongue are due to HPV. Although the cancer is not contagious, the virus is. In the US, HPV is blamed for up to 80 per cent of these tumours of the tonsils and the back of the tongue, which experts say could be due to increasing popularity of oral sex. The typical patient is described as an otherwise healthy man in his late 40s or early 50s who has never smoked or smoked very little. In Britain, the number of mouth and throat cancers have increased by 40 per cent in just a decade, to 6,200 cases a year. Cancer Research UK says the HPV virus may be key to the ‘rapid rise’. Symptoms include persistent mouth ulcers, pain, discoloured patches and difficulty chewing and swallowing. Men are advised to check their neck for lumps when shaving and both sexes to look at the back of their throat while brushing their teeth. Treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are often more successful in mouth and throat cancers caused by the virus than those caused by tobacco and alcohol. Although mouth cancer can be caused by HPV passed on by oral sex, doctors say Michael Douglas’s claim that oral sex is also a cure doesn’t make any medical sense.","Actor believed it was years of smoking and drinking that caused disease .

"By . David Kent . Holland coach Louis van Gaal felt his side operated well in a changed system as they defeated Chile 2-0 in their concluding World Cup Group B fixture on Monday. The Dutch emerged victorious from a slow-burning and often fractious contest in Sao Paulo, maintaining their 100 per cent record in the pool, after substitutes Leroy Fer and Memphis Depay both notched late goals. It was a different performance to that Van Gaal's side had produced when they beat Spain 5-1 in their Group B opener or when they then saw off Australia 3-2. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Holland fans celebrate their side's victory over Chile . Crest of a wave: Louis van Gaal and assistant Patrick Kluivert have guided Holland to three group victories . Head boy: Leroy Fer broke the deadlock and gave Holland the lead with this header . Super sub: Fer had only been on the pitch for two minutes when he scored . Make them De-pay: Memphis Depay seals Holland's victory with a close-range finish . Take off: It was Depay's second goal of the tournament after his strike against Australia . And the Oranje boss, quoted on FIFA.com, said of the Chile encounter: 'It was a match of the highest quality. 'We limited Chile to a handful of opportunities, we neutralised them extremely effectively - and particularly in the second half we created more chances. 'We did have to change our style today - and I will always pick a system and a strategy that will help us win. 'However, we're not perfect - in possession we still need to improve, but I do think we're very good without the ball.' After each winning their first two group matches, both sides had already qualified for the last 16 ahead of this contest. But they went into it knowing that clinching first place in the pool would see them avoid a meeting in the next round with the winners of Group A - likely to be hosts and tournament favourites Brazil, who were in action later on Monday. The future's bright: Arjen Robben was again the star man as Holland enjoyed a 2-0 victory over Chile . Dutch of class: Holland celebrate after topping Group B with a 100-per-cent record . Goal difference meant Holland needed only a draw to ensure they remained at the summit. And despite Van Gaal's comments about picking a team to win - and the fact that that was the final outcome - Chile coach Jorge Sampaoli suggested that the Dutch had 'only wanted to defend'. Sampaoli said: 'We kept going and fighting for 90 minutes, but ultimately we didn't get the result. 'We wanted to win this game and we gave our all. 'We felt that Netherlands only wanted to defend. We expected Netherlands to go on the counter-attack with regularity and for such a long time we limited them to long shots. Disappointment: Sampaoli was upset not to get a result, and felt Holland had only set out to stifle his team . Second best: A runners-up finish means Chile will now face Brazil in the last 16 . Fan-tastic: Holland supporters on the Copacabana beach celebrate their victory . 'I felt that our intensity and commitment was outstanding. Our players should have their heads held high as we've played well in the three games so far and we're now through to the round of 16.' Holland winger Arjen Robben - who, following Fer's 77th-minute header, provided the tee-up on the break in stoppage time from which Depay converted inside the six-yard box - said: 'If you told me that we'd win our three games to finish top of the group two months ago I'd have been delighted, but I don't want to end it here. 'We want to go on. Although we want to enjoy the moment, we'll soon need to start to work hard in training to improve even more. 'You have to give compliment to both teams, both gave 100 per cent today.

"The man appointed by Pope Francis to clean up the Vatican's scandal-hit bank allegedly had a gay affair with a Swiss soldier and had to be rescued after getting stuck in a lift with a rent boy. Monsignor Battista Ricca was recently appointed as Francis's new prelate with responsibility for the Vatican bank, the Institute for Religious Works which has been hit by years of financial scandal. But according to an expose by weekly Italian news magazine L'Espresso, Monsignor Ricca's own record is less than spotless. Allegations: Pope Francis is pictured (centre) meeting Monsignor Battista Ricca last month. Ricca is alleged to have only got the job as Vatican bank prelate after the powerful 'gay lobby' airbrushed his CV . The publication has claimed that Monsignor Ricca only got the position as IoR prelate after the supposedly powerful 'gay lobby' in the Vatican airbrushed his CV. According to the claims, Ricca took a Vatican diplomatic post in Uruguay in 1999 and caused shockwaves within the church when moved his Swiss army captain lover Patrick Haari in. The publication claims that the allegations have been confirmed by a number of bishops, priests and laity in Uruguay. Ricca was eventually moved to Trinidad and Tobago and then recalled to Rome in 2002. Admission: Pope Francis admitted for the first time last month that a powerful 'gay lobby' does exist within the Vatican . The same year, he allegedly found himself in more hot water when he was attacked at a notorious cruising ground. Soon afterward, Ricca had to be rescued by firemen when he got trapped in a lift. He was reportedly found inside with a youth who was known to local police. As well as his role as primate of the IoR, Ricca is also in charge of the Pope's residential quarters at the Vatican. But the Vatican has denied the claims. Vatican spokesman Padre Federico Lombardi described the claims as 'not credible'. The allegations come a month after Pope Francis acknowledged the existence of a 'gay lobby' inside the Vatican's secretive administration for the first time. Speaking during an audience with Latin American Catholics last month, the Argentine Pontiff said that there was a 'current of corruption' in the Roman Curia - the central governing body of the Catholic Church. He also admitted the existence of a long-rumoured 'gay lobby' in the Curia, and hinted that he might take action over the issue. The Vatican is no stranger to gay sex scandals. In 2010, it was reported that one of Pope Benedict's ceremonial ushers and a member of the Vatican choir were involved in a gay prostitution ring.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . One of France’s top bosses has praised Britain’s business-friendly policies – and claimed his homeland has lost its ‘culture of entrepreneurship’. Maxime Picat, the chief executive of Peugeot, praised the recovery in this country and said there were ‘great opportunities’ in the UK for business. ‘Entrepreneurship is a French word,’ he said. ‘But it is the British who put it into practice. Vive l’Angleterre.’ Maxime Picat, the chief executive of Peugeot, has praised Britain¿s business-friendly policies ¿ and claimed his homeland has lost its 'culture of entrepreneurship' Mr Picat praised the recovery in this country and said there were 'great opportunities' in the UK for business . Mr Picat, one of France’s most influential industrialists, also criticised his country’s inflexible labour market and the number of strikes there. He was speaking just before the international launch of Peugeot’s latest model in London. Asked why he thought the British economy was performing better than the French, Mr Picat told the Mail: ‘There is a culture of entrepreneurship in Britain…we’ve lost that. ‘Then there are great opportunities.  It’s easy to find a job. You have a flexible labour market. We don’t. There are strikes in France.’ He said the UK was better at ‘managing unemployment’ and had more ‘flexible labour policies’ which allowed the economy to thrive. ‘When the market is recovering, the UK is able to recover faster,’ he said. ‘Economic growth in the UK is proof of that. The UK grabs opportunities faster.’ Militant: Workers from the French national railway SNCF march through Marseille yesterday as part of a national rail strike . Criticism: Mr Picat, one of France's most influential industrialists, also criticised his country's inflexible labour market and the number of strikes there . While the UK economy has gone from strength to strength in recent months, France’s has all but ground to a halt under Socialist President Francois Hollande, who now has the lowest approval rating of any French president on record. The IMF has predicted French growth would be only 1 per cent this year and 1.5 per cent in 2015. It expects growth of 2.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent in Britain. French public spending is among the highest in the world and is due to hit 57 per cent of national output this year. Its six million state employees make up a fifth of the workforce, while their salaries account for a quarter of public spending. 'The UK has a flexible Labour market. We don't. It is recovering faster. It grabs opportunities. It is dynamic' Maxime Picat . Peugeot chief executive . The IMF has told the government to start cutting  the bloated public sector, saying France’s tax rises had ‘weighed on the capacity of the economy to grow’. The high tax rate of 75 per cent for top earners in France has led to many of them coming to the UK. Some 300,000 ambitious French people now live in Britain – many in London. Mr Picat added: ‘London and the UK is a great place to live, work and study. It is particularly dynamic.’ Mr Picat also said he thought Britain’s position on the EU was ‘more realistic’. He suggested that the lack of democratic accountability of the ‘Brussels administrators’ was partly responsible for the success of the far-Right Front National in France in the European elections. ‘Only two weeks after that very strong signal, they think that European politics is back to business as usual. It’s not,’ he said. Mr Picat made his comments as Peugeot held its first ever global international car launch in the UK – that of the new, more upmarket, 508. The UK is Peugeot’s third largest market after France and China. Peugeot bosses said the London launch date of June 18 was ‘significant’ – chosen because that was the date in 1940 on which exiled Free French wartime leader General De Gaulle used the BBC to broadcast his call to arms to fight on despite the French government’s impending armistice with the Nazi invaders. Launch: Tennis star Novak Djokovic with the new Peugeot 508 at the car's London launch . Market: Mr Picat made his comments as Peugeot held its first ever global international car launch in the UK ¿ that of the new, more upmarket, 508 . Peugeot stopped building cars in Britain in December 2006 when it closed the Ryton plant in Coventry, though its UK headquarters remain in the city. Nevertheless, UK car production has now overtaken that of France for the first time since the 1960s. Latest figures show that the UK last year built more than 1.5million vehicles, compared to 1.46million in France. It means the UK is the third largest car manufacturer in Europe after Germany and Spain with vehicles are rolling off a UK production line every 20 seconds. Analysts predict UK output will hit a record of around 2million by 2017.","Peugeot CEO Maxime Picat says there are 'great opportunities' in UK .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . The fall-out from England’s World Cup fiasco will not include an official FA report into exiting the tournament after two games. Instead, the FA will review all aspects of  the Brazil experience on a continuous basis building towards Euro 2016 - but without any special document detailing what went wrong. This differs from the approach after the poor show at South Africa 2010, when the now defunct FA International Committee still had power and manager Fabio Capello delivered a tournament report to them. VIDEO Scroll down for Sporstmail's Ashton and Sale: There should be an FA inquiry . Early homecoming: England come away from Brazil with just a point to their name . The end of the world: Roy Hodgson walks onto the pitch after a dismal draw against Costa Rica . Some not only wanted Capello sacked but asked for future managers to be hired on a  tournament-to-tournament basis. By contrast, the Club England group who run the national team have already, in their wisdom, contracted Roy Hodgson to Euro 2016. But even if there is no opposition within the FA to Hodgson remaining in charge, there are sure to be demands that the World Cup debacle is properly investigated. ........................................................................................................ Fifa president Sepp Blatter has kept such a low profile at the World Cup - avoiding big-screen appearances at matches to avoid the inevitable booing - that there is speculation he has hardly attended a game. However FIFA say Blatter has attended seven matches - Brazil v Mexico, Switzerland v Ecuador, Germany v Portugal, Spain v Chile, Honduras v Ecuador, Nigeria v Bosnia and Belgium v Russia. Meanwhile Michel Platini, who is looking increasingly likely to stand against Blatter for the FIFA presidency in 2015, is not taking advantage of his rival staying under cover. The Frenchman is not even in Brazil, although he’ll return for the quarter-finals. ......................................................................................................... There remains frustration in Belo Horizonte that the England team chose not to make the city their World Cup base when Team GB and the British Paralympians will have their training camps in Belo ahead of the Rio Olympics. Hotel standards and a lack of attractions for the players compared to Rio are understood to be among the reasons for the FA going elsewhere. But the BOA and the BPA are satisfied with  their proposed accommodation and Belo point to Uruguay, Chile and Argentina, who are all still in the World Cup, choosing to stay with them.

Reddin was head of performance services at the BOA before joining the FA in the same capacity last February, charged with improving the team’s record at major championships. Reddin is keen on the back-up of a legion of sports scientists ‘underpinned with the latest research’, which worked for Team GB in 2012 but definitely didn’t work for the footballers at Brazil 2014. USA’s World Cup fever . The United States might finally be embracing football, judging by the remarkable 18.2million ESPN viewers for the country’s 2-2 draw with Portugal. This was a bigger rating than for any of the recent NBA series finals between Miami Heat and San Antonio Spurs. ESPN’s figures are 36 per cent up on South Africa 2010, and rivals NBC have also enjoyed huge audiences for Premier League coverage.  Another sign of the way ‘soccer’ is finally gripping America, seven years after David Beckham joined LA Galaxy, was 10,000 fans watching the Portugal game on a giant screen in Grant Park, Chicago.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . Humans fear people, animals and objects approaching them (illustrated), even if the person is not threatening, experts claim . In our struggle to survive, humans have learned that something approaching us, such as a dangerous animal or a person, is more of a threat than one that is moving away from us. And while we don’t have to worry too much about attacks by ferocious animals - in cities at least - this type of fear still plays a large part in our day-to-day lives. Experts have found that humans still have negative feelings about people, animals and objects approaching them, even if the person is not threatening. ‘In order to survive, humans have developed a tendency to guard against animals, people and objects that come near them,’ said Christopher Hsee of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. ‘This is true for things that are physically coming closer, but also for events that are approaching in time or increasing in likelihood.’ In a study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Professor Hsee and students from Chicago Booth and the University of Wisconsin, suggested that this fear, which they have called ‘approach avoidance,’ is an innate tendency. The scientists conducted eight tests to investigate their thesis and found that even nonthreatening objects and people evoked negative feelings as they moved closer. Even seemingly docile entities, such as deer, had a fear factor attached to them since participants could still attach some uncertainty to a wild animal's behaviour. Scary? Scientists conducted tests and found that even not threatening objects and people evoked negative feelings as they moved closer. Even seemingly docile entities, such as deer (pictured) had a fear factor attached to them since participants could still attach some uncertainty to a wild animal's behaviour . ‘Approach avoidance is a general tendency, humans don't seem to adequately distinguish between times they should use it and when they should not,’ Professor Hsee said. ‘They tend to fear approaching things and looming events even if objectively they need not fear.’ The scientists think their research has interesting implications and uses in a number of areas. Marketing experts could use the information to determine if they should gradually move a product closer to viewers in a television commercial, or whether that could harm the image of the product, the scientists explained. Similarly, speakers who tend to move closer and closer toward their audiences during their speeches should think twice, as doing so may cast an unfavourable impression on listeners, they said.","Humans have an 'innate' fear of people and animals moving towards them .

Meanwhile, FIFA's . disciplinary panel on Monday cleared Mexico's FA of improper conduct . after the organisation received complaints that some of their fans . shouted 'Puto' at opposing keepers, saying under the current rules the . federation was not responsible. FIFA's director of television Niclas Ericson admitted producers had . made a mistake when they overlaid a line on TV replays suggesting Brazil . striker Fred was offside when he scored against Cameroon.

"By . David Kent . Ian Wright has returned to Brazil following the burglary at his London home during which his wife and daughters were held at knife-point.

But Wright made a return to ITV punditry duty during Brazil’s final group match with Cameroon on Monday night. Good to be back: Ian Wright returned to punditry duty in Brazil on Monday night . Ordeal: Wright had flown home last week following the burglary at his family home . Wright has spoken of the 'terrifying' moment the armed gang held a Stanley knife to his wife's throat and threatened to cut off her fingers before they fled with family possessions including the former England star's MBE. The 50-year-old had to cut short his work for ITV at the World Cup in Brazil to look after wife Nancy, 39, and their daughters, aged four and two, following the raid on Wednesday night. Wright went straight to a waiting car which whisked him back to his family after his 11-hour flight from Rio de Janeiro landed at London's Heathrow airport on Thursday lunchtime. After rushing into his home in Queen's Park, north-west London, he later emerged to confirm that everyone was safe and his wife was 'feeling good that I'm back'. Speaking to The Sun, he said the men who were wearing masks barged in after Nancy opened the door at 9.15pm. 'They threatened to cut her fingers off and even threatened to do the same to the children, who were both upstairs in their bedrooms. 'Nancy was praying the children wouldn't wake up. 'It would have been devastating for them to see what was happening.' According to Wright, the men were hysterically shouting at Nancy to show them where the family safe was and marched her from room to room. When the safe was found, Nancy pleaded with the men to stop and said she would open it if they stopped pushing her around. Wright confirmed the MBE he was given by the Queen in 2000 for services to football was taken alongside rare watches. One of the watches was given to him by former Arsenal team-mate Dennis Bergkamp while the other was an Arsenal watch with an inscription from the club. However, Wright said the main thing was that his family was safe. Scroll down for videos .

"By . Ray Massey . Many drivers think they will escape prosecution for texting at the wheel because they see so many others ‘getting away with it’, an RAC report reveals today. Some 51 per cent of motorists believe it is unlikely that they will ever be penalised for sending texts while their car is stopped  in traffic. Forty-two per cent think it is unlikely they will be caught texting while on the move, with 16 per cent believing it is ‘extremely unlikely’ they will be challenged. Unlikely: Nearly half of drivers think it is unlikely they will be caught texting while on the move . And a shocking six out of ten of motorists are ignorant of the fact that texting at the wheel of a stationary car with the engine on is against the law despite the fact it has been illegal since 2003 for drivers to use a hand-held mobile phone. More than half of motorists report regularly seeing other people texting in stationary traffic during half or some of their journeys, while nearly a third claim to see this during most journeys. When it comes to drivers owning up to texting in stationary vehicles on the road, only one in 14  of motorists say they do, though this figure almost doubles to 15per cent for 17 to 24-year-olds. One in six admit to not knowing texting and driving is illegal and one in five say do not know it is illegal to check Facebook and Twitter while driving. More than a quarter think it safe to text and look at social media sites when stationary with the engine running, despite this being illegal. This is also despite research that shows texting at the wheel is more distracting than driving when drunk. Using a hand-held phone to text or speak at the wheel carries a £100 fixed penalty – recently increased from £60 - plus three points on the licence. Ministers have pledged to review this and impose a higher penalty if widespread abuse continues. Phone fans: Six out of ten of motorists are ignorant of the fact that texting at the wheel of a stationary car with the engine on is against the law . More broadly, 75per cent of motorists report regularly seeing other people talking on mobile phones with  nearly half saying they see this happening during most of their car journeys. Yet only 1 in 12 of drivers admit themselves to using a hand-held phone on most journeys. More than a third of motorists are concerned about other drivers talking on hand-held mobile phones and more than one in five about other motorists breaking traffic laws generally. But law-abiding motorists are deeply frustrated that law-breakers are being left to ‘get away with it’ because there are too few police on the road, according to the RAC report on Motoring for 2014. By contrast they note how police and other authorities are happy to clamp down on speeding – because most of the work is done for them with automated cameras and requires little or no effort from actual officers. No likes: One in five drivers do not know it is illegal to check Facebook while driving . The RAC mooring report concludes: ‘Many motorists in 21st century Britain think there is little risk of being caught breaking the law at the wheel for anything other than speeding or running a red light: offences typically enforced via cameras.’ It says four out of ten motorists believe anyone committing common offences such as texting at the wheel of either a moving or stationary vehicle, aggressive driving, tailgating, middle lane hogging on the motorway or undertaking would more than likely ‘get away with it’. As a result 60per cent of motorists surveyed believe there are insufficient numbers of police officers on the roads to enforce driving laws. The RAC Motoring Report  notes: ‘While the vast majority of motorists are law-abiding, with only three million of more than 35.8m drivers having points on their licences, there seems to be a perception among many motorists – rightly or wrongly – that drivers won’t be caught if they flout the law.’ It notes: ‘This is especially the case with the use of mobile phones while driving.’ For the new offences of tailgating and middle lane hogging only a quarter and one in five respectively think motorists are likely to be pulled up by a traffic police officer. For aggressive driving some 40per cent of motorists felt drivers would be unlikely to be caught, with 30per cent believing it likely. For so-called ‘undertaking’ passing a car on the inside - the figures were 49per cent unlikely and only 20per-cent likely. The report says: ‘The only offences that motorists truly believe are dealt with effectively are the ones that are enforced via cameras such as speeding and traffic light violations.’ Here nearly half think drivers will get caught for speeding and 46per cent for  running a red light. Of motorists with speeding points on their licences half say they were trapped by a speed camera, whereas only a quarter were caught by a police officer. RAC technical director David Bizley said: ‘Our research shows that millions of law-abiding motorists are frustrated with the reduction of traffic police and believe that the chances of drivers being pulled up for breaking the law are now minimal. ‘Motorists are tired of constantly seeing other drivers breaking the law and getting away with it so it is hardly surprising that they want to see a greater police presence on our roads to enforce motoring legislation more effectively, which would also act as a genuine deterrent. ‘ .","Forty-two per cent think it's unlikely they'll be caught texting and driving .

The 17-year-old from Artane in Dublin is in a coma after passing out when the joke went wrong. The incident happened on Thursday when a group of teenagers were joking about on their lunch break. A 17-year-old boy passed out and suffered a suspected heart attack after his testicles were squeezed as part of a prank that went wrong close to St David's CBS in Dublin . The Irish Mirror reported the boy was on his way back to St David's CBS in the city when he bumped into a group of classmates. It is understood the fifth-year student was joking about with the group when someone 'jerked his scrotum'. A source close to the family said the incident was 'not malicious', adding that they hope the teen has not suffered any permanent damage. A school teacher and one of the teenagers performed CPR, while they waited for the emergency services to arrive at the scene. The boy was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Beaumont Hospital in Dublin and on Friday, he was reported to be in a stable condition. Doctors treating him, put the teenager into an induced coma.

"By . Becky Barrow . ‘Unscrupulous’ bosses who force workers into signing contracts which offer no guaranteed hours every week will today be warned they must clean up their act. Many of Britain’s biggest employers, such as McDonald’s, the fast food chain, and the NHS, use these so-called ‘zero hour contracts’. A ‘zero hours’ contract means you have a contract with a company, but there is no guarantee you will be offered any work, which leads to financial insecurity and disruption to family life. Under the crackdown, which will be announced today, Vince Cable will reveal a ban on the use of ‘exclusivity clauses’ in these types of contracts. Scroll down for video . Many of Britain's biggest employers, such as McDonald's, the fast food chain (pictured), and the NHS, use these so-called 'zero hour contracts' Video courtesy of Rocket Lawyer . Such clauses prevent an individual from working for another employer, even though the employer may not offer them any work. The clampdown by the Business Secretary comes after Labour said it would outlaw any zero hours contract which exploited a worker. While ruling out a blanket ban, Labour promised dramatic changes, such as making bosses move a worker onto a proper contract after one year if they have been working regular hours and compensation if a worker had their hours cancelled at short notice. Mr Cable said zero hours contracts have ‘a place in today’s labour market’, such as offering flexible work for students, older people and workers wanting to top up their main income. But he added: ‘It has become clear that some unscrupulous employers abuse the flexibility that these contracts offer to the detriment of their workers. ‘We are legislating to clamp down on abuses to ensure people get a fair deal.’ A Government consultation into zero hours contracts found ‘overwhelming evidence’ that controversial ‘exclusivity’ clauses should be banned. The consultation, which received 36,000 responses, found more than eight in ten people were in favour of banning exclusivity clauses in zero hours contracts. Mr Cable said zero hours contracts still have 'a place in today's labour market' Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, the business lobby group, said: ‘It is right to ensure that exploitation is stamped out. ‘Tying an employee into an exclusivity clause can turn a flexible contract into a rigid and archaic one.’ The Department for Business said it will also consult further on how to prevent ‘rogue’ bosses evading the ban, such as offering a one-hour fixed contract to their workers. The Office for National Statistics recently estimated around 1.4million so-called ‘zero hours’ contracts exist in Britain, and it predicts the number could be even higher. Around one in eight businesses in the UK use zero hours contracts, but large firms employing 250 or more people are far more likely to use them than smaller employers. The majority of workers with a zero hours contract are women, who typically work for the NHS, cafes, restaurants and hotels doing poorly paid jobs. For many workers with these types of contracts, it also means the boss does not offer paid holidays, maternity pay or other traditional benefits enjoyed by a permanent employee. Chuka Umunna, the shadow business secretary, accused the government of presiding over ‘a rising tide of insecurity.’ He said: ‘Zero-hours contracts, which were once a niche and marginal concept, have become the norm in parts of our economy as families have been hit by the cost of living crisis.’ Today’s ban will be part of the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill which will be introduced to Parliament today.","Contracts mean that here is no guarantee you will be offered work, even if you are employed by a company .

"By . Tom Gardner . The ruler of mega-rich Arab state Qatar has handed power to his son in a rare bloodless transition of power. British-educated crown prince, Sheik . Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, will take control of the hugely wealthy and influential Gulf . state which has become one of Britain's biggest investors. Foreign Secretary William Hague has welcomed news of new leader, taking to Twitter to say: 'Historic day for Qatar as the new generation takes over.' Transition: Ill health is thought to be the reason why Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, left, has decided to hand control of the hugely wealth Gulf state to his son crown prince Sheik Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, right . The 33-year-old new ruler will take over a country with a sovereign wealth fund thought to total $100biliion which owns Harrods and . Christie’s, has financed the Shard and has major stakes in a number of high-profile British institutions. Qatar is a small country of two million . people but is a big exporter of natural gas, a global investment . powerhouse and a financial backer of Arab Spring revolts. The 61-year-old emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, said in a televised address that the decision has been made to step down following weeks of speculation. Power: A view of the skyline of Doha, Qatar's capital, is a symbol for how the country has rising to be one of the most influential and wealthy countries in the Middle East . Rising from the sands: Huge natural resources has transformed Doha, the capital of tiny Gulf state Qatar, into a glittering metropolis of skyscrapers in just a few years . In a seven-minute speech aired on . state television, the emir said it was time for a new generation to take . over following his 18 years at the helm of the small, rich state. The Qatari investment fund is thought to total $100bn. The resource rich Gulf state has used its enormous spending power to buy a swathe of high profile brands and institutions over the past few years. Qatari investments include: . 'The time has come to open a new page . in the journey of our nation that would have a new generation carry the . responsibilities ... with their innovative ideas,' said Sheikh Hamad, . reading a prepared text behind his desk. 'I address you today to inform you . that I will transfer power to Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. I am . fully confident that he is qualified for the responsibility and is . trustworthy.' But the transition - a rarity in a . region where leadership changes are nearly always triggered by deaths or . palace coups - also sends a message the wider Middle East. It appears a sweeping response to the . Arab Spring upheavals and their emphasis on giving voice to the region's . youth, and reinforces Qatar's bold-stroke political policies. Under Sheik Hamad, who took power in a . bloodless coup in 1995, Qatar has been transformed into a political . broker. It has also become a center for global investment with a sovereign fund . estimated to be worth more than $100 billion. Its portfolio includes landmark real . estate, luxury brands and a powerful presence in the sporting world. Tiny Qatar also defeated rivals including the U.S. to win the rights to . host the 2022 World Cup. Now, the new ruler will begin the process of putting together a new government that may be in direct contrast to the old guard leaders across the Western-backed Gulf Arab states. Qatar has given no official explanation on the transition, but it is widely believed that Sheik Hamad is suffering from health problems. Sheik Tamim is not expected to make any immediate policy shifts for Qatar, which has used its riches to propel itself into one of the world's most politically ambitious countries. Landmark: The Qatari sovereign wealth fund helped finance The Shard, a 72-storey skyscraper in London which is Europe's tallest building . British icon: Harrods department store, pictured, in London's Knightsbridge is one of a number of high-profile acquisitions by the $100bn Qatari sovereign wealth fund . It has served as a powerful player in the Middle East, including key support for rebels in Libya last year and now in Syria. Qatar . also has broken ranks with other Gulf states to offer help to the . Muslim Brotherhood, which rose to political dominance in Egypt. In an important sign of continuity and shared goals, the outgoing emir and Sheik Tamim stood shoulder to shoulder and greeted members of the ruling family and others following the address. Sheik Tamim has been closely involved in all key decisions in recent years and his father is expected to remain a guiding force from the wings. 'Sheik Tamim will be driving his father's car, which is already programed on where to go,' said Mustafa Alani, a political analyst at the Gulf Research Center in Geneva. Qatar has played a role as mediator . in conflicts such as Sudan's Darfur region and regional disputes . including Palestinian political rifts. Qatar . this week hosted a Syrian opposition conference attended by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and is the venue for possible U.S.-led . peace talks with Afghanistan's Taliban. Sheik Tamim became the next in line to rule in 2003 after his older brother stepped aside. On . the eve of the power transfer, Sheikh Hamad issued a decree extending . the term of the advisory shura council, in effect indefinitely . postponing elections that had been tentatively scheduled for the second . half of the year. The . election would have been the first to the Shura Council, 30 of whose 45 . members are meant to be elected, with the others appointed by the emir, . under a constitution approved in 2003. All the body's current members . are appointed. Over at Stratford stand the buildings of the Olympic Village - once the Games are finished this summer, QIA will take ownership .

"By . Wills Robinson . Mother: Kerry Abel, 38, pictured leaving Sheffield Crown Court today, said she only left her son Riley, two, in the bath for five minutes . A toddler drowned in a bath of scalding water because his mother fell asleep while high on a cocktail of drugs, a court has heard. Riley Lewis, two, had suffered horrific burns when he was found at his home in Hull, floating face-down in water thought to be 45C. Even after he was taken to hospital, his temperature was still a shockingly high 41C. As soon as paramedics arrived at the scene they found him face-down in the water and discovered he was still hot to touch. His mother, Kerry Abel, 38, told Sheffield Crown Court she had only left Riley alone for five minutes, but Richard Wright QC, prosecuting, said experts in pathology and forensic science have agreed he must have spent at least two hours in the water. And on the day of her son’s death she had taken methadone, tramadol, her partner’s diazepam, and the painkiller pregabalin. There were also traces of heroin, cocaine, and cannabis in her blood. Miss Abel lived with Riley’s father Andrew Lewis and their children and had wanted the toddler to 'inhale steam' to treat a chest infection, the court heard. Andrew called 999 at 11.48pm on January 4, last year and said his son was dead. The first paramedics arrived eight minutes later. The court was also told that Abel was arrested at Hull Royal . Infirmary after Riley was pronounced dead, she tried to kick a support . worker and was verbally abusive to the police. Mr . Wright said there were two estimates of the temperature of the bath . water - that it was between 40C and 45C for several hours, or that the . initial temperature was 'considerably higher' and it had cooled to 41C. The court heard the burns were caused after Riley had drowned.Miss Abel had been prescribed methadone to treat her heroin addiction. But she had not been able to get her regular dose because it was 'lost in the system', the court heard. She was given an emergency dose on January 2, but failed to collect her prescription the following day. Cocktail of drugs: The court heard she had a number of substances in her system on the day of her son's death, including heroin and cocaine . The court heard pregabalin produces a 'euphoric' effect and Miss Abel described it as 'a popular drug on her estate', Mr Wright said. She had tried and failed to get her doctor to prescribe it. Mr . Wright told the jury they could expect Miss Abel to say she was unwell . at the time, had not eaten much, was in pain from an abscess in her . mouth, and after feeling dizzy was knocked unconscious when she . collapsed against a radiator. But . he said the prosecution did not accept that because her account had . 'changed over time' and been 'modified and appended' when she was . questioned about it. Mr Wright said: 'A far more likely scenario is that she put Riley in the bath and, affected by drugs, fell asleep. Hearing: The prosecution told Sheffield Crown Court that the injuries the boy suffered suggested he was in the bath for at least two hours . 'Miss Abel deliberately took a cocktail of drugs during the day that would inevitably have an effect on her function, and as an experienced drug user, she well understood the dangers. We do not say that Riley was deliberately killed by his mother, Kerry Abel. 'We do not suggest she wanted him to die or to be injured in any way. We do suggest Riley’s death was entirely avoidable and Kerry Abel was responsible for it.' Miss Abel denies manslaughter between January 3 and January 6, last year, and the trial continues.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Murderer: Babysitter Jessica Fraraccio, 22, admitted to killing little Elijah two years ago . The devastated family of toddler Elijah Nealey who was suffocated by his babysitter two years ago has slammed her five-year prison sentence as 'an insult'. Jessica Fraraccio, 22, pleaded guilty in October to killing the 23-month-old boy in his Virginia home. Even though Mike and Jennifer Nealey understood nothing could bring back their beloved son, the grieving couple hoped for a five-decade prison sentence. The couple were left reeling when Judge J. Howe Brown on Monday sentenced Fraraccio to 50 years jail, but suspended 45 and ordered that she donate $1 every year to charity following her . release. Audible gasps were heard in the courtroom when the sentence was announced, which the boy's grandmother described as 'an insult'. 'Once the verdict was read, I didn’t . even fully comprehend it until after I’d left the courtroom and it all . started sinking in. The anger has started to really build . up since Monday. It still doesn't make sense,' 40-year-old Mike Nealey said, according to The Huffington Post. 'His (the judge's) decision shows no respect whatsoever for me, my family, or the life of my son. 'To me, it’s a total failure of our . justice system. I want everyone to know what the judge thought my son’s . life was worth...which is pretty much nothing, according to him.' In handing down the sentence, Brown admitted his decision would please nobody, but didn't consider 50-years jail appropriate. 'Nothing I can do brings back Elijah or makes them (his parents) feel better,' he said, according to The Washington Post. 'Likewise, nothing I can do to punish her is more important than her memory of what she (Fraraccio) did.' Shocking: Jessica Fraraccio, 22, had cared for little Elijah for seven months before she murdered him in August 2012 . Fraraccio, a . devout Catholic with a 'submissive personality', had cared for little . Elijah for seven months before she killed him on August 22, 2012, just weeks before his second birthday. Fourteen months later, she pleaded guilty, after initially saying the toddler had slipped in a bathtub and hit his head. Fraraccio eventually admitted that while Elijah was eating lunch, she kicked the chair out from under him because he wouldn't stop crying. The boy hit his head on the table, then the floor. The babysitter became frustrated when the toddler continued to wail. Enraged, she picked him up by one arm, covered his mouth with her hand and slammed his head on the stair railing. His body was limp when she put him down. He was dead. Furious: Mike Nealey, Elijah's dad, said the sentence 'doesn't make . sense' and that 'the anger has started to really build up since Monday' Daddy's boy: Mike Nealey thought the prosecutor's proposed 50-year jail term was more appropriate . For months after the incident, the Healey's believed Elijah's death was accident. 'I feel like I never had the chance to be angry at her (Fraraccio),' Mike Nealey told Manassas Patch. 'By the time we heard that it wasn’t an accident I was so shocked...I believed for months it was an accident.' Mike Nealey remembers calling Chick fil-A on the day of his son's death to set up a birthday party for the boy. For Mike Nealey, Brown's decision was an incredible let-down. He doesn't believe Elijah's death was an accident. Defense attorney Sandra Drewniak told The Huffington Post that Fraraccio had a mental health break and 'just kind of snapped'. 'Ms. Fraraccio in my opinion had what is very similar to shaken baby syndrome,' she said. 'It was a terrible accident and she had no intention of hurting Elijah.' When Fraraccio eventually gets out of prison, Mike Nealey will have to explain to his two daughters, six and seven, what happened to their brother. For now, they believe he died after slipping in the tub. 'That’s the story we’ve told them and we haven’t changed it,' he said. 'They’re not old enough to really comprehend it yet. We’ll tell them one day, but not anytime soon.' A petition calling for Brown's removal from the bench has attracted more than 5,600 signatures. 'This monster deserves the full sentence, and Judge Brown deserves to lose his appointment. It is an outrage,' the petition author wrote.","Jessica Fraraccio, 22, murdered 23-month-old Elijah Nealey in August 2012 .

"By . Ray Massey . Labour’s favourite think-tank has declared a new war on the motorist with draconian Big Brother pay-as-you-drive tax plans to force middle class drivers to pay more per mile to drive their cars than poorer ones. Spy-in-the-cab black box technology would be used to track each car’s mileage by GPS satellite and to calculate the tax charge every time the driver fills up at the garage to encourage ‘behaviour change.’ It says the Government’s Driver and Vehicle Licencing Agency (DVLA) should be linked to HM Revenue and Customs records so that drivers could be charged automatically according to their income level – with wealthier motorists paying more. Under the IPPR plan, information on the tax affairs of drivers could be used to charge the better off more to use the roads . Drivers should also be charged a higher rate of tax for making ‘unecessary’ short journeys that they could have made on foot or by bicycle, says the report by the left-of centre Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR). The pay-as-you-drive tax rate should even be increased in summer when more daylight and warmer weather meant there was more incentive for people to leave the car behind and walk or cycle, it adds. Gas-guzzling cars that create more air pollution - such as most of those powered by diesel - should be charged at a higher rate. To avoid opposition, schemes should be brought local by stealth and without referenda votes which might scupper them, it said. But motoring groups condemned the Big Brother plans as ‘beyond Orwellian’. Under the plans each driver’s journeys would be monitored ‘using GPS tracking technology linked either to an in-vehicle unit or to a smartphone’. The travel data would then be transmitted from the vehicle to the petrol station each time the driver filled up. Payments could be collected through mobile phone bills or by the driver’s insurer. The IPPR argues that the existing systems of taxing motoring – fuel duty and road tax (VED)- are unfair and ‘blunt tools’. This is because many poor people are priced off the roads by high rates of fuel duty and the higher rates of vehicle excise duty on older, less efficient cars, which they are more likely to drive, it argues. It also notes that as cars become increasingly fuel efficient, tax revenue to the Treasury is set to fall. The IPPR is close to leading Labour politicians and inspired some of Ed Miliband’s policies to give tenants more rights in the private rented sector. ""A poor person driving a certain car a certain distance, in a particular area and at a particular time, should be charged less than a rich person making the same journey"" The report was written by IPPR Fellow Mark Rowney, a Labour candidate standing in Battersea, south London, in coming local elections. n his preface and acknowledgements, Mr Rowney author thanks Labour political rising star Will Straw, son of former Labour Cabinet minister Jack Straw, noting: ’Special gratitude is reserved for Will Straw for his support, guidance and comments throughout the research and writing process.’ The 62-page IPPR report is called ‘The Long Road to Ruin – why the UK needs to reform motoring taxes.’ It says: ‘The unfairness, unsustainability and unhealthiness of current motoring taxation mean that reform is urgently needed to transform it into a progressive system that is based upon road useage.’ It notes how the technology exists to allow ‘wireless transmission of mileage data to fuel stations’ and ‘GPS tracking using ‘satnavs’ or mobile phones’ and the black boxes used ion ‘pay-as-you-go-insurance.’ It says: ’These can be utilised to create taxation structures that encourage behaviour change.’ The report says the technology would allow ‘seasonal pricing to encourage active travel in summer; charging comparatively more for shorter journeys; charging polluting vehicles more than less polluting vehicles.’ Significantly it raises the spectre of ‘linking tax levels to personal information held by HM Revenue and Customes to make motor tax progressive.’ It adds: ’It is theoretically possible to create a system that targets individual unnecessary journeys and make allowances for peoples incomes.’ Spelling out the detail it says: ‘A poor person driving a certain car a certain distance, in a particular area and at a particular time, should be charged less than a rich person making the same journey. It adds: ‘A replacement motoring tax in the UK could be progressive by linking information on vehicle ownership held by the DVLA to information on income held by HMRC. It would thereby be possible to create a system that targets individual unnecessary journeys but which makes allowances for people’s incomes.’ The report raises the spectre of ‘linking tax levels to personal information held by HM Revenue and Customs to make motor tax progressive.’ The report says the shift to electric cars and greater fuel efficiency will result in a fall in tax revenues under the present system, forcing the Treasury to consider reforms to keep up the £38billion tax collected annually. The IPPR accepts that changes to motoring taxes are ‘politically toxic’ – especially since the last Labour government’s failed attempt to introduce nationwide pay-as-you-drive congestion charging. But it is convinced the public could be won over gradually. The IPPR concludes: ‘It will require a great deal of political courage. Those who might oppose reform can validly be accused of wilful fiscal irresponsibility, ignoring the plight of the squeezed middle and the poor.’ The report says the car-charging schemes should be introduced locally but – mindful of voters in Manchester and Edinburgh throwing out such ideas in the past - without a local vote: ’Referendums should be avoided if possible.’ When the Coalition took power in 2010, then Transport Secretary Phillip Hammond pledged to ‘end the war on the motorist’ after more than a decade of labour’s anti-motorist policies, including pay-as-yu drive road charging. AA president Edmund King said: ‘This proposal is beyond Orwellian — monitoring people’s movements, telling them when they can and can’t drive. Who would want to live in a society like that?’ He questioned the IPPR conclusion that motoring taxes penalised the poor noting: ‘We have 30 million cars on the road. It’s not like the 1950s or 1960s when arguably motoring really was for the rich.’","IPPR says poor people should pay less than other road users .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . General Sir Peter Wall, the Chief of the General Staff, has warned ministers any further cuts to defence spending would jeopardise the success of the service's reform programme . The head of the Army has warned against further defence cuts as he stressed the military needed to be prepared to deal with any new threat which might emerge. General Sir Peter Wall, the Chief of the General Staff, warned ministers any further cuts to spending would jeopardise the success of the service's reform programme. Gen Wall said while there was currently little appetite among politicians for fresh military engagement overseas, he warned Britain should pay 'special attention' to the 'rapidly shifting environment in which we may well have to operate sooner than some would have us think'. He said they would need all their current allocation if they were to deliver a 'well-trained, well-equipped and fully funded' force capable of defending the national interest. His comments come after the former chief of the defence staff, General Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, warned last night the armed forces were not in a fit state to deal with the current threats facing the country, most notably terrorism, and would deteriorate further if spending did not increase. Earlier this month, the National Audit Office warned of 'significant risks' to the Army reform programme, known as Army 2020. The reforms plans will see the regular Army cut by 20,000 to 82,000 while the number of part-time reservists will be increased from 19,000 to 30,000. Speaking at the Royal United Services Institute land warfare conference in London, Gen Wall said any further cuts in next year’s strategic defence and security review could leave them unable to honour commitments made by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond. Gen Wall said they would need all their current allocation if they were to deliver a 'well-trained, well-equipped and fully funded' force capable of defending the national interest. Picture shows British forces in Afghanistan in 2009 . He said: 'This is primarily about resources. The complexity of our change programme and its dependencies is significant - with plenty of risk. 'We will need all of our current resource allocation - and the freedom to reinvest savings in equipment support - if we are to deliver Army 2020 in a balanced manner and realise Mr Hammond’s commitment to a firm foundation of men and materiel, well trained, well equipped and fully funded to operate in the nation’s interests. 'In particular, any pressure on our equipment programme is likely to lead to an unbalanced force.' With operations winding down in Afghanistan, Gen Wall acknowledged that there was currently little appetite among politicians for fresh military engagements overseas. The former chief of the defence staff, General Lord Richards of Herstmonceux, warned last night the armed forces were not in a fit state to deal with the current threats facing the country . 'Boots on the ground may be out of vogue in the run up to a UK election - certainly in a combat context,' he said. However he stressed that it was vital that the Army was prepared to deal with any new threat which might emerge. 'We must pay special attention to understanding the rapidly shifting environment in which we may well have to operate sooner than some would have us think,' he said. 'Demand for land power may well be low at this point in the cycle - more from public reticence than because the world lacks security challenges - but that could soon change.'","General Sir Peter Wall said further cuts may jeopardise success of reform .

"By . Alice Smellie . Pioneer: Victoria Newlove has become the first Brit to have a single-port hysterectomy . It is fortunate that Victoria Newlove has an excellent relationship with her surgeon. For just eight weeks before her scheduled hysterectomy, he revealed that she would be the first person in the UK to undergo a new technique: he was going to remove her womb through her belly button. This incredible procedure sees the hysterectomy performed through a single incision in the belly button. It is virtually scar-less and patients recover within a fortnight. It’s all a far cry from the traditional operation that leaves a long scar across the abdomen and involves days spent in hospital and weeks of pain and recovery. It is being pioneered in the UK by consultant gynaecologist Professor John Erian, one of the godfathers of laparoscopic, or keyhole, surgery. ‘The procedure is a huge advancement as it frees women from discomfort quickly and safely, with little risk of infection,’ he says. ‘It’s suitable for everyone and I hope it will one day become the most common form of hysterectomy.’ A hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus, or womb. About 65,000 are performed each year in the UK, and one in five women will undergo the surgery at some point in their lives, usually by the age of 60. It is undertaken most commonly due to painful fibroids, endometriosis, severe bleeding, vaginal prolapse or uterine and cervical cancer. Women may also choose the surgery if they have the BRAC1 or BRAC2 gene, which significantly raises their chance of ovarian cancer. Victoria needed the operation because of severe endometriosis, where small pieces of endometrial (womb) tissue attach to surrounding organs. It can cause extreme pain and heavy bleeding and affects about two million women. ‘My periods were always heavy and painful,’ says Victoria, 31, who lives in Kent with her husband, Steve, 38, a signalling engineer, and their children Isabella, four, and Sophia, one. ‘But as time went on they got worse and worse.’ On one occasion she passed out from the pain and blood loss, so her doctor referred her to Professor Erian. ‘I always knew I would need a hysterectomy at some point as my condition kept deteriorating,’ she says. ‘Since I was first referred 11 years ago, I’ve had tissue lasered away six times but it isn’t a long-term solution. I’d imagined intrusive abdominal surgery, so was thrilled to hear about the new operation.’ Of the 57,000 hysterectomies performed annually in NHS hospitals, more than 35,000 are abdominal hysterectomies – where an incision of about 5in is made across the abdomen. The hospital stay is around five nights, and a further six to eight weeks are needed for recovery. Two other main options exist: . laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy, where the womb is removed . through the vagina (not suitable for women who have had a caesarean), . and total laparoscopic hysterectomy – keyhole surgery, where three to . four incisions are made in the abdomen. This method accounts for less . than six per cent of UK hysterectomies. Very occasionally this is done . through an incision in the belly button, with the womb removed through . the vagina. The new operation takes laparoscopic surgery one step further and has been made possible due to new instruments. Prof Erian, who operates at BMI Chelsfield Park Hospital in Kent, says: ‘I heard about the new procedure a year ago and have been waiting for the instruments to be refined. To my knowledge, this operation has been performed in only one other country – Greece – by an ex-pupil of mine. I am thrilled to introduce it here.’ Victoria had her surgery two weeks ago, under general anaesthetic as a private patient at Chelsfield Park. First an incision was made – about half an inch long – into which a ‘port’ was inserted. This is like a small plate with three tiny holes through which different instruments are inserted into the abdomen. The first hole holds a tiny camera, another contains an instrument like minute tweezers that can grasp the womb, and the third takes an instrument that can seal blood vessels and cut tissue using high-frequency thermal energy. All the instruments can be used remotely. Prof Erian explains: ‘The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas to allow better visualisation. Then one fallopian tube is grasped and the blood vessels are sealed, followed by the second. ‘A loop-shaped instrument – like a lasso – is inserted and tightened about the uterus to secure it, then thermal energy cuts it away.’ The uterus is cut up in situ and sucked out through the port. The whole procedure took just 45 minutes. Prof Erian left an ovary and fallopian tube, so Victoria won’t go through early menopause. ‘I was able to walk after less than 24 hours,’ she says. ‘When I went home – after just two nights – I only took paracetamol and ibuprofen as there wasn’t much pain. ‘After ten days I was able to pick my daughter up and drive around. Now I feel a little discomfort but nothing compared to the agony of my periods. ‘I am so relieved I’ll never suffer that again, and that my scar will be near-invisible so I’ll still be able to wear a bikini!’ bmihealthcare.co.uk/chelsfieldhospital .","Victoria Newlove first woman in UK to keyhole surgery hysterectomy .

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Have you ever wondered why humans don't all look the same? After all, we share a number of similarities on the inside, but on the outside we all have unique features. The answer, according to scientists at the University of Exeter and New York University, is that some animals developed this way to deliberately avoid interbreeding. Primates developed different facial appearances so their group was easily recognisable as being different from closely related and local species. The reason we all look different has been revealed by scientists - it is to avoid inter-breeding. Primates were found to have developed different facial appearances so that their group was easily recognisable as being different from closely related and local species . The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, provides the best evidence to date for . the role of visual cues as a barrier to breeding across species. They are often depicted as dim-witted evolutionary losers, but Neanderthals were not driven to extinction by their lack of brains, a study suggests. Instead, it is more likely that they disappeared 40,000 years ago because of interbreeding and assimilation with our early modern human ancestors, scientists believe. An analysis of archaeological evidence dating back 200,000 years stripped away some of the myths surrounding Neanderthals and revealed they were more advanced and sophisticated than has widely been thought. The differences between the two human sub-species are not enough on their own to account for the demise of the Neanderthals, said the US and Dutch researchers. Interbreeding could be one reason why Neanderthals vanished, according to the scientists. They were not so much driven to extinction as assimilated. Evidence of the two mixing can be seen in the fossil record. Some human-like characteristics have been found in late Neanderthal fossils, and conversely, Neanderthal features have been seen in early specimens of modern humans in Europe. In the research, a group of more than two dozen species of monkeys indigenous to the forests of Central and West Africa known as guenons were examined. Many . different species of guenons are sympatric, which means they live in close . proximity to each other, with multiple species often traveling, feeding, . and sleeping side-by-side. But, while interbreeding and its negative results - such as afflicted infertile offpspring - remains an unwelcome possibility, the guenons are oddly diverse. Oxford . zoologist Dr Jonathan Kingdon tried to explain the diversity in facial . appearance of guenons, which show markings such as differently colored . eyebrow patches, ear tufts, nose spots, and mouth patches. He . hypothesised that sympatric guenon species underwent facial changes . that visually reinforced differences among their species in order to . avoid the risks of interbreeding - also known as hybridisation. His theory was based on observations in the 1980s. Researchers then . used sophisticated facial recognition algorithms that can . identify and quantify detailed features in faces to test it. They . photographed monkeys held in captivity and employed the eigenface . technique, which is used in the field of computer vision for . machine recognition of faces. This was used to distinguish primate features, and then to determine whether the appearance of each guenon species was . related to the appearance of other species. Results . showed that, as predicted, the face patterns of guenon species evolved . to become more visually distinctive, specifically from those guenon . species they overlap with geographically, and hence those that they are . risk of interbreeding with. In the research a group of more than two dozen species of monkeys indigenous to the forests of Central and West Africa known as guenons (Vervet monkeys pictured in Botswana) were examined. Despite living in close proximity, the guenons were found to be oddly diverse . 'These results . strongly suggest that the extraordinary appearance of these monkeys has . been due to selection for visual signals that discourage hybridisation,' said lead . author William Allen, now of the University of Hull. 'This . is perhaps the strongest evidence to date for a role for visual signals . in the key evolutionary processes by which species are formed and . maintained, and it is particularly exciting that we have found it in . part of our own lineage.' Assistant professor James Higham in the Department of Anthropology in New York added: 'Evolution produces adaptations that help animals thrive in a particular environment, and over time these adaptations lead to the evolution of new species. 'A key question is what mechanisms keep closely related species that overlap geographically from interbreeding, so that they are maintained as separate species. 'Our findings offer evidence for the use of visual signals to help ensure species recognition: species may evolve to look distinct specifically from the other species they are at risk of interbreeding with. 'In other words, how you end up looking is a function of how those around you look. 'With the primates we studied, this has a purpose: to strengthen reproductive isolation between populations.'","Scientists in Exeter and New York reveal why we don't look the same .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Former police officer Ian Langford, pictured with his new wife outside court today, slept with two women he met after attending incidents at their home . A police officer who seduced and slept with vulnerable women while on duty has been jailed for 18 months today. Ian Langford, 46, who served with West Mercia Police in Shropshire, struck up relationships with two women after being called to attend incidents at their homes. Langford would visit the women, who he was having relationships with at the same time, during his shifts, Gloucester Crown Court heard. The father-of-one’s police radio was heard to go off during visits and he even called a police car to bring him back to the station, the court was told. Langford’s 'totally unacceptable' actions led to a trial collapsing in court - as he was sleeping with the key prosecution witness. He also illegally accessed police records to gain the contact details of one of his victims when she changed her phone number after their relationship ended. The court was also told how Langford was docked 13 days pay in 2008 by West Mercia Police for sleeping with a . vulnerable women after attending her home following a domestic violence . incident. Langford, of Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, who was supported by his new wife in court today, admitted two charges of misconduct in a public office for the relationships, which took place in 2012 and 2013. The judge sentenced Langford to nine . months for each count of misconduct in a public office, to run . consecutively - meaning a prison term of 18 months. He also made an order banning the identification of any of Langford’s victims. Judge Jamie Tabor QC told Langford that his actions had brought the police service into disrepute. 'You are not a man of good character because in 2008 you were reprimanded for committing a similar, if not identical, offence with another vulnerable woman,' the judge said. 'If you needed reminding that such behaviour was totally unacceptable, that incident should have deterred you. 'However, in May 2012, you met up with one victim. She was the victim of domestic violence, as had been the victim in 2008. 'She was looking for the protection of the law and the understanding of the police. You chose to seduce her when she was at her most vulnerable. 'Later, when the affair had come to an end you misused police data to discover her private phone number.' Prosecuting, Janine Wood said Langford . met his first victim in May 2012, after being called to her home to . attend a domestic violence incident. Langford 'immediately' began complimenting the woman and later contacted her on Facebook. The former officer, who served with West Merica police, would visit the women - who he was seeing at the same time - while on duty. He also called a police car to come and collect him following a meeting . 'She was vulnerable having suffered . years of abuse from her partner, Mr Langford gave her compliments and . support,' Ms Wood said. 'A sexual relationship began very soon afterwards.' The relationship ended a few months later and the woman changed her phone number. 'In December 2012, the command and control logs were accessed by Mr Langford and he obtained her phone number,' Ms Wood said. 'He sent her a text message minutes later.' In a victim impact statement, the woman said: 'As painful as it is to look back, when I think of the mental state I was in at the time I feel sick at how the authority figure in our community took advantage of me when he should have protected me.' The court heard how Langford met with a . second victim in June 2012 following a neighbourly dispute at her home - . which resulted in a trial. This meeting was while he was in a relationship with the first woman, the court heard. Ms Wood continued: 'He then began complimenting her inappropriately and gave her his email address and told her it was the address his wife didn’t know about,' Ms Wood said. 'He asked if he could kiss her and the relationship progressed. On a number of occasions she wrote in her journal and she recorded when sexual activity took place. 'That corresponded with Mr Langford’s GPRS tracker on his police radio. It was while he was on duty. 'There are exchanges of text messages which talk about what happened between them and mention him having to get a police car back to the station, confirming he was on duty at the time.' The relationship ended in June 2013, when the woman discovered Langford was engaged to be married to another woman, Ms Wood said. In a victim impact statement read to the court, the woman said: 'I thought I was safe with him but he left me with an enduring belief that the old stereotype of dodgy policemen is still very much alive and kicking, especially when it comes to vulnerable women. 'My feelings are unsurprisingly more emotional, I feel rejected - why did he do this? For kicks or thrills while supposedly on police duty?' The court heard how the man had previous relations with a domestic violence victim in 2008 . Judge Jamie Tabor added: 'The . case was compromised when it came to trial because the defendant let it . be known that you were having an affair with the prosecution witness. 'As a . result, the case had to be dropped, although a restraining order was . imposed. Nothing could demonstrate better why police officers have to . conduct themselves in a exemplary manner. 'Both . your victims feel extremely let down by the police. You targeted women . when they were at their most vulnerable. You carried out the affairs . while actually on duty. 'Your behaviour has brought the police service into disrepute.' Representing Langford, Simon Hunka said his client had joined the police force in 1989. He said Langford had previously been married but wed his new wife following the end of his relationship with the second victim in June last year. The relationship with his first victim ended in August 2012, when she went on holiday with her children, Mr Hunka explained. 'He is someone who has shown deep remorse and shame for his behaviour, he doesn’t try to excuse it,' Mr Hunka said. 'He is not someone who has set out with a specific sinister agenda.' Mr Hunka said his client, father to his 11-year-old daughter, no longer works for the police force. 'This is someone who had a long standing is the community,' Mr Hunka said. 'He is from a respected and respectful family and he knows he has brought shame on to that.'","Ian Langford seduced two women after attending incidents at their homes .

"By . Daniel Mills . Jailed Australian journalist Peter Greste has spoken to his family from his cramped Egyptian jail cell - for the first time since his sentencing - where he is spending up to '23 hours a day' locked inside. Speaking with brother Andrew following his shock seven-year guilty verdict for aiding the outlawed Muslim brotherhood, Peter has told him about his torment at receiving the sentence which has sparked international outcry and begun dialogue between Prime Minister Tony Abbott and the Egyptian Government. Andrew Greste, who appeared on Channel Nine's Today Show, described the cramped conditions of Peter's Tora prison cell, in Cairo, where he is spending close to every hour of the day locked inside. 'He is in a cell that's three metres by four metres in dimension,' Andrew said. Scroll down for video . Peter Greste told his brother Andrew he was shattered at his seven-year guilty verdict handed down by an Egyptian judge . 'There's a double bunk be and a single bunk bed within that space as well as a small screened off area where there's a toilet, shower and wash basin and they spend 23-hours a day in that cell.' Andrew said he and other brother Mike were not able to see Peter amid the chaotic scenes of Monday's sentencing as he was whisked away from the mesh cage in which he was locked in the courtroom. Peter, along with his two other Al Jazeera English colleagues, was sentenced to seven years in jail after he was found guilty of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's political situation, aligning himself with the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. His brother Andrew said Peter was feeling 'shattered and outraged' at the sentencing but has vowed to keep up the fight to ensure his release. He said despite the unexpected jail term, Peter was keeping mentally strong. 'He is pretty shattered, outraged - all those words to describe his emotions,' he said. 'But on the flip side to that he is still mentally strong and holding it together and he has assured us he is willing to keep up the fight.' Andrew Greste, left, said his brother was feeling 'shattered and outraged' at the guilty verdict . Greste, along with his two other Al Jazeera English colleagues Mohammed Fahmy and Baher Mohammed, was sentenced to seven years in jail after he was found guilty of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's political situation . The three journalists, including Canadian-Egyptian acting Cairo bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian producer Baher Mohammed, were arrested on December 29 after a raid on their Cairo hotel they were using as an office and denied the accusations, saying they were just doing their job. Monday's sentencing sparked and international outcry, particularly after Egyptian president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi dashed hopes of a prompt resolution. He said local authorities 'will not interfere in judicial matters'. The family of Peter had previously said that appealing for a presidential pardon was one of the first things they would consider in the campaign to free him. But with that no longer a prospect, the Greste's must now decide whether to lodge an appeal with the same judiciary that convicted him. The Tora Prison complex where Peter Greste is currently spending up to 23 hours-a-day inside . 'It's been extremely stressful, emotional and anxious,' Andrew said. 'Peter has shown remarkable strength and remarkable integrity through the whole process and respected the whole process, the Egyptian legal system, we've taken a lot of strength from Peter's courage and dignity.' It is anticipated that he will be upgraded to a better complex where his conditions are expected to improved, but where visits from his family may be reduced. Presently the family are free to visit Peter once a week but that may soon be limited to once a fortnight. Both Andrew and brother Mike Greste will continue splitting their time between Egypt and Australia to support Peter, and keep him informed about the next step in efforts to secure his release.","Peter Greste living in Egyptian cell '23-hours a day' in cramped space .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The hunt for missing British girl . Madeleine McCann has switched to the former Soviet Union after a . confession from a serial paedophile that she could be in Russia or the . Ukraine. Serial . paedophile Raymond Hewlett - who died three years ago from cancer - is believed to have told his son that he knew who had . abducted Maddy from a Portugal holiday apartment in 2007. A charity which specialises in finding trafficked children says it has been contacted by representatives of Madeleine's family to launch an appeal for information. Missing: Madeleine vanished in 2007 - three years before the death of paedophile Raymond Hewlett . Posters in Russian with pictures of the youngster showing how she might look now are being distributed from the charity's offices in Kiev and Moscow. Victoria Yanyko - from the Ukrainian Missing Persons Association - told local media: 'A representative of the family contacted us and we made a special, Russian language, leaflet to spread with the intention of finding this girl who went missing six years ago at the age of four.' 'We've distributed it in the Ukraine and in Russia, thanks to our Russian colleagues. 'A representative of the family contacted us after they got information from a dying man who said he took part in abducting Maddy and that she might be in this area,' she added. Russian news website Life.ru says the new search was triggered by a call from Graham Perry, a volunteer with the Find Madeleine campaign. 'It is possible that Maddy now holds another name and speaks another language,' he told Life.ru. Determined: Her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured) have led a high-profile worldwide search for their daughter since she went missing . The Russian poster shows Madeleine shortly before she disappeared and a computer image of how she may look now . Madeleine was nearly four when . she vanished from her family's Portuguese holiday apartment in Praia da . Luz as her parents, Gerry and Kate, ate dinner at a nearby tapas . restaurant with friends. The . case led to a worldwide search amidst fears the girl had been snatched, . but despite a number of leads coming to light no trace of Madeleine has . every been conclusively found. Since . the disappearance, officials have from time to time issued digitally . altered images showing what she might look like over the passage of . time. Madeleine's . family have never given up their quest to track down their missing . daughter. Mrs McCann has ploughed £1million from sales of her book about the incident and its aftermath back into the search. The bestseller, entitled simply Madeleine, was published in 2011 on the day of her eighth birthday. Holiday: Madeleine disappeared while she was with her family in Praia da Luz, pictured, in the Algarve region . Madeleine's Fund hit £1.8million shortly after the three-year-old vanished from her family’s holiday resort. But by 2011, after four years of searching, it had dwindled to £125,000. There have been a number of reported sightings of Madeleine from across the world since she went missing. In 2011 the Chandigarh Tribune said that a . British woman had seen a youngster bearing a remarkable likeness to . the youngster. But after studying a photo of the child, the McCanns announced the girl was not  their daughter. More recently, DNA tests confirmed that a girl . mistakenly identified in New Zealand as being Maddy was not the missing youngster. Police launched a five-day investigation in January when a Queenstown retailer became suspicious of a man and the young girl. The 'sighting' on New Year's Eve was the second time the girl was mistaken for Madeleine last year, the other being in March.","Pervert Raymond Hewlett 'told son on deathbed he knew who took her'

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ukip faced fresh accusations of double standards today amid claims Eastern Europeans have been hired to hand out flyers in its anti-immigration election campaign. Latvians have been hired by a firm in Croydon to hand out flyers ahead of elections on May 22. It follows revelations the party used an Irish actor in a poster about Brits missing out on jobs, as David Cameron today stepped up his attack on Ukip, accusing his rivals of not believing the country has a bright future. Ukip leader Nigel Farage has used a £1.5million poster campaign to take on the bigger parties ahead of local council and Euro elections on May 22 . Ukip faced embarrassment after it emerged the builder in its latest anti-immigration advert was an actor, Dave O'Rourke, who is from Ireland . Ukip has launched a £1.5million publicity drive in the hope of triggering a 'political earthquake' by topping the Euro poll on May 22. But the campaign attacking 'open doors' immigration from the EU has been dogged by allegations of spin, fakery and hypocrisy. Today it emerged that Ukip flyers were being delivered by Eastern Europeans hired by company Fast Leaflet in Croydon. Boss Andrew Spalis told the Huffington Post many of his employees are from Latvia and 'only yesterday' had been working for Ukip. Tory MP Gavin Barwell said: 'Ukip’s hypocrisy knows no bounds. They say they are against Europeans taking our jobs and then, when they have a chance to offer some British people work delivering their leaflets because they can’t find volunteers to do it, they employ European workers.' The row comes after it emerged that one of the stars of a Ukip poster campaign, who appeared to be a British builder ‘hit hard by unlimited cheap labour’, was actually an Irish actor, Dave O’Rourke. Today Ukip launched an investigation into a tweet from a party account boasting about its 'indigenous, white candidate' in the Newark by-election, Roger Helmer, who today gave an interview stressing he was now more relaxed about gay people. David Cameron took another swipe at Ukip during Prime Minister's Questions in the Commons today . Ukip has urged to 18 per cent in the latest Survation poll for the Mirror, with the Tories just one point behind Labour. The Conservatives have been torn between attacking Ukip and trying to woo its supporters. But today in the Commons, Mr Cameron accused Ukip of having a negative outlook about the future. Speaking during Prime Minister's Questions, he said: 'Britain has benefited from being an economy that is open to investment and open to people coming who want to contribute and work hard here. 'So much of their view seems to be that we don't have a bright future in this country. 'I absolutely believe that we do, if we get our deficit down, we get our economy growing, we invest in apprenticeships, we show that we can be one of the success stories of the 21st Century. We're making progress and that is the way to challenge their world view.' Ukip has made gains in the polls after stepping up its attacks on immigration and the EU. Yesterday the party confirmed its controversial MEP Roger Helmer will fight the upcoming Newark by-election for the party - despite recent controversy over a series of remarks about homosexuality. The party's local Twitter account - UKIP Newark - tweeted soon after: Newark: Our indiginous white candidate is ready to rock and roll #LetsDoThis.' Party aides inititally suggested the account was not official, but later it posted another message stating: 'Several members have access to this account. Tweet deleted. Investigation begun.' Soon after Roger Helmer was named as Ukip's candidate in the Newark by-electon, the Twitter account UKIPNewark posted this controversial comment . Amid confusion about whether the account was official, this message appeared hours later . Mr Helmer sparked outrage in 2012 after likening gay marriage to incest. The 70-year-old has also claimed people should be able to prefer being straight to being gay - like some people prefer Earl Grey to ordinary tea. And in 2000 he said being gay is ‘not worthy of valid equal respect’. But in an interview with The Times today he said he had relaxed his views, but appeared to suggest gay people are more likely to have threesomes. Mr Helmer said: 'I was raised in a very traditional home and I guess I grew up with those attitudes, but hell, we are now in the 21st century and my position is exactly the same as the party's position: that we are a broadly libertarian party and what two consenting adults, or indeed more than two consenting adults, choose to do together is none of my business, none of the party's business and as far as we're concerned, they're free to get on with it.' Roger Helmer has rarely avoided controversy during his career as an MEP, but has been returned to Brussels three times . Mr Helmer's selection comes after Ukip leader Nigel Farage ducked the chance to fight the Nottinghamshire seat. The byelection was called after the disgraced former Tory MP Patrick Mercer resigned in the wake of a cash-for-questions scandal. Mr Helmer was elected to the European Parliament in 1999 as the Tory MEP for the East Midlands - and re-elected in 2004 and 2009 - before defecting to Ukip in March 2012. His outspoken views have caused controversy throughout his career and last year even Mr Farage said he had gone 'too far' with his attack on gay marriage. In 2012 Mr Helmer said: 'If two men have a right to marry, how can we deny the same right to two siblings? Are we to authorise incest?' His made the bombshell remarks in a pamphlet entitled 'Straight Talking on Europe'. Nigel Farage decided not to fight the Newark by-election - leaving himself open to accusations that he 'bottled' his big chance . The year before he asked: 'Why is it OK for a surgeon to perform a sex-change operation, but not OK for a psychiatrist to try to ""turn"" a consenting homosexual?' Mr Helmer has also dismissed homophobia as a 'weasel word'. He said: 'The homosexual lobby is not content with decriminalisation. It wants to be accepted as a ""valid alternative lifestyle"". 'But it is not a valid lifestyle worthy of equal respect. 'At the risk of offending the politically correct, I will argue that homosexual behaviour is abnormal and undesirable.' He previously questioned the existence of 'homophobia', saying some people found gay relationships 'distasteful if not viscerally repugnant'. He defended the remarks, saying: 'Different people have different tastes. You may tell me you don't like Earl Grey tea. That may be a minority view but you are entitled not to like it if you don't like it. The Ukip candidate added: 'I simply made the point that people were entitled to their personal preferences. 'It is morally acceptable to prefer heterosexuality over homosexuality, or vice versa. Most of us prefer one or the other.' He later added: 'I said that people may prefer heterosexuality or homosexuality. I did not say that people could dislike – much less hate – other people on the grounds of their sexual orientation. 'The mainstream media are engaged in a feeding frenzy against Ukip, and are prepared to twist the facts to suit their agenda.' Mr Helmer also insists that he has condemned homophobia during his career. He said 'prejudice, hostility and violence against homosexuals are wrong and totally unacceptable'. But Mr Helmer's controversial views are not restricted to homosexuality. He has claimed that women who are date raped must ‘share part of the responsibility’. Mr Helmer said in 'stranger rape' the blame was 'squarely on the perpetrator' but in date rape cases 'the victim surely shares a part of the responsibility, if only for establishing reasonable expectations in her boyfriend’s mind'. The outspoken MEP has also claimed the Catholic Church was ‘systematically paedophilic’. He said: ‘So far as I know it has no rules or systems designed to support or promote paedophilia. 'But I think it would be perfectly fair to describe it as systemically paedophile.’ Despite Mr Helmer's controversial past, he was 'overwhelmingly' endorsed by the Newark constituency association at a hustings meeting on Monday before being backed by Ukip's National Executive Committee, a party spokesman said. Mr Helmer said: 'I am both proud and humbled to have been selected by the constituency association in Newark to represent the UKIP cause in this historic town in what could well prove to be an historic by-election.' 'It would be a huge honour to be elected to serve as Newark’s MP and I will be giving my all over the next few weeks to achieve that outcome.' Mr Farage said: 'He is a massively experienced and respected figure on the national political stage and on the local political stage as well. 'I know that the Ukip membership will rally to the cause of making Roger our first directly elected MP.' The Newark by-election is scheduled to take place on June 5, with the Conservatives selecting Robert Jenrick to run and Labour represented by Michael Payne. The Lib Dems are expected to choose a candidate in the coming days.","Leafleting firm says it uses people from Latvia and other European countries .

"By . Jack Doyle . Have you ever picked up your suitcase from the airport carousel and had the feeling that someone’s had a sneaky peek inside? According to an official report, you could be right. It seems that airport officials are rummaging through passengers’ luggage without telling them. Officials are allowed to search baggage before it is placed on the carousel. One third of searches turn up suspect items, but the other two thirds of cases are repacked and the passenger is not told about the search . Under little-known powers designed to stop drugs, weapons and other contraband entering the country, customs staff can search bags at ports and airports without informing the owner. But border staff have been discovered carrying out the searches without proper authorisation. Some officials said they would read confidential legal and medical documents if they found them in luggage – despite it being against the law. Officials can require passengers to open their luggage if they are stopped while walking through the customs channel. These searches take place in front of the passenger, who can see when items are being opened. But covert luggage searches are carried out on inbound flights after items are taken off planes but before they are placed on the carousel for passengers to collect. Details of the searches emerged in a report published yesterday by the Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, John Vine. From April to September last year hundreds of searches were carried out at regional airports across Britain. It means that every year thousands such searches will take place in our airports. In around one in three cases officials found suspect items, but in the remainder the luggage was simply repacked and returned to the passenger, who remained unaware it had ever been inspected. Mr Vine found a worrying lack of consistent rules on how such searches should be conducted across airports. His inspection found covert searches took place at Birmingham, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Luton and Manchester airports. Figures for searches at Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted were not included. At Luton staff were conducting searches without seeking approval from managers, who were required by law to sign off on all searches. Record keeping was so sloppy at Edinburgh, Luton and Manchester that in half the notebooks Mr Vine examined there was no record of who authorised the search. Staff were also found not to be recording why searches were needed. The report said: ‘Staff at Edinburgh told us they would be content to examine material they considered to be confidential during a ... baggage examination. 'Examples of confidential material discussed during staff focus groups included passengers’ personal medical records and legally privileged correspondence.’ Home Office rules state that any searches of confidential personal material need approval by a senior manager and the Surveillance Commissioner. Mr Vine said it was a ‘cause for concern’ that there was no staff guidance on what to do when sensitive personal material was discovered. He called for urgent updated guidance for staff on how the powers should be used. A report found that staff at Luton airport were not seeking managers' approval for searches, required under the law, and were also not recording why a search was needed . ‘The power to examine passenger’s bags without their knowledge requires authorisation and justification. It is an intrusive power, but one that is necessary to protect UK border security,’ he said. ‘The Home Office also needs to ensure that its staff are operating to consistent national standards: Standards that are fully supported by current, easily accessible and detailed guidance.’ Emma Carr, of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘It is not acceptable for luggage to be searched without a proper process being followed and records being kept. ‘The Border Force has totally failed to protect people’s privacy and if they are incapable of putting adequate safeguards in place then the Home Office should step in and do it for them.’ The Border Force said it accepted the report’s recommendations. A spokesman added: ‘The searching of baggage, including when the owner is not present, is a legal and proportionate response to ensuring that illegal goods are prevented from entering the UK and to protect revenue. ‘The independent chief inspector recognises that border staff are using these powers proportionately and with high levels of success and identified occasions where their standard of work was “exceptional”. 'This report shows that we are making the right changes and significantly improving performance.’","Officials are allowed to search bags before they go on baggage carousel .

"By . Wills Robinson . A mother has spoken of the heartbreaking moment her beloved golden Labrador died in her arms after she was poisoned - just hours before another family dog suffered the same cruel fate. Ali Harling, 45, from Preesall, Lancashire, was left 'devastated' after someone deliberately threw a drug over her garden fence, killing two of her pets. Her 11-year-old golden Labrador Dizzy died in the car on the way to the vets, before her other dog Stan, who was four, passed away. Devastated: Ali Harding, 45, (pictured) has spoken of her heartbreak after two of her golden Labradors died when they ate drugs that had been thrown into their garden . Tragic: Dizzy, pictured asleep right, died in Mrs Harling's arms as they travelled to the vet . Mrs Harling, said: 'I am devastated. They were my babies. 'They were completely innocent, they never did anything wrong. What happened was completely mindless.' Mrs Harling said when vets started operating on Stan, also a golden Labrador, they found his intestines were 'shredded' as a result of eating the over-the-counter drug, which police are not naming for fear of it being used to harm animals. Stan’s liver and kidneys were also failing. Mrs Harling’s other dogs, golden Labrador Jake, 13, and nine-month-old dachshund Alfie, were taken ill at their home, but are recovering well. Mrs Harling said she believed the drug had been thrown over her gate on June 15 or in the early hours of June 16. She said all her dogs suddenly got very sick at the same time. She kept an eye on them, and throughout the day they appeared better but, by the following morning - June 17, Dizzy and Stan were so poorly she rushed them to the vets.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain should be proud that David Cameron is isolated in Europe in the incr3asingly bitter row over Brussels jobs, Jeremy Hunt claimed today. The Health Secretary backed the Prime Minister's ‘lonely’ fight to block Jean-Claude Juncker from becoming European Commission president amid brutal criticism. It follows claims from Poland’s foreign minister Radek Sikorski that Mr Cameron of ‘f****d up’ attempts to veto the last European treaty. EU leaders will meet at the Menin Gate in Ypres on Thursday for a dinner to mark the start of the First World War. But behind the scenes wrangling continues over Mr Juncker’s candidacy, with almost every EU country united in pushing the plan through despite opposition from Britain. Mr Cameron is planning to push the issue to an unprecedented vote in Brussels on Friday to hammer home his argument that the former Luxembourg prime minister is the wrong person to lead the Commission. But Mr Hunt insists he is 'very proud' that the PM is taking the fight to Brussels. 'Sometimes leadership is lonely,' Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4. 'But if it is the right thing to do for Britain I am glad that we have got a strong Prime Minister who is prepared to take those steps. 'Even if it means that he is isolated from time to time, I think people in Europe will respect the person who tells the truth that Europe needs to be reformed, that it can't carry on the way it is doing, it is unacceptable to put in place someone who doesn't stand for reform and I am very proud that we have a Prime Minister who is prepared to do that, however difficult it is... however isolated. 'He is going out there, to these very difficult negotiations, fighting for the British national interest. 'It is not comfortable. He is the first Prime Minister who has vetoed a European treaty and that was a huge shock to the system.' Mr Cameron yesterday held ‘full and frank’ talks with Herman van Rompuy, the current president of the EU Council. Speaking in Downing Street, the PM made clear he would fight 'until the end' the nomination as his successor of the man seen by the UK as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to reform. With a majority of EU leaders - including Germany's Angela Merkel - throwing their weight behind Mr Juncker's candidacy, the Prime Minister looks certain to be out-voted under the qualified majority system, and is thought unlikely to secure enough support even to form a blocking minority of four or more member states. But the deep divisions caused by Mr Cameron’s EU strategy were exposed by extraordinary remarks made by Poland's foreign minister. Mr Sikorski is reported to have accused Mr Cameron of 'incompetence in European affairs' as part of a colourfully-worded private exchange with a former ministerial colleague. In a covert recording leaked to Polish magazine Wprost, he is said to have accused the Prime Minister of falling foul of 'stupid propaganda' and trying to appease his critics by feeding them scraps, only for the strategy to backfire. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt backed the Prime Minister's fight to block Jean-Claude Juncker (right) from becoming European Commission president amid brutal criticism . Polish Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski was a member of the Bullingdon Club at Oxford with Boris Johnson. David Cameron was also a member . In the conversation, Mr Sikorski is reported to have said: 'It's either a very badly thought through move, or, not for the first time, a kind of incompetence in European affairs. 'Remember? He f***** up the fiscal pact. He f***** it up. Simple as that. He is not interested, he does not get it, he believes in the stupid propaganda, he stupidly tries to play the system. 'His whole strategy of feeding (his critics) scraps in order to satisfy them is just as I predicted, turning against him. 'He should have said, f*** off, tried to convince people and isolate (the sceptics). But he ceded the field to those that are now embarrassing him.' Chancellor George Osborne has accused European leaders of saying one thing in private and another in public about the appointment. There has been speculation that Mr van Rompuy would prefer to delay a decision to avoid a row over the nomination overshadowing a visit by EU leaders on Thursday to Ypres to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of the First World War. Tory MP Bernard Jenkin dismissed the criticism.

"By . Hugo Duncan . Warned: George Osborne has been told Britain is in the midst of a double-dip recession, heaping more pressure on the Chancellor after controversy over his tax on hot takeaway food and a fuel duty rise . George Osborne suffered a bruising blow yesterday when a leading global watchdog declared that Britain is back in recession. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said output fell by 0.1 per cent in the first three months of 2012, having dropped by 0.3 per cent in the final quarter of 2011. If official figures next month from the Office for National Statistics back up the respected think-tank’s findings, it will be the first double-dip recession in Britain since 1975. The gloomy verdict – from such a . highly respected think tank – is a bitter blow for the Chancellor just seven days after his much-maligned 'pasty tax' announced in the Budget. The . Paris-based OECD is a long-time supporter of the Chancellor's battle to . repair the economic and financial damage of the Labour years. But . its view that the UK is in the midst of a double-dip recession will be . seized on by Labour as evidence that even Mr Osborne's most loyal . supporters do not think his plan is working. Mr Osbourne is already under fire for his controversial tax on takeaway food and a planned rise in fuel duty. Petrol . stations have begun rationing fuel before the rise kicks in and the Army is on standby after . ministers were accused of spreading panic. Retailers such as pasty-maker Greggs have also been up in arms about the planned rise in VAT on hot snacks, depending on their 'ambient . temperature', from October. Now bakers and food chains are planning to mobilise . angry pasty fans to block the new levy. In its report, the OECD also warned the recovery for the world's biggest economies . would be fragile, with the outlook for Europe 'very weak'. A . recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of economic decline. Britain plunged into a brutal . recession in early 2008 as the financial crisis and banking crash . wreaked havoc on the world economy. But it started recovering at the end of 2009 – albeit slowly. Scroll down for video . Garages across the country have seen a surge in sales as the threat of a strike by tanker drivers looms. Here motorists panic buy fuel in Burnham on Sea, Somerset . Bank of England figures also out today have fuelled predictions of further property price falls . The return to recession will fuel fears that the UK faces years of high unemployment and stagnant growth. Economists . have warned that Britain is in the grip of the longest economic slump . for 100 years – worse even than the Great Depression of the 1930s. But they are divided as to whether GDP will fall in the first quarter of the year. A number of upbeat surveys have suggested a return to mild growth in the quarter. And any slump would be modest compared with the 2008/09 recession and the OECD predicts a return to growth in the second quarter of the year. The Office for National Statistics today said the powerhouse services sector grew by 0.2 per cent between December and January, after a slight decline in the final quarter of 2011. However, it is generally agreed that the UK's economic growth will be feeble for the first half of 2012 at least, although falling inflation should increasingly deliver a boost to consumer spending as the year progresses. The Government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, predicts the UK will avoid a recession but the economy will grow by just 0.8 per cent over the course of 2012. Pastygate: Greggs could launch an online Parliamentary petition against the controversial VAT hike . Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, predicts the economy will grow by 0.3 per cent in the first quarter of the year. He said: 'Recent indications suggest the UK's economy will have expanded in the first quarter. Our own view is that the OECD is being too gloomy. 'The services sector appears to have strengthened, the manufacturing sector is recovering since the end of last year and there's been signs of strength in retail spending.' Meanwhile, the OECD warned of a two-speed recovery developing in the G7 nations, with North America enjoying a rapid expansion but Europe weighed down by austerity measures. The OECD said the recent hikes in oil prices, which have pushed Brent crude to above 120 US dollars a barrel, would push inflation up higher than it previously thought, wiping up to 0.2% from growth across G7 nations over the next year. It expects Italy. which is already in recession, to contract for te first two quarters of 2012, while France will contract in the first quarter and Germany's growth will be lacklustre. In November, the OECD warned the eurozone crisis was a key risk for the UK economy and it today called for the firewall to be increased in size to help prevent the crisis worsening. It last year slashed the UK's 2012 growth forecast to just 0.5 per cent from 1.8 per cent earlier in the year and said it expects unemployment to hit 9.1 per cent by 2013, putting another 400,000 people out of work. Bank of England figures showed today that mortgage . approvals for house purchase have dropped to their lowest level since . last June, fuelling predictions of further property price falls. The report showed a sharp dip in approvals even before the ending of a two-year stamp duty concession for first-time buyers, which finished last Saturday. There were 48,986 loan approvals for house purchase in February worth £7.1billion, almost 9,000 fewer such loans than in January, which was a 25-month high. The figures follow concerns from lenders and estate agents that a rush to beat the stamp duty deadline would be followed by a dip once the 1 per cent duty for first-time buyers on properties worth between £125,000 and £250,000 was reinstated. The Bank of England report was published on the same day that Nationwide said house prices recorded a monthly fall of 1 per cent in March. Last week in his Budget speech, the Chancellor predicted the economy would avoid slipping into recession. He said the Office For Budget Responsibility had estimated Britain would be in positive growth within the first quarter of 2012. Mr Osborne added that the OBR's forecast for UK growth was 0.8 per cent in 2012, 2 per cent in 2013, 2.7 per cent in 2014 and 3 per cent in both 2015 and 2016.

"By . Valerie Elliott . The Countess of Wessex pictured at the Trooping the Colour last week after she had been told her racehorse had to be put down . The first and only racehorse to belong to the Countess of Wessex has been put down following a tragic accident. Prince Edward’s wife Sophie was told the news shortly before she joined the rest of the Royal Family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch the Trooping the Colour last Saturday. By contrast with other members of the Royal Family, the Countess appeared saddened and deep in thought at moments. Three-year-old bay colt Zilber shattered his pelvis in a freak accident while training at Newmarket early that morning. Sophie was telephoned by trainer Ed Dunlop, who told her the horse had been put down. The Countess is said be ‘very sad’ about the death. The Royal Family and close friends have offered her sympathy over what is seen in racing circles as ‘very bad luck’. Mr Dunlop said: ‘It’s very sad for the Countess and everyone else involved. It’s a very sad day whenever you lose a horse.’ In a common arrangement in horse-racing, the Countess had leased Zilber, worth at least  £30,000, in a partnership with her friend, the Countess of Derby, and Mandy Koukash, wife of leading British racehorse owner Dr Marwan Koukash. The loss of Zilber is a blow for the Countess and her plans to become more deeply involved in horse-racing. Married to Prince Edward for 15 years – the couple celebrated their anniversary on Thursday –  she picked up the racing bug from her mother-in-law, the Queen. The Countess has even acquired her own racing colours: a purple and yellow diabolo strip worn by her jockeys. Adam Kirby was wearing the racing silks when the Countess watched him and Zilber finish third in the Alex Scott Maiden Stakes at Newmarket on April 16. Zilber had been taken out at 7am last Saturday from the trainer’s La Grange stables. After a walk and warm-up, Zilber set out for a brisk canter in the Al Bahatri gallops when he fell. While most horses can recover from a fractured pelvis, a vet judged the injury so severe the horse had to be put down. The Countess of Wessex's racehorse, Zilba, pictured in action in April at the Newmarket Racecourse . A spokesman for Mr Dunlop added: ‘It was extremely unlucky. It is a freak occurrence. The result is unfortunate and a sad first experience for the Countess of Wessex. The staff who look after him are very upset.’ Later that morning, wearing an elegant, white-lace Bruce Oldfield dress, Sophie joined the Queen and other members of the Royal Family at Buckingham Palace. A Palace spokesman said: ‘The Countess of Wessex was part of a partnership who leased Zilber. ‘The horse was sadly put down on veterinary advice. The Countess was informed last week.’","Racehorse Zilber put down after fracturing pelvis in freak training accident .

"Three men died within eight months of each other after taking the drug GHB at the same gay sauna, an inquest has heard. Greg Page, 41, head of communications at pharmaceutical giant Roche, was found dead at the Pleasuredrome sauna, in Waterloo, south London, at 8am on a Saturday morning in October 2012, the hearing was told. John Scott, 46, a security officer at City bank Goldman Sachs, was also found collapsed at the same time as Mr Page and rushed to hospital by paramedics. He died two days later, Southwark Coroner's Court was told. Three men died within eight months of each other after taking the drug GHB at the Pleasuredrome gay sauna within eight months, an inquest heard . Both men had the drugs GHB in their system, the inquest was told, but whereas Mr Page had mixed the drug with alcohol and cocaine, Mr Scott had taken the legal high, MPA, a meth-amphetamine substitute. The incident came just two . hours after a third man was removed unconscious from the premises by . paramedics after taking the drug. He was taken to intensive care but . recovered and was released from hospital days later, the inquest heard. The court heard that eight months earlier another man, 41-year-old Konstantinos Bampatzis, was found dead in a locked private room after taking mephedrone and GHB at the same 24-hour sauna . Sauna manager Ivan Stepenov told the inquest that he found Mr Bampatzis. He was alerted by a friend of Mr Bampatzis that he was unwell and said the man had locked himself inside the private sauna, the inquest heard. Mr Stepenov said he rushed to the room and opened it with a master key where he tried to revive Mr Bampatzis by giving him First Aid and CPR. Police later found a bottle of GHB, a bag of white powder and an unused condom lying nearby. His cause of death was found to be a result of a lethal cocktail of the two drugs. Mr Bampatzis, a supervisor from Parliament Hill, north London, had no family in the UK and had moved to London from Greece. Southwark Coroner's Court was told that Greg Page, 41, and John Scott, 46, both died after taking the drug at the sauna . Southwark Coroner Dr Andrew Harris questioned the sauna's proprietor, Charles Hill, over the establishment's drug policy and alleged lack of emergency lighting, making it difficult for paramedics to see to the unconscious customer. Mr Hill insisted that drug searches had become 'more aggressive' since the death of Mr Bampatzis and said Pleasuredrome now had a reputation for being clean. He said the sauna complex was now fitted out with emergency strip lights which staff could switch on at any time. Dr Harris recorded a narrative verdict into Mr Bampatzis' death. He said: 'His death was drug related from a combination of mephedrone and GHB. 'There is no evidence the drugs were forcibly given to him and there is no evidence he tried to take his life.' The coroner went on to say it was 'possible' the sauna's zero tolerance to drugs was not being implemented 'aggressively' enough at the time, but was assured changes had been made. Today, the joint inquest into the deaths of Mr Page and Mr Scott heard how an ambulance was called to Pleasuredrome eight months after Mr Bampatzis' death where the PR boss was found already dead. Both men were found to have died as a . result of the GHB in their system, which caused significant brain . injury and eventual pneumonia in the case of Mr Scott. Forensic toxicologist Fiona Perry told the court Mr Page had 803 milligrams of GHB per litre of blood, and 0.13 milligrams of cocaine per litre of blood. She said in a statement: 'Gregory Page had alcohol in his blood, mild levels, and GHB levels enough for a fatality. Cocaine was also relatively high...' Drug GHB (Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate), nicknamed Grevious Bodily Harm, or Blue, or Heaven. The men were all found to have traces of it in their systems when they died . Senior paramedic and advisor to the London Ambulance Service medical director, David Whitemore, told the court of his concerns about safety at Pleasuredrome. He said he had become concerned about the establishment after a number of staff members told him about the three patients on October 27th. 'They said they were always going there, very very frequently,' he said. 'When I looked at the call outs, it was clear we were being called for substance problems.' The paramedic said he spoke to ambulance staff who attended Pleasuredrome and was told the lighting was dim and the rooms cramped, which made it difficult to treat patients. Owner, Charles Hill, told the . inquest the sauna is for gay and bi-sexual males. Mr Hill said . there was 'at least one, if not two' members of staff on duty with first . aid training, and at the time of Mr Page's death, there were three. He . added the complex now had 'lots of phones' where staff could make . emergency calls and improvements had been made to the 'recovery room'. In . negotiations with Lambeth Council, Mr Hill agreed to lower the number . of hours available for rent of private rooms from three to two, and that emergency lighting had been added. Mr Page, from Rotherhithe, was an avid Arsenal fan and celebrated in the pharmaceutical industry for helping to promote the breast cancer drug Herceptin. His boyfriend of nine months before he died, Graham McGowan, also attended the inquest, accompanied by a friend. Sandra Drapper, Mr Page's mother, said her son was healthy and in good spirits before he died. 'He was very dedicated, popular and family orientated. He loved playing with his nephew, travelling, cooking and gardening. 'I spoke to him the day before he died and he was happy, he'd sold some shares which went well and he was going to use the money for a deposit on a flat.' Mr Scott's brother, Christopher, and his cousin, Justin Wood, said their relative had a 'very full life' and was an artist in his free time, selling sculptures for charity. 'He got a first in fine art at university - he was very creative,' said Mr Wood. 'He was very popular and greatly missed.' Pleasuredrome, the London Ambulance Service and Lambeth Council are all represented at the joint inquest into the deaths of Mr Page and Mr Scott and will be putting forward their evidence of how and why the two men died. The hearing continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Greg Page, 41, was found dead at Pleasuredrome sauna, south London .

Mr Lauer said: 'Sue is a professional photographer and designer and she loves to take pictures of our pugs in various scenarios. When blinkbox set us the challenge of a Game of Thrones tribute, we couldn't resist. Sue spent two weeks just creating the Iron Throne alone but it was well worth it. 'The pugs have been doing this since they were puppies. We have a studio set up in the garage and whenever I walk them towards it they get excited, no doubt wondering what's next.

"By . Vanessa Allen . Princess Diana leaked information about the Royal Family to reporters to show the ‘forces that were ranged against her’, it was claimed yesterday. She sought out journalists as allies in her bitter divorce battle with estranged husband Prince Charles and gave them information to ‘take him on’, the Old Bailey heard. News of the World journalist Clive Goodman said she sent him an internal phone directory for the Royal Household to reveal the size of Charles’s palace staff and complained she felt ‘swamped’ by his aides. Gift: Clive Goodman, left, told the Old Bailey today that he was sent a royal directory by Princess Diana . Goodman is accused of paying public . officials for Royal Household directories but told the phone hacking . trial that Diana sent the directory to him at work and called him twice . to ask if he had received it. He . said the book, dated from 1992, arrived at his desk in an envelope, but . he did not think he was the only one to receive one from the princess. The internal phone directory was known as the Green Book. Goodman . said: ‘She was going through a very, very tough time. She told me she . wanted me to see this document, she wanted me to see the scale of her . husband’s staff and household compared to hers. ‘She was in a very bitter situation with the Prince of Wales at the time and she felt she was being swamped by his household. ‘She . was looking for an ally to take him on, to show the sort of forces that . were ranged against her. We were quite a powerful organisation to have . as an ally.’ Contacts: The book provided the details of the people working for the royals at Buckingham Palace . Awkward: Charles and Diana in 1992 as they toured India . Charles and Diana separated in 1992 after an 11-year marriage and the warring Waleses set up separate households. Goodman, . 56, the former royal editor at the now defunct Sunday tabloid, was . asked if he was the only journalist she had sought out as an ally. ‘Oh . gosh no, there were several journalists,’ he replied. ‘She was very . close to Richard Kay at the Daily Mail, she was very close to Andrew . Morton who went on to write her biography, and she was forming a . relationship with Martin Bashir at Panorama.’ Diana . eventually gave an interview to Panorama in 1995, in which she . complained her husband’s relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles meant . there were three people in her marriage. The couple divorced shortly . afterwards. Goodman told the . court he was given two more directories by a former valet for Prince . Charles, Kenneth Stronach, and said the valet was ‘thoroughly fed up . with working for the Royal Family and the Prince of Wales particularly’. 'Bully': Andy Coulson has been accused of creating an aggressive atmosphere at the News of the World . Trial: Rebekah Brooks is pictured with her mother Deborah arriving at the Old Bailey this morning . He . said he used the directories as a ‘glorified phone book’ to contact . press officers and senior members of the household about stories outside . normal office hours. Following . Diana’s death in 1997, he said, the palace press office was ‘frankly . useless’ so he called the Queen’s private secretary in the early hours . for a ‘very frank conversation’. Brooks' mother Deborah Weir, arriving at the old bailey today . He . told how following her death, amid public anger at a perceived lack of . respect from the royals, there were demands for a flag to fly at . half-mast over Buckingham Palace. The . palace refused because of ‘stuffy protocol’, he said, but a flag . suddenly appeared for 20 minutes at half-mast and then disappeared . again. Press officers told him it was a mistake but he used the . directories to find an ‘enraged’ fireman at the palace who admitted he . had hoisted the flag in protest. Police . found 15 directories at Goodman’s home when he was arrested in 2006 . over phone hacking. He said he could not remember where the other . directories had come from but said he had never paid a police officer . for any directory, or for information for a story. He also denied using . the directories to help him to hack phones or  ‘blag’ information. The . jury was told Goodman worked at the News of the World for 20 years . before he was arrested for phone hacking in 2006. He admitted hacking . and was given a four-month jail sentence and sacked from the newspaper, . although he later accepted a £140,000 settlement over a claim of unfair . dismissal. He was then . arrested again in 2011 by police investigating hacking at the tabloid, . and denies two charges of conspiring to commit misconduct by paying . public officials for royal directories. Goodman . is not accused of hacking in this trial although he is named as part of . an alleged plot in which former News of the World editors Rebekah . Brooks and her successor Andy Coulson are accused of conspiring to hack . phones. They both deny the conspiracy and all seven defendants in the trial deny all the charges against them. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Royal editor received copy of the 'Green Book' at News of the World office .

"By . Chris Greenwood . The RSPCA is using a sensitive police database nearly 1,500 times a year under a deal giving it privileged access to criminal records. The animal welfare charity is using the Police National Computer (PNC) an average of 124 times every month in relation to prosecutions it brings. The scale of its activity raised concerns yesterday as the records are usually regarded as so  sensitive that employers – even in the public sector and involved in working with children – do not have access to them. Sensitive material: The RSPCA can request information about the criminal records of suspects, witnesses, defendants and victims . Critics accuse the charity of increasing ‘militancy’ by focusing on expensive political stunts  and strong-arm tactics at the expense of its core mission to protect animals. Information Commissioner Christopher Graham is to investigate the deal struck in 2010 between the police and the RSPCA. Under the agreement with the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), a private company, the RSPCA can request a criminal record check, paying Acpo at least £35 per search. Last night Tory MP Simon Hart, former head of the Countryside Alliance, said: ‘If any other political organisation had access to the PNC there would be widespread public concern. ‘This is an increasingly politically driven animal rights group which is a shadow of its welfare origins. I will be writing to the Home Secretary and Attorney General to seek clarity as to whether any pressure group can have similar access.’ The deal allows the RSPCA to request information about the criminal records of suspects, witnesses, defendants and victims. In one 19-month period it made 54 of these detailed checks on the PNC, which would reveal any convictions, cautions, warnings, reprimands and impending prosecutions. But the bulk of its use of the PNC came as RSPCA officials created fresh records on the database of their own suspects. During the same 19-month period the charity added 2,311 records of people it intended to prosecute so that their data could be seen by police. Other organisations holding agreements with Acpo are state bodies such as the Civil Aviation Authority and the Food Standards Agency. The RSPCA, which yesterday revealed that it secured 4,168 animal welfare and cruelty convictions last year, up from 2,441 three years ago, claims it accesses the computer to update records of its prosecutions. But it has been severely criticised in recent months for being too aggressive in prosecutions and campaigns. A Conservative councillor who served as election agent for James Gray, a pro-hunting MP, was prosecuted for unlawful hunting, but the case was dropped at the 11th hour. A judge criticised the animal charity for bringing the prosecution even though nobody had seen a fox. Sir Barney White-Spunner, who heads the Countryside Alliance, called for the RSPCA’s access to police files to be stopped until it is proved lawful. Animal rights: The RSPCA has been accused by critics of becoming increasingly political and militant . He said: ‘The RSPCA is neither a public body nor a statutory prosecuting force, it is a campaigning charity with an increasingly militant animal rights agenda. ‘The disclosure of highly personal information held on police databases to the organisation could pose significant risks to the individual concerned.’ An RSPCA spokesman said the charity requests information from the police to ‘prevent and detect’ serious animal-related crime. She added: ‘Any response from the police is at their discretion and will be proportionate to the request made.’ An Acpo spokesman said the charity has ‘indirect’ access, which does not include firearms licensing, vehicle registrations or information unrelated to particular prosecutions.","Critics accuse the RSPCA of increasing ‘militancy’

"By . Tara Brady . A generous insurance boss spent more than £500,000 throwing an office party for his staff  - which even featured a concert by Olly Murs. Millionaire Henry Engelhardt, 56, invited more than 5,000 people from his company to the free party at the Millennium Stadium, in Cardiff, Wales. It was turned into a fairytale mid-summer spectacular for the staff of Admiral who partied the night away. Scroll down for video . Rave on: 5,000 members of staff at Admiral partied the night away at the office bash thrown by their boss. It also included jazz bands, jugglers, clowns on stilts and even a zip wire for staff to fly across the stadium . Generous: Millionaire Henry Engelhardt pictured with revellers dressed as Prince Charming for the occasion. The stadium was turned into a fairytale wonderland with Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland themes . Fun-loving chief executive Henry dressed up as Prince Charming for the event which had four different fairytale themes, a fairground and circus. The climax of the night was an hour-long show by X Factor star Olly Murs who later mingled with office workers until the early hours. One happy worker said: 'Henry really knows how to party - it was one of the best nights ever. 'We knew it was going to be an extravaganza but everyone was blown away when we walked into the stadium.' The climax of the night was an hour-long show by X Factor star Olly Murs who later mingled with staff . Happy workers: Workers were given tokens for free drinks and food at the party from 6pm until 11.30pm . One side of the 74,000-seater stadium was Alice in Wonderland themed while another resembled the Great Hall in Harry Potter's Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There were also a Cinderella Ballroom and an Arabian nights area complete with magic carpet rides. Jazz bands, jugglers, clowns on stilts and the No Fit State circus were employed for the evening to keep guests entertained while a zip wire for staff to fly across the stadium was installed. Workers were given tokens for free drinks and food at the party from 6pm until 11.30pm. However, it carried on until the early hours at nearby Tiger Tiger nightclub where staff had free entry and more free drinks. Another worker at the South Wales based insurance giant said: 'We only have the party once every two years but it is worth waiting for. 'In the months leading up to it we all get emails with little hints about the theme of the night and who the star performer was. 'Henry’s parties just keep getting better and better.' Olly Murs (left) with a party-goer and (right) revellers at the bash which was thrown at Millennium Stadium . The event had five different fairytale themes, a fairground and circus spread out across Millennium Stadium . Olly Murs enjoyed the party as much as the staff - he joined them at the nightclub and was partying away until the early hours. He tweeted the next day: 'Top night at the £admiralparty in Cardiff last night!! Definitely 5,001 sore heads this morning! Cracking night!! Thanks for having me!!x' Sam Gould, who was DJ for the night, said: 'This was the biggest and best corporate event I have ever performed at.' Chicago born Mr Engelhardt, a father-of-four who lives in Cardiff told staff the party was a reward for all the hard work they put in. The Admiral Group is one of the largest employers in South Wales with 5,000 staff on their books. The company is building a giant £60m headquarters in the heart of the Welsh capital. Henry Engelhardt, CEO of Admiral Insurance . The founder and chief executive of insurance group Admiral wants his staff to have fun. When most businesses belonging to the FTSE 100 index might have a strict, no-nonsense style, Admiral has a Ministry of Fun - a team dedicated to organising weekly social activities for staff. This includes fancy dress days, nights out and even computer game matches in lunch breaks. This is all thanks to fun-loving CEO Henry Engelhardt. Mr Engelhardt is originally from Chicago and said he never planned to go into the insurance industry. He studied journalism at the University of Michigan but got a job as a trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. He told the BBC earlier this year: 'I made a dedication to myself that if I could help it, I would never again work somewhere where I was unhappy. 'This is because it is simply very difficult to flip a switch and then be happy when you aren't in work.' Mr Engelhardt and his French-born wife Diane decided to quit their jobs and travelled around Asia. Later on, Mr Engelhardt joined the car insurance industry and worked his way up. After being headhunted, Mr Engelhardt set up Admiral and the company is now worth £4million.","Henry Engelhardt, 56, is the chief executive of insurance giant Admiral .

"By . Mia De Graaf . Two Russian policemen have been fired over the death of a comatose murder suspect after they dragged him out of a hospital's intensive care ward and tried to check him in as luggage on a flight back to the station. The officers Fedor Moroz, 41, and Yuriy Koudinov, 45, had been alerted that the wanted man, 36-year-old Sergei Kozhemyakin, had been admitted to Balabanovskaya City Hospital in Western Russia's Kaluga Oblast. Despite the fact that he was in a critical condition, they went to the hospital and dragged him out of the bed without informing hospital staff. Scroll down for video . Caught: Officers were captured on camera dragging a comatose murder suspect out of hospital in Russia . They then drove him to Moscow's Vnukovo Airport and tried to persuade staff from the UTair airline to accept the man as a passenger on a flight back to Stavropol. When they refused on the grounds that he was unconscious, the officers then reportedly tried to have him declared as baggage and put him into the luggage hold. Once again blocked by the airline, the officers eventually decided to handcuff the man to a chair, and spent the night in the airport departure lounge hoping to get a flight with a different airline the next day. During the night, he appeared to have trouble breathing but they again refused to allow airport police to take the injured man to hospital. Allegations: The man, Sergei Kozhemyakin, 36, was wanted on suspicion of murdering a mayoral aide . Dragged: They dragged him to the airport, tried to check him in as a passenger and then as luggage . He reportedly died while the argument was going on. Kozhemyakin was wanted on suspicion of ordering the murder of Arkady Georgiadi, a mayoral aide in the Stavropol region town of Mineralnye Vody who was shot at point-blank range by two assailants in 2008. The perpetrators were arrested soon after, though police had been searching for Kozhemyakin who had gone missing until he was discovered when he checked into the hospital in a critical condition. It was not clear how he had ended up injured and in hospital and Russian police confirmed they are investigating the incident. Eventually, they handcuffed him to a chair were he died that night. Despite being caught on camera, officers Fedor Moroz and Yuriy Koudinov, who have now been fired, claim they did nothing wrong . Meanwhile, the two officers, who were caught on video dragging the unconscious man across the floor at the airport, have denied that they did anything wrong. 'We asked a nurse and she told us that it was fine to move the man and he didn't need to be in hospital any more,' said Yuriy Koudinov.","Sergei Kozhemyakin, 36, died after being dragged in a coma by police .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Passport staff were left incredulous today after it emerged the civil service boss who has overseen this year's unprecedented holiday chaos has been nominated as a 'leader of the year' at a respected awards ceremony. Paul Pugh, who admitted to MPs that he considered resigning over the 500,000 backlog of passport applications which he has allowed to build up ahead of the summer getaway, is up for the award in tonight's influential 'Investors in People' awards. The revelation comes just days after the £104,000 a year boss was slammed by MPs for losing control of the passport application backlog - threatening to ruin up to 55,000 family holidays. Passport Office chief Paul Pugh, who earns £104,000 a year, told MPs that up to 55,000 people will not get their travel documents in time . Mr Pugh, who is not expected to attend the lavish ceremony at the five star Landmark Hotel in central London tonight, last week admitted to MPs that he had considered resigning over the chaos at the Passport Office. It came after he admitted to MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee that the backlog of passport applications had almost doubled in just three months this year. Mr Pugh admitted 480,000 people were waiting for their travel documents - some 200,000 higher than at the same time last year. The Passport Office boss blamed a 'substantially higher intake' of applications for the backlog amid hostile questioning from MPs. But unions told MPs the figure was even higher. By June 8 the number of people waiting for their passport had hit 493,289, union chief Mike Jones told the Home Affairs Select Committee. Just 12 weeks earlier, the figure stood at 289,892. Mr Pugh apologised to families who suffered delays in their passport applications. He said: 'I absolutely recognise the anger and distress that some people have suffered and I would like to put on record that yes, in every case where we haven't met our service standards, where we haven't been able to meet the customer's needs, yes, certainly, we are sorry for that.' PCS General Secretary Mark Serwotka, whose union represents Passport Office staff, slammed the decision to nominate Mr Pugh for a 'leadership' gong. He said: 'This isn't just unfortunate timing, it's an insult to his staff who have been working all hours to clear backlogs caused by cuts and to the public who have been left stranded without a passport.' Amid mounting fury over the passport delays the Government was forced to take urgent action to deal with the crisis. Scroll down for video . Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog . The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham . Those who desperately need travel documents were told that they could get their applications fast-tracked free of charge, instead of paying an extra £55.50 a person. But this will only apply to those who have not had their passports back within three weeks and are going abroad in the next seven days. Minister also announced that those renewing their UK passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12-month extension. Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get. Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service. The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved. Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved. The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application. But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free. British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents. And families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents as well, the Home Secretary announced. But it emerged last week that nearly three quarters of countries will not accept the 12 month emergency extensions. Only 50 countries have confirmed they will accept the extended passports. Popular travel spots including Australia, China, India and World Cup host country Brazil are excluded from the list that was published on the Government website 'gov.uk'. The USA, Cyprus and Turkey – which were last year on the list of the seven most popular overseas holiday destinations for Brits – are not allowing the emergency passports. The Passport Office has increased the number of examiners and call centre staff by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high. The Government's attempt to head off the growing crisis came after MailOnline published pictures showing hundreds of boxes of passport applications piled on a sorting office floor. Passport office workers have also been forced to speak out over the pressure they are being put under to clear the backlog. One whistleblower said workers were being left 'suicidal'. He said Mrs May did not have 'any idea' how bad the situation really was and claimed staff were at breaking point. Speaking anonymously, he said he had been working seven days a week for four months to clear the estimated 500,0000 backlog of applications. He said: 'We're tired, we can't concentrate. Theresa May hasn't got any idea. She doesn't now how bad things are.' The whistleblower was asked about the morale at the Passport Office. The worker said: 'It's suicidal. Suicidal. The staff are worn out. 'Management keep changing the goal posts. They come up with crazy ideas and say how can we help, but they don't have a clue. 'The overnight staff are only supposed to work until 9pm, but they are working till midnight. I'm just so tired. 'I just want people to know the truth. I'm worn out, really worn out and it's been going on for far too long.' He added that the Passport Office in Durham was 'a million times worse' than in Liverpool. He added: 'It's really bad - they are way behind.' The worker said that yesterday morning a woman 'burst into tears because of the pressure they're putting on us'. The five star Landmark Hotel, in Marylebone, central London, will host tonight's 'Investors in People' awards . Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed .","Paul Pugh is up for award at tonight's 'Investors in People' ceremony .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . and Becky Barrow . and Hugo Duncan . The Bank of England was yesterday accused of behaving like ‘an unreliable boyfriend’ for sending out mixed messages about when interest rates will rise. During a grilling by the Treasury Select Committee, Bank governor Mark Carney was criticised for leaving homeowners ‘not really knowing where they stand’. Although Mr Carney predicted that interest rates – which have been held at a record low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009 – would rise soon, he would not give a firm answer as to when that might be. Bank of England governor Mark Carney appeared to play down the prospect of an early interest rate rise . Labour MP Pat McFadden told him: ‘It . strikes me the Bank is behaving a bit like an unreliable boyfriend – one . day hot, one day cold. The people on the other side of the message are . left not really knowing where they stand.’ It . is now widely expected that interest rates will rise before the 2015 . election and maybe even as early as the end of this year, which will . have huge implications for millions of homeowners. And . Mr Carney raised concern about the 1.4million who have bought their . first home since July 2007, the last time interest rates were increased, . and have never experienced a sudden rise in the monthly cost of their . mortgage. Mr Carney said: ‘One danger is that, having lived through years of interest rates at rock-bottom  levels, people assume they never go up. We have to dispel that.’ But . the governor also took pains to stress that when interest rates do . start rising, the process will be ‘limited and gradual’ – a phrase he . used nine times during the two-hour hearing. Economists predict the rate will be about 2.5 per cent by 2017. MPs on the Treasury select committee questioned whether Mr Carney considered the impact of his comments on the money markets . During . the select committee hearing, Mr Carney appeared to row back on a . warning last week that rates could rise before the end of the year. He told MPs that low wage growth and spare capacity in the economy meant a rate rise this year was less likely. He . struck a markedly different tone to his Mansion House speech last week, . when he suggested the cost of borrowing would increase before the end . of 2014, adding: 'It could happen sooner than markets currently expect.' It was seen as a clear signal that homeowners had to brace themselves for a rate hike. But . giving evidence to the Treasury select committee today, Mr Carney . suggested the tentative economic recovery meant interest rates could . remain at their historic low of 0.5 per cent for longer. The Bank of England base rate of interest has been at a record low of 0.5 per cent since 2009 . He stressed that the decision to make the first increase in rates for five years would be based on the state of the economy. 'The . start of normalising of interest rates, the exact timing of that will . be driven by the data, but the most important aspect of the guidance is . that the increase in rates will be limited and gradual.' He warned that Britain would still be 'living in extraordinary times a few years down the road'. Mr . Carney was grilled by MPs about whether his Mansion House speech was . giving his personal view or the official line of the Bank's Monetary . Policy Committee. He . insisted that his comments were in line with Bank policy and wanted to . shift market expectations about when a rate rise would come: 'Really what we are trying to do is we would like to see the market adjust to the data.' Last . year the Bank said interest rates would not rise until the unemployment . rate fell to 7 per cent, but when that target was met earlier than . expected, it set broader criteria for a rise. Mr McFadden said: 'The purpose of guidance is to achieve clarity of expectations among households and consumers.' But Mr Carney insisted the message from Bank guidance had been 'very clearly received'. 'As . the economy progresses, the time to normalise interest rates is edging . closer. It is coming closer. But what is most relevant is those . adjustments will be through a gradual process that is likely to be lower . that historical averages.' Ahead of the hearing, the Institute of Directors issued a call for interest rates to rise, possibly as early as this autumn. House prices in London rose by 18.7 per cent in the year to April,almost twice the national average of 9.9 per cent . IoD . chief economist James Sproule said: 'As the recovery takes hold it will . soon be the time to start taking interest rates to a level where . monetary policy can once again become an effective economic lever. 'Ideally . this rise in interest rates will be achieved gradually, starting in the . autumn of 2014, with an aim of reaching a more normal level, perhaps 3 . per cent, by autumn 2015.' Mr . Carney is expected to announce new rules later this week to further cut . back on large and risky mortgage loans in a bid to head off the threat . of a housing bubble. Prices . rose by 9.9 per cent in the year to April, surging by 18.7 per cent in . London. In 33 areas of England and Wales, property prices increased in . value by more than annual local wages. First-time buyers have been hardest hit by the boom, with prices for them rising by more than 10 per cent in a year. People . getting on to the first rung of the property ladder paid a record . £199,000 in April, almost 10 times the average salary of people in their . twenties. It is already getting harder for buyers to get a loan, with banks limiting mortgage approvals despite rising demand. The Bank of England reports that lenders forecast a 'lower appetite for risk' over the next three months . Prices paid by first-time buyers are up 10.7 per cent year-on-year, but only 9.5 per cent for those already on the property ladder . High street banks and lenders expect the number of new mortgage agreements to fall significantly from July to September. It . follows changes to the Mortgage Market Review which forces lenders to . more closely scrutinise borrowers' income and outgoings to check if they . can afford repayments if interest rates rise. In the past, people applying for a mortgage were asked for three months’ pay slips and recent bank statements to show their major outgoings. But since April they have faced invasive questions about their finances and lifestyle, from their weekly food bill to the cost of their childcare arrangements and even how much they spend on gym membership. New rules limiting the amount that can be loaned in relation to incomes will also push down mortgage approval rates. Jonathan Harris, a director of mortgage broker Anderson Harris, said: 'Demand is still strong as buyers remain confident of their ability to get a mortgage and their perception that now is a good time to buy, with more stock coming onto the market.'","Bank of England governor appears to suggest rate rise is still months off .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . An abortion doctor who performed ‘barbaric’ abortions at his medical centre will go on trial today over eight deaths including a pregnant refugee and seven viable newborns. Dr Kermit Gosnell, 72, the clinic owner, could face the death penalty over charges he killed 41-year-old Karnamaya Mongar and seven viable newborns at a West Philadelphia clinic in Pennsylvania. He also faces a separate federal trial on prescription drug charges. Gosnell, who has pleaded not guilty, saw himself as a medical missionary in the blighted neighbourhood where he worked and lived for 40 years. His Women's Medical Center treated the poor, immigrants, teens and women with late-stage pregnancies who could not get abortions elsewhere. Charged with murder: Dr Kermit Gosnell, an abortion doctor who performed 'barbaric' abortions at his medical centre, has gone on trial over eight deaths including a 41-year-old refugee and seven viable newborns . Gosnell told the Philadelphia Daily News in a March 2010 interview, a month after the federal drug raid: ‘I feel in the long term I will be vindicated. ‘I aspire to perfection, certainly for my patients.’ But some of those patients were left with infections, perforated bowels and other injuries after barbaric abortions were performed by untrained, unlicensed staff, according to numerous lawsuits and a lengthy 2011 grand jury report. In 2009 Ms Mongar also lost her life at the centre. Jury selection starts Monday in the death penalty case. All but one of the nine clinic workers arrested with Gosnell have pleaded guilty, three of them to third-degree murder, which carries a potential 20- to 40-year prison sentence. Unlicensed doctor Steven Massof of Pittsburgh told the grand jury that he used scissors to snip the spines of more than 100 babies born alive. 'House of horrors': Some of those patients at his Women's Medical Center (pictured) were left with infections, perforated bowels and other injuries after abortions were performed by untrained, unlicensed staff . He worked for Gosnell for a few hundred dollars a week. He pleaded guilty to third-degree murder in the deaths of two babies allegedly stabbed by Gosnell while Mr Massof assisted with the abortions. Gosnell's third wife, Pearl, a cosmetologist, pleaded guilty to performing an illegal, late-term abortion and other charges. She does not have to testify, but other co-defendants have said they would. It's not clear if Gosnell plans to testify, because a gag order has been issued in the case. But it's possible, given his posture in the Daily News interview. Gosnell said: ‘Many times people have not been able to fully pay me for my services. ‘As a principle, I have not refused to provide them care.’ Yet he made millions over the years, both from abortions and a thriving side practice where staffers allegedly dispensed his pre-signed prescriptions for OxyContin, Percocet and other highly addictive painkillers. Related federal drug charges await Gosnell after the murder trial, which is expected to last several weeks. Opening statements are scheduled for March 14. Lost her life at the centre: Karnamaya Mongar (pictured with her husband) died after allegedly receiving lethal doses of sedatives and painkillers from Gosnell's untrained workers in 2009 . It is not clear if Pennsylvania jurors have ever been asked to send a man of Gosnell's age or occupation to death row. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams called Gosnell's macabre medical clinic - where agents found fetal body parts in glass jars and staff refrigerators, and patient rooms filthy and blood-stained - a ‘house of horrors’. ‘Dr Gosnell is never going to get the death penalty,’ defence attorney Jack McMahon said early on, noting his client's age and the cost of protracted capital cases. The gag order now prevents Mr McMahon from commenting about the case. But he met with Gosnell at the courthouse on Thursday last week, with prosecutors and the trial judge nearby, in what some viewed as late-hour plea discussions. Ms Mongar's family has a civil suit pending over her death. The woman from Bhutan - who did not speak English - died after allegedly receiving lethal doses of sedatives and painkillers from Gosnell's untrained workers. She and her husband and three children had survived 20 years in refugee camps before settling in rural Virginia. She was referred to Gosnell's clinic to seek a second-term abortion. Medical technician Sherry West, during her plea to third-degree murder and other charges, admitted she may have administered drugs to Ms Mongar while Gosnell was off-site. ‘She's very sorry about the death of that young lady,’ defence lawyer Michael Wallace said after her plea. ‘She got caught up in a series of things that probably she did not realise the significance of.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Dr Kermit Gosnell could face the death penalty over the deaths .

"By . Sam Webb . Offended: Natalie James, who was called a 'c***' by a salesman who lost his commission after she complained about him . A car salesman called a customer a 'moaning little c***' after losing his commission when he sold her a Vauxhall Corsa. Natalie James bought the motor from Go Vauxhall in Croydon, south London, last year, but complained at the time about the conduct of salesman Gary Brown, who sold her the car. Her complaint meant that Mr Brown, 37, of Croydon, did not receive the £200 commission he would normally pocket for selling the vehicle. But more than eight months after buying the car, Miss James received a Facebook message from Mr Brown saying: 'Thought I recognised you.'The complaining little slag!' When Ms James replied: 'Excuse me? I don't even know you?'  Mr Brown, who had spotted Ms James on a mutual friend's Facebook page, added: 'Oh yes you do. It was me that sold you the black Corsa, but then you complained about me for no reason at all and said that you didn't want to speak to me.' 'I ended up losing commission I had earned for selling the car. All because you are a moaning little c***.' Miss James received the text messages on Friday and has contacted police, who are now believed to be investigating the comments sent to her phone. After posting a screen grab of the offensive text messages on Twitter, Miss James wrote: 'I bought a car from Croydon @vauxhall last year. 'Today I get this in my inbox from salesman who served me. Disgusting.' Now Mr Brown has apologised to Ms James . about the tirade. Mr Brown contacted Ms James using Facebook Messenger after spotting her on a mutual friend's profile . Tirade: Mr Brown has apologised to his former customer and called his actions 'silly and immature' He claims he was frustrated . because he had no idea why she complained about him. Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'I noticed her on a mutual friend's Facebook and thought ""I remember that name"". 'I was her salesman (and when the car sale was finalised) she asked not to speak to me. I have got no idea what I did, I thought we got on OK. I was hurt. 'I messaged her, which was silly and rash and immature. My intention wasn't to make her feel threatened or intimidated. It was a reaction. 'Some people find the use of the c-word more abusive than others.' Hi Natalie, . First of all, I apologise for the abusive message I sent you yesterday. I would have sent you this message by Facebook means, but I realise you've blocked me, which I completely understand. I saw you on a friend's Facebook and instantly remembered who you were when I sold you a car last year. I was gutted when you asked to speak to another salesman and had no idea what I had done to upset you so much. Obviously that doesn't excuse my message yesterday, so I apologise for that. All the best, . Gary Brown . He added: 'I'm an ex-soldier and you would be surprised how often that word is used in the Army. 'I didn't think of the consequences. 'I've left car sales, I don't believe I'm suited to that career.' He added she has not responded to his apology, sent via Twitter. Bosses at Vauxhall, which were alerted to the comments on Twitter - which have been retweeted more than 800 times - tweeted Miss James: 'We're really sorry about this & it's not something we condone in at all. 'We'll look into this & get back to you soon.'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Four loggerhead sea turtles were taken to a Virginia park and returned to the ocean after they washed up seven months ago in Massachusetts. The loggerhead turtles were escorted by a team from the New England Aquarium, who searched for 70-degree water - which would be warm enough for the turtles' safe return home, according a report by the Boston Globe. Homecoming! A loggerhead turtle is seen heading toward the water on Sunday in Virginia . The turtles were hypothermic last year when they ended up on Cape Cod. The four loggerheads, who weigh between 40 and 100 pounds, were eventually taken to Assateague Island National Seashore in Virgina, the paper said. Once taken out, the turtles trekked 25 yards on the sand toward the water - as a crowd of around 200 kept watch. Back at the beach: Onlookers watch as a turtle - wearing a satellite - moves back toward the ocean . Exam: This May photo shows a turtle being tested as the UNE's Marine Animal Rehabilitation and Conservation Program and aquarium technicians prepare it for future release . Scientists placed satellites on two of the turtles to track their movements in the next six to nine months, the Globe said. The returned turtles were the last members of a group of over 85 that washed up last year on Cape Cod, the paper reported. Loggerhead sea turtles range in size between 34 and 49 inches long, the aquarium says on its website, and can live between 30 to 50 years.","Four loggerhead turtles were escorted by a team from the New England Aquarium to Assateague Island National Seashore in Virgina .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Married couples are in decline, fuelled by changes in social attitudes and the arrival of families from abroad. The proportion of families with a couple who have tied the knot fell from 70 per cent in 2001 to 65 per cent in 2011, the Office for National Statistics said. However, there are wide variations between the nationalities of families, with 85 per cent of Indian couples getting married compared to just 35 per cent of those from Somalia. Scroll down for video . New research based on the 2011 Census shows that there were 15.8million households living in England and Wales, with 9 in 10 of them comprising of just one family. While almost two thirds (65 per cent) were married, the proportion with cohabiting couples and lone parent families rose in the decade from 2011. Some 85 per cent of families were headed by someone born in the UK. But a breakdown based on the nationality of the ‘family reference person’ shows how rates of marriage, cohabiting and living alone vary depending on where in the world comes from. The ONS said that just over a third of foreign families were born in the Middle East and Asia (36 per cent), with the two largest countries of birth (India and Pakistan) accounting for more than half (52 per cent) from this region. Among people born in the UK, 65 per cent of couples were married, ranked 21 out of 35 countries. Marriage rates were highest among families headed by someone born in India (85 per cent, followed by Sri Lanka (84 per cent) and Afghanistan (83 per cent). The ONS said: ‘High proportions of married couples may reflect cultural attitudes towards family structures and marriage in the population.’ ‘High proportions of lone parent families may reflect reasons for migration (such as conflict in the country of birth) and arrival profiles (as populations that have been I the UK longer have had more time for partnership breakdown),’ the ONS added. Lone parent families accounted for 18 per cent of all families in England and Wales; the proportion was highest for families headed by someone born in Somalia (60 per cent). The ONS said: ‘This may reflect Somali-born migrants who arrived during the 1990s following the Somali civil war; many women and children may have left without their partner.’ A third (33 per cent) of Lithuania families were cohabiting, the highest rate in the country, followed by Poland (32 per cent) and France and New Zealand, both on 30 per cent. Just 3 per cent of families from Bangladesh, Pakistan and India were cohabiting.","Cultural attitudes to marriage vary if families are from overseas, ONS says .

"By . Associated  Press Reporter . Punished for doing what he believed was right: The Rev. Thomas Ogletree will be tried March 10 for violating church law against officiating at gay unions . The United Methodist Church has formally charged another clergyman for presiding at the same-sex wedding of his son. The Rev. Thomas Ogletree will be tried on March 10 for violating church law against officiating at gay unions, according to his spokeswoman, Dorothee Benz. It’s the second high-profile United Methodist trial in recent months over same-sex relationships. In December, pastor Frank Schaefer of . central Pennsylvania was defrocked after he officiated at his son’s gay . wedding in Hull in 2007. The church considers homosexuality incompatible with Christian teaching. Ogletree . is a theologian, a former Yale Divinity School dean, and a retired . elder in the church’s New York district, or Annual Conference. Some clergy had filed a complaint after his son’s 2012 wedding announcement appeared in The New York Times. Ogletree, . 80, said he could not refuse his son’s request to preside at the . wedding, which was held in New York, where gay marriage is legal. 'It is a shame that the church is choosing to prosecute me for this act of love, which is entirely in keeping with my ordination vows to ‘seek peace, justice, and freedom for all people’ and with Methodism’s historic commitment to inclusive ministry embodied in its slogan ‘open hearts, open minds, open doors',' Ogletree said in a statement. Bishop Martin McLee, who leads the New York Annual Conference, could not be immediately reached for comment. Unfair: Rev. Frank Schaefer (right) was defrocked by the United Methodist church after officiating his son Tim's (left) same-sex marriage . Bishop Martin McLee (pictured) leads the New York Annual Conference . The Rev. Randall Paige of Christ . Church United Methodist Church in Port Jefferson Station, New York, led . the group of clergy who had filed the complaint against Ogletree, . according to United Methodist News Service. An administrator at Christ Church said Paige was not available for comment. Theologically conservative Methodists have said they file formal complaints reluctantly, hoping to find another resolution for their disagreements, but feel clergy must be held accountable when they violate church policy. Like other mainline Protestant groups, Methodists have been debating for decades over whether the Bible condemns or condones same-gender relationships. However, other mainline groups, such as the Episcopal Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, have in recent years taken key steps toward accepting same-sex couples. The top Methodist policy-making body, the General Conference, has repeatedly rejected changing church law on homosexuality, including in their most recent vote at a 2012 meeting. In the last few years, as gay marriage has gained legal recognition by US states, Methodists advocating for gays and lesbians have intensified their protests, hosting gay weddings in Methodist churches or officiating at ceremonies elsewhere. Two other similar cases are pending within the Methodist church. The Rev. Stephen Heiss of the Upper New York Annual Conference is expected to face a church trial for presiding at same-sex marriages, including officiating at his daughter’s 2002 wedding. The Rev. Sara Thompson Tweedy, of the New York Annual Conference, is facing a formal complaint that she is a 'self-avowed practicing' lesbian, or lives openly with a same-sex partner, which is barred by church law. Ogletree’s trial will be held at First United Methodist Church in Stamford, Connecticut. The United Methodist Church is the second-largest Protestant group in the United States and claims 12.5 million members worldwide. Cases pending: Rev. Stephen Heiss (left) is expected to be tried for officiating at his daughter's wedding in 2002 while Rev.

'We do not see any value in changing.' It has struck a nerve with the majority of supporters. One, because they feel Hodgson should be cut loose.

"By . James Rush . Created: . 02:03 EST, 24 June 2014 . Football fan: Ed McGovern, headteacher at Stafford Leys Primary School, has taken two weeks off working during term time to travel to Brazil . Parents have attacked a primary school head teacher they say has taken two weeks off during term time to travel to the World Cup in Brazil. Ed McGovern, 55, was allowed to take unpaid leave from . Stafford Leys Primary School in Leicester due to 'personal reasons' after enlisting the help of his union. The . school has not confirmed the reason for Mr McGovern's absence but . parents said they found out he had gone to South America for the World Cup. A . spokesman for the school said Mr McGovern has never previously made a . request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been . 'exemplary.' But furious parents said he should be 'setting an example', especially when they could be fined for taking their children out of school. One even called on the head teacher to resign. Businesswoman Carol-Anne Girvan, 42, whose two sons attend Stafford Leys Primary School, said: 'I think it's absolutely appalling. 'He is headteacher, he was refused permission to do this at first and had to appeal to his union I hear. 'He has a responsibility here for his pupils and he has neglected them. 'He is supposed to be setting an example to not only the students but for parents, who themselves cannot go to this kind of event. He ought to resign because of this.' Parent Kiran Kaur added: 'I don't think it is right. We parents can't do it, can we, but he can go away when he wants. I think Ofsted should be taking a good look again at the school - his leadership should be in serious question now. 'I want to know why the governors and powers that be thought that this would be OK.' Anger: Ed McGovern was allowed to take two weeks off from Stafford Leys Primary School in Leicester . Parents: Carol-Anne Girvan (left) said the head should resign while Jasvir Singh (right) said it was a 'disgrace' Jasvir Singh, 41, whose has a son at the school, added: 'We only found out he was gone recently. I don't think that's right. 'I . couldn't believe what I was hearing... It is a big disgrace and we . should have been asked about this before he was allowed to go away.' Parent Kiran Kaur said: 'His leadership should be in serious question' Father-of-two Carlton Skeats, 44, . said: 'Considering parents face fines for taking their children out of . school this just reeks of double standards. It doesn't send the right . message at all.' And Zoe . Gibbs, 28, whose two sons Harvey, six, and Oliver, eight, go to the . school, said: 'They haven't told us anything really, it's a disgrace. 'But . of course it has come out that he's gone to Brazil for the World Cup. If I were to take my son out of school I'm sure I'd be punished. 'When my son had tonsillitis he was off for two weeks and Mr McGovern wrote us a letter saying he had had too long off sick. If that's too long when you're genuinely ill then going on a jolly to Brazil isn't right.' Other parents were more supportive of the headmaster. Kerry . King, 31, a full time mum with two children at the school, said: 'I . don't see a problem with it. He is taking unpaid leave and it will not . affect the children as he doesn't teach in class. 'I . think people are just jealous that he can go and they can't, he's an . exceptional head and should be allowed a one off experience.' Veerpan . Kau, 29, whose daughter attends the school, added: 'I think it is fine . what he has done. He is not hurting the children - there is plenty of . cover for him for just two weeks.' But . the Conservative MP for Charnwood, Stephen Dorrell, said: 'It is . unprofessional and disappointing that the headteacher has not displayed . professional leadership at this school.' 'Double standards': One parent said the school (pictured) had criticised her when her son was off sick . Mr McGovern's request for time off was originally rejected by governors following a row when the headteacher of another Leicester school was allowed to take a month off in term time to get married. The decision however was overturned after the head appealed with the help of his union. A school spokesman told MailOnline: . 'Requests for leave of absence for personal reasons can be made by staff . in line with our school policy. 'Our . leave of absence policy states that the Governors “will endeavour to . facilitate requests for leave” and “will wherever possible seek to . achieve for our employees a balance between home, work and leisure as . part of our commitment to being an employer of choice”. 'Our . headteacher has led the school with distinction for the past ten years. During that time the school has improved from being judged by Ofsted as . having serious weaknesses to our most recent inspection earlier this . year which showed that all aspects were at least good. The headteacher is understood to have taken time off school to travel to Brazil for the World Cup (file picture) A spokesman for the school (pictured), in Leicester, said Mr McGovern has never previously made a request for leave of absence and his attendance record has been 'exemplary' 'His attendance record over this period has been exemplary and he has never previously made a request for leave of absence. 'The request was for unpaid leave of . absence for personal reasons which has been approved by the Governing . body after careful consideration. 'We . have made provision to ensure that during the period of this absence . strong cover for leadership of the school is in place and standards of . teaching and learning will remain high.' Defending her son's decision, the headteacher's mother Shelia, 77, who lives in Birmingham, said: 'My son has put so much into education. Surely he deserves a break. 'Why shouldn't he go to Brazil, who knows what he will be able to teach the children when he returns. 'No one would make a fuss if he took time off to cut the lawn in his garden.' Supportive: Parents Veerpan Kau and Kerry King said there were plenty of staff to cover for the head teacher . His mother-in-law Mona Neil, 90, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said: 'I knew he was planning but I don't know what's just happened. I know he was thinking, hoping to go.' Mr McGovern, who lives with his wife . Kathryn, 49, in the village of Countesthorpe, Leicestershire, is due . back before the school breaks up on July 11. A parent who asked not to be named said letters had been sent to the parents to inform them Mr McGovern had taken leave for personal reasons. Mrs McGovern, who is also a headteacher at a Leicestershire primary school, was unavailable for comment. Last week it was reported headteacher and football fan Mark Williams quit his job to travel to the World Cup because he would not miss 'the trip of a lifetime' A . National Association of Head Teachers spokesman said: 'Mr McGovern . applied for an unpaid leave of absence and was granted the time off by . his governing body after many years of distinguished service. 'We . represented our member during the appeal as we would all members on . personnel issues. Ultimately, the decision belongs to the governing . body, which appears to have acted in line with its own policies and at . no cost to the public purse.' Susan . Holmes, a governor at the school, said: 'I would love to be able to . comment but all the board of governors were told not to say anything . about it. 'I have since left the board over a disagreement I had with a policy, but I still can't say anything.' A . Department for Education spokesman said: 'It is the responsibility of . the school’s governing body to take decisions on staffing and leave.' Stafford . Leys Primary School was built in 1966 and is situated in Leicester . Forest East, five miles to the west of the city centre. Changes to the law in September last year meant headteachers would only grant pupils leave of absence during term time in 'exceptional circumstances'. It is then upto the headteacher to decide how many days a pupil is allowed to be away from school if the leave is granted. Parents who take their children out of school can be fined £60 per child, which increases to £120 if it is not paid within 28 days. Failure to pay can result in court action and in extreme cases a short prison term. It has 518 boys and girls aged between four and ten on the roll and was rated 'good' by Ofsted in March this year. Last week it was reported headteacher . and football fan Mark Williams quit his job to travel to the World Cup . because he would not miss 'the trip of a lifetime.' The . England and West Ham fan told governors at High Lawn Primary School, in . Bolton, that he wanted to resign so he could go to the tournament. They gave him two weeks off during . term time to travel to Brazil and he is due to return in July for the . remainder of the summer term before a new headteacher takes over in . September. Yesterday, . meanwhile, it was reported a mother had declared she will risk a prison . sentence for letting her son miss three days of school to attend her . wedding. Clare Whitelegg was furious her nine-year-old son's primary school refused her request for him to take time off lessons to watch her marry her police officer fiance Andy McLeary. The school argued that the wedding did not warrant time off because it could not be classed as ‘exceptional circumstances’. Parents can be punished if they take their children out of school outside holidays. They can be fined £60 per child, which increases to £120 if it is not paid within 28 days. Failure to pay can result in court action and in extreme cases a short prison term.","Parent criticises 'double standards' after headteacher goes to Brazil .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Britain will veto plans by Albania to join the European Union unless new rules are introduced to immigration. Brussels today named Albania as a candidate to join after changes were made to the way the country of 3million people is run. But David Cameron has made clear that he will block any attempt to allow Albania to formally join the 28-nation bloc without new limits on freedom of movement. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama welcomed the news that Albania had cleared the first hurdle on its long path to European Union membership, on his country's fourth try . EU leaders meeting on Friday will formally sign off the decision to allow Albania to start the process of preparing its application to join. Albania has failed to win the coveted status three times since 2009. Countries including Britain and Germany have made clear it will not be allowed to proceed without further efforts to tackle corruption and the introduction of an independent judiciary. However, Downing Street today made clear that the it will use its veto to block further expansion of the EU without new rules to prevent migrants from new, poorer countries moving to the UK in search of work. A Number 10 source said: ‘It is absolutely clear that before Albania can ever join, the long-term transitional arrangements would have to apply. If they don’t, we won’t let them in. End of story.’ Mr Cameron is pushing the idea of new countries having to reach a set level of income per head before the borders are opened to the rest of the EU. It follows concerns about the influx of people from countries like Poland, and more recently Bulgaria and Romania, when they joined the EU. Albania has been granted candidate status in the process of applying to join the 28-nation bloc, but will have to overcome opposition in Westminster to be successful . The prospect of EU expansion has emerged for the first time since the European Parliament elections, in which support surged for Eurosceptic parties. In Britain, UKIP topped the poll, beating Labour into second place and the Tories third. Mr Cameron believes the introduction of controls on freedom of movement for new controls could be a major gain in his plan to renegotiate Britain’s EU membership, before staging an in-out referendum by 2017. The Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister set out that all and any future accessions would have to be the subject of the new transitional controls that he wants to see, and that would apply to all and any future cases. ‘This is not a decision on accession, it’s a decision to at some point in the future, it could be several years down the line, this is the beginning of any negotiations. ‘There is a period of negotiations that in some countries’ cases has taken decades, any final decision, at the end of that process requires unanimity, and the Prime Minister is very clear the new transitional requirements he wants to see would have to apply to any and all future accessions.’ David Cameron has made clear the UK will not allow Albania to join the EU without limits on freedom of movement for new countries . Albania will not be allowed to progress in joining the EU without major reforms on the use of fraudulent documents, money laundering, drug cultivation and human trafficking. As well as Britain, other countries taking a hardline stance include Holland, Germany, France, the Czech Republic and Spain. In a statement, the EU said Albania had to address issues such as the use of fraudulent documents, money laundering, drug cultivation and human trafficking. Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said that, with the EU's decision, Albania had 'regained its lost dignity in the eyes of international partners.' 'It was not an easy job, Europe is not a door that opens easily. After the (European) elections, things could have gone in another direction. The reason I am thankful to European leaders ... is that they stood by the project of Europe,' he told reporters in the Albanian capital Tirana.","Albania granted candidate status in process of applying for EU membership .

An invitation to the event's live webcast was then posted on Samsung's official blog. This second invitation hinted the software on the S5 might have a new layout and the teaser featured nine rounded app icons - current icons are a mixture of shapes. These . icons were also 'flatter' in design, similar to those seen on Apple's . iOS 7 software, having previously been designed with shadowing to give . them a 3D appearance. The apps listed were Speed, Curiosity, Fun, Outdoor, Social, Style, Privacy, Fitness and Life. Curiosity, Fun and Social are also featured in the latest video. These icons also appeared to be colour coded, with apps relating to features of the phone -  Privacy, Speed, and Curiosity - shown in blue. Rumours claim the Korean tech giant will launch the Galaxy S5 phone during the event in Barcelona next week. The the use of the number five in the video, pictured, adds even more weight to these claims . A number of the titles relate to photos, and photo features, including this 'selfie' slide. Rumours state the phone will have a 16MP camera - up from 13MP - and these slides bolster these claims . Outdoor, Style and Fitness were shown in green, while the Social icon is yellow, Fun is purple and Life is red. This . new look suggests the Touchwiz interface used across Samsung's devices . will be redesigned for the S5 - or whichever device the firm announces. Touchwiz is a skinned version of Google Android, designed specifically for Samsung gadgets. It makes it stand out from the traditional Android used on Nexus devices, for example. The . icons on the webcast invitation also hinted at what Samsung wants to promote as the . phone's main features, namely speed and privacy. Meanwhile, Curiosity . could hint towards a new search feature. Samsung unveiled the teaser invitation, pictured, on its official blog. It features rounded icons for Samsung apps, and hints towards a new-look version of its Touchwiz interface. Touch Wiz is a skinned version of Google's Android operating system. The icons also have the 'flatter' design seen in Apple's iOS 7 . This new look suggests the Touchwiz interface used on Samsung devices, pictured here on the Galaxy S4, will be redesigned for the S5. The icons on the teaser also hint at what Samsung wants to promote as the phone's main features, namely speed and privacy . It's not surprising Samsung may be looking to improve its Touchwiz interface. Last November, vice chairman Kwon Oh-hyun admitted that the software is poor, and that the firm is better at designing hardware than developing software. The Korean firm is expected to use the event to reveal its Galaxy S5 alongside a new, curved version of its Galaxy Gear watch. It has already been claimed the handset could have a new 'smart' home screen that changes depending on the user's location, or what they are doing. An image obtained by website @evleaks, . shows a home screen displaying a series of cards, similar to how Google . Now works; showing nearby locations as well as information gleaned from . apps about what the user is doing. For . example, it shows details of the user's latest run, a flight they plan to . catch and text messages from friends. This could be a major overhaul for Samsung's flagship handset, if it is legitimate. Samsung sent journalists invititations to a 'Samsung Unpacked' event, pictured, at the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona, last month.

Leaks of Samsung's new menu system show a series of 'smart cards' showing information to users than can change depending on where they are or what they are doing. This is similar to how Google Now works . The specs for Samsung's new Galaxy S5 . have also already leaked online, amid claims the handset will come in both . metallic and plastic versions. The . handset is expected to have a 5.25-inch screen - up from the S4's 5-inch display - use iris . scanning to recognise users without a password, and will run a . superfast Snapdragon processor. There is also expected to be a mini version of the S5, and a camera version called the Zoom, according to the Sammobile web site. The metal version is expected to cost around 800 Euros (£657) and the . plastic model is rumoured to cost around 650 Euros (£535). By comparison, the metal Phone 5S starts at £549. If true, Samsung's move is identical to Apple's decision to launch a plastic iPhone 5C alongside its flagship 5S model last year.","Trailer features images and titles with the number five written beside them .

"By . Dan Bloom . A British artist has been killed and his partner is feared dead after a gas explosion ripped through the home they built together in Portugal. Glyn Uzzell, 84, had lived with Paul Fonk in the villa in the Algarve region for 35 years, and two works by David Hockney were thought to be hanging in his home when it was destroyed. Portuguese media reported tonight that Mr Uzzell's partner had been confirmed as a second victim in the tragic blast. Tragic: Glyn Uzzell (left) built the house himself with his partner Paul Fonk (right) in southern Portugal. It exploded in what is thought to have been an accidental gas blast yesterday which sent debris flying 300m away . Wreckage: The home was completely destroyed along with a separate studio for Mr Uzzell's work . The vast explosion yesterday morning was heard more than a mile away and completely obliterated the house, leaving its roof on a neighbour's property. Debris was thrown 300 metres away before police and rescue workers descended on the area, popular with British ex-pats, just before 8am local time. Destroyed: A print of The Diploma by David Hockney (pictured) was believed to be in Mr Uzzell's home . Born in Swindon, Wiltshire, in 1930, Mr Uzzell studied at London's renowned Goldsmith’s College before moving in 1957 to teach at the International School of Geneva, Switzerland. There he won prizes and was given a one-man exhibition at the city's Musée de l’Athenée. It was there that he met his Luxembourg-born partner Mr Fonk and the pair moved to the Portuguese village of Caramujeira, near Lisbon, in 1979. They painstakingly renovated a dilapidated farmhouse into a villa and decorated it with art, including two works by the renowned British artist David Hockney. One of the works was believed to be a tongue-in-cheek etching of a fake diploma which Hockney made when the Royal College of Art refused to award him one after he spoiled an exam paper as a protest. Friend Rolf Osang said Mr Uzzell picked up . the artwork in a gallery in London's . Sloane Square for a little over £5 soon after it was created in 1962. Called The Diploma, it was produced in an edition of 50 and has been hailed as one of Hockney's great early works. Another copy of The Diploma sold at auction for £29,760 last year in London. Mr Uzzell's print, which featured a goose-stepping art school head and a monster, is thought to have been destroyed in the blast. Mr Osang, 64, who owns the Galeria Arte Algarve where Mr Uzzell exhibited much of his recent work, paid tribute to the artist. 'He's a very established artist and we . were very lucky to have him,' Mr Osang told MailOnline. Nothing left: Neighbours said they heard the blast more than a mile away and it sounded like an earthquake . Emergency response: Firefighters and paramedics attended the scene in the village of Caramujeira . 'He had been . very ill with heart problems and hadn't been exhibiting for five years, . but started again after he had a heart operation and had an implant put . in. 'He was an incredibly . warm person and a loving person and of course, such a loving person was . much loved by those who knew him too. Well-loved: Mr Uzzell was born in Swindon, Wiltshire and studied at Goldsmith's in London . 'He had the most wonderful house. He built it all himself with his partner and they had two pieces by David Hockney in the house, as well as a separate studio with his own works which I believe have been destroyed. 'He came often to the gallery and was very sociable. 'He was such a happy person and he came to the gallery only last Friday, completely jubilant about life and his recovering health. 'It's hit me and others in the art community here terribly. 'People felt the blast a mile and a half away. We have many small earthquakes here and it felt like one of those.' In a biography on his website, the artist wrote: 'My work is greatly influenced by the environment. 'Subjects are alluded to but not with straightforward representation. 'Time, place and mood play their part in images that are ostensibly abstract but reveal a point of contact with the visual world.' Mr Uzzell is believed to have a sister from Britain who visited him in Portugal earlier this year. A Foreign Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'We are aware of the death of a British national in Lagoa, Algarve. We stand ready to provide consular assistance.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . From puppeteers and musicians to acrobats, folk singers and magicians, this is no ordinary community. Clustered together in one Delhi slum, the 2,800 families are all street performers. The origins of the multi-talented Kathpulti colony are unknown despite only dating back 40 years. Creative: Budrul Lal, 44 (left), Sundr Bevi, 49, and Suacu Lal are all painters living in the Kathpulti community in a collection of Delhi slums where all their neighbours perform . Facing the street: Basanti Bhatt, 50, a head balancer (left), and Kesar Bhatt, an 80-year-old puppeteer (right), are protesting the government's move to oust to community . Variety: After 40 years, the 2,800 performers in the slum - including Sunita Davi, 30, and Burra Bhatt, 45, who make elephants, are being forced to leave . Monkey tamer: Chatta Khan, 45, spends his time rehearsing new tricks with his pet monkeys, which he takes to the street to perform with . But over time, it has inspired a cultural phenomenon. However, as the government pushes a drive to spruce up the area, they are now being ordered to pack up and leave to make way for luxury flats. The move has sparked fears of a creative drought in the region. In a bid to capture the beauty of the community, British photographer Mark Leaver travelled to India to document the lives and talents of each resident. One 50-year-old woman, Basanti Bhatt, stares stoically at the camera as she performs her act: balancing a five-foot vase on her head. Practice: Children, like 15-year-old Laki Bhatt (left) and 12-year-old Honey Bhatt (right), spend hours every day rehearsing skills such as stilt walking and drumming . Hub: Jagdish Bhatt, 65 (left), and Rajkumar Bhatt, 50 (right) are two of a number of puppeteers in the slum which has created a wave of creativity in the Delhi region . Next door, Chatta Khan, 45, pauses for a moment to pose with his two monkeys as he rehearses taming them. Nearby, an entire family, the Bhatts, have formed a joint act as musicians, and spend their days singing and dancing. Budru Lal, Suacru Lal, and Sundr Bevi are all painters. Their tiny room is splattered with paint and decked with paintings of Hindu figures. Unusual: Punna Gujat, 65 (left), is a chair maker and Basavraj Adewas, 65 (right), makes herbal medicine - both recognised forms of street performance . Residents like singer Babbie Bhatt, 45, (left) and Shabana Khan, who creates textile art (right), will be forced to make way for a new block of flats and a mall in the area . Dressed up: They spend the little money they have on outfits and instruments. Mohumed Shabbir, 34 (left), is a magician, and Rahool Bhatt, 19 (right), is a drummer . Other professions include toy elephant makers, herbal medicines doctors - a recognised street act - and drummers. The Kathpulti Colony is said to have the largest single concentration of street artists in the world. The graduate photographer knew he wanted to work on a substantial body of work abroad. He began to research charities that he could volunteer with, as he knew as a volunteer he would be given immediate access and local contacts. Makeshift: Hamid Brite, 18, is one of just a few so-called longmen in the colony, using stilts made from piece of wood and rope . Musicians: British photographer Mark Leaver went to stay with the community to capture their talents and met the Bhatt family of musicians . 'I began looking globally for these opportunities, and then refined my choices down to charities that could accommodate me as a photographer. 'In the end it was a throw up between India and Kenya. I decided to go with India after looking at the slum the charity operated in.' He explains that his project became very focused on the street performers who live in the slum. 'Initially I was just there to meet and get to know people while trying to adjust to the culture, I wanted to create formal portraits of slum residents alongside this. 'However after a few days in the slum there was no doubt in my mind that I had to make a formal set of portraits of the performers. I knew that the slum was famous for having street performers in it, but I don't think I was prepared for the world's largest concentration of street performers!'","Kathpulti colony of 2,800 families are all street performers living in collection of Delhi slums .

"By . Sebastian Shakespeare . Among British aristocrats there has been but one topic of conversation since King Juan Carlos of Spain announced his abdication: will HM the Queen follow his example? Now one of this country’s most prominent bluebloods, historian John Julius Norwich, has spoken out to urge Her Majesty not to renounce the throne in favour of Prince Charles — even if she becomes seriously ill. ‘The Queen should not stand down,’ Viscount Norwich tells me. ‘It doesn’t matter if she gets Alzheimer’s. I mean, George III went a bit crazy and had a Regent. The same could happen again.’ Royal view: Historian John Julius Norwich (left) has spoken out to urge the Queen not to renounce the throne in favour of Prince Charles — even if she becomes seriously ill . Lord Norwich, who will speak on Wednesday at the Chalke Valley History Festival near Salisbury, compares King Juan Carlos’s abdication to Pope Benedict XVI’s resignation last year. He was the first pontiff to quit in almost 600 years. ‘I was shocked when Pope Benedict stood down, like a bank manager,’ says the 84-year-old historian, who through his father, Tory politician and diplomat Duff Cooper, is descended from William IV and his mistress Dorothea Jordan. ‘A pope shouldn’t do that. He should have stayed on until death. He has set a pretty awful precedent.’ Abdicate: King Juan Carlos of Spain, 76, (left) has abdicated in favour of his son Crown Prince Felipe, 46 (centre) It is highly unusual for a public figure to discuss the Queen’s health in such frank terms. Her Majesty is in fine fettle at 88, while the Queen Mother lived to 101. Juan Carlos, 76, is reported to have told courtiers that he stepped down because he wanted to hand over the throne while his son and heir, Crown Prince Felipe, 46, was still a young man to stop him ‘withering’ like Charles. The Prince of Wales, 65, is the oldest heir to the British throne for 300 years. Author Kate Williams, who will speak at Chalke Valley on Saturday, says: ‘Although the Queen will never abdicate, she will step back increasingly from the role — especially the more arduous duties, public occasions etc. She has already stepped back from foreign travel.’ Why consult octopuses and apps to predict the winner of the World Cup when you have the impeccable logic of Kwasi Kwarteng, MP for Spelthorne.  Kwarteng, whose new book, War And Gold: A Five Hundred-Year History Of Empires, Adventures And Debt, was published last month, has a sensible theory. ‘South American countries always win when the tournament’s held in South or Latin America,’ he tells me. So who does he think will win? ‘Argentina,’ says Kwarteng, who will be speaking at today’s  Chalke Valley History Festival for Schools. Television presenter Peter Snow admits to feeling nervous about the publication in the U.S. this summer of his book, When Britain Burned The White House: The 1814 Invasion Of Washington. ‘I’m very worried,’ he tells me. ‘I’m going over, as the book will be published there on the anniversary of the invasion, August 1814, but I’m concerned about the number of eggs and tomatoes that may be thrown at me.’ ‘I think it was one of the most shameful defeats in U.S. history,’ says Snow. ‘It took a long time to recover from the humiliation.’ Television presenter: Peter Snow admits to feeling nervous about the publication in the U.S. this summer of his book, When Britain Burned The White House: The 1814 Invasion Of Washington . Snow, who will be discussing his book at the Chalke Valley History Festival this Sunday, is optimistic about the future of that thoroughly British institution, BBC’s flagship current affairs programme Newsnight, which he presented 17 years ago. ‘It’s really terrific,’ he says. ‘Newsnight still remains untouchable. Jeremy [Paxman] will be very hard to replace. But there are plenty of good candidates.’ Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt MP is looking forward to his Chalke Valley History Festival talk this Saturday.  The reason? The venue is piquantly close to the South Dorset seat of Tory MP Richard Drax, whose slave-trading family is extensively covered in Hunt’s latest book, Cities Of Empire.  Last year it emerged that Drax’s ancestors, who made a fortune running slave plantations in Barbados, were given compensation for  having to release 189 slaves in 1833. Antiques Roadshow presenter Fiona Bruce was criticised a few months ago by art expert Lucinda Lambton who said she was  ‘unqualified and not highbrow enough’ for the show and an example of the BBC dumbing down. Since then, however, Bruce has discovered a lost Van Dyck sketch, soon to be auctioned at Christie’s, and has won praise from her TV art sleuth close colleague and Fake Or Fortune? co-presenter Philip Mould. ‘Her instincts were bang-on,’ says the gallant Mould, who once discovered a lost painting of Henry VIII’s older brother Prince Arthur and will be speaking at the Chalke Valley History Festival tomorrow. ‘She has become a very valuable part of the show. By taking part in programmes like this, you can’t help learning about artistic technique.’ Over to Lucinda, wife of Sir Peregrine Worsthorne. ‘I’m delighted Philip Mould is singing Fiona’s praises,’ she says. ‘Well done her. That’s terrific. Did she really do it herself?’ Praise: Antiques Roadshow presenter Fiona Bruce has won praise from her TV art sleuth close colleague and Fake Or Fortune? co-presenter Philip Mould (right, with Fiona)","Historian John Julius Norwich urges the Queen not to renounce the throne .

"By . John Drayton . Cristiano Ronaldo believes Portugal are an ‘average side’ and conceded he never thought his team stood any chance of winning the World Cup. The Real Madrid star, speaking after his side’s dramatic draw with the USA, believes that to say his side are 'limited' and that to say they are a top team would be a 'lie'. Portugal are currently sit bottom of Group G with just a single point from two games, rescued by their dramatic late equaliser against the USA when Ronaldo crossed for team-mate Silvestre Varela to convert.

Double act: Nani scored the first for Portugal, whilst Ronaldo's superb cross salvaged a late equaliser . It will take a minor miracle for them to qualify for the second round, as Germany and USA, who play each other in the final round of games, both only need a draw to make it through to the last-16. And even if the USA do lose, it will take a big swing in goal difference for the Portuguese to qualify, after their 4-0 thumping at the hands of the Germans in their opening game. Ronaldo said: ‘Maybe we’re an average team. It would be a lie to say that we are a ‘top’ team. ‘We have many limitations and suffer from injuries such as with Pepe (who was suspended) and (Fabio) Coentrao. This limits us a lot. Limited: Portugal were deprived of centre back Pepe against USA, following his rash sending off . Finished: And Fabio Coentrao, who was ruled out of the tournament after suffering an injury against Germany . ‘We have a very limited team and we are not at the best level. This does not enable you to beat top teams. ‘There are no miracles. We knew we would have a tough group, with perhaps teams better than us.

"By . Joshua Gardner . Took it to the top: Security expert Khalil Shreateh used a Facebook glitch to post to Mark Zuckerberg's wall after the site's security team refused to heed his warnings about the vulnerability . A hacker from Palestine found a Facebook glitch that allowed anyone to post on a stranger’s wall, but when the company ignored his warnings he took them all the way to the top by posting about the issue on Mark Zuckerberg’s wall. Khalil Shreateh first contacted the Facebook security team after proving the glitch was real by writing on the wall of a friend of the Facebook founder. But instead of thanking him and fixing the issue, Facebook said it wasn’t a bug. And because of the methods Shreateh used to finally convince them of the threat, Facebook later denied him the reward usually given to programmers who report holes in the site’s security. ‘My name is Khalil Shreateh. I finished school with B.A degree in Information Systems .

He hoped his ability to post to her page, nonetheless, would help prove his case to Facebook security. Scroll down for video...

Watch video of Shreatah explaining the Facebook glitch... However, instead of repairing the obvious security breach, Facebook replied to Shreateh by saying the issue ‘was not a bug.’ Undeterred, Shreateh used the glitch to hack his way onto Mark Zuckerberg’s Facebook page. ‘Sorry for breaking your privacy,’ he wrote in a since removed post to Zuckerberg, ‘I had no other choice…after all the reports I sent to Facebook team.’ Shreateh went on to recount his attempts to warn the website and posted a grab of the post on his blog. Minutes later, his pleas were answered. Facebook contacted him demanding to know how he’d hacked their bosses personal page. ‘We fixed this bug on Thursday,’ wrote Matt Jones from Facebook’s security team in a Saturday post on Hacker News.

"By . Sarah Griffiths . A Dutch engineer has built the world's smallest electric scooter (pictured) which can fold down to fit inside a work bag . Commuting to the office could be about to get faster and more fun. A Dutch engineer has built the world’s smallest electric scooter which can fold down to fit inside a work bag in just 10 seconds - or be pulled along like a large briefcase. But despite its small size, the scooter can reach a speed of 12mph (19km/h). When a rider is using the vehicle, the scooter stands at four feet tall (125cm) and three feet (97cm) long. But it can collapse to just one foot in height (32cm) and one foot 10 inches (57cm) long when folded up – small enough to stash in a bag and to fit beneath the seat, or in the overhead compartment on a train. It weighs 26lbs (12kg) and has a range of almost 10 miles (16km) before the battery requires a charge. The electric vehicle is fitted with a LiFePO4 battery and a permanent magnet brushless engine. Mechanical engineer Anton Schaap from Hilversum in the Netherlands, said: ‘As far as we know, it is the most compact vehicle in the folded state. ‘It can be folded in just ten seconds and it can also be unfolded in another ten seconds. The 53-year-old came up with the idea for the compact vehicle when the company he was working for planned a move away from the railway station to a new location. Speedy: When a rider is using the vehicle (pictured), the scooter stands at four feet tall (125cm) and three feet (97cm) long. The vehicle can currently reach speeds of 12mph (19km/h), but the final model could be faster depending on local regulations . Top speed: 12mph (19km/h) but this could be altered prior to launch . Size when extended: Four feet (125cm) tall and three feet (97cm) long . Size when folded: One foot (32cm) tall and one foot 10 inches (57cm) long . Weight: 26lbs (12kg) Range: 10miles (16km) on a single charge . Charge time: A few hours . Estimated price: £800 ($1,350) ‘Most employees travelled by train to work, so I was figuring out how they could reach the new office five miles (8km) from the railway station,’ he said. Schaap hopes that charge time will be a few hours when the scooter is ready to be sold and estimates it will cost around £800 ($1,350). ‘We have planned a speed of 12mph (19km/h) but it could also be faster or slower, depending on local regulations,’ he said.

"By . Damien Gayle . Lobbyists are buying up ad space on ESPN to get their message across to sports-mad President Barack Obama and his White House team. Political strategists have revealed how they have begun suggesting the all-sports network to clients who want Obama and his officials to hear their concerns. The President and his staff, as well as other influential Washington figures, are reputed to be regular viewers of the broadcaster, which currently has a near monopoly on sports coverage. President Barack Obama does a behind the back move with a basketball: Lobbyists have begun taking out ads on sports network ESPN that are targeted at the sports-mad president and his team . That's despite one ESPN host branding the commander-in-chief's dismal display of his own basketball skills last month 'the most embarrassing moment of his entire presidency.' Companies and organisations have been cagey about the tactic, but those suspected of using it include Microsoft, the American Petroleum Institute and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. Bruce Haynes of bipartisan public affairs firm Purple Strategies told Politico that he and colleagues had begun advising clients to advertise on ESPN. 'The data is clear that a significant amount of elites and influencers are watching ESPN and sports programs and that there is really a high value to being on those networks,' he said. 'You are much more likely to get the eyeballs you want than being on some other places.' Microsoft is one of the companies that have taken out adverts on ESPN that seem more directed at decision makers rather than consumers. The personal computer software giant took out slots on Monday Night Football programming to directly criticise rival Google as part of its Scroogled campaign. That campaign, which is still running on ESPN in Washington, raised questions about Google's business practices just as federal watchdogs considered taking action against the online ads and search firm over competition issues. Obama and wife Michelle watch a game: Media strategists say there is clear data to show that influential political figures are increasingly watching sports . But advertisers with an issue to push are not just using ESPN to target influential political figures. Strategists say the broadcaster is one of the few that people still watch in real-time, and adverts can also reach important non-ideological voters whose points of view are more susceptible to persuasion. Jim Spellane, spokesman for International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, said advertising on ESPN is part of a broader effort to reintroduce the union to the general public. But, he added, 'it doesn't hurt that an influential audience and electeds watch ESPN [too].'","Data shows that influential political figures are increasingly watching sports .

'We are so disappointed not to finish with a victory but I don't think I have asked for a much better performance. 'Apart from the first 10 or 12 minutes of the game I thought we dominated it totally. 'Unfortunately we didn't take our goal chances today.

Daniel Sturridge missed three good chances for England and was unfortunate not to be awarded a penalty in the first half after a clash with Oscar Duarte. Hodgson said: 'We created the chances, that is important, and normally Daniel is so clinical. 'I am not that concerned. I know he will take the goal chances in the future. The important thing is to keep giving him the opportunity. 'But I have got to say I think we are really unlucky not to win this game.

Wide of the mark: Sturridge had three good chances but failed to add to his sole World Cup goal against Italy . Good luck: Hodgson hugs Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto as the opposition secured top spot in Group D . The result meant Costa Rica finished top of Group D with seven points while England, already eliminated after defeats to Italy and Uruguay, ended bottom with one. With his side's exit already confirmed before the game, Hodgson made nine changes to his starting line-up to give other squad members an opportunity. He said: 'I thought they all did very well and I thought the whole back four was absolutely excellent. 'We restricted a team that has beaten Italy and Uruguay and topped the group, we restricted them to almost no chances. 'Ben Foster was very good behind and in midfield I thought we dominated it, we outplayed them in that area. We created goal chances. 'The only thing we didn't do is take them and that's a great disappointment.' New era: Luke Shaw was one of those making his World Cup bow as Hodgson made big changes . Veteran midfielder Frank Lampard, who captained the side, also felt England should have won the match. The 36-year-old said: 'It was a difficult game to approach. 'I think we did everything we could do. We showed a bit of character, we prepared right for the last two days. Everyone knows how tough it's been. 'It wasn't vintage but we had enough chances to win the game. I think we played some good stuff, bright stuff at times, and created enough chances to win.'

"By . Adam Crafton . Follow @@AdamCrafton_ . Former Manchester United manager David Moyes believes that Marouane Fellaini can emerge from the wreckage of a dismal first season at Old Trafford and evolve into an important player for the club. Moyes, who was sacked in April after enduring a traumatic first campaign in charge of Manchester United, signed Fellaini from the duo’s former side Everton on deadline day of last summer’s transfer window for £27.5million but the Belgian midfielder suffered a torrid debut season, making only 19 starts and failing to score a single goal. It is understood that United would be receptive to offers approaching £18million for Fellaini, with the former Everton midfielder emerging as a scapegoat for much of the debris of Moyes’ dismal season in charge. VIDEO Scroll down for funny music starring Kompany, Fellaini and Hazard . Red Devil: Marouane Fellaini celebrating his equaliser against Algeria on Tuesday . Debacle: Fellaini and David Moyes both had disastrous debut seasons at Manchester United . Sportsmail understands that Fellaini is determined to fight for his future at Old Trafford and would only contemplate a move if new manager Louis van Gaal was to indicate that there is no future for him at the club. Writing in his column for the Sunday Times, Moyes admitted that Fellaini found the ordeal a difficult experience: . ‘I felt for him over the criticism he took. He’s a shy boy, a humble boy, a quiet personality. Despite appearances - the hair makes him look like an extrovert - he’s a gentle, sometimes, emotional soul who is so desperate to do well and he was hurting because he wasn’t able to show his true self at the start of his United career.’ ‘Without going over old ground regarding last summer’s transfer window, I want to make two points. The last thing we wanted was to makie him my first signing as United manager and the only signing of the summer. ‘That was always going to bring too great a spotlight on him. But by the time we got to deadline day the club hadn’t been able to close a couple of big deals and there was no choice.’ Past life: The duo together during their more successful period at Everton . Mucking about: Fellaini playing with a sprinkler dring Belgium training ahead of their game with Russia . Fellaini demonstrated his qualities with a match-turning performance from the substitute’s bench in Belgium’s 2-1 World Cup win over Algeria, scoring with a crucial goal to lead his side to victory. ‘His size is such a threat to the opposition,’ Moyes continued,’He’s technically gifted, especially when it comes to chest control, and he’s formidable in the air - though, actually, I feel he should score more headers than he does. He can run. ‘He has brilliant fitness, a brilliant attitude. What we saw him do against Algeria was what I brought him to Manchester United for. 'He took time to settle at Old Trafford but in the final month of last season was becoming an influence, a different sort of player to the ones already there and one who was having an impact in games and helping produce goals. I feel he still has the potential to go on and be a good United player.’","Fellaini can recover from poor first season at Man Utd, according to Moyes .

"By . Mark Duell . The number of sex offenders barred from working with children has plunged by more than 75 per cent since vetting and barring legislation was changed three years ago, it has been claimed. Some 12,360 people were said to have been stopped from working with children in 2011 due to committing sexual offences against youngsters. This fell to 5,758 in 2012 and 2,800 in 2013, according to figures obtained by Labour using Freedom of Information laws. Ban: Some 12,360 people were said to have been stopped from working with children in 2011 due to committing sexual offences against youngsters (file picture) Other data released today shows the number of people being barred from working with children as a result of intelligence sharing and investigations by the police and Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) has fallen from 1,542 in 2011 to 471 in 2012 and to 351 in 2013. Labour has claimed changes made by Home Secretary Theresa May have played a significant role in these  reductions as her reforms made it harder to bar a convicted sex offender. Yvette Cooper, Shadow Home Secretary, said: ‘Theresa May was warned repeatedly that the new legislation left major loopholes in the system. This evidence shows those warnings were right.’ Meanwhile, data from the NSPCC suggests recorded sexual offences against children aged under 16 went up by 23 . per cent between 2004-05 and 2012-13, reported The Daily Telegraph. Miss Cooper went on: ‘Parents want to know that if someone has committed serious abuse against children or has a history of grooming or sexual abuse, they will not be allowed to work with children. ‘And schools, sports organisations and other groups need to be able to have confidence in the vetting and barring system. Child . protection is immensely important and it must not be put at risk . because of faulty legislation or failures in the Home Office system.’ Criticism: Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper . (left) claimed Home Secretary Theresa May (right) 'was warned repeatedly . that the new legislation left major loopholes in the system' Barring based on conviction was changed by legislation. For all but a handful of offences, only . those actually working with children or expressing a desire to work with . children are added to the barred list, while those in other occupations . are not added. A Home Office spokesman said: ‘It remains the case that anyone committing the most serious offences is still automatically barred from working closely and unsupervised with children. ‘The coalition Government introduced changes to the barring regime to apply common sense levels, but if someone applies to work with children any serious criminal records or police information are still considered when checks are carried out and, if necessary, they will be barred. 'Child protection is immensely important and it must not be put at risk because of faulty legislation or failures in the Home Office system' Yvette Cooper, Shadow Home Secretary . ‘The changes strike an appropriate balance between avoiding unnecessary intrusion into people's lives and ensuring that children and vulnerable groups are protected.’ An NSPCC spokesman said: ‘These figures add to our concerns that the pendulum may be swinging in the favour of abusers' rights rather than child protection. ‘The dramatic drop in the number of people being barred is concerning and the Disclosure and Barring Service needs to explain why this has happened in a transparent way to reassure that the current system is fit for purpose in terms of its contribution to protect children. ‘Given the number of sexual offences against children has not fallen in line with the number of people being barred, it would seem timely for a review of the implementation of the service to take place to ensure that children are being adequately protected.’","Vetting and barring legislation was changed three years ago .

"The decline of Steven Gerrard . The saddest sight of all was seeing Gerrard, a great England player, stranded in midfield and exposed. Either the system had to be modified to give him more support or Hodgson should have taken the harder decision to substitute him. Isolated: England captain Steven Gerrard . The hole in midfield . Hodgson complained that he didn't have too many experienced players which is why he invested so much in Gerrard - but it seemed one tournament too many.   Hodgson seemed to believe the attacking football hype and that England had enough to overwhelm the opposition. Yet there were gaps between the holding midfielders and the front four. A 4-3-3 with an extra midfielder, Ross Barkley or Jack Wilshere, would have been more conservative but restored the balance and supported Gerrard better. On the ball: Hodgson has to learn from the mistakes he made at World Cup . Absence of Ashley Cole . There was a logic to excluding Cole: England were going to play on the front foot, with full backs pushing on. Glen Johnson's cross for Rooney's goal was a perfect example - and it worked in patches. There were doubts that Cole could still do that. But full backs still need to defend. Leighton Baines was a threat going forward but he turned into a liability defensively. Struggle: England defender Leighton Baines . Lack of a game management . Hodgson has a reputation as a coaches' coach and is fascinated by tactics and how the game develops. Yet there seemed to be very little reaction to key problems. Uruguay had a clear plan for Lodeiro and Cavani to crowd Gerrard and make life uncomfortable for Jagielka and Cahill when they were in possession. England could have changed Gerrard's position to make Uruguay consider whether they really wanted to detail two players to crowd him - or change the system. Instead England stayed as they were and Gerrard was played out of the game. Disappointment: England were undone by defensive lapses against Italy and Uruguay . Hodgson's high risk strategy . The irony is that had Hodgson set up a team as he did at Euro 2012 - cautiously and ensuring they exceeded the sum of their parts - he would have been vilified and England would likely have two points. Almost everyone embraced the new model England. Yet England seemed to have one setting, which was all-out attack. If England are to improve in tournament football they will need to fuse the old model with the new one to create a better balance.","Steven Gerrard was left isolated in England midfield .

Natalie Critchley and her partner Richard Green, 22, called an ambulance to their £90,000 terraced home in Preston, Lancashire, after their daughter Lia Green began feeling unwell. Paramedics fought to save her life, but the toddler was pronounced dead on arrival at Royal Preston Hospital. Richard Green was . charged in October with her murder and later remanded in custody.

"By . Tamara Cohen . and Steve Doughty . Defence: Nick Clegg rebutted the clergy's charge that welfare cuts have been unfair . Nick Clegg has attacked high-ranking clergy for ‘exaggerating’ the effects of the Government’s welfare reforms. Amid a growing row between ministers and church leaders, the Deputy Prime Minister reacted angrily to claims the ‘safety net’ for the vulnerable had been removed. His comments came in response to an open letter signed by 27 of Britain’s 59 Anglican bishops which claimed hunger was a ‘national crisis’ and ministers had an ‘acute moral imperative’ to take action. In their letter, the bishops, joined by 15 other faith leaders, said people in Britain are ‘going hungry’ and that 500,000 have visited food banks since Easter. The letter came after a high-profile intervention by the Most Rev Vincent Nichols, leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales last week, who said the Coalition’s benefit savings had left people in a ‘destitute situation’ and reliant on food banks. And it was backed yesterday by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who agreed with his colleague’s remarks and said there had been a ‘swell of feeling’ about the issue among rank and file clergy. But Mr Clegg – who was asked about the issue by a food bank boss on his radio phone-in programme – rebutted the charge that welfare cuts have been unfair, saying failure to tackle the deficit would be irresponsible and that curbing welfare spending has to play a part. Speaking on LBC Radio, Mr Clegg told the boss of the House of Bread food bank in Stafford: ‘We inherited this massive black hole in the public finances. 'There’s nothing fair about simply saying we’re not going to deal with our debts. We’re going to let our children and our grandchildren do it.’ The Most Rev Vincent Nichols, leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, said the Coalition¿s benefit savings had left people in a 'destitute situation' and reliant on food banks . He added: ‘What we’ve done is try to make sure that the way we reform welfare and we reform the tax system encourages people into work. I have a huge amount of respect for Vincent Nichols. 'I like him, I’ve met him a number of times but I think to say that the safety net has been removed altogether is an exaggeration.’ Mr Clegg went on to attack those who ‘denigrate’ welfare reforms, saying Britain is spending ‘billions of pounds’ protecting people who need support. ‘But what we’re doing,’ he said, ‘is simplifying the system and sharpening the incentive to work. It is surely better to see people in work rather than on benefits.’ To back up their charge that Britain is the world’s seventh largest economy and yet ‘people are going hungry’, 42 clergymen, including 27 Anglican bishops, made a series of startling claims. The Mail’s Social Affairs Correspondent Steve Doughty examines whether they stack up: . CLAIM: 5,500 people were admitted to hospital for malnutrition last year. REALITY: The figure is correct, but malnutrition has very little to do with food shortage. In fact, the NHS advises that especially among children ‘malnutrition due to inadequate food intake in this country is rare, although it can occur if a child is being neglected or abused’. In adults, too, it is normally associated with another medical condition. Malnutrition includes obesity as well as the results of eating too little food. CLAIM: Half a million people have visited food banks in the UK since last Easter. REALITY: The Trussell Trust – which runs most food banks – said between last April and  December around 500,000 people were given three days’ worth of emergency food at its banks. However, the Trust told the Mail  yesterday that the figures refer to requests for food, not the number of individuals making them. So the bishops do not know if 500,000 people have visited food banks once, or 50,000 have gone ten times. CLAIM: One in five mothers report  regularly skipping meals to better feed  their children. REALITY: The assertion appears to be based on a two-year-old survey of questionable academic value, in which the Netmums website polled 2000 of its members. Cathy Ranson of Netmums said: ‘We are due to re-run the study shortly with the Trussell Trust and see whether the situation has improved or become worse. No one has been in touch with us about using [the survey].’ CLAIM: Tens of thousands of older people must ‘heat or eat’ each winter. REALITY: No-one doubts that life can be hard for poor pensioners, but there are fewer now than ever before. The latest Government poverty estimates say that the number of pensioners below the official poverty line, 60 per cent of average income, dropped in 2011/12 by 100,000 from the previous year. There were 1.9million pensioners considered poor, down from 2.8million in 1998/99. CLAIM: Wages have stayed flat while food prices have gone up 30 per cent over the past five years. REALITY: Food prices in real terms – after inflation is taken into account – were 12 per cent higher last summer than in 2007. Until last year, benefits were raised every year strictly in line with inflation. Whitehall estimates say that the poorest fifth of all families spent 16.6 per cent of their income on food and drink in  2011, almost exactly the same as the 16.8  per cent they spent in the year the recession struck, 2008. CLAIM: Over half of people using food banks have been put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures in the benefit system. REALITY: The Trussell Trust said in October that 19 per cent of its clients between April and September needed food because of benefit changes. A further 35 per cent of clients said they needed food because of delays in benefit payments, but these were nothing to do with recent welfare reforms. Archbishop Welby, the leader of the world’s 80million Anglicans, said yesterday that the Church was well-placed to comment on welfare as it has people working ‘on the ground’ all over the country. He said: ‘It is from the upswell of feeling that they are reporting that sense that they’re seeing in their own church communities, as priests, as ministers, as pastors, in whichever community that these letters and the comments of Cardinal Nichols are coming. And I’m entirely with him.’ Deputy Prime Minister yesterday challenged Nigel Farage to a debate on whether Britain should leave the EU. In a high-risk move, Nick Clegg said he plans to launch an ‘aggressive’ defence of the EU. But some Lib Dem insiders fear the party could be pushed into fifth place in the Euro elections on May 22, behind Mr Farage’s Ukip and even the Greens. Ukip last night suggested that David Cameron and Ed Miliband should be invited to participate as well. Mr Farage is expected to accept the challenge when he responds to Mr Clegg’s offer today. But it emerged last night that a number of points in the bishops’ letter appeared to be based on questionable information. For example, a claim that ‘one in five mothers report regularly skipping meals to better feed their children’ appears to have come from a two-year-old poll by Netmums. And while the letter claimed that ‘over half of people using food banks’ had been ‘put in that situation by cutbacks to and failures of the benefits system’, a study found that only 19 per cent of those using food banks said they were doing so because of benefits changes. Last week Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, told Radio 4’s Today Programme: ‘There are many cases where people are left without benefits, without any support for sometimes weeks on end. ‘The voices I hear express anger and despair. Something is going seriously wrong when, in a country as affluent as ours, there are people in that destitute situation depending on food banks.’ But a spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said there was no robust evidence that welfare reforms were increasing food bank use. They added: ‘It’s wrong to talk of removing a safety net when we’re spending £94billion a year on working age benefits and supporting millions of people.’ And a Number 10 spokesman said: ‘Of course many families are facing tough times as a result of the worst recession in a century. ‘That’s why our welfare reforms are about building a country where people are not trapped in a cycle of dependency but are able to get on, stand on their own two feet and build a better life for themselves and their family.’","Deputy PM rebuts clergy claims about poverty in the UK .

"By . Kate Lyons . UK retail giant Marks & Spencer is set to open its first Australian store this year. The $13billion British chain will expand Down Under, following the lead of Zara and Topshop, which opened in the country in 2011 and 2012 respectively and Sweden’s H&M and Japan’s Uniqlo, due to open in 2014. M&S executives have already appointed two directors to head up the Australian arm of the business with plans to launch smaller scale shops rather than huge department stores. Headed Down Under: Marks and Spencer are entering the Australian retail market later this year. They are known for their lavish advertising campaigns, including this one starring Helen Mirrren (in white and black check coat, front right) These will measure approximately 2,000 square metres, about a fifth of the size of their usual footfall or Australian department stores Myer and David Jones. In a small-format store, fashion and beauty take up approximately 80 per cent of floor space, with food accounting for the remaining 20 per cent. The directors are Anthony Clarke, an assistant company secretary of the M&S Group parent company in the UK, and Melissa Lovell, a corporate lawyer at oil and gas company Santos. Heading Down Under: UK retail giant, Marks & Spencer are set to open a store in Australia this year . Both are employed by Marks & Spencer (Australia) Pty Ltd, a corporate entity that has been inactive for almost seven years. It is understood that agents for the retailer are currently searching for a space in Sydney and have examined several sites on George Street in the centre of the city. The retailer has identified international expansion as a key goal. It currently has more than 440 stores operating in more than 50 territories across Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Last year, the company announced plans to more than double the number of stores in India from 36 to 80 by 2016. It already has 16 outlets in Hong Kong and 10 in Singapore, and has been looking to enter the Australian market for some time. Despite multimillion pound advertising campaigns fronted by models and stars such as Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Helen Mirren, the company has been struggling for some time. In the last three years, it has repeatedly reported falling sales of general merchandise, which includes clothing and homewares, while food sales remain strong. M&S reported its pre-tax profits for the first half of 2013 were down 9 per cent compare to the previous year, falling from £289.5million to £261.1million. In December, City broker UBS downgraded its UK profit forecasts for M&S – a move which saw the value of M&S shares slump by 10.8p to 441.5p, knocking £178million off its stock market value in a single day.","Sydney store to open after success of M&S in Asia, Europe, Middle East .

"By . Sophie Borland . and Amie Keeley . Tragedy: Averil Hart starved herself to death . A gifted student died from anorexia at 19 after a string of failings by GPs and specialists. Averil Hart was found collapsed  at her university flat by a cleaner after becoming so weak she could barely stand. When she died it is thought her weight had dropped to below six stone. Averil’s family say she was supposed to have been in the care of specialist medical staff, and should not have been allowed to starve herself to death. They have also accused NHS bosses of altering her medical records after her death, possibly as part of a cover-up. Averil first developed the illness at 17, while she was doing her A-levels. She  became so ill she was admitted to hospital and stayed there for ten months. She recovered well and her parents agreed to let her go to the University of East Anglia in Norwich, not far from the family home in Colchester, Essex, to do a degree in English and creative writing. Doctors reassured the family she would be closely monitored by GPs at the university as well as by a specialist eating disorders team. But she was placed under the care of a junior trainee psychologist who had no experience of  anorexia, her parents claim. Despite seeing her six times a week, he failed to realise she was rapidly losing weight. By the time her father Nicholas, 55, and older sister Imogen, 27,  visited her one weekend last November she was so weak she slurred her words as if drunk. Too week to stand: The gifted student was found collapsed by a cleaner while she was studying at the University of East Anglia . They drove home in tears and made an emergency call to Averil’s previous doctor who promised to send one of the NHS specialists nearby to check on her. But nothing was done and a few weeks later she was found unconscious. She slipped into a coma and died a few days later on December 15, 2012. Her case is one of 14 highlighted by the Patients’ Association today in a report on poor NHS care. The charity warned that, too often, the health service forgets that ‘care and compassion should be at the heart of what staff do’. Averil’s mother Miranda, 54, told the . Patients’ Association the family were promised the teenager would have . weekly check-ups from an NHS psychologist and would be weighed, have her . blood pressure checked and mental well-being assessed. Yet she was left . in the care of a junior psychologist who had no experience of eating . disorders and weighed her only three times. Forgotten treatment: Olivia Burns, 84, was admitted to Tameside General Hospital with terminal lung cancer after her family were told she had been put on the Liverpool Care Pathway . The family also discovered that a manager at the NHS’s Norfolk community eating disorders team made ‘additional notes’ on her file two weeks after her death which, they said, was ‘highly questionable’. They have made a formal complaint to the NHS and are calling for an independent inquiry. In another case, the family of Olive Burns, 84, were told she had been placed on the Liverpool Care Pathway when staff had in fact forgotten to treat her on a busy weekend. She had been admitted to Tameside Hospital, Greater Manchester, with terminal lung cancer shortly before her death last year. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The shocking cases in this report defy belief and make me all the more determined to make compassionate care the beginning, middle and end of everything the NHS does.’ The NHS trusts in charge of Averil’s care offered their ‘sincerest apologies’ and said a formal investigation had been launched. A Tameside Hospital spokesman said: ‘On occasions in the past, the care we offered our patients did not meet the standards they rightly expected and for this we are truly sorry. We are now on a journey of improvement.’","Averil Hart was found collapsed at university, so weak she could not stand .

"By . Damien Gayle . A man's life was saved by Facebook when his online friends raised the alarm after noticing that he hadn't made his usual updates to a page he runs. Facebook friends of John Clark, from Dunston, Gateshead, started to worry when he failed to update a local news and nostalgia group on the social networking website. They called police, and when officers arrived at his home, they found the 55-year-old slumped on the floor after suffering a suspected stroke. Helps people connect: John Clark, from Dunston, Gateshead, was saved when his online friends raised the alarm after noticing that he hadn't made his usual updates to a Facebook page he runs . Mr Clark was rushed to hospital and thanks to the concern and help of his friends it is now hoped that he will make a full recovery. Dave Scott, who also lives in Dunston, was one of those who raised the alarm. He said regular users of the Dunston When I Was a Bairn Then & Now group began to get worried when they realised Mr Clark had not made his usual Facebook posts. 'He had signed off on Saturday night, but he always posts the Lottery numbers later on,' said Mr Scott. 'He didn't add anything, and no-one could get in touch with him on Sunday or Monday. It was totally out of character as he always says if he is going away for a few days.' Gez Hampton, of Cambridge, was among the first to become concerned her friend had not been online, but it was Yvonne Somerville of Dipton, County Durham, who warned Mr Scott. He went to visit Mr Clark at home to see if his friend was okay. 'I went round to his house and knocked but there was no answer,' said Mr Scott. 'I then tried his mobile number but again there was nothing. 'His friends said he had suffered a stroke before and they were really concerned. We then decided to involve the police.' After they were told about Mr Clark's history of strokes, police officers broke into his home. 'They found him lying on the floor,' said Mr Scott. 'They told me he was quite cold already. You wonder what he would have been like if they had waited longer.' Virtual community: Regular users of the Dunston When I Was a Bairn Then & Now group began to get worried when they realised Mr Clark had not made his usual Facebook posts. It is believed that Mr Clark suffered a stroke at home and fallen, hurting his back. He is still receiving treatment at Gateshead's Queen Elizabeth hospital where he is on the stoke ward. Mr Scott has been to visit his friend and said the suspected stroke has left him numb on one side and struggling to swallow. 'He is full of morphine but he did come round and we had a chat,' he said. 'All he wanted was his laptop to get onto the site to natter and thank everyone for their good wishes and concern. 'He remembers having pains in his neck through Saturday night and going downstairs for medication. 'He remembers lying on the stone floor for a long time, and then he must have got up and tried to move and slid behind the sofa and got trapped there until the police found him. 'I think we have been very lucky to have discovered him when we did.' A police spokesman confirmed they had received reports of concern for a 55-year-old man at 5.10pm on Monday evening. 'Officers attended the scene and the man was taken to hospital complaining of back pains,' a spokesman said.","Friends of John Clark started to worry when he failed to update group .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Sick: This picture shows the selfie taken by heroin addict Kirsty Edmondson - as former history teacher Kenneth Chapman lay murdered beneath her . This picture shows the shocking selfie taken by a heroin addict - as a former history teacher lay dead beneath her after he was murdered by her boyfriend. Kirsty Edmondson, 23, and 35-year old Christopher Sawyers used mobiles phones to take 'trophy photos' and had sex with each other in Kenneth Chapman's bed whilst they lived with his corpse for up to a week. In this image, released with the consent of Mr Chapman's family, the victim's body was in the room as Edmondson took the photograph, although he can not be seen. Other pictures have not been released for reasons of public decency. During their trial, Manchester Crown Court was told that Sawyers had injected Mr Chapman with a fatal dose of heroin to 'off him', and take his money to buy more drugs. The court heard how the pair behaved like 'vultures around a corpse' stealing the victim's TV and computer and raiding his bank account in a string of online frauds. They even texted the victim's sister pretending to be 47-year old Scotsman Chapman asking if she could lend him £75. Police were called in after concerns about the victim's welfare and found him dead at his flat in Eccles, Greater Manchester.  Tests showed he had been injected with a lethal dose of heroin. It emerged Sawyers had realised there was 'money to be made out of murder' after he got away with killing a former accountant with the same drug - 17 months before Chapman's death. After the latest killing he had shown one of the selfie photos to his friends saying: 'Look at this. I will show you a photo of a corpse.' In another bragging outburst he declared: 'I'm a serial killer now.' Career criminal Sawyers was convicted of murder and manslaughter and jailed for life with a minimum recommendation he serve 33 years. Guilty: Christopher Sawyers (left) was found guilty of the murder of Mr Chapman. Edmondson (right) was cleared of murder but  jailed for three years after she admitted two charges of theft and nine of fraud . He . admitted two thefts and seven fraud charges. Edmondson was jailed for . three years after she admitted two charges of theft and nine of fraud. She wept as she was cleared of murder. At . Manchester Crown Court the judge Mr Justice Timothy Holroyde said: 'A . phrase from the trial springs to mind - the pair of you were ""like . vultures around a corpse"". 'Within . a very short time you were stripping Kenneth Chapman of what he owned, . selling it for what you could get and reducing the flat which had been . so kept and tidy to a scene of disorder and despoliation. Victim: Former history teacher . Kenneth Chapman was injected with a fatal dose of heroin by Christopher Sawyers . 'Anyone . who doubted the malign and destructive effects of the misuse of class A . drugs should have sat and listened to the evidence in this trial. 'Those . who have sat and listened have heard evidence that vividly showed the . utter degradation wrought upon those who had become addicted to such . drugs. 'It has been . strikingly apparent throughout as indeed both defendants have frankly . acknowledged, that their use of Class A controlled drugs had brought . them to the state in which their wholly dominant and overriding concern . was getting their next fix however they could. 'Kirsty Edmondson in two sentences in her . evidence summed it up: ""drugs change your life and change your morals"", . and ""smackheads don't really have consciences"". He told Sawyers: 'You wanted to get your hands on everything Kenneth Chapman had, which you believed was substantial. When the opportunity arose, you took it quickly and ruthlessly.' After the case Chapman's sister Moreen Sinclair said: 'The only comfort we draw from this is that others can be safe from Christopher Sawyers in the future. 'However, we can take no comfort in the lenience of the sentence given to Kirsty Edmondson who, in our eyes, abused the kindness that was shown to her by Ken. I still find it difficult to believe it has happened and Ken is gone. 'My family were still grieving the loss of our mother and now we have to deal with Ken's death. Since he has died I have had difficulty sleeping and as a result it has affected my work meaning I can no longer work shifts. 'His death has had a big impact on my son's life. They were very close. Paul has become depressed and has had medical attention. He also had to have six weeks off work since he passed away. 'Since his death I have received cards from people offering their condolences and saying how shocked they are. One from his teachers from the high school who were shocked saying he was a nice guy.' Scene: Police were called in after concerns about the victim's welfare and found him dead at his flat in Eccles, Greater Manchester (pictured) Detective . Chief Inspector Sarah Jones from Greater Manchester Police said: . 'Christopher Sawyers deliberately injected Kenneth Chapman with a fatal . dose of heroin for one reason and one reason only: greed. 'It . is our belief that he killed him in order to financially benefit from . his death so that together with Kirsty Edmondson, they could continue to . buy heroin. 'There is . little doubt in my mind that the grip heroin had on them caused them to . continue to periodically live with the dead body of Kenneth Chapman for . in excess of a week in order to steal from him without ever giving a . thought to the appalling nature of their crimes.' During . the trial the jury was told how Mr Chapman - a former soldier - had . been a keen athlete and a member of a running club. He taught A level . and GCSE history at Rivington and Blackrod High School in Chorley, . Lancashire. However, in 2007 he was disgraced when he went to prison for two and a half years for grooming a schoolgirl for sex in an internet chatroom. He lost his teaching job and after his release met Edmondson when he became embroiled in the drugs scene and began associating with call girls for company. Callous: Giving evidence Edmondson (left) told the court 'smackheads don't really have consciences', while the court heard how she and Sawyer (right) had treated Mr Chapman's home as their 'exclusive preserve' He . made £18,000 from the sale of his house and moved into rented . accommodation and was believed to be contemplating a permanent move back . to Berwick-upon-Tweed, Scotland after visiting his family over . Christmas last year. But . tragedy struck on December 28 2013 after he met up with Edmondson and . Sawyers and they went back to his flat where they took drugs. When the . victim fell unconscious he was administered with a lethal dose of heroin. Mr . Tony Cross QC prosecuting said: 'Christopher Sawyers and Kirsty . Edmondson treated Kenneth Chapman's home and property as their exclusive . preserve. Keen athlete Kenneth Chapman had been a soldier before teaching A level and GCSE history at Rivington and . Blackrod High School in Chorley, Lancashire. In 2007 he was jailed for two and a half years after he admitted grooming a schoolgirl for . sex in an internet chatroom. He was also placed indefinitely onto the sex offenders' register and banned from ever working with children again. He was forced to resign from his teaching job and after his release from prison met Kirsty Edmondson, soon becoming embroiled in the local drugs scene and associating with call . girls for company. He made . £18,000 from the sale of his house and moved into rented accommodation. He was believed to be contemplating a permanent move back to . Berwick-upon-Tweed, Scotland after visiting his family over Christmas . last year, only to be administered with the lethal dose of heroin by Christopher Sawyers on December 28, 2013. 'In . the 15 days between the death of Mr Chapman and the discovery of his . body these two defendants began to steal what they could from him - his . TV, computer and from his bank account to purchase goods using a variety . of different fraudulent methods. 'They . even texting his sister pretending to be him to borrow money. These . were callous and despicable actions. They began within hours of Kenneth . Chapman's death and continued for days as the two defendants lived in . the flat carrying on their lives whilst Mr Chapman lay dead. 'So . twisted were their actions that they even took selfies of them enjoying . themselves in the very same room as the cadaver. They took ""selfies"" in . the very room where he lay rotting. These photos are trophy photos - . two people proud of their work. 'They had sex in his bed and filmed it. They stole and committed fraud. Attempts were made to order goods via Amazon, top up mobile phones and pay forged cheques into Sawyers' bank account. 'This was how they lived their lives - using his home, car and property as their own. They did so because as Christopher Sawyers was later to tell witnesses - he wanted to 'off' him. To kill him. To end his life.' Less than an hour after Mr Chapman is believed to have been killed, the pair were caught on CCTV driving around Salford in his car where they also attempted to withdraw £100 from his bank account. The couple moved out of the property on January 3 and Mr Chapman's body was found on January 12. Police later spoke to a witness who said she had overheard overheard Sawyers talking to Edmondson about Chapman saying: 'We can't keep taking him for bits, we need to see him off. This is taking too long, we need to OD him.' A Home Office pathologist later revealed that the morphine concentration in Chapman's body was the highest he had ever encountered in deaths from misuse of heroin. The court heard Sawyer was also responsible for the death of former accountant Peter Clark, 60, who also drifted in the Manchester drugs scene. He suffered a fatal collapse whilst he and Sawyers were taking heroin at a house in Ancoats, Manchester on July 5 2012. He was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. Inquiries revealed he used Mr Clark's phone and stole cash from his wallet.","Kirsty Edmondson and Christopher Sawyers took 'trophy photos' after the death of Kenneth Chapman, as his body lay in the room .

"By . Mark Prigg . It can open its jaw 180 degrees, and fire it like a beartrap at the ground to launch itself into the air. It also backs a venomous sting - and is invading the US. The giant Trap-jaw ants are spreading across the US, researchers warned today. Scroll down for video . Most trap-jaw ants belong to the genus Odontomachus, named for their mandibles, or mouthparts, which are capable of opening 180 degrees. There are four species of trap-jaw ants native to the United States. Sorger and her co-authors were interested in the spread of an invasive and particularly aggressive species from South America called Odontomachus haematodus, which was first unofficially recorded in Alabama in 1956. Measuring upto 9.5mm long, they are commonly called trap-jaw ants due to their elongate mandibles, which can be opened to 180°, then snapped rapidly together on prey. These ants are amazing in their ability to control and time the mandibular movement. When necessary, an ant can forcibly close the mandibles against a surface or other organism and actually propel itself away for up to several inches . The research was done by scientists at North Carolina State University, the Mississippi Entomological Museum, the University of California, Davis and Archbold Biological Station. 'The fact that some of these species are spreading is interesting, in part, because these giant ants have managed to expand their territory without anyone noticing,' says Magdalena Sorger of North Carolina State and co-author of a paper describing the ant species. 'We know very little about these ants, including how they interact with native ant species in the areas they’re invading.' There are four species of trap-jaw ants native to the United States. Sorger and her co-authors were interested in the spread of an invasive and particularly aggressive species from South America called Odontomachus haematodus. Native to South America, haematodus was first unofficially recorded in Alabama in 1956. The Mandibles of a Malagasy Trap-jaw Ant - which are strong enough to throw the animal in the air . But the researchers found that the species has now spread across the Gulf Coast, at least as far east as Pensacola, Florida. 'Haemotodus is particularly interesting because it is larger and more aggressive than other trap-jaw ants in the United States,' Sorger says. As recently as a few years ago, ruginodis was thought to be confined to the Orlando region, and points south. 'I found ruginodis in landscaped areas near buildings – outside a mall, outside my hotel – usually in the mulch underneath hedges,' Sorger says. The giant trap-jaw ants are spreading across the US, researchers warned today. But now Sorger has confirmed a record of ruginodis more than a hundred miles north of Orlando, in Gainesville. 'The species could have traveled even farther than Gainesville, but no one has looked for it.' But not all of the trap-jaw species are on the move. Sorger also studies O. relictus, a species that is found only in endangered scrub habitat on central Florida’s ancient sand ridges. Sorger found that relictus ants on separate ridges displayed different behaviors and had distinct genetic profiles – indicating that they may have evolved into separate species. 'If these two O. relictus populations are, in fact, distinct species, it would make them the rarest ants in North America,' Sorger says. 'I’m hoping to resolve this question soon, via more genetic analyses.'","Trap-jaw ant can open its jaw 180 degrees .

"By . Mia De Graaf . The Japanese Prime Minister has apologised to a female assembly member who was told to 'hurry up and get married' during a debate on sexism. Ayaka Shiomura, 35, was giving a speech on women in the workplace last Wednesday when she was interrupted by a slew of misoginist taunts from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Her opposition counterpart, Akihiro Suzuki, 51, jeered 'hurry up and get married' before shouting: 'can't you give birth?' Apology: Akihiro Suzuki (right) is seen bowing in apology to opposition lawmaker Ayaka Shiomura. Mr Suzuki, a member of Japan's ruling party, sparked outrage after heckling Ms Shiomura with sexist taunts . Outrage: Mr Suzuki has now resigned over his taunts, shouting 'hurry up and get married' and 'can't you give birth?'. His words sparked outrage across the nation, with 70,000 people petitioning for his resignation . It has come as a major embarrassment to the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is driving a push to get more women in work. Yesterday, after days of denials, Mr Suzuki formally apologised and resigned from his post. Mr Abe also apologised. Since the apology, Mr Suzuki's office has . been pelted with eggs as he continues to face an onslaught of criticism . on social media. Embarrassment: Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, running a drive to get more women in work, has also apologised . Ms Shiomura, a lawmaker in the opposing Your Party, had been asking leading Tokyo business figures about measures to help working mothers when she was heckled. The taunts drew laughter from other members of the assembly, reports claim. Ms Shiomura, who is not married, was seen wiping away tears as she continued with her questioning. The incident sparked outrage, with 70,000 people singing a petition for the hecklers to be punished. Finally, on Monday, he bowed in apology to Ms Shiomura in front of reporters. He said: 'I did not make these remarks out of any intention to insult lawmaker Shiomura. 'I recognise that there are women who want to get married and can't, and those who want to have children and can't. 'My comments were lacking in concern towards people like that. 'I deeply apologise for and regret that a comment I made set off such a huge fuss.' Despite accepting the apology as 'a mark of progress', Ms Shiomura said he was 'a bit too late'. Meanwhile, many leading male politicians claim she deserved the taunts because she is still single.","Ayaka Shiomura, 35, interrupted by members of leading party during debate .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . The differing standards of hotel accommodation allocated to the BBC World Cup pundits in Rio isn’t going to help build much team spirit among the all-star cast. Clarence Seedorf is staying in the grandest of Rio’s hotels, the Copacabana Palace, along with FIFA president Sepp Blatter and the FIFA ExCo, while Thierry Henry and his personal trainer, plus Rio Ferdinand, are in the equally plush Sofitel on Copacabana. Meanwhile Gary Lineker, Alan Shearer and Alan Hansen, despite being the mainstay of the BBC’s domestic coverage on Match of the Day, are in a very modest hotel nearby, along with the rest of the Beeb’s football foot soldiers. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Ashton and Sale with fans on the Copacabana beach . Disparity: Seedorf and Henry (left) are in luxury while other BBC pundits stay in more modest surroundings . Seedorf is said to be paying for his own accommodation, while Henry is footing the bill for the trainer keeping him fit for his Major League Soccer return. But Ferdinand and Henry being given a higher standard of hotel than the rest was part of their contractual agreement. A BBC spokesman said: ‘We are staying in a very competitively priced hotel close to our production base, as befits a frugal BBC. ‘There is no problem among the talent and we have the best team spirit I can remember at a major tournament.’ Mind you, England said the same and look what happened to them. David Moyes has recovered sufficiently from the trauma of losing his job at Manchester United after less than a season to take a pundit role for part of the World Cup. Return: Moyes will join Richard Keys and Andy Gray as a pundit for BeIn Sports in Doha for one week . But Moyes, who turned down advances from the BBC and ITV earlier in the year because he was concerned about a backlash from United fans, has chosen to go to Doha rather than Rio. He will be a studio analyst for BeIn Sport for a week, even if it means having to work with Richard Keys and Andy Gray. A spat broke out between the BBC’s Dan Roan and Sky’s Nick Collins as to who should ask the first question in Roy Hodgson’s final broadcast media conference in Rio. It was Roan’s turn in the rotation agreement with ITV and Sky, but Collins argued he had never had that opportunity when Hodgson was in the chair. After 20 minutes of wrangling they agreed to toss a coin, but before that happened Hodgson and captain Steven Gerrard came into the room. Roan and Collins both put up a hand for the microphone and the FA chose Sky to go first. Lucky Everton manager Roberto Martinez has kept his media roles at the World Cup despite Sports Agenda revealing his accreditation pass was withdrawn by FIFA after he blatantly broke the strict non-transferable rule by giving it to someone else to gain entry to Holland training. American TV network ESPN, who have Martinez as one of their pundits, say he will be working from their production studios in Rio for which he only needs an ESPN pass to gain entry. The Times said Martinez would continue as one of their columnists. Lucky: Martinez has kept his jobs with ESPN and The Times despite being banned from World Cup stadiums . Dein shows FA the way . The England party will be retreating en masse from Brazil tonight with none of Roy Hodgson’s coaching staff staying on at the tournament to see what they might learn. Their brief stay in Brazil contrasts with that of former FA vice-chairman David Dein, who will be watching his 13th game of the World Cup when England take on Costa Rica and intends to see 25 games in all. Dein, spotted boarding a private jet at Sao Paulo, is wealthy enough to have fast planes at his disposal taking him from game to game. But surely the FA should have found an administrator keen enough on football to embrace the World Cup in the same way. Such a figure would have been far more useful in their delegation than the blazers who were just here for a jolly. Leighton Baines, who has replaced Ashley Cole as England’s left back, might end up doing the same at Chelsea. Replacement: Baines (lef) has taken Cole's place for England, and Mourinho wants him at Chelsea as well . Stamford Bridge boss Jose Mourinho has made it clear on his summer travels that he has Baines on his radar, although that was before the Everton defender had a nightmare World Cup, especially in the opening defeat by Italy.","Seedorf staying in the Copocabana Palace, Henry in the Sofitel .

"By . Laura Clark, Education Correspondent . A failing school has been turned around just 18 months after a new head took over following the sacking of all its governors by Education Secretary Michael Gove. Downhills Primary was forcibly removed from council control and turned into an academy run by an outside sponsor after years of underperformance. The school in Haringey, North London, became a focal point of resistance to Mr Gove’s education reforms after union activists bitterly opposed attempts to hand it to an academy operator. New broom: Principal Kirstie Fulthorpe, pictured with some of her pupils, took over the school 18 months ago . A Save Downhills campaign – fronted by some parents and governors – was backed by the controversial campaign group the Anti Academies Alliance and the National Union of Teachers. Now Ofsted has reported that the school it became – the Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane – is ‘good’ with ‘outstanding’ leadership. In their report, inspectors said: ‘Pupils’ progress has improved rapidly since the academy opened in 2012. Leaders have brought about considerable improvements in teaching, behaviour and achievement because of very high expectations.’ It said that since the academy had opened pupils’ progress has accelerated in all year groups. The report noted that pupils’ results were still well below national averages but were improving. Battle: Union activists fought Michael Gove's plans for the school in the courts . It marks a dramatic turnaround on Downhills’ last full inspection in January 2012 which put the school in special measures – meaning it needed urgent action to turn it round – and heavily criticised leadership and teaching. Inspectors concluded that ‘the persons responsible for leading, managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement’. And they said that ‘teaching over time has failed to provide sufficient levels of challenge for pupils to make adequate progress in reading, writing and mathematics’. Despite the report, campaigners challenged Mr Gove’s attempt to turn the school into an academy through the courts. The claim was rejected and the school became an academy under the control of the Harris academy chain in September 2012, with its new principal Kirstie Fulthorpe taking up her post in December 2012. A large number of teachers left but only a handful of parents withdrew their children. Attempts to block the takeover infuriated Mr Gove who branded opponents ‘ideologues who are happy with failure – the enemies of promise’. ‘It’s the bigoted backward bankrupt ideology of a Left-wing establishment that perpetuates division and denies opportunity. And it’s an ideology that’s been proven wrong time and time again,’ he declared. The latest Ofsted report will be seen as vindication of his insistence the school be taken over. The Harris chain was founded by the carpets tycoon Lord Harris of Peckham. Its chief executive is Sir Daniel Moynihan who said he was delighted by the academy’s progress. He added: ‘What the critics need to remember is that if a school is failing it means the children are failing and are not secondary-ready, and that cannot be allowed to continue.’ Turnaround: The school in north London, pictured before it was taken over, had been in special measures . The school previously came out of special measures in 2005 but just a few years later was told it required ‘significant improvement’. After it was once again placed in special measures in 2012, Mr Gove ordered the sacking of the governors, to be replaced by an interim board selected by the Department for Education (DfE). Although the power to remove a governing body had existed for some time, it was never used by the previous Labour government. The DfE said the power was not used lightly. Miss Fulthorpe said her key changes were to improve teaching and communication with parents, including having Somali and Turkish interpreters at parents’ evenings. She added that the school now has a 20-name waiting list for reception places. A DfE spokesman said: ‘Under local authority control this school had been failing hundreds of pupils for year after year. ‘Such a swift and impressive turnaround proves that partnering with a high-quality academy sponsor is the best way to improve failing schools.’ What are academies? What are free schools? What do academies and free schools have in common?","Downhills Primary removed from control of Haringey Council, north London .

"By . Associated Press . Frank Lloyd Wright's 1927 vision of a proper service station had two fireplaces, a second-floor observation room, eye-catching copper spires and separate restrooms for the comfort of travelers increasingly hitting the road rather than rails. The architect never saw his idea leave the drawing board after demanding an architectural fee equal to the cost of building it. But on Friday, the Buffalo Transportation/Pierce-Arrow Museum cut the ribbon on the Wright-designed station it built from the plans, with Wright's own convertible parked out front as if awaiting a fill-up. The Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum's Frank Lloyd Wright-designed filling station with his very own car (pictured) parked outside . The Buffalo Transportation Pierce-Arrow Museum's Frank Lloyd Wright-designed filling station opened on Friday . 'In 1927, you had a gas pump and an outhouse,' museum founder James Sandoro said, contrasting the filling stations of the times with the luxury version Wright designed for a nearby Buffalo intersection. The non-working station was built inside a 40,000-square-foot addition to the museum to protect it and its visitors from the elements. Two 45-foot copper poles that Wright called totems rise from the floor through a copper cantilevered roof typical of Wright designs. To avoid pump islands, Wright proposed putting the gas overhead in gravity-fed tanks, a setup - especially with fireplaces underneath - that wouldn't pass safety codes today. In his writings, Wright called his station 'an ornament to the pavement,' said Sandoro, who acquired the rights to build it 11 years ago from the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation in Scottsdale, Arizona. Eventually, Wright would design and help build one working filling station, in Cloquet, Minnesota. The station, opened in 1958 with a glass-walled observation lounge and copper canopy similar to what Wright envisioned 30 years earlier, remains open today. The gas stations equipped with an upper observation deck and separate restrooms . he filling station never made it off the drawing board during the architect's lifetime . Construction of the Buffalo filling station was praised by tourism officials who see it as a draw for both fans of Wright, who died in 1959, and car buffs. The museum, which received $6.3 million from New York state for the expansion, is filled with transportation artifacts and also honors the Buffalo-made Pierce-Arrow automobile that in the early 1900s served as the official car of the White House. 'It is one big cog in our economic development wheel,' Buffalo Niagara Partnership President Dottie Gallagher-Cohen said. Wright's 1929 L-29 Cord Cabriolet is on loan from the Auburn, Cord Duesenberg Museum in Auburn, Indiana. The filling station is the third Wright structure to be built in Buffalo using designs not realized during his lifetime. The Blue Sky Mausoleum, believed designed in the mid-1920s, opened in Forest Lawn Cemetery in 2004, and the Fontana Boathouse, designed in 1905, opened in 2007.","The architect never saw his idea leave the drawing board after demanding an architectural fee equal to the cost of building it .

"By . Corey Charlton . A rare Ferrari has become the second most expensive car sold at auction in Britain after it fetched a whopping £10.75 million. The Ferrari 375-Plus was the Italians’ ultimate weapon in the 1954 World Sportscar Championship. Just five were ever made and this model competed at Le Mans, Silverstone and the Mille Miglia races. This Ferrari is now the second most expensive car sold at auction in Britain after it fetched £10.75 million on Friday . The now record breaking and extremely expensive Ferrari pictured at break-neck speed on the track at Mille Miglia in 1954 - it was later stolen while in storage . But in 1986 a trailer containing the Ferrari, which was missing some major parts and the engine, was stolen, kicking off a 25-year tale involving the FBI, Interpol and, most recently, lawyers. After years of legal wrangling, the car was put up at auction at Bonham’s Goodwood Festival of Speed auction on Friday. The car, offered without a reserve, was the star lot with collectors from around the world registering their interest in it. Bidding started at £2 million and quickly increased as potential buyers battled it out in the auction room. The Ferrari was the Italians' ultimate weapon in the 1954 World Sportscar Championship, with only five models ever made - four for the track and one for the road . The Ferrari was capable of doing 0-60mph in just four seconds and 60 years ago could hit a top speed of 186mph - it was used to devastating effect on the track . The Ferrari 375-Plus was the ultimate weapon in the 1954 World Sportscar Championship, with this model competing at Le Mans, Silverstone and Mille Miglia . On the left, the rare Ferrari 375 Plus waits to set off at Mille Miglia in Italy in 1954, while on the right it is pictured flying down a straight at the 1954 Le Mans race . Offers were soon going up in £250,000 increments with the hammer eventually going down at £9.6 million with applause around the auction room. With a buyers premium and VAT, the new owner ended up paying a massive £10.75 million. This topped the £5 million paid for a road car in public in Britain, when an American bought a Bentley Blower at the same auction in 2012. It is now the third most expensive car ever sold at auction and the second most expensive in Britain. It follows the massive £19 million paid for a classic Formula 1 Mercedes-Benz in July last year, which also set a world record. The 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 was the race car driven by five-time F1 world champion Juan Manuel Fangio when he clinched his second title in 1954. The sale is the latest chapter in an incredible history for the 1954 Ferrari 375 Plus, which was the fastest road car of its day. Under the bonnet was a 4.9-litre which developed a staggering 330bhp. The Ferrari was capable of 0-60mph in just four seconds and could hit a top speed of 186mph - 60 years ago. But in 1957, the car was damaged by fire and sold by its owner to a nuclear physicist called Karl Kleve. The scientist kept the car in his massive collection in Ohio but in 1986 a trailer containing the Ferrari was stolen. The thieves, who were later jailed, sold the car to a broker in Atlanta who, in 1989, sold the car to Belgian racing driver Jacques Swaters. Mr Swaters, a close friend of Enzo Ferrari, was initially unaware the Ferrari had been stolen and had it restored in Modena, Italy. Despite the theft and recovery, the Ferrari was never returned to Mr Kleve and there were years of legal battles on each side of the Atlantic. Bonhams helped to resolve the dispute, which resulted in the Ferrari being sold at auction for the record figure. The car was sold with a spare period works block engine and its original body panels, still bearing traces of the 1957 Cuban Grand Prix race colours. This Mercedes Benz W196, driven by Juan Manuel Fangio when he won his second World Drivers Championships, set a world record when it sold for £19 million .","A rare Ferrari 375-Plus, driven by the Italians in the 1954 World Sportscar Championship, has sold for £10.75m .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . Toppling Saddam Hussein bears some responsibility for today's crisis in Iraq, Tony Blair has admitted. Mr Blair said it would be 'absurd' to argue the 2003 Iraq war had nothing to do with the chaos in the country today - as al-Qaeda inspired Isis fighters close in on Baghdad. The former Prime Minister's admission comes just days a week after he claimed the US-American invasion was not to blame for the looming civil war in the country. He said it was the 'predictable and malign effect' of the crisis in Syria. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair has admitted that his decision to topple Saddam Hussein does bear some responsibility for the chaos gripping Iraq today. But he insisted that the primary cause was the failure to end the war in Syria . But writing in the Financial Times today, Mr Blair said: 'Of course the Iraq of 2014 bears, in part, the imprint of the removal of Saddam Hussein 11 years ago. To say otherwise, as a recent editorial in this newspaper implies that I do, would be absurd.' However, Mr Blair insisted the main cause of today's crisis in Iraq is the civil war in Syria which the West has failed to stop. Mr Blair's remarks came as the jihadist fighters in Iraq captured two border posts over the weekend - one along the frontier with Jordan and the other with Syria - considerably expanded territory under their control. The lightening offensive by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant takes the group closer to its dream of carving out an Islamic state straddling both Syria and Iraq. Mr Blair claimed that the al-Qaeda in Iraq style terrorism had been all-but defeated seven years after the 2003 invasion but has been given new life by the West's failure to stop the sectarian strife ripping Syria apart. He said: 'We cannot ignore the fact that Isis, the jihadist group advancing across Iraq, rebuilt itself and organised the Iraq operation from the chaos in Syria. 'Isis and other al-Qaeda-type groups in Iraq were flat on their back four years ago, having been comprehensively beaten by a combination of US and UK forces and Sunni tribes. The civil war in Syria allowed them to get back on their feet.' The former Labour leader said not intervening in countries like Syria had been just as bad as going to war in Iraq. He said it would be 'odd' to claim the Arab spring of 2011 would not have touched Iraq forcing a civil war regardless of the decision to invade 11 years ago. Saddam Hussein kept the country's ethnic tensions in check with an iron fist, claim opponents of the Iraq war. But he sparked a war with Iran killing one million people, invaded Kuwait and massacred thousands of Kurds . Mr Blair claimed the 'fundamental challenge today... is the challenge of Islamist extremism' around the world which needed to be taken on and defeated. He said the 'bad news is that this issue is not going away' but claimed most Muslims want nothing to do with dictators or terrorist - and should be supported to live in democracies. Mr Blair has previously warned that by not intervening in Syria the problems are 'going to come back and they are going to hit us very directly even in our own country'. He added the 'biggest single worry today [is] returning jihadists fighters from Syria'. The former PM also called for Britain to 'support' the United States if they take military action in Iraq. 'It's in our interest to stop these jihadists.' 'They are prepared to fight us and they will if they are not stopped,' he added. But Mr Blair's intervention has been slammed by critics of his 2003 decision to take Britain to war against Iraq. Sir Christopher Meyer, Britain's ambassador to the US from 1997 to 2003, said the decision to topple Saddam was 'perhaps the most significant reason' for the sectarian violence now ripping through Iraq. 'There are many reasons for this disastrous state of affairs. Perhaps the most significant is the decision taken more than 10 years ago by President George W Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair to unseat Saddam Hussein without thinking through the consequences for Iraq of the dictator's removal.' The decision to bar members of Saddam's Ba'ath party from top jobs and disbanding the army - one former member of which now leads the Isis surge, were among the most serious errors, he said. 'We are reaping what we sowed in 2003. This is not hindsight. We knew in the run-up to war that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein would seriously destabilise Iraq after 24 years of his iron rule. 'For all his evil, he kept a lid on sectarian violence. Bush and Blair were repeatedly warned by their advisers and diplomats to make dispositions accordingly. 'But, as we now know, very little was done until the last minute; and what was done... simply made things far worse.' Tony Blair has vigorously defended his decision to support the then US President George Bush's decision to invade and remove Saddam Hussein in 2003 . Meanwhile, the US Secretary of State John Kerry landed in Baghdad today on a surprise trip to push for Iraqi unity and stability. Flying in from Jordan on a visit which the State Department had sought to keep secret amid security concerns, Mr Kerry was to meet with beleaguered Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and Iraqi leaders across the political and communal spectrum. Mr Kerry 'will discuss US actions under way to assist Iraq as it confronts this threat from ISIS and urge Iraqi leaders to move forward as quickly as possible with its government formation process to forge a government,' State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said.","Former PM says it would be 'absurd' to dismiss impact of 2003 invasion .

"By . Associated Press . A judge on Friday imposed a 50-year sentence on a woman convicted of killing her husband using pliers, a box cutter and a plastic baseball bat during a jealous rage. Justice E. Allen Hunter, who previously described 51-year-old Roxanne Jeskey's actions as 'monstrous savagery,' told her he chose not to impose a life sentence because of her brain injury. Her lawyers argued that the injury contributed to mental problems, leading to the violent outburst in June 2011. Roxanne Jeskey stands up after hearing her verdict of guilty by Superior Court Justice E. Allen Hunter in the murder of her husband Richard 'Rick' Jeskey in May . A medical examiner reported that Richard Jeskey was beaten and strangled and suffered cuts, punctures and bruises from head to toe. His naked body was found in a bathtub in their Bangor apartment. Mr Jeskey suffered extensive multiple blunt and sharp force injuries to the head, neck, torso, limbs and genitalia, Ferenc said in the autopsy report. He also was strangled with sufficient force to break the hyoid bone of his neck, Ferenc testified last year. The hyoid bone is the bone at the top of the neck under the chin. The judge concluded that the injuries were inflicted with a plastic baseball bat, razor, wooden and metal rods from broken towel racks, a pair of needle-nosed pliers, and, perhaps, other implements. 'Any one of these injuries standing alone manifests a depraved indifference to the value of human life,' Hunter said. 'Taken together, they reflect a monstrous savagery and cruelty that defies comprehension.' Roxanne Jeskey looks toward family members as she is led into the courtroom at the Penobscot Judicial Center in Bangor on Monday for the start of her murder trial. It is clear from Dr. Ferenc’s testimony that Richard Jeskey, while alive, was subjected to extreme cruelty that rises to the level of torture,' Assistant Attorney General Leane Zainea said. From his head to his lower extremities, he was cut, sliced, punctured, beaten and burnt. Most of the injuries he sustained were accompanied by hemorrhaging, which is indicative that his heart was beating and he was alive when he was beaten, repeatedly cut, sliced and punctured. 'This is not, if there is such a thing, a ‘run of the mill’ murder,' she continued. 'It is a murder characterized by, in the words of the definition of depraved indifference, such outrageous, revolting, savage, brutal or shocking conduct that it readily demonstrates an almost total lack of concern or appreciation for the value of human life on the part of the defendant. It is a murder involving literal torture.' 'Ms. Jeskey had injuries on her body that, in combination with her mental health issues, could represent the trigger to an unreasonable reaction and show of force against Mr. Jeskey' Defence attorney David Bate wrote. 'Admittedly, the court found that the severity of Mr. Jeskey’s injuries and duration of time it would take to inflict those injuries indicates sufficient intent or knowledge to support a conviction. 'However, the severity of the injuries also represents an extreme and unexpected departure from 48 years of no criminal activity, strongly suggesting that her mental health status played a substantial role in what unfolded that night,' he concluded. Guilty: An emotional Roxanne Jeskey, 51, of Bangor apologized to her husband¿s family and said just before being sentenced that she regrets her actions the night of June 12 to 13, 2011 . A neighbor testified that Roxanne Jeskey was angry because her husband had been calling another woman. Experts gave conflicting testimony at Jeskey’s trial about whether she knew right from wrong the night she killed her husband. Prosecution and defense experts testified that Jeskey’s cognitive skills and memory are impaired because of the removal of the tumor. However, she was found competent to stand trial . On Friday, she addressed the judge and suggested she would have been better off letting ""nature take its course"" instead of having surgery 10 years earlier to remove a brain tumor. Jeskey also apologized to her husband's family. .I can honestly say I've prayed for you. I do feel your sorrow. I do miss him. He was my husband,' she said. Later, she looked at her own family and said, 'God will make each day better than the day before, and I'm confident I'll get the help I need.'. Prosecutors sought a life sentence for Jeskey. The defense asked the judge to impose 20 to 25 years, and said she'd likely die in prison even with that sentence.

"By . Kirk Maltais . A 90-year-old man who fought and survived in the grueling Pacific Theater during World War II was shocked when he learned that, according to an records mix-up, he was listed as having gone AWOL by the U.S. Military during that same time period. Dr. Thomas J. Smith Jr., 90, of Albany, New York, discovered in 2006 while obtaining records for a memoir he was writing that the military had mixed him up with another Thomas J. Smith Jr. According to Smith, the source of the confusion was with the middle names of the two men. 'The bottom of the letter is stamped Thomas Jefferson Smith Jr. I’m . Joseph,' Smith told WTEN. Thomas J. Smith, Jr., 90, a teacher in Albany, New York, first discovered the error in his military records while compiling information for a memoir . Smith in his formal Marines regalia. He served in the Pacific Theater in 1942, fighting in several historic and grueling battles . According to Smith, the man he was mixed up with went AWOL  while Smith was recovering from a gunshot wound to his back on the Marshall Islands, as part of the island-hopping his unit did.

"By . David Kent . Paulo Bento needs Germany to do Portugal a huge favour after a 2-2 Group G draw with the United States left his side teetering on the brink of early World Cup elimination. The Seleccao would have been knocked out of the tournament by the USA had substitute Silvestre Varela not scored a last-gasp equaliser in Manaus to keep Portugal's faint hopes of progressing to the last 16 alive. Nani opened the scoring during the early exchanges at the Arena Amazonia but goals from Jermaine Jones and USA captain Clint Dempsey meant Varela was charged with forcing the draw to salvage a vital point. Net gains: Substitute Silvestre Varela scored in injury time to salvage a 2-2 draw with the United States . On the ball: Portugal head coach Paulo Bento . Portugal must now beat Ghana in Brasilia while hoping group leaders Germany inflict a heavy defeat on the USA, a defeat heavy enough to allow Bento's men to remedy their inferior goal difference and sneak into second place. Bento told FIFA.com: 'It's clearly not a good result for us. The 2-2 doesn't put us out of the World Cup mathematically, but it does leave us in a very difficult situation. 'Not just because of what we'll need to do against Ghana, but also because we'll need a favourable result from the Germany-United States game. 'We were unlucky late in the first half, but it was a great effort to level the match (in second-half stoppage time). 'Now all we can do is to give everything in our very last game and try and make the most of the very little chance that we have left.' The USA, who beat Ghana 2-1 last week, came so close to recording back-to-back wins but, despite admitting he was frustrated by Sunday night's result, Stars and Stripes coach Jurgen Klinsmann hailed an 'extraordinary performance'. 'When you concede a goal in the last second then it's unlucky,' he said. 'Our boys put in an extraordinary performance. 'The journey's now a little bit longer for us, but we want to beat Germany to confirm our place in the round of 16. End of the road: Cristiano Ronaldo and Co are relying on other results to stand any chance of progressing . 'I'm a little frustrated with this draw, but we're going to work hard to make sure this doesn't happen again.' Everton goalkeeper Tim Howard pulled off a series of fine saves to keep Portugal at bay during their brighter periods. He said: 'We're a little disappointed, but still optimistic. 'We thought we'd put one foot in the round of 16, but we are where we'd aimed to be before the tournament: going into the final game with a good chance of progressing. 'The coaching staff put in place a great game plan. Portugal didn't cause us too many problems and we could have avoided both their goals. 'We moved the ball around better and had the clearer chances. We're not going to let the last-gasp goal get us down.' On Thursday the USA meet Germany in Recife, where a draw will be enough to send both nations through to the knockout stages at the expense of Ghana and Portugal.","Portugal were heading out of the tournament until late equaliser in 2-2 draw .

"By . Andrew Warshaw . Click here to view our brilliant Match Zone service including Teofilo Gutierrez's goal. Welcome back, Colombia. They may be in the shadow of more illustrious South American contenders but what an exhilarating performance they put on Saturday amid another intoxicating atmosphere at this goal spree of a World Cup. Missing the mercurial talents of Radamel Falcao to a pre-tournament injury that robbed them of one of the world’s most potent strikers, they were nevertheless far too good for an ageing Greek team whose game plan went out of the window after five minutes. Just like in Sao Paolo in the opening game, Belo Horizonte’s imposing stadium was turned into a sea of yellow, but yellow of a different patriotic fervour. More than 40,000 Colombians poured into Brazil’s third largest city hoping to carry on where they had left off in qualifying when they finished second behind Argentina.

"By . David Kent . USA have a terrific opportunity to make the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time in 12 years when they take on Belgium on Tuesday. Jurgen Klinsmann's side progressed from this summer's 'Group of Death' - as referenced by president Barack Obama this week - by beating Ghana and drawing against Portugal. While this isn't the most gifted American team of recent years, particularly without the goalscoring Landon Donovan, the manager has them well-drilled and they are uniting a country. VIDEO Scroll down to see 'Marouane Fellaini sends Belgian girl a wig resembling his hair' The main man: America have looked to Clint Dempsey for their supply of goals in recent years . Flying high: Barack Obama watched the Germany game from his airplane as USA progressed . Who are the danger men? Clint Dempsey is the talismanic figure up front for America and has scored twice in the tournament so far. The Seattle Sounders man isn't usually a striker but has played on his own under Klinsmann in the absence of more attackers. American supporters should watch out for Eden Hazard for Belgium. The forward lit up the Premier League at Chelsea over the last year and poses a serious threat with his direct dribbling and intelligence on the ball. The USA central midfield pairing of Michael Bradley and Jermaine Jones have Bundesliga experience in Germany and work hard, while Tim Howard has been one of the most consistent goalkeepers in Europe over the last five years.

Wilmots guided his team to three wins out of three in Group H - even though they weren't at their best. The Belgians have a host of talent who play in the English Premier League, including Romelu Lukaku (Chelsea), Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham) and Vincent Kompany (Manchester City).

"By . Scarlett Russell . Move over blondes, the most beautiful women are brunettes. A new survey has asked who the 50 greatest beauty icons of the  last 50 years are, with Audrey Hepburn coming out on top. Overall, 33 out of the 50 were brunettes, 17 blondes and just one redhead - 1940s film legend Rita Hayworth. Icon: Audrey Hepburn, pictured here, was voted the most desirable woman of the last 50 years . Royally beautiful: The Duchess of Cambridge's long brown hair is the envy of many women the world over . The top 10 women in the survey, which was carried out by Superdrug, Audrey Hepburn was directly followed by three blonde icons: Princess Diana of Wales, Grace Kelly and Brigitte Bardot. But supermodel Twiggy was the only other blonde in the top 10, which featured a total of six brunettes. Elizabeth Taylor, the Duchess of Cambridge, Angelina Jolie, Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai and actress Catherine Zeta-Jones all featured, as reported in The Sun today. Also in the list of desirable brunettes were Kelly Brook, Mila Kunis, Jackie Kennedy, Victoria Beckham and Alexa Chung. Standing proud: Brunettes Angelina Jolie, left, and Kelly Brook, right both made Superdrug's beauty icon list . Brilliant brunettes: Mila Kunis, left, and Victoria Beckham, right, both made the beauty icon list . In the blonde corner, 17 per cent of those who voted went to Princess Diana. Kate Moss, Holly Willoughby, Charlize Theron and Scarlett Johannson all made the list, too. X Factor judge Cheryl Cole had twice as many votes as Nicole Scherzinger, who also sat on the X Factor panel. Superdrug spokesperson Simon Comins told The Sun: 'The public like to look at all the attributes that make an amazing woman.' Always an icon: Princess Diana was voted the second most beautiful woman of the last 50 years. She followed Audrey Hepburn, making her the most desirable of all the blondes on the list . Blondes have more fun?Kate Moss, left, and Holly Willoughby, right, were voted number 13 and 16 respectively in Superdrug's list of the 50 most beautiful women of the last 50 years . Red on top: Rita Hayworth was actually naturally brunette, but died her hair to attract a greater range of roles . Rita Hayworth, who was born Margarita Carmen Cansino . in 1918, was the only redhead in the votes. She was, in fact, a natural brunette, but dyed her hair red as she thought it would get her more film roles. It clearly worked, as the actress and dancer rose to international fame in the 1940s and 1950s as one of . Hollywood's sexiest and most iconic 'femme fatales'. An icon of early cinema, she was one of the few women who danced on screen with both Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly. She died of Alzheimer's disease in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan in May 1987 when she was 68 years old. Breakfast at Tiffanys and Funny Face actress Audrey Hepburn was 63 when she died. Like Rita, she was considered one of the greatest beauties and most iconic actresses of all time.","Survey by Superdrug reveals 50 greatest female beauty icons of all time .

"By . Ian Drury, Home Affairs Correspondent . Prisoners should be allowed access to computers and the internet despite the security risks because they are living in a technological ‘dark age’, it was claimed today. Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick sparked controversy by calling for murderers, paedophiles and terrorists to be allowed to log on to websites. He argued giving offenders the chance to surf the web would help with reintegration into society and reduce reoffending. But critics said it was ‘barmy’ to give prisoners access to the internet where they could plan crimes, do drug deals, torment victims and log onto extremist websites. Mr Hardwick said secure, controlled use of the internet could also transform education, family contact and resettlement in jails - making it less likely inmates would return to a life of crime after leaving jail . Mr Hardwick, who was embroiled in a war of words with ministers this month after claiming prison were overcrowded, spoke out at a conference on modernising justice in London. He said secure, controlled use of the internet could also transform education, family contact and resettlement in jails – making it less likely inmates would return to a life of crime after leaving jail. Greater internet access could assist prisoners in looking for jobs and studying for qualifications as well as for making practical arrangements prior to their release, he said. Mr Hardwick said: ‘Like other risk management processes in a prison, prisoners’ access to new technologies and the internet needs to be based on risk assessment of the individual concerned and properly supervised. ‘I don’t think we can go on with prisons in a pre-internet dark age: inefficient and wasteful and leaving prisoners woefully unprepared for the world they will face on release. ‘Yes, there are security issues to be addressed, but the technology allows every key stroke to be monitored and access can be risk assessed. Chief inspector of prisons Nick Hardwick controversially called for prisoners to be allowed access to the internet . ‘There is a fear that a move in this direction will be seen as being soft on prisoners. But we can’t leave prisons in a time warp.’ Mr Hardwick said it was ‘relatively easy’ for prisoners to get hold of an illegal mobile phone in prison through which they could access the internet. Only last month film footage taken on a mobile phone emerged showing a group of boys in a Young Offenders Institute kicking and punching fellow inmates in a sickening ritual. Prison reform campaigners have pointed out that in Norway, all prisoners have access to the internet, even in their cells, with firewalls set up to ensure security. A report last year found three-quarters of all governors of prisons in England and Wales who responded to a survey believed inmates should have controlled access to the internet. But Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said large numbers of prisoners had been convicted of crimes involving misuse of computers and the internet, such as paedophiles who downloaded sex abuse images and Islamist extremists. He said: ‘Internet access would be another serious blow to the notion that prison is a place where criminals are finally punished. ‘This could do real damage to the fight against organised crime and it risks victims being intimidated and terrorised. ‘Surely prison guards have better things to do than stand over criminals watching them surf the internet.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘Advances in technology can provide useful tools to aid rehabilitation in prison, however there are clear security risks in allowing prisoner’s access to the internet and public protection will always be our priority.’","Nick Hardwick said prisoners are living in a 'technological dark age'

"By . Jennifer Newton . A selfless teenager has launched his own campaign to help sick children despite battling a brain tumour and undergoing 11 operations himself. Tyler Murphy came up with the idea of organising gift boxes for other sick children with life threatening illnesses to raise their spirits while lying in his hospital bed. The 17-year-old was diagnosed with a brain tumour when he was 12-years-old and has spent much of his time in and out of hospital having undergone surgery 11 times.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . With a little help from a California woman, Mattel - the toy company behind iconic dolls like Barbie and Polly Pocket - has agreed to begin manufacturing more 'Ella' dolls, which are designed for kids going through chemotherapy. The therapy dolls don't have hair, but come with a number of wigs, and are designed to help young kids cope with losing their hair as a result of their treatment. Grace Bumstead, 4, suffers from a form of leukemia so rare that its rate among children is one in a million. Scroll down for video . Chemo Barbie: The 'Ella' Barbie is bald and is designed for little girls going through chemotherapy .

While she was in treatment, Grace got an 'Ella' doll, which her mother says has now joined the girl's 'inner-circle of Barbies.' 'When they first met, she’s like, ""OK, I get what’s going on."" But it . gave us the chance to say, ""Here’s a beautiful, smiling doll. It doesn’t . have hair,’” her mother, Melissa Bumstead, told CBSLA.com. At such a young age, Grace will be forced to endure intensive chemotherapy over the next 18 months. The treatment already has caused the young girl to lose her blond curls. 'She’s been amazingly brave. And we’re very, very proud of her. It’s not . where we expected to be in life right now,' Bumstead said. 'We bring [Ella] along everywhere to say, ""This is what’s happening. This is what’s happened to Ella. This is what’s gonna happen to you."" It . brought it to her level.' 'Ella': Grace was given an 'Ella' doll before she started losing her hair to help explain to what was happening to her . Impressed with how much the doll helped her daughter, Bumstead discovered that the hospital where Grace was being treated had just six dolls to give to other girls facing chemotherapy. Bumstead took it upon herself to publicly let the toy giant Mattel know that they need to make more 'Ella' dolls by starting an online petition urging Mattel to manufacture more of the special dolls. After just three months, the petition had more than 100,000 signatures. 'Every 10 minutes, we had 1,000 signatures,' Bumstead said. When Mattell got word of the petition, it agreed to make more of the dolls and distribute them to hospitals across the country.

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . If the hectic pace of life and international travel is getting too much – British Airways believes it has the answer to calm you down – ‘Slow TV’. Forget the action packed shoot ‘em up ’ Hollywood blockbusters, the Star Wars-style space epics or break-neck speed car chases. BA bosses reckon many passengers while cruising at 600mph and 35,000ft would rather unwind and de-stress on a lengthy flight to the on-screen equivalent of watching paint dry. Scroll down for video . A screenshot taken from the new 'slow' movie. From next week British Airways are to screen an entire seven-hour-long silent snow-covered train journey from Bergen to Oslo in Norway . So from next week they are to screen an entire seven-hour-long silent snow-covered train journey from Bergen to Oslo in Norway and believe  passengers will appreciate the   calming, hypnotic and  ‘mesmerising’ qualities of the quiet meandering programme that is void of commentary to liven things up. BA will be the first  airline to  air such languid ‘Slow TV’ alternative to the usual fare of 130 movies, 650 TV shows, 550 music albums and 228 radio shows. They were inspired in part by the popularity of the highly addictive slow-moving in-flight screens which show the aeroplane’s progress across a  map  as well as key statistics such as temperature, speed and time. The journey-within-a-journey was also inspired by a wider trend for ‘slow TV’ which is already popular in Scandinavia for its relaxing, undemanding qualities. The programmes also feature gentle, everyday events such as knitting, walking and bird feeding. For those of a certain  vintage,  the idea will bring back memories of the highly popular and equally hypnotic  spinning  ‘potters’ wheel’ – used in the early days of black and white television for the ‘interlude’ used between programmes -  showing a pair of hands fashioning a clay  pot. Next in line will be an eight hour epic taking the passenger on a journey to see the entire process of knitting  a jumper - from the shearing of sheep to the finished product . British Airways said staff would trial the train journey before expanding to other ‘slow’ programmes. Next in line will be an eight hour epic taking  the passenger on a journey to see the entire process of knitting a jumper - from the shearing of sheep to the finished product. The genre has already become a cult hit in Norway, with more than a million people tuning in to the programme called ‘The Seven Hour Train Journey to Oslo’ when it ran on Norwegian TV station NRK. BA’s  in-flight entertainment manager Richard D’Cruze  said one of the team at their  agency Spafax read about this unusual documentary that had become a cult hit in Norway and tracked it down: ‘It fits perfectly with the ‘wallpaper’ style footage people find mesmerising in-flight, such as our moving maps which customers watch for endless hours. Highlights include children waving from stations, the changing weather, and stretches of total darkness as the train passes through long tunnels . ‘There’s definitely a hypnotic, calming and entertaining quality to ‘Slow TV’ that is perfect for in-flight entertainment.’ The quiet film uses a camera mounted on the front of an ordinary train, and shows its journey through stations, countryside, past picturesque lakes and underneath snow-capped mountains. Highlights include children waving from stations, the changing weather, and stretches of total darkness as the train passes through long tunnels. Last year, NRK found itself with an unexpected hit after broadcasting the show to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the train route. The quiet film uses a camera mounted on the front of an ordinary train, and shows its journey through stations, countryside, past picturesque lakes and underneath snow-capped mountains . Head of programming at the public service broadcaster Rune Møklebust said he had commissioned it after a colleague suggested filming the whole trip: ‘We thought it would be something completely new… and cheap,’ he said after putting it up against more popular  fare such as the ‘X Factor’ and ‘Have I Got News For You’.

Arve Hjelseth, a sociologist from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, attributed the success of the shows to a renewed appreciation for nature in modern society, adding: ‘We're more stressed these days, too, so it's a time to relax as well as an antidote to modern TV, where camera angles shift every second. So called 'slow-TV' is strangely calming.’","Passengers will de-stress to on-screen equivalent of watching paint dry .

"By . Abul Taher . and Nic North . One of the British Isis fighters seen in a recruitment video made sure he was ready for combat by taking up cage fighting. Reyaad Khan, 20, chose to prepare himself by practising mixed martial arts (MMA) at his local gym in Cardiff. The sport involves fighting in ‘cages’ – round cushioned floors which are surrounded by plastic and metal fencing. Training: Reyaad Khan (left) chose to prepare himself by practising mixed martial arts at his local gym in Cardiff . Last night Henry Saye, head coach at the £30-a-month gym, said Khan was short and podgy as a teenager. But Mr Saye said he was ‘in good shape’ when he last saw him – just weeks before he left Britain with his friend, 20-year-old Nasser Muthana, who reportedly also took part in MMA sessions. The 34-year-old trainer, who works at the Brotherhood gym near  Khan’s Cardiff home, believes he was radicalised a year before he left Britain. He said: ‘He suddenly changed. On Facebook, he started ranting about the US and the way that the West treated Muslims. He hadn’t been like that before. Almost overnight, he became a reactionary.’ The detail of Khan's training was revealed as it emerged President Obama has sent a special unit of CIA officers to the UK to investigate British Muslim extremists. Head coach Henry Saye said Khan (circled) was short and podgy as a teenager but was recently in good shape . The unusual move has been made amid growing fears in Washington that we are becoming a ‘breeding ground’ for terrorism. In a pointed snub to MI5, the agents arrived on a ‘lone wolf’ mission to interrogate senior security experts about the radicalisation of UK Muslims. It is more normal for the U.S. to rely on intelligence shared directly from the British security services.","Reyaad Khan, 20, practised mixed martial arts at gym in Cardiff .

"By . Associated Press . Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal broke down in tears on Wednesday at the end of a news conference where he apologized for posting an anonymous blog comment that denigrated welfare recipients and other postings that were seen by some as racist. Huppenthal was barely composed from the beginning of the packed news conference at the state Board of Education's meeting room near the Capitol, but he finally lost his composure after about a half hour when he tried to explain how those comments had most affected his longtime assistant. 'We can imagine the emotional impact. I have talked to people who have been hurt by the hour,' Huppenthal said. The person I feel most — to the point of my own tears — is my assistant Merle. She has been with me for .... ' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arizona Superintendent of Public Instruction John Huppenthal broke down in tears on Wednesday during a public apology following a hurtful bog post he'd written calling poor people on welfare lazy pigs . Huppenthal then broke down completely and left the room. The state's top education officials, however, said he would neither resign his position nor drop out of the Republican primary, where he faces a challenge from a conservative who is campaigning to get the state to drop new Common Core standards. He also said he would not back away from his support for the standards 'that are hugely controversial among the conservative elements of Arizona.' Huppenthal has been peppered with criticism for a week, ever since it became public that he had posted on both conservative and liberal blogs under pseudonyms for several years. Among the posts dating to 2011, when he took his current office, was one that denigrated both President Barack Obama and welfare recipients. 'Obama is rewarding the lazy pigs with food stamps (44 million people), air-conditioning, free health care, flat-screen TV's (typical of ""poor"" families).'Another earlier set of comments that came to light this week credited former state Sen. Russell Pearce, the author of the state's tough anti-illegal immigration law, with bringing down crime rates. But he went on to call on immigrant to assimilate, and quickly. Huppenthal finally lost his composure after about a half hour when he tried to explain how those comments had most affected his longtime assistant . 'No spanish radio stations, no spanish billboards, no spanish tv, no spanish newspapers,' he wrote. 'This is America, speak English.' A former superintendent of public instruction, Lisa Graham Keegan, was among several community members who called Wednesday for Huppenthal to resign. She said his comments were so damaging that he can't effectively lead the state's school agency. 'The No. 1 issue for the person who holds the job of superintendent of public instruction is deep respect and community with the people that we serve and those that we work with,' said Keegan, who served from 1995-2001 as a Republican but now is an independent. 'John Huppenthal's comments have violated that sacred bond.' Others at the news conference where Keegan spoke echoed her comments. 'We wouldn't take the comments that John Huppenthal has said from a student body president. We wouldn't take it from a principal at a school,' said Lawrence Robinson, a Roosevelt School District board member. 'We certainly will not take it from the person responsible for representing all of our public schools and our education.' Huppenthal faces a primary challenge from Diane Douglas, a conservative Republican who has attacked the incumbent for his support of the Common Core standards. Two Democrats, David Garcia and Sharon Thomas, are also in the race.","'Obama is rewarding the lazy pigs with .

"By . Graham Johnson And Jonathan Petre . One of the country’s most prestigious private schools ran out of emergency contraceptive pills after requests from pupils who had sex in their boarding houses. The revelation was made in an email in which senior staff at the £33,000-a-year co-educational Stowe School voiced ‘great concerns’ when supplies of the ‘morning-after’ pill were exhausted after one weekend earlier this year. Assistant Head Peter Last wrote in the email, leaked to The Mail on Sunday, that the fact pupils were ‘relaxed enough’ to have sex in a boarding house and ‘openly’ tell school nurses suggested staff needed to increase vigilance and warn pupils about their behaviour. Stowe School in Buckinghamshire ran out of emergency contraceptive pills after requests from pupils who had sex in their boarding houses, an email revealed . A former member of staff at the Buckinghamshire school, whose alumni include Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriends Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas, said the email ‘shocked’ staff because it showed sexual activity among pupils was much more prevalent than suspected. Family values campaigners criticised the school, with former GP Trevor Stammers, a spokesman for the Family Education Trust, saying he was ‘extremely concerned and disappointed’ that the school gave mixed messages by banning sex but providing the ‘morning-after’ pill. The email was sent on February 4 to matrons and heads of the school’s 12 houses. Mr Last, who is also a housemaster, wrote: ‘After this last weekend... the Medical Centre ran out of supplies of emergency contraception early this week. ‘Not only is this worrying enough in itself, but it is also of great concern that some of the pupils who have been asking for emergency contraception have told the nurses that they were having sex in boarding houses over the weekend...’ The revelation was made in an email, pictured, in which senior staff voiced 'great concerns' when supplies of the 'morning-after' pill were exhausted after one weekend earlier this year . Mr Last’s email continued: ‘Sexual activity is a very serious pastoral concern for us as a school, and something we need to be constantly vigilant for. ‘The school rules do, of course, state that “no study, bedroom or dormitory may be entered by a student of the opposite sex” and it also very clear that students having sex in school time (either on site or off) are “liable to expulsion”. ‘This is clearly a difficult area to police, but the fact that students are openly saying that they have been having sex in their houses at weekends suggests that our level of supervision of them at weekends needs to be stepped up...’ The school, which opened in 1923 with 99 pupils and whose other alumni include businessman Sir Richard Branson and the late actor David Niven, is housed in one of the country’s most imposing  neo-classical buildings, Stowe House, set in 750 acres of landscaped gardens and parkland outside Buckingham. The ex-staff member said: ‘We were aware that there was some sexual activity... but the email was a shock because we were being told that sex was taking place more frequently than we had first thought. ‘Crucially, sex was taking place in houses. Sex in houses was a big no-no. Even boys going into girls’ dorms or bedrooms was a big no-no.’ Family values campaigners have criticised Stowe School, pictured, for sending out mixed messages by banning sex but providing the 'morning-after' pill . The ex-staff member said that Stowe School did not provide condoms to its 770 pupils, who include about 220 girls, because of fears it might encourage sexual activity and because of its Christian ethics. There is no suggestion that any of the sex taking place was under-age. Law firm Schillings last night said on behalf of the school that Stowe’s  medical centre held only two morning-after pills at the time. The school stated: ‘Stowe places the utmost importance in providing the highest level of pastoral care for all of its pupils. ‘The school has clear policies, rules and procedures in place covering all pastoral issues, including those that concern sexual behaviour. Transgressors of the school rules risk expulsion. The school continually reviews procedures to ensure the maintenance of high standards of pastoral care.’ Stowe School, where 90 per cent of pupils are boarders, has been embroiled in controversies before. In 2003, a former pupil was arrested for alleged sex abuse of a 14-year-old still at Stowe. A year earlier there was a drugs probe when the rave drug ketamine was found in a student’s room.","Email reveals school ran out of emergency contraceptives after one weekend .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A new book about convicted murderer Jodi Arias reveals the killer’s nymphomania and victim Travis Alexander's inability to stay away from her helped lead to his grisly 2008 murder. HLN TV host Jane Velez-Mitchell’s new book about Arias and the Mesa, Arizona murder of her on-again off-again lover Travis Alexander details the torrid affair that preceded the grisly 2008 crime. Exposed: The Secret Life of Jodi Arias hits shelves August 20 and goes far deeper into the sordid tale’s sexual underpinnings than any reports have gone thus far. Scroll down for video... Deadly attraction: HLN TV host Jane Velez-Mitchell details the mutual sexual obsession between Jodi Arias and the man she murdered leading up to the crime in Exposed: The Secret Life of Jodi Arias . The New York Post published an excerpt from the upcoming book. ‘Jodi elicited Travis’ reckless forbidden passion,’ writes Velez-Mitchell of the practicing Mormon. ‘Unfortunately for her, it was also what Travis loathed, as it came with more and more guilt each time.’ Velez-Mitchell says a close friend of Alexander’s described Arias as a ‘sexual dynamo.' ‘We were driving one day,’ revealed Taylor Searle, ‘and [Travis] was talking about Jodi and was describing how she was a nymphomaniac. He was explaining that Jodi had gotten herself off eight times in one day. It might have been nine, or it might have been 13.’ Velez-Mitchell reveals a deeply unhealthy, sexually charged dynamic between Alexander and Arias that extended even after Alexander broke things off with his future murderer in 2007. Insatiable: Velez-Mitchell reveals that Travis Alexander, though a practicing Mormon, just couldn't stay away from Jodi's forbidden fruits . Not long after the breakup, the two began having sex again. And according to the book, Alexander was desperately torn between following the dictates of his Mormon faith and those that came from inside himself. Desperate to stay near her obsession, Jodi offered to clean Travis’s house for $12.50 an hour. And unable to stop himself from keeping her around, Travis gave Jodi the keys. ‘Unfortunately, giving Jodi access to his house meant Travis was able to keep his addiction to his guilty pleasure full-blown. The pusher was right there serving him his drug on a silver platter,’ writes Velez-Mitchell. But as Travis began to date other women and distance himself from his fiery former lover, Jodi became progressively unhinged. Motive? As Arias awaits the sentencing portion of her trial, Exposed: The Secret Life of Jody Arias puts together the pieces of her sordid life that led to the murder of Travis Alexander . ‘Whether it was because of his upbringing or Jodi’s skills in the bedroom,’ writes the TV host, ‘Travis clearly had a difficult time deciding what he was going to do about Jodi.’ And Travis’s forays into the ‘dark side’ were hurting his chances of leading the normal Mormon life he so desired. ‘Already, she was having Mormon guilt about kissing Travis to the point where he had an erection,’ writes Velez-Mitchell about a Mormon girl Travis dated after  She was so naïve about the situation inside his pants, she assumed it was something he could control, not an act of nature. She also thought it was somewhat her fault that she had not done enough to keep his thoughts clean.’ Addict: Velez-Mitchell writes that Alexander called Arias a 'sexual dynamo' and likens his desire for her to that of a junkie and his drugs--deadly but irresistible . Jodi’s behavior became progressively erratic—she began stalking Travis when he was with other women and hacking into his Facebook account. She would show up to his home naked and unannounced. Though she eventually moved back to her home town in California, the world would soon learn how quickly she returned to Travis’s Arizona home. On June 4, Arias showed up in the early morning hours. She and Alexander had one long and final sexual encounter. That evening, Jodi would stab her former lover some 29 times, shoot him in the face, and slice him ear-to-ear. Their insatiable sexual affair had come to a bloody end.","HLN TV host Jane Velez-Mitchell writes that Travis Alexander had a full-blown addiction to sex with Jodi Arias .

"By . Travelmail Reporter . As 350,000 students prepare to graduate this July, the UK could this year face a potential 'brain-drain' as graduates move abroad in search of better career opportunities. A study, which questioned 500 young people of graduation age, explored attitudes towards travelling and working abroad, and was commissioned to help student and traveller shipping specialist, 1StopShip understand ‘Gen Y’ moving trends. It found that instead of putting their hard earned degree to good use, 47per cent of young people were planning to move abroad in the next 12 months, while 23per cent were actively considering it. It is thought as much as 70% of graduates will look to move abroad rather than enter the world of work . The majority (43per cent) were planning to do this for the medium-long term (up to 5 years), while 11per cent predicted they would remain overseas for more than five years. The top destinations emerged as New York (58per cent), Sydney (34per cent), L.A. (26per cent) Melbourne (23per cent), and Beijing (19per cent) while the top reasons for wanting to move abroad were better job prospects (47per cent), spiralling living costs in the UK (26per cent) or disillusionment with UK politics (21per cent). Recent Government figures suggest that graduates contribute to the UK economy almost 10 times what it costs the state to educate them, in turn bringing in £180,000 more to the economy than those with A-levels over their working life. This continued trend could therefore impede the UK’s fragile economic recovery. Ian Brown, from 1StopShip said: 'A good proportion of our customer base is made up of young people – often graduates – who decide to defer the world of work in favour of travelling or working abroad. This can be for a variety of reasons, and often it’s a case of balancing the need to build a career with the opportunity to experience new cultures and gain valuable life experiences. 'However, whatever the reasons for travelling, careful planning is key, and that’s where a cost-effective and reliable shipping service can play its part.'","11% will go for more than five years .

"By . Miles Goslett . A leading candidate to become the next chairman of the BBC Trust was last night accused of ‘colluding’ in a cover-up over the Jimmy Savile scandal. Diane Coyle, acting chairman of the Trust, was one of four trustees who attended a meeting last December to discuss allegations that former director-general Mark Thompson knew about Savile’s abuse almost a year before he left the Corporation. The BBC Radio Forum, whose 4,000 members include BBC producers, and the Taxpayers’ Alliance, which campaigns for better use of public money, have written to Culture Secretary Sajid Javid urging him to investigate whether Ms Coyle is  a ‘fit and proper person’ for the £110,000-a-year post. Mr Javid is overseeing the appointment. Diane Coyle, acting chairman of the BBC Trust, is accused by the BBC Radio Forum of colluding to allow vital facts about Savile's offering to remain secret . They write: ‘She has colluded in allowing vital facts to remain hidden from public view.’ The groups allege Ms Coyle helped to exclude from public view which executives allegedly knew about claims against the late DJ, and when they were first told of them. Last December Nick Pollard, who chaired a BBC inquiry into why a Newsnight investigation of Savile was axed, admitted he had excluded from his final report the claim about Mr Thompson. Despite . listening to a recording of Pollard saying he made a ‘mistake’ by . excluding this evidence, the trustees opted to leave the report . unchanged. Savile died in October 2012 and had hundreds of victims, and the BBC Radio Forum allege Ms Coyle helped to hide which executives allegedly knew about claims made against him, and when they were first told of them .

"By . Martin Beckford . Career civil servant: Stephen Harrison received almost £260,000 in redundancy payments . Two bosses of a failed anti-fraud quango have been rewarded with payoffs worth almost £400,000. The National Fraud Authority was accused of ignoring victims of conmen who rang its Action Fraud hotline, and of failing to get a grip on soaring levels of online crime. It was shut down by Home Secretary Theresa May earlier this year so that elite police units could ‘strengthen the Government’s fight against economic crime’. But now it can be revealed that  the two most senior figures in the organisation, which cost taxpayers £11.8 million last year, have been given massive voluntary redundancy payments. Stephen Harrison, who served as the NFA’s chief executive from September 2011, received between £255,000 and £260,000 – on top of his £95,000 salary and £1,600  in perks. The career civil servant, who spent 20 years in the Home Office, also left with a pension pot worth £509,000. The NFA’s ‘director of knowledge’ Edward Nkune, meanwhile, was given a £120,000-£125,000 ‘golden goodbye’ to go with his £70,000 annual wage. Mr Nkune, who previously worked at the Serious Fraud Office, has retirement funds worth £263,000. The NFA was established only in 2008 by the Home Office and was devoted mainly to collating statistics on the scale of fraud in the UK. It also set up the Action Fraud  hotline that left local police unable to take details of criminals. Quids in: Edward Nkune, the organisation's 'director of knowledge', received almost £125,000 . But as The Mail on Sunday has . reported, many victims say their plight was ignored by the call-centre . staff who took their crime reports. Only . half of crimes reported to Action Fraud were ever passed on to police . forces to investigate, and few of those were ever solved. Matters were made worse still when BSS, the private company that ran the hotline, lost 2,500 reports because of IT problems. Amid growing concern that cyber fraud was not being taken seriously enough, the NFA was shut down in March this year by the Home Secretary. The National Crime Agency – dubbed Britain’s FBI – took over its strategic role while City of London Police assumed responsibility for the Action Fraud hotline in an attempt to ‘improve fraud reporting and analysis’. Inaction: Only half of crimes reported to Action Fraud were ever passed on to police forces to investigate . However, an elected crime tsar fears that even after the costly reorganisation, victims are still not being supported and cases still not being investigated. Martyn Underhill, the independent Police and Crime Commissioner for Dorset, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It really is time that this Government is held to account for its continuing failures in relation to fraud. ‘The NFA was a failing body and hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers’ money have been wasted on closing it. ‘Its successor continues to fail victims and continues to fail the public.’ The NFA’s final accounts stated that the voluntary redundancy payments made to both Mr Harrison and Mr Nkune were made  on ‘standard Civil Service compensation scheme terms’, based on their length of service.","National Fraud Authority was accused of ignoring victims of conmen .

Chefs Heston Blumenthal and Jamie Oliver say a decent bubbly can be yours for exactly this price — thanks to the 1970s drinks gadget SodaStream. They swear it can turn an average plonk into a drink tasting exactly like champagne. Jamie explains: ‘If you put an OK bottle of wine in the SodaStream, it will bubble up to be much better than an OK champagne.’ And in a blind test, Heston fooled members of the public into thinking they were drinking champagne after putting a £5.25 bottle of Blue Nun through the gadget. The method is simple — decant the wine into the bottle, pop it in the machine, then press the button to add carbon dioxide. But does it work? We asked Femail wine expert and author of The Knackered Mother’s Wine Club, Helen McGinn, to test it out on white and rose supermarket wines. Helen McGinn tries out using a SodaStream to make alternative champagne . There were so many bubbles it looked like Alka Seltzer at first. But they soon calmed down and lasted a good hour in the bottle. The fizz really enhanced the fresh apple and pear aromas! You could easily pass this off as a dry £10 Prosecco. Score: 8/10 . This is fantastic. It has more flavour and weight than the Pinot, and the result is more interesting. Golden in the glass, the bubbles bring out the apple flavours. It reminds me of sparkling Chenins from the Loire Valley, which cost at least £12. Score: 8/10 . This simple, dry rose is super sippable as it is, so I did wonder if bubbles would make it any better. The answer was, not really. The bubbles diluted the delicate strawberry flavours. Score: 5/10 . Fan of the fizz: Jamie Oliverl believes you can make your own bubbly at home for much less than buying it in the shops . A smart, refreshing wine, made from Chenin Blanc and grown in France’s Loire Valley. Adding bubbles really intensifies the aroma and I loved the lemony aftertaste. It could pass for a smart French fizz. Score: 7/10 . As this is a Chardonnay — one of the main grapes used in champagne — you’d think it would work with bubbles. But the wine lost its personality, which it has in spades without bubbles — golden in the glass, with ripe lemon flavours. Score: 4/10 . This Spanish wine is a juicy beast loaded with red fruit flavours. Add bubbles and you have a rose that tastes divine. The colour is precious-stone pink and with bubbles looks even more appealing. This could easily pass for a £10 bubbly. Score: 10/10 . Not even a blast of gas could perk this up. In fact, there’s a medicinal taste and the big bubbles don’t make it go down any easier. Don’t waste your gas. In fact, don’t waste your money in the first place. Score: 1/10 . I’m strangely fond of this. Get past the blue bottle and inside is a lovely light white with a touch of sweetness. It already has a slight spritz, so does it need another blast of bubbles? Heston may disagree but I prefer it unadulterated. Score: 5/10 . Bottle your own bubbly: Chef Heston Blumenthal fooled members of the public into thinking they were drinking champagne after putting a £5.25 bottle of Blue Nun through a SodaSteam . This really does what it says on the label. It’s a crisp, floral wine and so works well with the bubbles — it has instant aromatic appeal. The flavours are crisper than Prosecco, but it’s refreshingly good. Score: 9/10 . This Spanish rose is bright and juicy, and the colour is to die for. Sweetheart pink, with strawberry and raspberry flavours, the bubbles create a taste explosion! The colour is more intense than many pink Proseccos. Turn the lights down and your guests will never know. Score: 9/10 . As a long-time champagne lover, I thought it was impossible to produce anything nearly as good. But I’m converted. This can’t give you instant champagne. But it will make cheap wine bubbilicious. Overall, the single grapes worked best. The only thing missing in most cases was the pop of a cork!SodaStream £49.99-149.99,  sodastream.co.uk .","Chef Jamie Oliver says carbonating cheap wine makes decent fizz .

"By . Daniel Martin . Lives are at risk because of a desperate shortage of MRI scanners in the NHS to diagnose cancer, an international report has found. In a bitter irony, it was UK scientists who were instrumental in inventing the scanners which are now credited with saving lives throughout the world. Yet we have fewer of them than almost all other Western countries – and even developing countries such as Turkey and former Communist states such as Slovakia. Short supply:Picture posed by models. The UK has fewer scanners than almost all other Western countries - and even developing countries such as Turkey and former Communist states such as Slovakia . Out of the 32 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which represents industrialised nations, the UK stands 26th. Our record is even worse on CT scanners – also invented by British scientists – on which we stand 30th out of 32. Only Hungary and Mexico are below us. The figures come weeks after it was revealed suspected cancer sufferers are waiting longer for diagnosis on the NHS, reducing their chances of recovery. The NHS recommends no one should wait longer than six weeks for a diagnostic test. But in April, almost 17,000 patients waited longer – more than double the total in the same month last year and the highest for six years. Some 2,439 waited too long for MRI scans, compared with 374 at the time of the last election in 2010; with 859 waiting too long for CT scans, compared with 215 in 2010. Despite billions being pumped into the NHS in recent years, Britain’s record on cancer survival is still among the worst in Europe. British scientists are credited with developing the cancer-detecting scanners which are now more prevalent around the world than they are here. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) uses magnetism to build a picture of inside the body, while CT (computed tomography) uses radiation. MRI is best for diagnosing tumours in the brain, bones and soft tissues. For other cancers, doctors may call for a CT scan. The first commercially viable CT scanner was invented by Sir Godfrey Hounsfield in London, where the first brain scan in the world was carried out on October 1, 1971. Meanwhile, a team led by Scottish professor John Mallard built the first full-body MRI scanner in Aberdeen. On August 28 1980 it obtained the first clinically useful image of a patient’s internal tissues, identifying a tumour. Last week it emerged that, despite not having the money for cancer scanners, tens of millions are spent a year on cosmetic surgery. Mike Hobday, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘This report suggests we are at a further disadvantage.’ Roger Goss, of Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s not surprising we can’t afford modern equipment, after we negotiated a contract that enhanced doctors’ pay to such a degree all funds go on staff costs.’ The OECD figures come in its Health At A Glance 2013 report, which warned: ‘If there are too few [MRI and CT] units, this may lead to access problems in terms of geographic proximity or waiting times.’ The report shows the UK has only 5.9 MRI units per million people, less than half the OECD average of 13.3. This is dramatically below the 23.7 in Italy and 46.9 in Japan – one of the countries with the longest life expectancy. Even in Turkey there are 10.5 MRI scanners per million. Britain’s ranking of 26th out of 32 is below Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Portugal. Only Australia, Poland, Chile, Hungary, Israel and Mexico are below us. On CT scanners we are 30th out of 32 countries, in front of only Hungary and Mexico. The numbers concern only NHS scanners. NHS England said: ‘The situation over the last few years has improved in terms of numbers of machines and an increase in the trained work force.’","British scientists were instrumental in inventing life-saving MRI scanners .

Alex Salmond’s top advisers have held a crisis summit on their referendum campaign as panic sweeps through the Scottish Government. The Daily Mail can reveal that civil servants were ordered to raid the public purse and launch an unprecedented advertising blitz in a desperate bid to close the gap on the No campaign. Mr Salmond’s most senior political aides, the Scottish Government’s top mandarins and heads of the communications department attended the emergency meeting on Thursday, which was convened in less than 24 hours. Fearing they have been massively ‘out-gunned’ by the Westminster Government, the SNP administration now plans to send a pro-independence document to every household in Scotland at a likely cost to taxpayers of more than £700,000. They are also set to follow the UK Government’s lead and bombard the Google internet search engine with adverts, boost their social media presence on sites such as Facebook and Twitter and engage more with businesses and organisations. Attempts will be made to target online adverts at youngsters and women, who are among the most hostile groups to separation. And the Mail understands that several SNP politicians have been told they must curtail their summer holidays to focus on the battle to destroy the Union. The dramatic increase in activity comes after recent opinion polls gave the No campaign a 20-point lead over Yes, with just over 80 days to go until the referendum on September 18. Ewan Crawford, Mr Salmond’s ‘senior special adviser’ on constitutional issues, was behind the crisis summit, while other key players included special adviser Liz Lloyd, policy executive Martin McDermott of the elections and constitution division, and head of news Fiona Wilson. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who is leading the government’s referendum campaign, was urgently briefed on the outcome and – in a desperate attempt to distract from the Mail’s revelations – rushed out a press release announcing a ‘major public information campaign’ at 6.30pm last night. Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie said: 'This crisis summit shows the nationalist government knows its assertions and bluster isn't cutting the mustard in the face of the considered, factual case to remain in the UK. Top Yes campaign officials are expected to spend more than £700,000 on the blitz after a recent poll showed the No campaign had a 20-point lead (file pic) 'Alex Salmond's rushed PR strategy won't cover up the fundamental risks of independence that his White Paper failed to address. 'With only weeks left they are running around like headless chickens desperately grasping for the appropriate wheeze that will win then their long sought after dream. It shows how desperate they have become.' Anas Sarwar, deputy leader of Scottish Labour, said: 'The nationalists' campaign looks to be in meltdown because the majority of Scots are seeing through their bluster and assertions and deciding we are better together. 'The SNP are running out of time to persuade Scots to break up the country and no matter how much they spend on advertising, their message of division and grievance is being rejected.' The crisis meeting comes after Better Together board members held their own emergency talks in March, as exclusively revealed by the Scottish Daily Mail. They dramatically reversed the campaign tactics and a more positive message was adopted as part of a major advertising drive. At the time, the gap in the polls had narrowed significantly to just a few percentage points. An emergency meeting was convened in less than 24 hours to discuss the future of the Yes campaign with just over 80 days to go before the referendum on September 18 . But the latest poll, published earlier this month by YouGov, found that 53 per cent of adults plan to vote No, up two points since March, while support for Yes has slipped from 37 per cent to 36 per cent. As well as a concerted effort from Labour to defeat independence, the Tory/LibDem government has produced more than 2.5million 16-page publications, which are being delivered to every household in Scotland. The initiative cost taxpayers £720,000 and the Scottish Government will launch a similar mailshot in early August, after the Glasgow Commonwealth Games are over. Paid-for Google adverts will specifically be targeted at young and female voters, the Mail understands, while there will be ‘promoted Tweets’ – which are essentially adverts on Twitter. Miss Sturgeon said last night: 'We want people to be armed with the facts before they vote, which is why we are stepping up our public information campaign in the coming weeks. 'This will match the efforts of the UK Government in every way. The Tory-led Westminster Government has been using public funds to push their anti-independence message, and it is important that that is directly countered.'","Poll showed No to independence campaign with 20 point lead over Yes .

"By . Snejana Farberov . Scary Poppins: Evelyn Pillow, 85, described by a neighbor as caring and polite, has been convicted of assaulting a baby boy while caring for him last September and sentenced to 400 hours of community service . An 85-year-old Virginia nanny has been convicted of assaulting an infant she had been babysitting. Evelyn Faye Pillow appeared in Henrico Circuit Court Friday, admitting that there was sufficient evidence to convict her on a misdemeanor assault charge. The abuse occurred last September while the octogenarian was caring for a little boy. Medical experts were prepared to testify that the months-old child showed classic signs of shaken baby syndrome. As part of the plea agreement, Pillow was ordered to perform 400 hours of community service. She also received a 12-month suspended sentence and was barred from being alone with children. Mrs Pillow, of Highland Springs, called 911 in September 2013 to report that the baby boy in her care was unresponsive. The infant suffered damage to his eyes and brain, but according to his family he has since recovered. The victim’s loved ones sat in the courtroom Friday, many of them in tears, as Evelyn Pillow learned her fate, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Deputy Commonwealth’s Attorney Nancy Oglesby delivered the family's impact statement, saying that for the first 24 hours after the assault the child's condition was touch-and-go, and that no one knew at that point if he would ever wake up. The little boy spent five days in the ICU before he was cleared to return home. Oglesby told the court that the child showed signs of prior brain injury inflicted upon him within the time frame of his care by Pillow, but there is no proof that the 85-year-old nanny was responsible for the trauma. The news came as a shock to Pillow's next-door neighbor William Lynchesky, who said the 85-year-old was like a grandmother to him. ‘She watched my child for about four years straight and she still sees my daughter whenever we can,’ he told CBS 6. Describing Pillow as caring and very polite, Lynchesky suggested that perhaps there is more to the story than the public is being led to believe. ‘She’s a good woman and I think that something like this might have been a mistake, or something bad could have happened prior that we don’t know,’ he said.","Evelyn Pillow, 85, of Virginia, sentenced to 400 hours of community service and barred from being alone with children .

"By . Leesa Smith . Children as young as three develop an awareness of different body shapes and sizes with many perceiving that bigger is better. Although only in the early stages, the Children’s Body Image Development Study shows that children aged from three to eight recognise different body images. Many children expressed the desire to be larger – associating it with the positive aspect of growing up, in the La Trobe University study, which is the largest of its kind in the world. Children as young as three have an awareness of body images, with almost 38 per cent of boys and 30 per cent of girls wishing to be a different shape, and most wanting to be bigger, a Melbourne study shows . Almost 38 per cent of boys and 30 per cent of girls wished to be a different body shape with most wanting to be bigger, and few acknowledged that weight loss was a possible concept. The results showed that boys were more influenced by their father’s attitude about body image than girls were about their mother’s attitude. The young participants were shown pictures of different kinds of bodies and asked about positive and negative characteristics, and what body shape they would want. Dr Stephanie Damiano, from the School of Psychological Science, said the next part of the research would look at the attitudes of a children’s friends about their own body image ideas, and also what role the media played. ‘It’s not just about eating disorders, it’s really about body acceptance,’ she told The Herald Sun.

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . More than one million Britons suffer food poisoning every year, with supermarket chicken named as the biggest offender . More than one million Britons suffer food poisoning every year, with supermarket chicken named as the biggest offender. A huge problem of sickness, diarrhoea and vomiting linked to dirty food and poor hygiene in the home and restaurants is revealed in new figures from the Food Standards Agency. Apart from the personal misery, the cost of treating the victims of this epidemic in terms of the NHS and time off work is put at more than £1.8billion a year. The watchdog names campylobacter, which is most often found on raw chicken, as the biggest cause of food poisoning, ahead of Clostridium perfringens and the norovirus, which is commonly associated with shellfish. It says that salmonella, which historically is linked to contaminated eggs but is also found in fresh produce, causes the most admissions to hospital at about 2,500 a year. In most cases contamination with campylobacter and other food bugs leads to a short-term tummy bug. But they can have serious complications including paralysis and even death. The agency has re-calibrated the way it measures sickness linked to food to provide a new – and more reliable – estimate of the true scale of the problem. It reports: ‘There are more than 500,000 cases of food poisoning a year from known pathogens. This figure would more than double if it included food poisoning cases from unknown pathogens.’ Significantly, it said: ‘Poultry meat was the food linked to the most cases of food poisoning, with an estimated 244,000 cases every year.’ Agency officials are so concerned about campylobacter contamination of chicken that it has launched a survey of the meat on sale in supermarkets with the intention of regularly publishing a ‘name and shame’ list. The first of these surveys is expected to be published in the next fortnight and the hope is that it will shame traders, forcing them to take more action to protect their customers. The new estimates of food poisoning were produced by a team from the University of Liverpool. Lead researcher, Professor Sarah O’Brien, said: ‘These findings will help the FSA to target its resources more effectively in tackling food poisoning. ‘They confirm that the FSA is right to put campylobacter at the top of its priority list. A watchdog has named campylobacter, which is most often found on raw chicken, as the biggest cause of food poisoning . ‘It is the biggest food safety problem we have and more needs to be done to tackle it.’ The British Retail Consortium insists that supermarkets are already tackling the problem. A spokesman said: ‘Retailers fully support the FSA’s objective to reduce campylobacter and are investing in their supply chains working with farmers and processors to identify controls. ‘Measures implemented include introducing leak-proof packaging on all whole birds to control the spread of any contamination and provision of on-pack labelling which advises consumers on how to handle and prepare poultry. ‘Campylobacter is killed by normal cooking so providing people prepare chicken properly and follow sensible hygiene practices they’re at no risk.’ After poultry, the next greatest food poisoning risks are vegetables, fruit, nuts and seeds, responsible for 48,000 cases, followed by beef and lamb, with 43,000.","Supermarket chicken named biggest offender as a million suffer food poisoning every year .

"By . Dan Bloom . There was chaos for tens of thousands of commuters tonight after a man trespassed on the tracks of one of Britain's busiest railway stations. The man, wearing white shorts, a white Adidas T-shirt and a black 'bum bag' is believed to have walked off the end of platforms 13 and 14 at London's Waterloo station at 4.40pm today. All trains in and out of the 19-platform terminal were cancelled for 45 minutes while police and paramedics retrieved the man and walked him back to the station. Trespass: Police escort a man who trespassed on the tracks near London's Waterloo Station, blocking all 19 platforms for almost an hour and disrupting tens of thousands of commuters travelling home . Concerns: The man was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital for assessment . Not a perfect Friday night: Waterloo station was still packed hours after the incident with services in disarray . He was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital for assessment. But the lines being blocked for such a long period during the rush hour meant there was a crush of thousands of people inside the station. It meant chaos for those who use Waterloo as the sole point of departure for huge tracts of south west London alongside destinations like Southampton and Portsmouth. The closures also affected the thousands of sports fans travelling in and out of Wimbledon for the tennis championships, where Andy Murray thrashed Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets this afternoon. A South West Trains spokesman said: 'We are sorry for the extensive . disruption to services today. Rush hour: The incident happened at 4.40pm on a Friday, when Waterloo is usually already heaving with people . Where to now? Passengers were delayed for several hours after the incident, which backed up all lines . 'A serious trespass incident at London . Waterloo caused all lines to be blocked for around 45 minutes. 'This . length of closure has caused significant disruption to all South West . Trains routes. 'Stations across the network are very busy, customers will have to wait for some time before boarding trains. 'There is disruption to services running on all routes.' A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'Officers were called to Waterloo station at 4.40pm on Friday 27 June after reports of a man trespassing on the line. Heating up: There was nothing for stranded passengers but to bake in the afternoon sun under the glass roof . 'Officers attended alongside colleagues from the London Ambulance Service. 'A man was detained under the Mental Health Act and taken to hospital for assessment.' The disruption came just a day after Waterloo - the country's biggest railway station - had to be evacuated. The entire station was cleared after a fire alarm was set off at lunchtime yesterday. It turned out to be a false alarm - but still wreaked havoc for thousands of passengers. Advice to passengers on Friday evening: . Dorking passengers can join Southern . services from London Victoria/Clapham Junction or use alternative trains . to Epsom and change there for Southern services. Chessington South passengers may need to travel to alternative stations then use buses. Hampton Court passengers may need to travel to Kingston or Subiton then use buses. No trains will run through from London Waterloo to . Exeter this evening. Until then Exeter/Salisbury trains will only run . between Basingstoke and Exeter/Salisbury. Customers will need to use . alternative services between London Waterloo and Basingstoke and change . there to complete their journey, but connections . cannot be guaranteed.

"By . Corey Charlton . The RSPCA has seized 26 live chickens from the backyard of an Indian restaurant following a remarkable discovery made during a health inspection. The birds were first discovered by Wyre Council staff behind the Indian restaurant Saffron, in Poulton, Lancashire after public tip-offs triggered the inspection. However, the restaurant owner has claimed he had no idea the chickens were on the premises and suggested his business has been deliberately targeted. Saffron restaurant in Poulton where RSPCA officers seized 26 live chickens from the property's backyard . Owner Rakmat Ullah, who has managed Saffron for 10 years, said: 'Unfortunately, and I don’t know who did it, but someone has planted some chickens in boxes in our back yard. I never expected to see anything like that in our yard.' Officials found no evidence that poultry was being slaughtered on site. Mr Ullah said he was in the middle of transferring the lease to a new manager. He added: 'I wasn’t at the restaurant, but I was called by the environmental health team during their inspection to say they had found some chickens. 'I was amazed. I didn’t know anything about any chickens, but when I got there I saw seven or eight boxes with them in. 'Then the RSPCA arrived and it was like a raid - they had three vans where they put all the chickens in cages. I had no idea what was happening.'

"By . Mia De Graaf . A festival-goer has died after suffering a suspected reaction to ketamine at Glastonbury. The 26-year-old man, from Reading in Berkshire, died this morning as the first official day of music got under way at Worthy Farm in Somerset. He was taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary in a 'life-threatening condition' on Wednesday. The tragic: A 26-year-old man has died today after suffering an adverse reaction to the illegal drug ketamine when he arrived at Glastonbury festival on Worthy Farm in Pilton, Somerset, on Wednesday . Avon and Somerset Police tweeted: 'Unfortunately the man taken ill after a suspected reaction to ketamine has died this morning. 'His family are aware and being supported.' Police said it is not thought that the batch of the Class B drug the man took was contaminated, but that he suffered an adverse reaction to it. Reaction: Police said the batch of the drug was not believed to be contaminated but the festival-goer, from Reading, suffered 'an individual reaction'. He was taken ill overnight and died at Bristol Royal Infirmary . Ketamine is a powerful general anaesthetic that can cause the sensation of a near-death experience, but deaths linked to the substance are rare. Legally used for operations on humans and animals, it gives recreational users a 'floaty' feeling but can also lead to a bad trip known as the 'K-hole'. Costing around £20 a gram on the street, it can be addictive and includes among its effects paralysis of the muscles, loss of feeling in the body and a distorted sense of reality. It can also cause hallucinations, agitation, panic attacks and impairment in short and long-term memory, and frequent use has been associated with depression. The drug was regraded from a class C to a more serious class B controlled drug earlier this month amid growing concern over its impact on the health of long-term users. Physical damage from long-term use includes serious bladder problems, with some heavy users even having to get their bladders surgically removed. A spokesman said: 'The family of the man had been informed of his condition yesterday. His death is not considered suspicious. 'At this stage we believe this was an individual reaction to ketamine and was not from a bad batch of the drug.' A 67-year-old woman died at the site on Wednesday night from natural causes. Her death is not being treated as suspicious. Kicking off the official music today, a 17-piece Japanese orchestra made an enthusiastic effort to banish the bad weather. Turtle Island got proceedings off to a . rousing start on the Pyramid Stage, drawing a small crowd to their . pulsating punk-rock beats. As . steady rain fell on the site, many appeared reluctant to leave the . relative comfort of their tents, while others tentatively ventured out . in wellies and anoraks to see just how much mud they might have to . contend with. Although the rain - expected to continue throughout the day - was not welcome to many, stall holders charging £15 a time for wellies and waterproofs were enjoying a roaring trade. Also performing on the Pyramid Stage later today will be Elbow, Lily Allen and Rudimental, while acts on other stages include Haim, MIA and Jurassic 5. Police said 85 crimes were reported within the first 48 hours of the festival opening its gates on Wednesday morning, a 30 per cent decrease on last year. About half of these were property thefts, with 30 people arrested so far.","Man, 26, taken to Bristol Royal Infirmary after taking drug on Wednesday .

"By . Dan Bloom . A dominatrix and two friends who were accused of torturing one of her clients at knifepoint have been cleared of all charges. The anonymous man was visiting 20-year-old Sinead Nijjer - who he had paid for oral sex twice before - when he claimed he was jumped by her friends Rico Awad and Leam Ryan. He told a court that he feared his penis would be cut off, during an ordeal in which he was forced to suck Miss Nijjer's toes and told his face would be scalded with boiling water. Cleared: Sinead Nijjer, 20, had been accused along with two friends of torturing a man who had previously paid her for sex at her flat in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire - but today the trio were cleared of all charges . But Mr Awad, 21, insisted on a different version of events - that an argument had broken out when the client enjoyed an hour-long domination appointment then refused to pay. Today a jury took less than two hours to clear the trio of false imprisonment, robbery and common assault. The trio had already been cleared of blackmail and causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. The . jury also cleared a fourth man, 22-year-old Mohammed Awan from . Aylesbury, of perverting the course of justice after he was claimed he . offered the man £1,500 to drop his allegations. During the trial the jury was told the alleged victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was held at knifepoint while he was forced to dance around in nothing but women’s underwear. He also claimed he had his face cleaned with a toilet brush - all while being filmed, and was threatened the footage would appear online. Claims: Sinead Nijjer (left) and Rico Awad (right) said Mr Awad came to the flat after the man refused to pay . Speaking from behind a screen, the man said he had visited Miss Nijjer's home on July 23 last year in the belief she would have non-domination sex with him for free, after he previously paid £50 for oral sex twice. He told the jury that when he got to her flat, he was jumped on by two men including one wearing a balaclava and holding a knife. 'The man said if you do what we tell you then you won’t get hurt,' said the alleged victim. 'I was kissing her feet for maybe 15 seconds. She took a sip of her drink and sprayed it all over me. 'They were getting a buzz out of the whole thing... They were laughing all the way through. I was scared. 'What happened was real... I still have to live with it today.' The man said he was able to escape when he exaggerated breathing difficulties he was having and one of his alleged captors called 999. But Miss Nijjer said the alleged victim had come to her flat for a domineering session which he then refused to pay for. Mr Ryan, 22, of no fixed address, said he was only at the flat in case things got violent between Miss Nijjer and the man, which he said they did when he refused to pay. Missing: Miss Nijjer had not attended the four-day trial and a warrant remained in place for her arrest . And Mr Awad, from High Wycombe, said he only arrived at the flat after the argument over money began, and he was the one who called 999 when the man began having breathing difficulties. In court the alleged victim was accused of making up the story to cover his embarrassment after paramedics found him in the flat wearing just women’s underwear. He denied wanting to engage in a domination session, denied taking part in an hour-long appointment and denied telling Miss Nijjer: 'That was ****, I’m not paying.' But the jury took just one hour and 40 minutes to clear all four defendants of all charges. There were smiles from Mr Awan and Mr Awad in the dock and Mr Awad gave the jury a thumbs-up. It came after Judge Francis . Sheridan dismissed a blackmail charge against Miss Nijjer, Mr Ryan and . Mr Awad, saying there was not enough evidence. He also instructed the jury to find the trio not guilty of causing a person to engage in sexual activity without consent. Mr Ryan and Miss Nijjer did not appear at the trial, and warrants remained in place for their arrests. The pair have not been seen at Aylesbury Crown Court  since last year, despite numerous court hearings being held ahead of the four-day trial.","Client visited Sinead Nijjer, 20, at her flat in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire .

"Pamela Stephenson has told how she rushed husband Billy Connolly to hospital with a potentially deadly blood  clot – while he cracked jokes about her. Bundling the veteran comedian into a taxi, she then became the butt of his gags as poor roads made the mercy dash bumpy. Ignoring the pain he was suffering, the Scottish funnyman turned to her and said: ‘Uh-oh, he drives just like you, Pamsy!’ Even though he was going through so much pain, he never stopped being his hilarious, curmudgeonly, adorable self, Pamela Stephenson revealed about her husband Billy Connolly . Former Strictly finalist Miss Stephenson, 64, was speaking for the first time about Connolly’s brush with death – which followed surgery to remove his prostate after he was diagnosed with cancer. She told the Mail’s Weekend magazine: ‘I said, “Billy, I’m saving your life here, stop going on about my driving!” ‘Even though he was going through so much pain, he never stopped being his hilarious, curmudgeonly, adorable self. Fortunately I don’t take it personally; I just think  it’s funny that he’d choose that moment to run down my driving.’ Quick-thinking by the actress turned psychologist may have saved the life of her 71-year-old husband. Unable to get doctors to listen to her initially, Miss Stephenson eventually got through to an intern who told her to get the father of five to a hospital immediately. The medical problem resurfaced when he was filming this ITV documentary about how we deal with death called Billy Connolly's Big Send-Off . Doctors dealt with the clot, but the problem resurfaced later when he was filming his ITV documentary about how we deal with death, Billy Connolly’s Big Send-Off. Luckily their daughter Amy, 28 – a researcher on the show – recognised what was happening and he was taken back to hospital. ‘Thank God Amy was with him,’ said Miss Stephenson. ‘She recognised what was happening and they  got him back to hospital to deal with  the clot. ‘He’s had all his check-ups and he’s in great shape now.’ It was Miss Stephenson who also persuaded him to see a doctor in September last year which led to what he has described as his ‘funny week’ – in which he was prescribed a hearing aid, pills for heartburn and told on the same day that he had Parkinson’s and prostate cancer. But she found the strength to deal with the emotional impact on her close-knit family – the couple’s three daughters Daisy, Amy and Scarlett, and Connolly’s son Jamie and daughter Cara by his first marriage. ‘It was important to be strong for Billy and our family, very much so,’ said the former Not The Nine O’Clock News star. ‘That’s what marriage is about: you have your ups and downs and you have to see each other through them. I also understand the psychology of illness, and I knew it was not going to be easy on me either. Let’s face it, he [Connolly] was a terrible patient! But you can’t blame someone for that when they’re going through something that you’re not.’ New Zealand-born Miss Stephenson describes herself as ‘a glass half-full person, while Billy’s a bit the other way, so we have a good balance’. ‘The Parkinson’s is mild but Billy still worries about it,’ she added. ‘It’s actually bigger in his mind than it is in reality; he’s always watching for symptoms.’ In the wide-ranging interview Miss Stephenson also revealed she still feels jealous if her husband works with attractive female co-stars and disclosed that former Comic Strip colleagues Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders once said ‘mean things’ about her.","The blood clot resurfaced while he filmed Billy Connolly's Big Send-off .

"By . Jacinta Taylor . Paedophile: Tony Marsden sent thousands of messages to the youngster . The mother of a 14-year-old girl bombarded with many hundreds of sexually explicit Facebook messages from a paedophile trainee teacher has reacted with fury and disbelief after he was spared jail. Tony Marsden sent thousands of messages to the youngster which  at first used charm and flattery to groom but quickly grew explicit and sinister. When the girl’s mother found out what he was doing it took her 1,450 sheets of A4 paper to print out the vile transcript. Yet a judge handed down a suspended jail sentence, saying he was impressed by ‘powerful mitigation’, including glowing references from a former private school head, a school chaplain and a GP. The girl’s mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told The Mail on Sunday: ‘He should never have been freed. I do not think they should be able to take into account character references for paedophiles. The messages were pornographic. My blood ran cold when I saw them – I was horrified at what I was reading.’ The Mail on Sunday has seen the sickening catalogue of messages which reveal how the 23-year-old trainee primary teacher from Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, embarked on a campaign to lure the impressionable teenager to follow his bidding after befriending her at a summer camp where he was an instructor. The majority of the messages are too disgusting to print here. In an early grooming text to the girl, who had just celebrated her 14th birthday, Marsden tells her: ‘You are just amazing, you really are.’ Soon after, he promises her that he will ‘make you toast in the morning, make you laugh and smile and never hurt you and always be there to catch you and everything’. But the following day he pleads: ‘Tell me what you are doing, will make me so horny.’ In other messages he begs her to send photos of her in a bikini and tries to make her touch herself sexually, writing: ‘Just try this one xx i slowly run my hand back up he [sic] inside of your leg before .  .  . xxx’ Bombarded: Excerpts from three of the messages, most of which are too explicit to be printed . Then he demands: ‘Just try xxx I want to know what you’d do to me .  .  .’ Then he says: ‘Or you just want me to make you ... and you can .  .  . Xx’ The girl changed from a confident, happy, outgoing teenager to becoming increasingly withdrawn and secretive as the messages from Marsden became more graphic and insistent. It was this sudden personality change which alerted her parents that something was wrong. Her mother checked her daughter’s Facebook account and was horrified by the quantity of filth Marsden had been sending. She said: ‘Tony Marsden put on this facade of being a perfectly nice man, but underneath it all he was trying to gain my daughter’s trust for his own gratification. ‘She is blameless, but feels as if she has done something wrong. Judge Simon Hickey suspended Marsden's sentence after he heard glowing references . ‘I never imagined that she would be in danger from someone that she knew and who came from a family with decent, hard-working parents. ‘I had always thought that I had been very vigilant when it came to my daughter’s access to the internet, making sure that she only accepted friend requests from people she knew and taking her laptop and phone off her at night.’ Judge Simon Hickey gave Marsden credit for pleading guilty to inciting a child to commit a sexual act and slashed one third off a mandatory two-year custodial sentence and then suspended the remaining 16-month sentence for two years. The Newcastle Crown Court judge told Marsden: ‘You have the support of your family and good references, including one from a reverend. You have committed a serious offence, but I think it’s highly unlikely you will trouble the court again.’ Asked yesterday about his sentencing, Judge Hickey said: ‘I am afraid I cannot comment.’ Leading child protection agencies slammed the sentencing. Jon Brown at the NSPCC said: ‘The victim’s family understandably expected a tougher punishment. Sexual abuse by its very nature is hidden so it’s unlikely that even people close to the individual would know their true character.’ And Esther Rantzen, founder of the NSPCC’s ChildLine, said: ‘I can absolutely understand the fury of the mother. How she must have felt when she discovered what this man was doing to her daughter. ‘I am not sure that judges have a real understanding of paedophilia, which is an addiction.’ Bharti Patel, chief executive of child protection charity ECPAT UK, said: ‘Any leniency on sentencing sends out the wrong message on the severity of the crime of grooming and could deter young people from reporting such instances.’ The mother initially contacted  the NSPCC for advice who in turn passed the matter on to police. Detective Inspector John Douglas said: ‘This man has abused his position of authority and trust by sending a youth explicit messages via social media.’ Marsden was ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register and barred rom working with children for  five years. He has also been suspended from his university course and will not  be allowed to continue his teacher training.","Primary trainee Tony Marsden, 23, sent explicit messages on Facebook .

"By . James Tozer . A female chemistry teacher has been banned from the classroom for life after bombarding a schoolboy with thousands of sexually explicit texts. Victoria Ayris, 30, used the social network WhatsApp to send photographs and intimate details of her life to the Year 11 boy after they exchanged mobile numbers. After the headteacher became suspicious, she sent the boy a panic-stricken text begging him to delete everything, pleading: ‘Don’t ask why, just do it.’ A chemistry teacher has been banned from the classroom for life after . bombarding a Year 11 schoolboy with thousands of sexually explicit texts (posed by model) Miss Ayris resigned from Castlebrook High School in Unsworth, Greater Manchester last year and has now received a life ban from the National College for Teaching and Leadership. A professional conduct panel heard the ‘outstanding’ teacher sent 2,000 messages to the pupil – then aged 15 or 16 – over nine months in 2012. Police later concluded that no offence had been committed, but the panel said the incident – which became ‘the subject of rumour and gossip’ among pupils and staff’ – amounted to serious misconduct. Miss Ayris, of Accrington, Lancashire, apologised for her actions. The teacher had joined Castlebrook High School in Unsworth, near Bury, Greater Manchester, in 2008 and was ‘well-regarded’ as ‘an outstanding, hard-working teacher whose results had been consistently good,’ a report to the panel said. But in February 2012 she exchanged mobile phone numbers with ‘Pupil A’ - then aged 15 or 16 – and over the next nine months sent him 2,000 messages via WhatsApp. They would exchange scores of messages each day which included ‘sexual and graphic’ content as well as photographs of herself, although these were not sexual in nature, the panel was told. Over the months, their relationship became ‘the subject of rumour and gossip amongst other pupils and staff at the school,’ its report found. Victoria Ayris, 30, used the social networking site to share intimate details of her life and photographs with the boy. When the headteacher became suspicious, she begged the boy to delete the messages . Eventually another pupil informed headteacher Anthony Roberts about the texts, and in November he ordered her to stop contacting him, but she lied that she didn’t have his number, the report said. However later that day she sent the boy a message reading: ‘Delete my phone number and all messages including WhatsApp — don’t ask why just do it — your mum will want to see your phone when you get home.’ Miss Ayris initially failed to provide Mr Roberts with details of all the texts the pair had swapped, but later handed them over and in April last year resigned from the 780-pupil specialist science and technology college. Police studied the phone records and text message content and interviewed her under caution but later concluded that no offence had been committed. She was not represented at the hearing but the panel was told she admitted the allegation, apologised and said she would not repeat such actions in future, while the pupil’s parents were supportive for helping him during ‘a difficult time in his life’. The panel nevertheless said her actions constituted misconduct of a serious nature, adding:  ‘The panel is satisfied that the conduct of Miss Ayris fell significantly short of the standards expected of the profession.’ Miss Ayris, of Accrington, Lancashire, who is now understood to be in in Australia, can ask to have the ban reversed after two years. A spokesman for Castlebrook High said: ‘When the allegations of misconduct were raised, the matter was immediately reported to the local authority. ‘In accordance with procedure, the teacher was suspended pending investigation of these allegations, and she subsequently resigned in April, 2013. ‘Safeguarding of pupils in all our schools remains paramount, and all of our schools have robust safeguarding procedures, which in this case resulted in a referral to the teachers’ regulatory body and dealt with appropriately.’ Last summer 64 per cent of its pupils achieved grades of C and above in their maths and English GCSEs, slightly above the national average.","Chemistry teacher Victoria Ayris, 30, used WhatsApp to contact young boy .

"By . James Slack . In hiding: Former U.S. spy and intelligence leaker Edward Snowden is holed up in Russia . Britain's ability to track terrorists and crime gangs has been severely damaged as a result of the intelligence leaks by ex-U.S. spy Edward Snowden, the Home Secretary revealed yesterday. One year on from the whistleblower’s actions, police and security services are finding it harder to monitor the electronic communications used by fanatics and master criminals, Theresa May warned. She said the issue must be addressed – raising the prospect of new laws to help GCHQ, police and others to intercept emails and phone calls. Mrs May told the Royal United Services Institute: ‘People talk about national security versus civil liberties, but you can only enjoy your liberty if you have security.’ Fugitive Snowden has been accused of compromising secret surveillance techniques by passing up to 1.7million stolen top secret documents to The Guardian. It is estimated a quarter of the serious criminals being tracked by GCHQ have fallen off the radar following the leak – described by security officials as the biggest in modern history – because they have been alerted to the methods being used to track them. One senior intelligence source said the UK’s electronic eavesdropping centre had also suffered a ‘sizeable reduction’ in its ability to gather intelligence on terrorists. Ministers have also been hit by a European Court ruling which means that internet and communications companies can no longer be forced to store data such as phone records. This information is vital to police and intelligence agencies in establishing who a suspect has made contact with and when. Mrs May suggested there was a need for a charm offensive to repair the damage done by Snowden’s claims that there is mass surveillance of the public. ‘There is a need to get out there more generally the importance of intelligence in fighting all of these national security threats,’ she said. ‘We will try to find innovative ways of getting the importance of these activities to members of the public.’ Mrs May has previously run into political trouble by promoting plans for a so-called snoopers’ charter, which would allow the police and security services to access every internet click as well as phone calls and emails. The last proposal was scuppered when Nick Clegg withdrew Liberal Democrat support. Warning: The issue was raised by Home Secretary Theresa May in a speech at the Royal United Services Institute today (pictured) But Home Office sources stress the current issue is about protecting the capabilities the police and security services already have to monitor electronic communications, not giving them extra powers. Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, has said the disclosures by Snowden, who is holed up in Russia, had led to some of GCHQ’s operations being shut down. He said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that substantial damage to UK security has been caused by the Snowden revelations... I think it inevitable that many of those who have something to hide will have... changed their communication methods as a result.’ U.S. National Security Agency deputy director Rick Ledgett has said the stolen files contained ‘the keys to the kingdom’ and MI5 director general Andrew Parker called Snowden’s actions a ‘gift to terrorists’. Snowden claims the U.S. government’s actions were a ‘threat to democracy’. Much of the stolen information was revealed by The Guardian and The Washington Post. But there are mounting suspicions he had been recruited – unwittingly or not – by foreign agents. Intelligence chiefs believe he is now passing military details to President Putin’s spies.","Home Secretary said issue of Edward Snowden's leaks must be addressed .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Two very different men in two very similar cars will contest the 50th grand prix to be staged at Silverstone – the race that could go a long way to defining the lives and careers of Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. Hamilton is largely a public figure, a result of his craving for fame and the modern media’s insatiable appetite for celebrity gossip. This week he told his 2.17million Twitter followers that he spent a romantic break in Venice with his Pussycat Dolls girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger to celebrate six years (mostly) together and had a lunch on a yacht in Monaco with A-listers Samuel L Jackson and Magic Johnson. Rivals: Nico Rosberg smiles as he sits next to Lewis Hamilton following his victory at the Austrian Grand Prix . Venice: Hamilton posted a series of pictures from his latest holiday on Twitter this week . He also posted pictures of himself riding his push bike bare-chested. His Twitter account is accompanied by the self-description: ‘H.A.M. until the day I die.’ In a certain nomenclature those initials stand for Hard as a Mother******. Rosberg, more measured and more cerebral, is essentially a private man. Save for a tweet thanking fans for sending him birthday wishes – he turned 29 on Friday – there is no word about his personal life from the moment he finished the Austrian Grand Prix victorious a week ago. That victory put the German 29 points ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Hamilton in what is a private battle for the 2014 World Championship. Rosberg’s advantage is not quite as big as it seems – under the old scoring system, where a win was worth 10 points rather than 25, it would be a lead of about 12, or one victory and a little bit more – but clearly Hamilton needs to stop his rival’s momentum by winning for the first time since the Spanish Grand Prix on May 11. Victorious: Rosberg lifts the trophy after triumphing at the Red Bull Ring in Speilberg, Austria . Playful: Hamilton sprays Rosberg after finishing second behind the German at the Austrian Grand Prix . John Watson, one of only 12 home winners of the British Grand Prix, said: ‘He needs to win this race big time. It is make or break – as important a grand prix for Lewis as any in his career has ever been. He needs to respond to Nico Rosberg’s excellent performances by dominating him in every way, in qualifying and in the race. ‘He needs to reassert himself. It is not an issue of speed. In Austria it was a matter of not quite doing things accurately enough. He was not quite as exact in how he got into the pit box as he could have been, whereas Nico is maxing out on his potential, in his in-lap, his out-lap, pit stop. He is nailing everything. ‘Lewis has always relied on his natural skills. Nico is metronomic.’ Silverstone: Hamilton (pictured) is under pressure to beat Rosberg on home soil . Sir Jackie Stewart, a twice winner of the British Grand Prix and, like Watson, a survivor from the dangerous days of their sport, also sees Hamilton’s over-reliance on God-given skill as the significant difference between the two men. ‘Lewis is a natural,’ said Stewart. ‘But he needs to get away from using only his natural talent, which is in danger of being detrimental to him. All the great drivers have had more than that.’ Stewart himself developed his mind-management long before he got into Formula One. He reached international standard in clay pigeon shooting as a boy, learning that if he missed a target it was gone for ever. You could not recover your position on the next corner. The calmness and calculation of Stewart is more evident in Rosberg, a driver Stewart observed at close quarters during the German’s years at Williams. ‘Nico was not fully developed then,’ he said. ‘He was not quite training as hard as he is now. He has full race distance ability now. He has a very good brain and is totally focused on his motor-racing. There are no distractions. He has been engaged for while and is close to getting married. He is very settled, and that can help performance.’ Helping: Niki Lauda says Hamilton is well-prepared for the British Grand Prix and is motivated to do well . The man trying to help Hamilton is another driving luminary of the Seventies, Niki Lauda, the Mercedes non-executive chairman. Lauda told me yesterday that his British driver is ‘very well balanced, not sad, but motivated’. But Watson is less convinced. ‘Pictures of him having lunch with Samuel L Jackson is great for Hamilton’s management – Simon Fuller and XIX – because it gets their client profile, but at the end of the day it is all about winning the world championship. ‘It would be a brave person to say that his private life is impacting on his professional life, but I don’t know who in the team has the ability to put their arms around Lewis in the way Ross Brawn could and did. ‘Niki’s job is to see Mercedes win. Paddy Lowe (the executive technical director) is a superb engineer but he is not a team principal and Toto Wolff, well, he’s more of a businessman.’ Meeting: Hamilton (right), has lunch with Samuel L Jackson and Magic Johnson in the south of France . Mercedes seem likely to win at Silverstone despite the upturn in Williams’s fortunes at the Red Bull Ring last week because the aerodynamic demands of the Northamptonshire track are better suited to them. That raises the prospect of Hamilton recreating one of the most epic performances ever seen on a British track – his win in the wet in 2008. ‘The British fans are the absolute best in the world and it’s really humbling to see thousands of people out there cheering you on, no matter what the weather or the result,’ he said. Good memories: Hamilton celebrates on the podium at Silverstone after his stunning win in 2008 . ‘When I won in 2008 it was just the best feeling. The gap was about 60 second at the end and I had lapped everyone up to third place, which was just unreal. 'I could never have hoped or dreamed for a race like that, especially at my home grand prix. That has to be one of the best moments of my career. ‘I loved raising that gold trophy in front of the home crowd and I’m determined to get my hands on it again this year.’","Mercedes pair will compete at the 50th grand prix to be held at Silverstone .

"Thousands of soldiers could lose their jobs in a new wave of redundancies set to embarrass the Prime Minister, it has been reported. An announcement is expected to be made next January with the final number of those losing their jobs confirmed in May. The final figure due to be made redundant could reach 3,000. Under plans set out in 2010 the size of the Army will be cut by 20,000 to 82,000 by 2020. Plans to cut 3,000 armed forces jobs are expected to be announced next year, according to reports . An Army source told The Times that David Cameron is keen to avoid the bad publicity that would accompany the announcement of more job losses. Armed forces documents seen by the newspaper reveal that the Army is concerned that the Government could intervene to prevent further job losses. Downing Street is said to prefer to see troop numbers fall through people retiring or leaving of their own accord - while military chiefs want to be able to choose themselves how many redundancies to make. The armed forces redundancy steering group has said the latest round of cuts will see between 2,500 and 2,900 soldiers losing their jobs, with a further 150 RAF staff and 17 medical and dental personnel from the Navy being made redundant, according to the newspaper. Reports of the latest cuts comes after it was announced in June that the size of the Territorial Army will increase from 19,000 to 30,000 by 2018. But Colonel Ian Brazier, a former Army officer, told The Times: 'The ruthless cutting continues but the reserves supposed to be plugging the gap have not yet been recruited.' Prime Minister David Cameron meets  British soldiers after addressing them at Camp Bastion. Under plans set out in 2010 the size of the Army will be cut by 20,000 to 82,000 by 2020 . An MoD spokeswoman confirmed cuts were being considered, but said no decision had yet been made. She said: 'These redundancies are not new and were announced in the strategic defence security review in October 2010 and again in July 2012. 'Following last year's redundancies which were 84 per cent voluntary, we were clear that a fourth tranche, affecting Army personnel and a small number of medical and dental personnel from the Navy and RAF, could be needed. 'Outflow and recruitment rates will be taken into account before any decisions are taken on any final redundancies.' A defence source said: 'It is only natural that ministers would take a close interest in armed forces redundancies and the necessary recruitment process as we restructure the armed forces. 'However the entire armed forces redundancy programme is led by the three single services. 'They are responsible for their own redundancies and ultimately decide on how many people are made redundant.'","Soldiers, RAF staff and Navy medical personnel 'in line for redundancy'

"By . John Drayton . Former Liverpool player and manager Kenny Dalglish is confident the club will not turn their back on Luis Suarez, whom he believes needs help to control his emotions. The Uruguayan was given a four-month ban by FIFA from carrying out any football-related activities after biting Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini in their World Cup clash earlier this week. It is the third time Suarez has been suspended for biting an opponent and Liverpool have faced calls to cut their losses with the controversial striker, despite his outstanding campaign for the Reds last season, when he scored 31 Premier League goals in 33 matches. VIDEO Scroll down to see Uruguay manager Tabarez make a passionate defence of Suarez . The incident: Luis Suarez appears to bite Giorgio Chiellini's shoulder in Uruguay's 1-0 win over Italy . Tooth ache: Suarez fell to the ground and held his teeth after the encounter with Chiellini . Yet Dalglish, who brought Suarez to Anfield from Ajax in January 2011, thinks more understanding needs to be shown to the 27-year-old. The Scot said in his Daily Mirror column: 'It is my belief that when you bring a player to a football club, he becomes your responsibility. You don't just turn you back on a player because he has done something wrong. 'I think you will find that Liverpool will not turn their back on Suarez, whatever the ban FIFA have decided he must serve. Of course it will be a heavy blow if the club has to do without him for the opening months of the season. 'You can't really ask any one person why what happened against Italy happened, because there is only one person who knows and that is Luis - some people have injuries you can't see. 'Sometimes, when people have something wrong with them, just because they don't have a plaster cast on their leg, people think they don't need help.' Arm around the shoulder: Kenny Dalglish brought Suarez to Anfield from Ajax back in January 2011 . Dalglish thinks the punishment is harsh on Liverpool as the incident was out of their control. 'When he was punished by the FA for the biting incident with Branislav Ivanovic and banned from domestic games, he was still allowed to play for his national team,' he added. 'It seems a bit strange, then, that when he is banned for something he did with his national team, his club has to suffer, too.'","Kenny Dalglish confident Liverpool won't turn their back on Luis Suarez .

"By . Ian Ladyman . Follow @@Ian_Ladyman_DM . According to those in Holland, Louis van Gaal has never looked so relaxed. In his home country, meanwhile, his popularity is soaring. This is what good results do, of course. Ten goals in three World Cup games ahead of today’s quarter-final have seen Van Gaal’s team play a central and starring role in the narrative of this tournament. Those players at Manchester United who think that everything will be straight forward under their incoming manager may wish to pause a second, though. Embrace: Louis van Gaal puts an arm around his captain Robin van Persie . Chatty: Van Persie and Kuyt having a discussion in training . As he outlined frankly when questioned by English journalists here yesterday, players must learn to work closely with him if they are to prosper. ‘I don’t think anything is possible without it,’ said Van Gaal, when asked about the importance of unity. ‘I don’t think we can achieve anything without harmony between players and staff. ‘We have this harmony here. All players and staff create harmony and all players and staff are convinced we can progress as far as possible. 'I’m a person who enjoys harmony. If people make it impossible then it becomes a problem. ‘The players have to pull it off. I’m just a means to an end, no more than that. The players have to do it. 'They are open minded — a fantastic group — the atmosphere is marvellous and everyone works for the best. That’s what I’m most proud of, making 23 players into a cohesive team.’ Talking tactics: Van Gaal with star forward Arjen Robben . The circle: Van Gaal addresses his players during the session . The issue is relevant to Van Gaal in his present role because of problems Holland have had in the past. It will be relevant next season at Old Trafford, of course, because his predecessor, David Moyes, was undone by a group of players he simply could not see eye to eye with. Van Gaal has a reputation for abrasiveness. There will be some small battles to be fought at United. It is, however, a much more relaxed Van Gaal who is leading Holland through this tournament. In his home country, he has not always been universally popular. There has been disquiet over the fact that he has spent so many of his coaching years outside of Holland, while his decision to play three central defenders going in to this tournament has been viewed by some as unduly negative. Anyone who has seen Holland play in Brazil, however, will find it hard to agree. Cooling off: The team stop for a drink in the scorching conditions of Fortaleza . It was the Dutch who kicked things off here with their 5-1 rout of Spain on day two and, though  defensive deficiencies remain, they have reason to be confident that an attack, buoyed by the prime form of Arjen Robben and Robin van Persie, can continue to function. Here in Fortaleza yesterday, news was conveyed to Van Gaal of a popularity that is, by all accounts, now going through the roof. ‘I’m not getting all this news,’ he said, smiling. ‘I understand there has been a turnaround, people have changed minds. I’m really pleased this World Cup came at the right time. ‘And yes, this is a new system [3-5-2] but it’s incredibly clever that you can play this formation within three weeks. 'We are used to playing different systems and we have players from foreign competitions that only started with it a few weeks prior to the championships. Tekkers: Van Persie performs a few flicks and tricks as he prepares for Mexico . Lining one up: Van Gaal getting stuck in with the ball at his feet . 'But there is no mountain too high. We showed that in the [2-0 Group B] victory against Chile.’ Van Gaal welcomes back his captain Van Persie today after he served a one-game suspension in their final group match. And he admitted that he was worried about the heat but would appear to have little concern about the threat posed by today’s opposition. It is usual for competing teams to allow the media in to training sessions before match day for just 15 minutes. Yesterday in the heat of Fortaleza, however, Van Gaal declared that he would keep the doors open throughout. ‘The newspapers always think they know my team anyway so what does it matter?’ he smiled. ‘I have no secrets out here. It is not my way.’","Dutch manager will take no nonsense when he arrives at Old Trafford .

Trott, 33, did not feature in Friday night’s Twenty20 defeat to Derbyshire to give himself a chance to prepare mentally for the switch back to four-day mode. Trott has not played a first-class match for 10 weeks but advised the England and Wales Cricket Board and his county bosses that he was ready to resume his career during talks this week.

Rebuilding: Trott begins his hopeful comeback to the top level at Edgbaston against Nottinghamshire . Trott has played a couple of NatWest Twenty20 Blast matches in the past fortnight. But featuring in only his second Championship match since quitting the Ashes tour last November one defeat into the 5-0 whitewash with stress-related symptoms is viewed as a significant step in his rehabilitation. Trott began the season for Warwickshire but lasted only one Division One match — scoring 37 and 26 against Sussex — before suffering a recurrence of the problem. The 49-cap England Test batsman spent a further six weeks away from the game before returning to second XI duty at the start of June. He has struck two hundreds since. Warwickshire have not revealed a squad for Sunday in a bid to keep the return low key but Trott will slot in batting at No 3 with Warwickshire captain Jim Troughton unfit (back). ‘Having a world-class player coming back into the fold does nothing but help,’ said the club’s director of cricket Dougie Brown.

"By . Paul Collins . Tim Sherwood has branded the obsession with the way in which managers carry themselves as 'nonsense' and claims some only continue to get hired because of the way they project themselves. The 45-year-old was sacked as Tottenham manager at the end of last season despite enjoying a modicum of success at White Hart Lane. Many believe that decision was down to his touchline demeanour and outspoken nature in the press, but Sherwood stands by his style. Different to the rest: Tim Sherwood was lively during his spell as manager of Tottenham last season . Paying the price for enthusiasm? The 45-year-old was sacked by chairman Daniel Levy at White Hart Lane . 'I don't care about perception,' the former Blackburn midfielder wrote in his Independent column. 'My reactions on the touchline were emotionally honest. 'When you are out there on your own you go through massive highs and lows. I don't think it is wrong to show your emotions. 'But it is something that is picked up on by people in football. And there are some managers who use it to their advantage. They project an image. There are a lot of actors out there.' Two men who can't be accused of any calculated emotion are Miguel Herrera and Jorge Sampaoli. The Mexico and Chile bosses have been real characters at this summer's World Cup and have lived every moment of their sides' tournament thus far. The pair go into this weekend with real chances of upsetting the apple cart; Chile play Brazil on Saturday with Holland waiting for the Mexicans. Characters: Mexico's Miguel Herrera (left) and Chile's Jorge Sampaoli have lit up this summer's World Cup . And the energy given off by their respective bosses is something Sherwood has admired. 'I like Mexico's coach Miguel Herrera. He is there in the moment,' he said. 'There is nothing forced about him. So too Jorge Sampaoli. He prowls around that technical area with intensity. He doesn't spend any time checking how he looks on the stadium screens. 'As a football person, I like that.' He added: 'I have spoken to a few people in football since I left Spurs. Many of them have told me that If I had kept my mouth shut on certain issues I might still be manager. There are some people at football clubs who think that the demeanour of a manager, what he says to the press and the television after the match, is more important than how he prepares his team. It's a nonsense.'","Ex-Tottenham boss was always lively on the touchline at White Hart Lane .

Shortly after 4am, a foghorn boomed off Giglio Island and the head of Italy's Civil Protection agency, Franco Gabrielli, announced that the ship had reached vertical. It was a dramatic operation that unfolded in real time as TV cameras recorded the final hours when the rotation accelerated with gravity pulling the ship into place. For Italy, it was a moment of pride after the horror and embarrassment of the crash in January 2012. The Concordia slammed into a reef off Giglio Island after the Italian captain brought it too close to shore in an apparent stunt. He earned the public's contempt when he abandoned the ship before everyone was evacuated, and then refused coast guard orders to go back on board.","Salvage experts started rotation of cruise liner in Italy yesterday at 9am .

On the night before the operation begins to finally raise the Costa Concordia, haunting underwater footage shows the doomed cruise ship lying on the seabed which is littered with shoes, mattresses and deck chairs. The ship has been marooned and half-sunk off the coast of Tuscany for 20 months - a reminder of the tragedy which saw 32 people lose their lives on January 13, 2012.

While dinner plates, cutlery, shoes and sun loungers lay scattered across the seabed for fish to swim around. The cost of lifting the giant cruise liner, which sank off the coast of Tuscany in January 2012, off the sea bed, has ballooned to £500million - a figure that could rise if there are problems, organisers admitted. Thirty-two people died when the ship, with 4,200 passengers onboard, hit rocks and ran aground off the island of Giglio after an ill-judged 'salute' to inhabitants by the ship’s captain.

A buoyancy device acting 'like a neck brace for an injured patient' will hold together the ship's bow, and fishing nets will catch debris as it rises from beneath the ship, said Nicholas Sloane, senior salvage master at Titan Salvage. The salvage team will go through the ship cabin by cabin and hand over items found on board to the Italian state prosecutor, and the vessel will be towed away to be dismantled. The greatest fear for environmentalists is that the ship will break up under the massive force needed to haul it upright. Uncharted territory: The international team of engineers will use a never-before attempted strategy to set upright the luxury liner . Huge task: The Costa Concordia cruise ship could be upright again next week, nearly two years after the liner capsized and killed at least 30 people .

The Italian Department for the Environment have also highlighted the danger of pollution as thousands of tonnes of water inside the ship pours out. The ship’s fuel has been removed over months by divers and construction workers toiling 24 hours a day, but chemicals and toxins from rotting food and drink remain. Arpat, the Regional Environmental Agency of Tuscany, said it ‘will provide a sampling of the water in the affected area both during the rotation and in the days to follow, in order to identify the extent, the extension and duration of pollution.’ Enormity: An aerial view shows the huge scale of Costa Concordia - equivalent to a floating city - set against the backdrop of the houses on Giglio Island .

Steel chains weighing 17,000 tons have been looped under the vessel to help pull it upright. Tanks filled with water on the exposed side will also help rotate it upward.

"By . Alan Baldwin . Safety car periods will be followed by standing race restarts from the grid next season, Formula One's governing body announced on Thursday. The measure, which replaces rolling restarts, is aimed at making grands prix more exciting but has been criticised by some drivers. 'I understand the start is one of the most exciting times for the fans but it sounds very extreme and I hope it's not going to be done. It's going too far with things,' Mercedes' championship leader Nico Rosberg said at last weekend's Austrian Grand Prix. On track: Safety car periods will be followed by standing race restarts from the grid next season . The International Automobile Federation said in a statement that its World Motor Sport Council had agreed the change to the 2015 sporting regulations. 'Safety Car restarts will now be a standing start from the grid,' it said. 'Standing starts will not be carried out if the safety car is used within two laps of the start (or restart) of a race or if there are less than five laps of the race remaining.' Australian driver Daniel Ricciardo of Red Bull was another unimpressed by the 'artificial' proposal which was put forward by the Formula One Strategy Group that brings together leading teams including his own. Picture that: Nico Rosberg, who won the Austrian Grand Prix and leads the championship, has been critical of the safety car ruling . 'If it goes to a standing start the chance of not having a great start is pretty high so you could go from first to fourth. It's just a bit too much of a disadvantage for someone who earned the lead in the first place,' Ricciardo said. Other changes include measures to reduce costs in areas such as testing and design and to make cars more attractive than the current 'ugly-nosed' ones. Three pre-season tests of four days each will be scheduled in 2015 and restricted to Europe, ruling out more costly excursions to Bahrain. In 2016 this will be reduced to two tests of four days each. There will also be two in-season tests of two days each, also in Europe, with two of the four days reserved for young drivers. Starting grid: The pack will face standing restarts from 2015 . Wind tunnel testing will be limited to 65 hours a week, from 80, and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) usage reduced. Friday night personnel curfews at race weekends will be extended from six to seven hours next year and then eight in 2016. The FIA has also introduced new regulations to change the look of the cars' noses for 'improved safety and to provide more aesthetically pleasing structures'. Drivers will be limited to four engines per season instead of five, unless there are more than 20 races on the calendar, and parc ferme conditions will be enforced from the start of final practice on Saturday rather than qualifying. A proposed ban on tyre blankets has been put on hold. The governing body added that any changes to sporting and technical regulations would in future require unanimous agreement from all parties from March 1 instead of the current cutoff of June 30.","Standing starts from the grid will follow safety car periods from 2015 .

"By . Emma Glanfield . This extraordinary ‘bayonet hat’ would have allowed British soldiers in the First World War to attack the enemy with their heads if it was given the go-ahead, it has emerged. However, the incredibly rare prototype cap - which comes with a sharp six inch blade fixed to the top of it - was deemed too dangerous for soldiers after being considered by the War Office. It has now been discovered nearly 100 years after the war and is expected to sell for more than £3,000. The extraordinary 'bayonet hat', was the brainchild of British solicitor Philip Baker, would have allowed soldiers in the First World War to attack the enemy with their heads if it was given the go-ahead by the War Office . It is thought the idea was for the wearer to stab the enemy with the knife on the hat, either by running at them head first and ramming the weapon into them or by removing the hat and using it as a conventional knife . The item was the brainchild of British solicitor Philip Baker who patented the invention in 1916 and offered it up to the War Office for consideration. He gave them a prototype cap along with drawings showing how it worked. It is thought the idea was for the wearer to stab the enemy with the knife on the top of the hat, either by ramming their head at them or by removing the hat and using it as a conventional knife. The design allowed the knife to be covered by a scabbard and locked in the down position when the wearer was in his own trench. But, when in close combat attack, the soldier would have flicked the knife 90 degrees upwards and used it as a weapon along with his rifle and regular bayonet. Both army-issue caps and steel helmets were to be modified with the foldable knife, with the latter doubling as a small shield and the dagger acting as the handle. However, the War Office didn’t take up the option of the bayonet cap as it was considered too dangerous for the wearer.

If the prototype had been given the go ahead, both army-issue caps and steel helmets would have been modified with the foldable knife, with the latter doubling as a small shield and the dagger acting as the handle . It was one of numerous quirky weapon inventions that were produced during the First World War in a bid to give the British soldiers on the Western Front the upper hand. Now the prototype hat, complete with knife fixed in position, has emerged for sale and is expected to sell for more than £3,000 when it is auctioned on June 25. The original patent document is being sold with it, along with the basic drawings. Matthew Tredwin, of C&T Auctioneers in Kent which is selling the item, said: ‘Many inventors and members of the public came up with ideas for items of uniform that may have helped protect the soldiers at the front. ‘This bayonet hat was meant for hand-to-hand combat and would have quite a barbaric weapon when you think about it. ‘We can only assume this item was made to present to the War Office to gain approval, but obviously was not considered as was not by any means practical.

Matthew Tredwin, of C&T Auctioneers in Kent which is selling the item, said: 'This bayonet hat was meant for hand-to-hand combat and would have quite a barbaric weapon when you think about it' ‘It is very rare however to find any examples of items that were created but never put into production. It is truly a unique item, that you will never find another example of.’ The prototype has been held by the Wilson Military Headgear History Research Centre in the US for many years. The centre was set up by the late philanthropist Robert Wilson. He died last year from cancer and the hat has now returned to Britain where it is now being sold. Terry Charman, of the Imperial War Museum, said: ‘After the war settled down into trench warfare, uniforms and weapons were tailored for hand-to-hand fighting. ‘This hat is one of the weird and wonderful inventions that people produced to give the British the upper hand over their opponents.’ Tanks: . The first tank, the British Mark I, was designed in 1915 by William Foster & Co. It was first demonstrated to the British Army in February, 1916 before going into combat at the Somme in September of that year. British tanks were originally referred to as ‘landships’ by the Landships Committee, but were later named tanks after it emerged factory workers at William Foster referred to the first prototype as ‘the tank’ because of its resemblance to a steel water tank. The French fielded their first tanks in April, 1917 and went on to produce more tanks than all the other combatants combined. The first tank, the British Mark I (pictured) was designed in 1915 by William Foster & Co. It first went into battle at the Somme in September 1916 . Flamethrowers: . The flamethrower, which projects a long, controllable stream of fire, was first used by German troops in February, 1915. Some flamethrowers project a stream of ignited flammable liquid while some project a long gas flame. They can be used hand-held or attached to a tank. The first design for a modern flamethrower was submitted to the German Army by Richard Fiedler in 1901. They are primarily used in battlefield fortifications, bunkers, and other protected emplacements, causing horrific injury or death to enemy soldiers in confined spaces. Aircraft Carriers: . The first proper aircraft carrier was the HMS Furious, which was built for the Royal Navy during the First World War. It was originally a 786 foot long battle cruiser equipped with two 18-inch guns, but was reclassified as an aircraft carrier in September 1925. The forward turret was removed and an area suitable for landing aircraft was installed in its place. HMS Furious was used extensively for trials of naval aircraft and later as a training carrier once the new armoured carriers like Ark Royal entered service in the late 1930s. In August, 1917, while performing trials, Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup, believed to have been N6453, successfully on board HMS Furious, becoming the first person ever to land an aircraft on a moving ship. The first proper aircraft carrier was HMS Furious (pictured), which was built for the Royal Navy during the First World War . Air Traffic Control: . The First World War accelerated development of aviation technology and pilot training. Before the war, there was very little, if any, communication between the pilot of an aircraft and the mainland. However, during the war, the US Army installed the first operational two-way radio in planes. Developments for the radio began in San Diego in 1915 and by 1916, technicians could send a radio telegraph over a distance of 140 miles. In 1917, a human voice was transmitted by radio from a plane in flight to an operator on the ground for the very first time. In 1921, Croydon Airport in London was the first airport in the world to officially introduce air traffic control to commercial flights.","Hat with six inch blade on top was brainchild of British solicitor Philip Baker .

"By . David Kent . After citing the heat as a contributing factor in their loss to Costa Rica, Italy were again sweating it out on Sunday ahead of their decisive Group D match against Uruguay. That clash on Tuesday in Natal, which will decide the second team to go through to the round of 16 with Costa Rica after England's elimination, will be in similar conditions and another 1pm local time kick-off. Midfielder Thiago Motto claimed the Italians were at a disadvantage due to the 'crazy heat' in Arena Pernambuco in Recife, where a header from Costa Rica's Brian Ruiz was enough to hand them a defeat. But with Tuesday's clash just north of Recife in the coastal city of Natal set to be no different coach Cesare Prandelli had his side out in the heat of the day in preparation for the match they must win or draw. VIDEO Italy and Uruguay set for crucial Group D clash . Cooling down: Mario Malotelli pours water over his head in a bid to turn down the temperature in Natal . Sweating it: Italy claimed the heat in their match against Costa Rica was a factor, but Tuesday will be the same . Preparations: Balotelli is the man in the middle during training in Natal ahead of their clash with Uruguay . Italy captain Gianluigi Buffon admits the 1-0 loss to Costa Rica was draining, both physically and emotionally after they only just beat England courtesy of a Mario Balotelli header. 'Of . course this time we have to carry the loss to Costa Rica as baggage and . that could make it seem tougher than it is,' Buffon said. Their place in the tournament is nothing new for Buffon, who is the third player to be part of five World Cup squads along with Germany great Lothar Matthaus and former Mexico goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal. 'It's really not that bad of a situation,' Buffon said Sunday. 'This is the 10th tournament I'm playing with Italy and in 10 tournaments only one time - in last year's Confederations Cup - were we already qualified by the third match ... So it's not like much has changed.' Buffon went to the 1998 Cup though he didn't play, but he's held the starting place since 2002. Heated: Buffon (right) and Prandelli talk during training in Natal on Sunday . Laying down the law: Prandelli addresses his team, which must win or draw to make the round of 16 . Buffon showed he could still be decisive in the third-place match of last year's Confederations Cup, when he stopped three penalties in a shootout win over Uruguay. That was after a 2-2 draw in which Edinson Cavani scored both goals for Uruguay. And Cavani is not even Uruguay's most dangerous striker, as Luis Suarez showed when he scored both goals in a 2-1 win over England on Thursday. 'Cavani and Suarez are a great attack duo but it's not like we're just realising that now,' Buffon said. 'They have confirmed themselves for many years with the national team and individually with their clubs. It's normal when you face a squad of Uruguay's caliber that there are quality players.' Mario Balotelli has spearheaded Italy's attack for the opening two matches but coach Cesare Prandelli could add Ciro Immobile up front against Uruguay. Immobile led Serie A with 22 goals for Torino before completing a transfer to Borussia Dortmund, just days before flying to Brazil. But his only action thus far was in the final 17 minutes of the Azzurri's 2-1 win over England in their opening match. Extra striker: The Serie A's top scorer Ciro Immobile (centre) could line up with Balotelli against Uruguay . Work out: Italy do the hard yards under bright blue skies . 'I don't think Mario and Ciro have ever played together,' Buffon said. 'It would be something new that would carry all of the associated risks - and benefits.' Italy will also probably be without key defensive midfielder Daniele De Rossi, which could prompt coach Cesare Prandelli to revert from a four-man defense to the three-man formation employed by three-time Serie A champion Juventus. Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci and Andrea Barzagli - who each play for the Turin club - would fill those places. 'Our coach is always able to find the right balance in situations like this,' Buffon said. 'He's a maestro at that. ... We're definitely going to need a warm heart and a cold head. We can't throw away our self-confidence for one poor match.' No matter what happens on Tuesday, it won't be easy for Italy. 'If we are eliminated after the first round it would be a failure,' Buffon said. 'It would be a personal disappointment and nobody would hide from that. But if we advance we're going to face hostile opponents and that's where the real problems start.'","Italy play Uruguay on Tuesday in a crucial World Cup clash for both countries .

"By . Mark Prigg . Apple's first ever computer has been sold for £398,000 at a German auction - and it still runs. The revolutionary Apple 1 has been signed by Apple computer inventor and co-founder Steve Wozniak, who designed and built the machine from scratch with his own hands in 1976. Produced by Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, only 200 units of the Apple 1 were ever built - and originally dol for $666.66 . The first ever Apple computer which founder Steve Jobs sold from his parents' garage is expected to fetch £250,000  at auction. The Apple 1, the first ready-made PC to ever come on the market, was created by Jobs and fellow founder Steve Wozniak in 1976. The pair built 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California, selling 50 to a local shop called Byte. How the Apple 1 works . The . eye-catching price-tag of the original Apple caused wild speculation as . to the reasons behind selling for $666 - the number of the Devil. But the number was classic Apple; it was design for the sake of it. Beauty for no reason other than because it looked nice. Steve . Wozinak once revealed: 'I simply like triple digit numbers with all the . things I'm involved with. The cost of making the Apple 1 was around . $540 or there about and we agreed on the best markup, retail price above . the cost of building it, which worked out to $666. 'Jobs . then tacked on the 66 cents to make it an eye-catcher price for the ads . with the sale and promotion publications of it to the public. As the . computer that gave birth to the Apple empire, including the MacBook, . iPod, iPhone and iPad, it is among the most prized Apple products in the . world. Only 46 of these original Apple machines are known to exist on the planet and only six are in working order - like the one that was sold. Auctioneer Uwe H. Breker from Cologne in Germany said: 'This is the sensational first product of today's highest valued company, . 'The Apple 1 is already a legendary milestone from the dynamic dawn of the personal computer age. 'This computer is one hundred-percent authentic and in fully-working condition. 'At the time it was first sold the machine was always delivered as a motherboard only. 'The peripheral equipment such as power pack, keyboard, monitor and cassette recorder had to be obtained personally by the user. 'Apple never offered a housing - every user had to make his own. 'The Apple 1 did not have an operating system, just a monitor-program, which provided the interface between keyboard entry, the computer memory and monitor exit. 'Any software system had to be loaded on cassettes.' The machine's main motherboard. Steve Wozniak was renowned for his neat designs, and his ability to create machines using fewer chips than any of the competition . The rare part of computer history is being sold with an original manual, software tapes which allow it to be run and a company letter from Steve Jobs. 'To date, the only two fully-working Apple 1 sets in comparable condition to the one were auctioned in 2012,' said Uwe. 'The first was sold by Sotheby's New York on June 15th for $374,500 and the second on 24 November 24th by my auction house for $640,000. The sale was held on May 24th by Auction Team Beker of Cologne, Germany. The Apple 1, the first ready-made PC to ever come on the market, was created by Jobs and fellow founder Steve Wozniak in 1976. The pair built 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California, selling 50 to a local shop called Byte. They cost 666.66 US dollars although buyers would have been expected to cough up extra to add a monitor, keyboard and cassette player. The Apple machine has even been signed by Apple computer wiz Steve Wozniak, who created the firm with Steve Jobs in 1976, building 200 units in Jobs' parents garage in California . The Apple 1 came with a tiny 8K memory - around 600,000 times less than is standard with today's Apple computers. It would not even have the capacity to store one song. This example comes with all the original gizmos needed to make it run and is one of only six of the 46 surviving Apple 1s still working. It even carries Wozniak's signature on the motherboard, and also included in the auction is a company letter signed by Jobs. The machine runs on the 'Basic'  software system, which had to be loaded using a cassette. Only two working Apple 1s have ever . been auctioned; the first fetching around 241,000 pounds last year and . the second selling for a record 412,500 pounds just months later. Only two working Apple 1s have ever been auctioned; the first fetching around £241,000 last year and the second selling for a record £412,500 just months later . The Apple founders created the personal computer in 1976 and presented it at a Palo Alto computer club, but there were few takers at the time. Paul Terrell, owner of a retail chain called Byte Shop, placed an order for 50 of the machines and sold them for $666.66 retail - once Wozniak and Jobs agreed to assemble the circuit boards rather than offer them as kits. The pair then produced 150 more and sold them to friends and other vendors. Fewer than 50 original Apple 1s are believed to survive, with only six known to be in working condition. In a nod to the technology created by Jobs and Wozniak, potential buyers can even follow the auction online on their iPads. Uwe Breker, the auctioneer who sold the machine, said: 'The Apple 1 really is the symbol for the American dream. 'Two students had an idea, built and marketed it, and 35 years later it is the highest valued company ever. 'Steve Wozniak designed the Apple 1 computer, the first fully assembled computer kit, in 1976 and Steve Jobs took on the task of selling it. 'In Jobs' parents garage the pair built 200 Apple machines and sold 50 to a computer shop called Byte. 'The shop marketed it with the slogan 'Byte into an Apple' which gave Jobs the idea for the iconic logo we know so well today. The main board of the Apple machine, which is expected to sell for £250,000 . The gadgets comes with all manuals & certificates, making it a unique purchase . The heart of the machine: The 6502 microprocessor which powered the Apple 1, which was chosen because of its low cost . 'As with all Apple products the Apple 1 wasn't around long before a better model was launched, but a legend had begun. 'The rest is history. Apple is now the most valuable country in the world and interest in their early items only increased after Jobs' death. 'You couldn't actually do very much with the Apple 1. 'You had to load your program each time on a cassette and it only had eight kilobytes of memory - enough for only the most basic of word processing. 'From the 200 built only 46 remain but just six of them are working - and this is one of them. 'That makes it even more rare than it would be already - plus this one is signed on its motherboard by Steve Wozniak. 'This item was bought by a software company owner 30 years ago and when he saw our Apple 1 auction last November in which one sold for 640,000 US dollars he thought now was the time to sell.'

"By . Emily Crane . and Aap . A Queensland girl asked her mother to pray for her hours before she died alone and in pain after she was bashed with a metal pole at the hands of her mum. The abuse the eight-year-old was subjected to in the lead up to her death at her Cairns home in 2011 was outlined by a coroner on Friday. 'I flogged her with the vacuum pole in her room and kept hitting her and hitting her,' the girl's mother, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told police after the death. A Queensland girl (picture posed by model) asked her mother to pray for her hours before she died alone and in pain after she was bashed with a metal pole at the hands of her mum . The girl was beaten with the pole on three occasions between November 22 and 28, 2011. Following a beating on November 28, 2011, the girl asked her mother for drugs to relieve the pain, but the woman said there was none in the house. The girl replied: 'Well could you at least say a prayer for me?' She died later that day. On another occasion, the girl was bashed so hard the pole bent so that sharp points along its length cut the girl every time she was hit. An autopsy revealed the girl, whose body was covered in bruises, died from the effects of blunt force injuries and congenital heart disease. The girl would have been in significant pain and had difficulty walking for several days leading up to her death, the court heard. Coroner Jane Bentley handed down findings on Friday of an inquest into the girl's death three years ago. She said Queensland's child safety department and abuse preventative agency Act for Kids didn't do enough to protect the girl. The inquest heard the girl became 'invisible' in the system, despite abuse claims in 2009 and 2010, and it went undetected that she didn't attend school for a year before her death. Coroner Bentley said it was 'inexplicable' the girl's extended family, including her aunt, uncle and step grandparents, knew about the abuse but didn't tell authorities. The girl's step grandfather said he'd noticed bruising on the girl for 12 months before her death. Coroner Bentley said the girl was a defenceless child who died 'alone and in pain'. There were no reports of the other children at the house being abused. The mother is serving a seven year jail sentence after last year pleading guilty to manslaughter. The girl's stepfather was sentenced to three years jail on the same charge after admitting he turned a blind eye to the abuse.

"By . Sarah Dean . and Australian Associated Press . MP for the Northern Tablelands Adam Marshall was caught drink-driving on Friday night . A 29-year-old MP has called himself a 'bloody idiot' after being caught drink-driving. NSW parliamentarian Adam Marshall was stopped by police while driving home from a night out with friends on Friday in Glen Innes, Northern Tablelands, in northern New South Wales. He allegedly blew a mid-range reading of 0.112 at about 10.45pm after being stopped by police during a random breath analysis. The state MP, who began his political career at the age of 19, said in a statement that he deeply regretted his actions. 'Although I thought I was ok to drive, I wasn't. I drank and drove – I was a bloody idiot,' he said . 'I would like to sincerely apologise to the community, my friends and family for my actions.' NSW Nationals leader Andrew Stoner has also commented on the incident. 'Earlier today, I was informed that the MP for the Northern Tablelands, Adam Marshall, was last night caught driving under the influence of alcohol,' he said. 'I have since expressed to Adam my disappointment with his actions, and reiterated the high standards that I expect of all our MPs.' Mr Marshall is not the first Tablelands MP to attract scandal. He claimed the seat at a 2013 by-election sparked by the resignation of Richard Torbay, who held the Northern Tablelands as an independent for 14 years. NSW Nationals leader Andrew Stoner confirmed the incident and expressed his 'disappointment' Mr Torbay resigned last March - a day after the Nationals dumped him as their candidate for the federal seat of New England. He was subsequently referred to the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption because of his relationship with crooked ex-Labor powerbroker Eddie Obeid. Mr Stoner said Mr Marshall had resigned as temporary Speaker and Deputy Chair of the State and Regional Development Committee. But Mr Marshall, who will appear in Glen Innes local court on July 15, has promised: 'I will continue to work as hard as ever for the people of Northern Tablelands and carry on my work advancing our issues and needs.'

"By . Darren Boyle . Around 700 British troops training in Kenya have been prevented from leaving after the Nairobi government withdrew diplomatic permits over a travel advice row. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has issued a travel advisory to British tourists visiting the east African country, warning against holidaying in a number of high-risk areas. The soldiers from 3rd Battalion, The Rifles, had been involved in infantry training exercises and were due to fly home on aircraft delivering their replacements from the 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment. Islamic terrorists have launched attacks near tourist areas such as the resort island of Lamu, prompting the Foreign Office advice . However the Kenyan government has delayed issuing diplomatic clearance for the Parachute Regiment to enter the country, leaving the 700 soldiers waiting to go home stranded. The FCO has warned tourists against travelling to the region near the Somalia border or in the poorer areas of Nairobi. An FCO spokesperson said: 'There is a high threat from terrorism, . including kidnapping. The main threat comes from extremists linked to Al . Shabaab, a militant group that has carried out attacks in Kenya in . response to Kenya’s military intervention in Somalia.' The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Kenya's eastern region due to the deteriorating security situation . Relations between London and Nairobi have been frosty since the country's new president Uhuru Kenyatta accused the British government of supporting a rival candidate, according to the Daily Telegraph, . The FCO advises against all but essential travel to: . A spokesman for the British High Commission in Nairobi said: 'There has been a delay that we became aware of in the middle of last week in the receipt of diplomatic clearance from the Kenyan authorities for these troops. We hope this will be resolved shortly.' British troops have used Kenya for infantry training for many years but that agreement is now under jeopardy. One security source told the Telegraph: 'It’s not clear why the paperwork’s being held up [for the soldiers] but it’s very hard to think it’s coincidence at a time when the Kenyans are pretty annoyed at the travel advisories and all the earlier stuff.' According to High Commissioner Christian Turner, British troops training in Kenya provide a £58 million boost to the local economy. The Military of Defence added: 'The UK has a long-standing, mutually beneficial, defence relationship with Kenya and we hope that the delay in receipt of diplomatic clearances from the Kenyan authorities will be resolved shortly.' Earlier this month, 50 gunmen murdered at least 48 people in an attack claimed by Al Shebab militants who crossed over the border form Somalia .","British troops due to fly home on aircraft delivering their replacements .

"By . Leesa Smith . Fighting off crocodiles and sharks was all in a day's work for Jason Beachcroft during his epic sea kayaking adventure around Australia over the past 17 months. Jason Beachcroft has completed the first sea kayak circumnavigation of Australia, to have included Tasmania, arriving back in Rose Bay, Sydney this afternoon, where he began his mission on January 12 last year. The incredible feat has been accomplished three other  times before but has never included the treacherous trek across the Bass Strait and back again. After 17 long months at sea on a kayak, Jason Beachcroft arrives back where started at Rose bay, Sydney. on January 12 last year . Beachcroft greeted by his supportive family and friends as he paddled into Rose Bay after 17 long months circumnavigating the Australia . Beachcroft, (being congratulated by a friend), documented his journey on a blog and his Facebook page so his supporters could follow his adventure . Beachcroft said the stretch was often referred to as ‘The Everest of the Australian sea kayaking’. But tackling the waters was well worth it as the scenery he paddled through in western Tasmania was the biggest highlight of the entire trip for the 45-year-old. Beachcroft described the remote and wild parts of southern and western of Tasmania as ‘stunningly beautiful’.The Kimberleys in north Western Australia came in as a close second for the same reasons. The seed was planted for Beachcroft a few years ago when he read Kiwi sea kayaker Paul Caffyn’s book on his adventures when he circumnavigated the country – minus Tasmania. One of the most confronting and surreal moments of his long voyage was fighting off a crocodile in northern Western Australia. Beachcroft was camped up a hill when he heard his kayak being moved in the middle of the night and went down to discover a crocodile was pulling his boat into the water. In a lucky escape, Beachcroft managed to hit the predator on the head with a hand spear that was attached to his kayak. ‘I wasn’t feeling fear – it was only two metres - I’m not concerned until they are at least four metres,’ he said. ‘I was just thinking “I need my boat and the food on it”.’ It wasn’t the only time the kayaker had an encounter with a member of the large reptile family – he also paddled right over the top of a crocodile while at Gantheaume Point in Broome. Beachcroft (middle) catches up with friends Sue (left) and Rick (right) Lovegrove in Tathra, NSW . His second last sunrise in Stanwell Park Beach in NSW . It wasn’t unusual for sharks to take a bite out of the kayak – something that Beachcroft experienced at least 50 times. ‘They are attracted to the rudder but once they realised they can’t eat it they usually swim away,’ Beachcroft said. ‘But this one stupid bronze whale shark kept biting so I had to whack it on the nose.’ Another challenging moment was when he broke a couple of ribs in South Australia after he hit the side of his kayak during rough surf conditions which slowed him down for about five weeks. Despite being a solo quest, Beachcroft wasn’t entirely alone with 'Omarm the Pirate Monkey' given to him as a travelling companion for the trip. Beachcroft is not a stranger to the outdoor life – he is going back to his job working as an outdoor guide in the Blue Mountains. There was not a single point throughout the voyage that the intrepid adventurer had any regrets or even thought for a second about giving it all up. ‘I’ve been told I’m determined,’ he admitted. But he did miss the usual pleasures such as his own bed and being able to kick back and watch a movie, and not so typically – rock climbing. Despite roughing it for the best part of a year and a half, Beachcroft is not heading straight to a health spa for a pamper treatment but hitting the ski fields in Jindabyne. ‘I find skiing relaxing,’ he said.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . The majority of babies will be born out of wedlock within three years, new figures suggest. The decline in marriage has led to a huge change in the way children are brought up in a generation. A record 47.5 per cent of babies were born to unmarried mothers in 2012, compared to just 8.4 per cent 40 years earlier. Record rise: Dramatic social change has seen the proportion of babies born to unmarried parents soar from just 11.8 per cent in 1980 to 47.5 per cent last year . Baby boom: The number of babies born in Britain was the highest for 40 years but a record 47.5 had unmarried parents . If the trend continues at the same rate, most babies will have unmarried parents by 2016. David Cameron has come under growing pressure to introduce tax breaks for married couples to send a signal that the institution is still valued. Experts say children whose parents have tied the knot are happier and achieve more success later in life. The Office for National Statistics said the proportion of babies born to unmarried mothers stood at 46.8 per cent in 2010, up from 40 per cent in 2000, 28.3 per cent in 1990 and 11.8 per cent in 1980. ‘This continues the long-term rise in the percentage of births outside marriage/civil partnership, which is consistent with increases in the number of couples cohabiting rather than married or in a civil partnership,’ the ONS said. When records began in 1938, the year before the outbreak of Second World War, 95.8 per cent of babies had married parents. The figures for 2012 also include births registered by a same-sex couple outside of a civil partnership. Boom: The number of babies born each year has been gradually rising since the turn of the century, but is still much lower than the post-war baby boom . The change comes after the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 allowed two women in a same-sex couple to register a birth. In 2012 there were 556 babies born to same-sex couples in a civil partnership and 252 births registered by gay couples outside a civil partnership. Mr Cameron has promised gay and straight married couples will benefit from a tax break, worth around £150-a-year. Tim Loughton, the former Children's minister, urged the government to introduce the allowance to halt the decline in marriage. 'If people are prepared to make a public declaration to each other in front of their friends and family they are more likely to stay together. Without marriage people drift in and out of relationships very easily,' he told the Telegraph. 'In families where parents break up children do less well at school, are more likely to suffer mental health problems and are more likely to have substance abuse problems. 'The government needs to send a very clear message that it supports marriage. That's why married tax breaks are so important.' Over the last three-quarters of a century the number of babies born in England and Wales has fluctuated. In 2012 there were 729,674 live births, up around 6,000 on the year before, continuing a rising trend seen since 2001 when there were only 594,634. The lowest number of babies born on record was in 1977, when there were only 569,259 as the country was still emerging from the deep recession earlier in the decade. The post-war years saw record numbers of babies born, hitting 881,026 in 1947 and the emergence of the generation known as the baby boomers.","Last year a record 47.5 per cent of babies were born to unmarried mother .

"By . Maureen Paton . When Bernard Cribbins wants to get something off his chest about children's TV, the powers that be might want to take notice. A legend of the genre, during his 71-year showbiz career Bernard's not only voiced 70s hit The Wombles (yes, every character), but he's also read more Jackanory stories than anyone else and, in 2009, was awarded a BAFTA for his children's TV work. But today he's not happy. 'Children's TV is so frantic now, they've neglected the fundamentals of traditional storytelling,' he says. Bernard thinks that all the old fashioned charm of children's TV has been lost . 'There's too much fast editing and CGI - the very opposite of Jackanory.' Which is why he became involved with the popular BBC teatime TV series Old Jack's Boat, a mix of live action and animation in which he plays a retired fisherman who tells tall tales about his fantastic adventures with his faithful Hungarian Vizsla dog Salty. 'What I like about Old Jack's Boat is that it's just like Jackanory - me telling a tale straight to camera with my lovely dog.' The sad irony of Bernard's life, however, is that he and his wife Gill - who've been married since 1955 - couldn't have children of their own in those pre-IVF days after she suffered an early miscarriage. 'It would have been nice to be parents, but I don't feel wistful about it any more,' he says. 'If we'd had our own children, they'd all be bigger than me now and shouting at me,' he adds wryly.Instead they acquired lots of godchildren and a succession of beloved dogs. 'They could well have been child substitutes without us knowing,' admits Bernard. 'The thing about dogs is they give you unconditional love - and they don't have teenage years!' Their last dog Rosie was a 'delightful' Jack Russell that died three years ago, and they haven't been able to bring themselves to replace her. Naturally, Bernard was involved in the casting of Salty, whose real name is Scuzz. Bernard (pink shirt) and Kenneth Williams in Carry on Jack in 1963 . There's talk of a new series of Old Jack's Boat spin-off, Salty's Waggy Tales, as well as a dog show for the Parachute Regiment's Afghanistan Trust charity next year, to which Bernard - who did his National Service in the Paras - hopes to take Scuzz along as star guest. Meanwhile, his latest family project sees him recording the narration for Sir Richard Stilgoe's children's musical Brilliant - The Dinosaur, which begins a UK tour of theatres next spring. He hopes the show will introduce a new generation of children to the simple joys of live theatre. The Dinosaur show tells the story of how a hurricane opens up a cave in England and reveals a reptile that's been hibernating for 65 million years. 'The dinosaur will be 100ft long, female and wearing pink lipstick,' says Bernard. Old Jack's Boat is shown on CBeebies, weekdays at 5.45pm . Now 85, Bernard's been performing for as long as Sir Bruce Forsyth, and says he has no plans to retire. 'Showbusiness keeps me young. I'll carry on until I have to stop. If I wasn't producing the goods they'd get someone else in.' He's worked with everyone from comedy legend Peter Sellers and the first Bond girl Ursula Andress to Catherine Tate and David Tennant in Doctor Who. He was even a pop singer in the early 60s with the novelty hits Right Said Fred and The Hole In The Ground. One of the last survivors of the Carry On films, Bernard never thinks of himself as a star. 'I'm like an itinerant fruit-picker, going from orchard to orchard to pick up work,' says the Oldham-born son of a plumber's mate. He met Gill when he was a young stage manager/actor in Oldham and she was his assistant. 'She would often join me on tour or on foreign film shoots. It's very easy to get tempted in my business if you're feeling fruity,' says Bernard, who claims he still gets a funny turn at the memory of working with the beautiful Ursula Andress in the 1965 adventure film She. 'But I always wanted to keep on the straight and narrow, just do the job I love and go home,' he concludes. And his favourite audience of all? 'Children - they're wonderfully receptive. So although I don't have any of my own, I feel very lucky I've got lots of other children who sit and listen to my stories.' Old Jack's Boat, CBeebies, weekdays, 5.45pm.

Luis Suarez made the extraordinary claim to FIFA’s disciplinary committee that he ‘did not bite or intend to bite’ Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini — but ‘fell’ into him. And his refusal to accept responsibility for the offence or even to admit that it took place appears to have backfired and resulted in the severe sanction from FIFA — he is banned from all football for four months as well as nine international games. Suarez’s defence will come as a further embarrassment and Liverpool are now preparing to sell the player to Barcelona. They are hoping to bring Chile and Barca striker Alexis Sanchez the other way as part of the deal. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Spirit of Suarez lives on as Uruguay fans wear Luis masks . Accident? Luis Suarez told FIFA he did not deliberately bite Giorgio Chiellini but fell on top of him . Big miss: FIFA have been formally informed of Uruguay's appeal against Suarez's ban . Time: The Uruguay football federation will now have a further seven days to prepare paperwork for the appeal . FIFA’s written reasons to the . Uruguayan FA for the sanction emerged yesterday and the document quotes . from Suarez’s explanation of the collision with Chiellini. Suarez . submission to FIFA said: ‘In the run-up to the impact, my knees came . together, I lost my balance and that destabilised my body and I fell . into my opponent. In that moment, my face came into collision with the . player, causing a small bruise on my cheekbone and a lot of pain to my . teeth, which caused the referee to stop play. That is what happened and . in no event did I, as is written in the document, “bite” or “try to . bite”.’ However, the . attempt to deny the incident appears to have been an enormous . misjudgment by Suarez and his legal team and resulted in a more severe . sanction than if contrition been shown. The . FIFA disciplinary commission noted ‘at no point did the player show any . contrition or repentance of any type, nor did he admit any violation of . FIFA regulations and has therefore not shown any knowledge of having . committed any offence.’ In . applying the sanction, the committee considered ‘the grave danger of . repetition, the exceedingly abnormal nature (of the offence) in the . context of a football match and the intention to harm the opponent.’ It . was also noted that he had been sanctioned previously for this offence . in club football. Suarez’s . latest offence means he will have been banned for a total of 47 matches . for three separate bites and racially abusing Manchester United’s . Patrice Evra. Last night, he . made his first public comment since arriving back home in Montevideo, . having been thrown out of the Uruguay camp by FIFA. In a tweet, he said: ‘Hi all, I write this post to give thanks to the outpouring of support and love I am receiving. ‘Both . myself and my family really appreciate it. Thank you very much for . being by my side and I want all my colleagues today to know we support . the national team for the match against Colombia.’ Painful: Suarez fell to the ground and held his teeth straight after the encounter with centre back Chiellini . Suarez . will now leave Liverpool, with the Premier League club working to . extract the best possible deal from a difficult situation. The . club will ask for £80million, although Barcelona and Suarez believe the . transfer can be done for £65m, based on a buy-out clause. Nevertheless, . Chile striker Sanchez could be key to negotiations. Barca are willing . to sell him, Liverpool want to buy him but the player needs to be . convinced and Arsenal are likely to bid, although they have not . registered their intent as yet. Liverpool will now begin a £120m rebuilding project to fill the void left by Suarez. Adam . Lallana’s £23m move will be announced tomorrow and the Belgian striker . Divock Origi will join at the end of the World Cup for £10m — although . he is expected to spend next season on loan with  current club Lille. Liverpool . will look to add £15m Southamton defender Dejan Lovren and £25m Benfica . winger Lazar Markovic to their summer transfer spending, which has . already included £9m for Emre Can and £4m for Rickie Lambert. Liverpool will be forced to end up paying Suarez £3m in wages for doing nothing if they don’t sell him this summer. The . Uruguayan is occupying the minds of owner John W Henry and the . Liverpool hierarchy as they work out what to do next with their troubled . striker. Last night, the Anfield club were poring over the FIFA ruling handed to them by Suarez’s lawyers. The Premier League club has its hands tied, however. Although . the Uruguayan FA has handed in a formal appeal over  Suarez’s . punishment, Liverpool will have to abide by FIFA’s final decision and . cannot mount their own, separate appeal. In . addition, withholding Suarez’s wages while he is suspended from playing . and training is not an option under agreements the Premier League has . made with the Professional Footballers’ Association — and FIFA’s own . rules. Evidence: Chiellini looked outraged as he showed the referee the apparent point of impact on his shoulder . Suarez took to Twitter on Saturday to thank his supporters and said: 'Hi all, I write this post to give thanks to the outpouring of support and love I am receiving. 'Both myself and my family really appreciate it. Thank you very much for being by my side and I want all my colleagues today to know we support seleccion for the match against Colombia.' The maximum fine . Liverpool can impose on Suarez, if they have a mind to, is two weeks . wages, under contracts signed with the PFA. Even . if the players’ union gave them special dispensation to increase the . fine because of the seriousness of his offence, Liverpool could not . withhold Suarez’s money for more than two months without Suarez being . free to  move to another club — something Liverpool would not . countenance for such a valuable asset. It . leaves Liverpool having to decide whether it would be beneficial for . the club to enter negotiations with Barcelona, who would like the player . to form a dream attack with Neymar and Lionel Messi. If . an agreement for the player to move to Spain cannot be reached, . Liverpool will have to pay Suarez’s £175,000-a-week wages until the end . of October — amounting to £3million — even though the player cannot . play, train with his team-mates or watch the team play. Suarez . may even choose to stay away from the country altogether and there are . serious doubts about whether he will want to return to England while he . is banned. Even before his bite, the player had shown clear signs of wanting to quit the Premier League. He . and his family left their home in Woolton, Liverpool as soon as the . final ball had been kicked at the end of the Premier League season in . May. By the time Suarez was awarded the prestigious Football Writers’ Footballer of the Year in London four days after the end of the league . season, the 27-year-old was already in Barcelona where his in-laws live. The trophy was collected by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers instead. Show of support: Uruguay's WAGs have given their backing to Luis Suarez following the striker's ban . Message for his followers: Suarez took to Twitter to thank his fans for the messages of support they'd sent . Thumbs up: Suarez gestures to fans from the balcony of his home after returning to Uruguay . Rapturous reception: Suarez was joined by his children as he greeted the army of fans who had gathered . Suarez’s . comments after scoring twice against England in the Group D clash — in . which he claimed that he had been ‘laughed at’ in England — were also . seen  as stirring upanimosity and an indication of his desire to play in . La Liga. But Liverpool . owner Henry showed last year, when he rejected out-of-hand Arsenal’s bid . of £40m- and-a-pound for Suarez, that he will only let the player go to . Barca if they meet his market value of around £70million — despite this . third biting offence. Despite . the furore surrounding Suarez, Liverpool are proceeding with plans to . bolster Rodgers’ squad for next season when they will play in the . Champions League after a five-year absence. The . protracted move for Lallana should be finalised and announced within . the next 48 hours and the club also has an interest in Belgian striker .

"By . Sarah Harris . Tough love: Gina Ford, author of a best-selling book on childcare said teachers must be 'firm but fair' As the author of a best- selling book on childcare, she is known for helping parents cope with teething, toddlers and tantrums. Now Gina Ford is turning her hand to a new task – telling teachers how to deal  with pushy parents. And  the key to her advice? Treat them just like demanding children. Miss Ford, who has divided mothers with her ultra-strict advice, insists difficult parents must be taught the importance of ‘boundaries’ and be treated with a ‘fair but firm’ hand. She told the Times Educational Supplement: ‘Applying good boundaries to a pushy parent is just as necessary as applying good boundaries to a demanding child. ‘A pushy or demanding parent needs to understand that he or she can’t fundamentally alter the way the school operates. ‘Good schools will work  with the parent to improve  communication and resolve matters successfully, but being  fair but firm may be the only  way to deal with a really demanding parent.’ Former maternity nurse Miss Ford, who does not have children of her own, is a pioneer of the controversial ‘controlled crying’ technique for babies – where children are left to cry themselves to sleep. The parenting expert’s latest book, The Contented Baby Goes To School, suggests teachers use a similar tough-love approach with clingy parents who struggle to leave their children when they first start school. She discourages mothers and fathers from lingering over goodbyes or watching their youngsters through classroom windows, claiming that while this can be comforting for parents, it is likely to unsettle their child. She went on to say: ‘Starting school is a huge milestone in the life of a child. ‘But it is very easy to underestimate what a big thing having a child starting school can be for a parent. Pushy: Gina Ford said that parents who are particularly demanding when their children start school are sometimes just particularly anxious . ‘Those parents who are particularly demanding when their children start school are sometimes just particularly anxious. ‘Hopefully teachers will have a well thought through policy in place if a parent’s anxieties are reflecting on to their child. ‘Talk to all parents about how to manage leaving their child, and set ground rules for the whole class. ‘This will help teachers avoid singling out one parent who lingers over farewells and finds it hard to leave.’ She added: ‘The parent ultimately just wants to be heard. By listening, one can demonstrate that their concerns, whether valid or not, are being met with consideration. ‘Adapting to a significant change takes time for adults as well as small children.’","Gina Ford, author of best-selling childcare book, has divided mothers with her ultra-strict advice .

Scroll down for video . Victims: Laura Simonson, 37, from Farmington, Minnesota, was one of two women whose bodies were discovered June 5 in two suitcases discarded along a rural road in Town of Geneva . Hot trail: Detectives wearing hazmat suits removed bags of evidence and a refrigerator from the suburban Milwaukee apartment of Steven Zelich . Mr  Zelich, a security officer and former cop, has been charged with two counts of hiding corpses . Laura Simonson's father, Richard Wierson, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that his daughter had placed escort ads on Craigslist. Wierson said she had struggled with mental illness since adolescence, and that her seven children were placed in foster care with him in 2010. One of her daughters, Alyssa, passed away last year. A missing persons investigation initiated by the Farmington Police Department determined Simonson was last seen November 2 in Rochester. Missing person: Simonson, a Craigslist escort, went missing in November 2013; a short time later, someone took out an ad online claiming that she had been enslaved and tortured by Steven Zelich . The 37-year-old was reported missing by her mother November 22, 2013 - about three weeks after she parked her van outside her family's home in Farmington. On Thursday, police in Rochester announced  they have evidence suggesting that Simonson was killed at the Microtel Inn and Suites in town where the victim and Zelich allegedly stayed together on the night of November 2. The next day, Zelich checked out of the motel but Simonson was no longer with him, police said. Following Ms Simonson's disappearance, . an ad was placed on the site SecondCityClassifieds.com claiming that . the divorced mother of seven was mentally disabled and had been enslaved . and tortured by Steven Zelich. The ad titled 'Steven Zelich is a predator' described the former law enforcement officer as a 'sadist' who had enslaved Simonson, keeping her 'naked, handcuffed, shackled, and caged.' 'He has no intention of ever releasing this poor woman who suffers from various mental disabilities. She has been whipped and tortured by Steven Mark Zelich since November 2, 2013,' the ad read. The writer provided Zelich's cell phone number and email address, urging online users to harass the man and flood his inbox with messages. The ad also revealed Zelich as an avid practitioner of sadomasochism who had been active on the site Collarme.com under the user name 'mrhandcuffs.' Tragic matriarch: Laura Simonson is pictured here with six of her seven children. Her seventh, a girl named Alyssa, passed away last year . That profile has since been deleted, but on the website Collarspace.com dedicated to the S&M lifestyle, a user by the nickname 'Mrhandcuffs' described himself as dominant and touted the virtues of having a long-term slave. The profile was accompanied by a photo of a middle-aged man strongly resembling Zelich seated on a white couch. 'There is nothing better than a slave, tied tight, gagged, blindfolded, hooded, chained, caged...' he wrote. 'The slave I seek understands the incredible connection between owner and owned.' According to Chicago Tribune, . the 52-year-old licensed security officer also had been active on an online . discussion board titled MasterB Slave Club, where he posted a similar message . about 'seeking perm enslavement... ideally in a farm/caged situation.' Mr Handcuffs: Zelich has been active in the S&M community, posting on websites dedicated to that lifestyle under the name 'mrhandcuffs' about his desire to own a permanent slave . The second victim in the suitcase case was likely killed in Wisconsin, according to investigators. Authorities have released an eerie sketch of what the mystery woman may have looked like.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . It has long been one of Britain’s most romantic destinations – a charming market town where elegant Georgians paused to ‘take the waters’. But – in worrying news for one of Kent’s prettiest places – the spring that has long been the main selling point of Royal Tunbridge Wells appears to have dried up. End of an era? The Chalybeate Spring - seen her in a stock image - has run dry . The Chalybeate Spring is located in Bath Square on The Pantiles – the Georgian colonnade, full of shops and galleries, that is the heart of the town. It is here that mineral water is served in cups by ‘dippers’, who wear period costume during the summer season. But last month the water from the underground spring stopped flowing – and with it, visitors to the attraction have also dried up. A fixture since 1606: Visitors have been flocking to the Chalybeate Spring to 'take the waters' for four centuries . The area of The Pantiles around the spring is owned by property investment company Targetfollow. The firm has been tight-lipped about the issue, according to Tunbridge Wells paper The Courier. A spokesman would only say: ‘We are undertaking an investigation.’ Tunbridge Wells Borough Council says the spring opened for the tourist season on April 18 – and its staff noticed that the water had stopped flowing on May 5. In a statement, it says: ‘We do not know what has caused the water to stop.’ ‘We notified Targetfollow when we realised that there was no flow and closed the dipper service. The dippers will return as soon as they can.’ Tradition: Visitors to Tunbridge Wells are served by costumed 'dippers' - but the service is currently on hold . The council is still waiting to hear from Targetfollow as to when it can meet to discuss the water shortage. Council cabinet member with responsibility for tourism, leisure and economic development Jane March says: 'I was very disappointed when I was informed that the spring had stopped flowing. 'The council has been in touch with Targetfollow, the owners of the Pantiles, to try and arrange a meeting about it.’ This is not the first time the waters have run in to trouble. In 2010, people were banned from taking the reddish-coloured waters, believed to have health-giving properties. They were found to have traces of a harmful bacteria and a lack of rainfall had dramatically lowered the water level. A perfect spot for a summer's afternoon: The Pantiles is the heart of Tunbridge Wells . The spring was reputedly discovered in 1606 by one Lord North, an aristocrat at the court of James I who was staying in the Kent countryside to boost his ailing health. He encountered the spring, and found that drinking its water improved his condition – before recommending its restorative properties to his friends. By 1630, when Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I, paid a visit, the spring had been firmly inked on the map as a fashionable destination – and by the 19th century, Royal Tunbridge Wells had become a must-see hotspot for the London gentry.","Worrying news for Kent town whose appeal is based on its mineral waters .

"By . Hannah Roberts In Rome . Amanda Knox will never return to Italy to face justice, her grandmother has declared, and nor will any other member of the Knox family. Elisabeth Huff, Knox's maternal grandmother and closest confidante, whom she wrote to often from prison, said that her granddaughter had been 'persecuted' in Italy. Knox, and former boyfriend Raffaelle Sollecito, 29, spent four years in prison for the 2007 murder of her British flatmate Meredith Kercher, who was found with her throat slit in the cottage they shared in Perugia. Amanda Knox, pictured (left) after arriving back in the U.S. after being acquitted of the murder of British student Meredith Kercher, will never return to Italy to . face retrial , her grandmother Elisabeth Huff (right)  has said . The pair were freed on appeal in 2011, but Italy's highest court this week dramatically quashed their acquittal, ordering a retrial. Knox does not need to return for the new trial, but if found guilty, Italy could demand her extradition. Mrs Huff, the first member of her . immediate family to speak out about the family's true feelings, said . that Italian prosecutors' pursuit of her granddaughter amounted to . 'harassment'. Meredith Kercher, 21, was found semi naked and with her throat cut in her bedroom of the house she shared with Knox in November 2007 . She told the Italian newspaper La Stampa: 'It's a persecution. She has already been tried twice. Why reopen it. The prosecutors want to find other guilty parties at any cost and they will never give up. That is the view of Amanda and our entire family. 'Because of this Amanda will not return to Italy for the new trial. She will never go back. No one in our family will.' Mrs Huff, who was with Knox at her mother's house when she was told of the retrial, told how her granddaughter wept. 'She was hurt, sad, in pain, Mrs Huff remembered, 'She had thought that the nightmare was finally over. 'She cried, she repeated that she was innocent. 'She said she was scared and that it was impossible to live a normal life like this.' It's difficult to move on when you are 'constantly harassed' she added. Knox's book, due out on April 30, will explain her innocence, her grandmother said. Sollecito, . who has already released a book about his experience, has registered a . company which will re-examine and solve cold cases, according to Italian . media.
