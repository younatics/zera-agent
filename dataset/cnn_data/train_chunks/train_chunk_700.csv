Alex Baldwin, pictured last week, could be serious about his bid for office . Hollywood star Alec Baldwin is seriously considering running for the position of New York Mayor, according to his little brother. Billy Baldwin cast aside suggestions that his older sibling's flirtation in taking over from Michael Bloomberg in the top role was 'just for show' in an interview with CNN's Piers Morgan. He said the 30 Rock actor's on-and-off political aspirations were 'on one level [...] very real'. He said: 'I think he's very committed and extremely bright and knowledgeable and I think he could do it and he could run. 'On the other hand, I'm not quite sure if he's cut from the proper cloth because it requires a lot of tolerance and a lot of patience.' Morgan noted that the 54-year-old, who told Vanity Fair this week how he fantasised about murdering his ex-wife Kim Basinger's lawyer during their bitter child custody battle, had a reputation for being 'temperamental' and 'a bit hot-headed'. But Billy said these attributes were not necessarily a bad thing. And he added: 'Let me remind you that John McCain and Rudy Giuliani are quite the same. 'They are very successful and highly effective politicians.' Baldwin married 28-year-old yoga instructor Hilaria Thomas on Sunday, and had a series of run-ins with paparazzi photographers in the run-up to the big day. He is also known for his rants on Twitter and last December was thrown off a plane after he refused to stop playing a scrabble game on his smart phone. Scroll down to see the interview... Angry: Alec Baldwin scolded a fan and ignored her request for an autograph as he sent his daughter off outside his apartment in New York City earlier this week . Interview: Billy Baldwin spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan about his brother's political aspirations . In the Vanity Fair interview, Baldwin admitted he is still considering going into politics, and that he has already once toyed with the idea of running for New York Mayor. He said: 'I think I do want to go into politics. I really, really do. And I don’t know if I will. If I want to run, run for what? You have to stop and ask a lot of whys. Run for the glory? 'Run to complete some missing piece of myself? I can keep doing what I’m doing for a living now and be perfectly happy.' But in the same interview he also said he wanted Harvey Levin, creator of the hugely successful website TMZ.com, to die a violent death. His 'revenge' was for Levin posting a voicemail recording where he called his then 11-year-old daughter Ireland a 'rude thoughtless little pig. Baldwin said: 'I wanted to stick a knife in him and gut him and kill him and I wanted him to die breathing his last breath looking into my eyes.' Beating: Alec Baldwin shoves Daily News photographer Marcus Santos after leaving the Marriage Bureau last month . Reaction: Alec Baldwin tweeted afterwards that all paparazzi should be waterboarded . In the interview, which took place . before his weekend wedding in New York, Baldwin said he has learned to . control his anger issues. 'You have to let that go,' he said. 'Enough time - I mean, it does heal wounds.' Although he didn't think he would marry again after his split with Kim, Alec revealed he couldn't help falling for Hilaria, who he credits with putting him on a diet and keeping him away from alcohol. He said: 'I thought, I'm probably never going to meet somebody like this again, and so I decided I would get married.. which is kind of mind-blowing to me.' But his 'change' from hothead to peaceful man may take longer than he thinks. Last month, Baldwin was involved in an unseemly altercation with a photographer after collecting his marriage licence. Smile for the camera: A rare picture of Alec looking happy in front of the camera, on the day of his wedding . Here comes the bride: Hilaria Thomas, now Baldwin, stepped out before her wedding in a summer dress .

He was seen lurching at tabloid news photographer Marcus Santos outside the city Marriage Licence Bureau as he left the office with his then fianceé. Santos, who works for the New York Daily News, later claimed the 30 Rock star 'punched' him in the face outside the office. He told the newspaper: 'He comes after me, starts shoving and punching me - one time, right in the chin.' But Baldwin maintained on Twitter that he was provoked. Baldwin tweeted soon after the incident: 'A photographer’ almost hit me in the face with his camera this morning. #allpaparazzishouldbewaterboarded'. He added later: 'It's sad w the tabloid press. They attempt 2 provoke an incident + when it doesn't pan out, they say u did it anyway... #no1punchedany1'","Actor's younger sibling spoke to CNN's Piers Morgan about politics .

A survivalist is hoping to outlast the Apocalypse with his latest purchase - a £15,000 Cold War bunker. The underground shelter was built during the height of the Cold War in 1958 to protect key personnel in the event of nuclear war. It is accessed through a small reinforced concrete hatch and ladder which leads 20ft down to a shower, small kitchen, chemical toilet and beds. Welcoming: The bunker, with its own air supply, was originally used during nuclear exercises by the Royal Observer Corps . The underground shelter was built in 1958 by the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation to protect key personnel in the event of nuclear war . The bunker, with its own air supply, was originally used during nuclear exercises by the Royal Observer Corps. But for nearly half a century it has become damp and neglected beneath the fields of a farm in Wadhurst, East Sussex. Landowner Matthew Bramall, 58, who was a young boy when it was built by the Ministry of Defence, has now sold it to an undisclosed buyer. He said: 'I wouldn't want to live there - even if it meant surviving the Apocalypse. You'd just be stuck in the ground. In need of an update: The interior of the bunker in Wadhurst, East Sussex . The shelter was snapped up for a meagre £15,000 when farmer Matthew Bramall decided he didn't need a nuclear bunker any more . There are believed to be fewer than 1,000 Cold War nuclear bunkers left in Britain . The Cold War is the name given to the relationship that developed primarily between the West and the USSR after World War Two. The Cold War was to dominate international affairs for decades and many major crises occurred - the Cuban Missile Crisis, Vietnam, Hungary and the Berlin Wall being just some. For many, the growth in weapons of mass destruction was the most worrying issue. As a result underground military bases where MPs and the RAF prepared for what might have been were built during the period. About 1,500 of bunkers like the one in Wadhurst, East Sussex, at were built during the height of the Cold War in the 1950s, with many decommissioned less than 10 years later. The three sites up for sale were used until 1992, when they were taken out of service following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Many have been bought by telecommunication companies and others are used as safe storage for computer systems, but also memorabilia collectors have been tempted to snap up the bunkers. 'It has been on the farm my whole . life. When I was younger it was in use and soldiers would be posted . there, but gradually they stopped coming back.' He added: 'I have been selling bits of land over the last few years, and finally decided to get rid of the shelter. 'I was going to do something with it, but then I decided that if I wanted to live underground, I would live somewhere bigger. 'It's a total mess down there, and it's filled with stuff left over from when it was being used.' The new owner of the bunker has told Matthew he plans to renovate it so it can be used in the event of a catastrophe. Russ McLean, who runs a unique property website, said the bunker sale was an opportunity to buy a unique piece of construction for not very much money. He said: 'They are really interesting and at a price you can afford, I'm not surprised this bunker was snapped up so quickly. 'It's a time capsule from a period of history that we will hopefully never have to revisit. 'They were seen as a beacon of hope in a terrifying time, but now I think an anti-nuclear bunker would be the perfect place to hide from your angry wife.' There are believed to be fewer than 1000 Cold War nuclear bunkers left in Britain. Mr Bramall has lived on the farm in Wadhurst, East Sussex, his entire life, and was only three when the MoD began construction on the subterranean structure .

Tom Comstock, of Portland, was rear-ended by a truck last week, causing a load of lumber to shoot through his back windshield and almost kill him. The lumber scraped the side of his head and came to rest on his steering wheel. Mr Comstock, a registered nurse, then immediately jumped out of his vehicle to make sure no one else was injured in the multi-car pileup. The luckiest man alive: Tom Comstock suffered only minor scrapes to his head . ‘I get stopped, and look at the lumber in my front seat and say to myself ‘damn. That should have killed me,’ he wrote on his Facebook page. ‘Then I do what any good nurse would do. I jump out of my car and yell ‘IS ANYONE HURT? I’M A NURSE!’ Paramedics arrived as Mr Comstock tended to the other vehicles and were amazed he was okay. ‘The paramedic asks me to step back cause ‘this is gonna be gruesome,’ he continued. ‘I don't think they believed me when I told them it was my car.’ Shiver me timbers: Not even Mr Comstock himself can believe he survived so narrowly . Incredible: The lumber shot just past his head and hand, shocking paramedics who expected a gruesome scene . Amazed he still has a hand: Mr Comstock says he moved his hand just before the lumber plowed through his vehicle, or else he would have lost it . One of the paramedics told him she expected much worse, he further explained. Pictures taken by the lucky man show what looks like an impossibly lu cky escape from death, it doesn’t look like anyone could possibly have walked away from the vehicle alive. He was taken to a hospital after a brief on-scene examination. As word of how Mr Comstock made it to the hospital spread, he began to receive visitors looking to catch lightning in a bottle. A miracle: This incident looks unsurvivable from the front of the truck . How could anyone survive this: The lumber took out the head rest on the driver's seat . What a wreck: In addition to lumber almost taking his life, the rear end of Mr Comstock's truck is also smashed up . ‘Most of the people there wanted to rub my head for luck,’ he wrote. ‘Couldn't count the number of people who told me to buy a lottery ticket.’ A doctor told him he would be fine, to just take pain killers and buy that lottery ticket. His vehicle is heavily damaged, but he’s okay – and looking to the future. ‘I told God, if he's going to save me from death from this and he doesn't send me a boyfriend, I'm going to call a party foul,’ he told KATU.","Tom Comstock was involved in a multi-car pileup last week in Portland, OR .

The average family manages just 36 minutes of quality time together a day, new research has revealed. A study found that hectic work schedules and the sheer volume of domestic chores leave little time for family fun. Researchers also found that a typical family will find time for just 15 days out together every year. It also emerged nearly half of the 2,000 adults polled feel the balance of work and play is skewed in favour of their job. Time: The average family spends just over half an hour of quality time together per day because of work and other life commitments, research has shown (library image) Christmas Day, the occasional Sunday together and days spent in the garden during the summer were hailed as times when families get to spend quality time together. Visiting the grandparents and reading to the children at night also gave everyone a chance to relax and enjoy each other’s company. Gemma Arranz, a spokesperson for IKEA which commissioned the study, said: 'Family life gets more hectic as time goes on, so it’s not surprising that Christmas Day is when we spend the most time together in one go. 'Modern family life is hectic for many parents. Daily chores and housework are an essential part of family life but can also make home life feel very routine. 'We want to help parents to make the most of this time and see it as an opportunity for interaction and engagement with their kids, not something that gets in the way.' The study found working long or anti-social hours was the most common stumbling block, while evenings and weekends dominated by household chores and frantic routines were common. That leads to just over half an hour a day that families get to be with one another without regular distraction. All together: Christmas Day and Sundays are when busy working families spend time together (library image) But even then it’s not easy - eight in ten parents admit they often battle with the TV or videogames to get the kids’ attention. Despite the majority of families having good intentions to organise things for the family to do as a whole at weekends, plans fall through a quarter of the time due to things getting in the way, results showed. No surprise then that 55 per cent of families say they suffer from a hectic domestic life. And modern life does seem to take its toll - more than 70 per cent admitted there are regular instances when the whole family sits in front of the television in silence because they’re too tired for conversation. Nearly three quarters of mums and dads felt their children were growing up too fast, yet six in ten said their weekly routine doesn’t leave them enough time to enjoy their kids at the age they are. In fact, nearly a third have missed key moments in their child’s development because of their hectic routine keeping them away.","Typical family spends 15 days out together every year, research showed .

Discovery: A man who found a cigarette in his wife's handbag has filed for a divorce, reports suggest . A Saudi husband divorced his wife three months after they married because he found a cigarette in her bag. The unnamed man, from the southern Saudi city of Jizan, was so furious at the discovery he immediately filed for divorce. It is believed the woman, who maintains the cigarette was not hers and that she does not smoke, has since attempted to change her husband's mind. Relatives from both sides have also intervened to amend the situation, some reports claim. However, any attempts at a reconciliation have so far failed as the man is said to be convinced the cigarette did belong to his wife. Around 600,000 women smoke cigarettes in Saudi Arabia, official figures show. They make up a tenth of the total smoking population - which is a estimated at six million. The figure includes around 800,000 teenagers - mainly intermediate and high school students - and expatriates. Last year a Saudi judge ruled that women who suffered as a result of their husbands’ smoking were allowed to file for divorce. In October 2012, Saudi judges set a new trend in the country by using cigarette smoking as a factor in child custody cases. 'A parent could now lose the custody case if he or she is proven to be a smoker,' a legal official told Gulf News. 'Under the emerging trend, the smoking factor is now being treated like the drinking factor and can decide the outcome of the custody case,' he said. The court would favour non-smoking parents and would factor smoking into custody cases to protect the child from the negative impact of passive smoking. A study in the western city of Madinah found that 40 per cent of Saudi university female graduates would not marry husbands who smoked. The young women said they did not want to 'marry themselves into a smoking home' as they would fear for the future of their husbands and children.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement . An international peace conference aimed at ending Syria's civil war will be held in January, the first face-to-face talks between the government of President Bashar al-Assad and rebels seeking to overthrow him, the United Nations announced today. The United Nations is hoping for a peaceful transition in Syria, building on an agreement between world powers reached in June last year. The deal calls for the warring sides to agree to set up a transitional governing body with full executive powers, including over military and security entities. 'We will go to Geneva with a mission of hope,' U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement. The . announcement came as Syria mediator Lakhdar Brahimi met senior U.S. and . Russian officials in Geneva in his latest effort to get negotiations on . track to end a war, now in its third year, that has killed more than . 100,000 people. Brahimi, . with backing from world powers, has been trying to convene a peace . conference since May and had hoped that it could be held in . mid-December. He will hold a news conference later on today to announce the invitees, a spokeswoman said. The . participation of Syria's ally Iran in the peace conference has been a . major stumbling block as Washington has opposed it, while Russia has . backed Tehran's attendance. It was not clear from Ban's statement whether Iran would be invited. Efforts: The announcement came as Syria mediator Lakhdar Brahimi met senior U.S. and Russian officials in Geneva in his latest effort to get negotiations on track to end the war . He said he expected 'all regional and international partners to demonstrate their meaningful support for constructive negotiations'. Brahimi has previously called for Iran to be included in the conference. A U.S. official said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry would attend the talks.

World powers including the United States clinched a deal on curtailing Iran's nuclear programme at the weekend, in a sign of easing tensions between the longtime foes. Brahimi, after separate talks with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif at the weekend, met leaders of the Syrian opposition on Sunday. Factional fighting and fragmentation among those seeking to overthrow Assad have hampered the revolt as well as diplomatic efforts to form a representative opposition party to negotiate with Assad's delegation.

Dom Loehnis (pictured) told the Old Bailey he sat next to Rebekah Brooks, a former editor of the News of the World, at a meal at the PM's country residence in October 2010 . Rebekah Brooks discussed how to hack phones while attending a birthday party for David Cameron at Chequers, her trial at the Old Bailey heard yesterday. The former News International chief executive was one of 60 guests invited to celebrate Mr Cameron’s 44th birthday at his official country retreat in October 2010. Brooks, 45, sat next to Dom Loehnis, a headhunter and one of Mr Cameron’s closest friends. Giving evidence, Mr Loehnis said Brooks told him there was ‘one default code’ to access mobile phone messages and that ‘nobody changed’ their PIN. Loehnis, who had Mr Cameron as his best man at his wedding and knows him from their days at Eton together, said he sat next to the former News of the World editor at a meal in the PM's country residence. And he told the court that Mrs Brooks said she thought Andy Coulson, Mr Cameron's spin doctor and the former editor of the News of the World, might not survive in his Number 10 job because of the scandal. Describing the dinner Mr Loehnis told jurors: 'She (Brooks) said at a certain point people had discovered that you could get into mobile phone voicemails by tapping in a distinct code.' Mr Loehnis said he got the impression phone hacking had been going on since the late 1990s ‘when mobile phones became something most people had.' Andrew Edis QC, prosecuting at the Old Bailey, asked if Brooks said anything about how extensively the practice was used. Mr Loehnis, a consultant with an international group of headhunters, said: 'No, simply that once people had worked out how to do it, who knew how many people had done it? 'The impression I got was that it was something that once you discovered you can do it, you do it almost because you can,' said Mr Loehnis. The former Sunday Telegraph journalist said Brooks never gave any indication of whether she thought it was illegal or right or wrong. 'Was there anything about the general attitude among journalists on the subject?' Mr Edis asked. 'No,' the witness replied. The Old Bailey heard Mr Loenhis was contacted by police when they found a handwritten letter he had sent to Brooks following her resignation as Chief Executive Officer at News International in July 2011. Jonathan Laidlaw QC, defending Brooks, claimed the ‘two minute' conversation between his client and Mr Loehnis was not an admission that she had been involved in phone hacking but was simply a topical subject at the time. Accused: Former News of The World editor Rebekah Brooks arrives at the phone hacking trial in London today . The court heard the topic of conversation was Andy Coulson (pictured here arriving at court) who was then director of communications for Cameron . He said: 'It was common knowledge, not . just in Fleet Street, that there were weaknesses in telephone security . voicemail systems and both of you were acknowledging that it was . possible to access voicemails.' 'Yes,' Mr Loehnis answered. The court heard the topic of conversation . arose after Mr Loehnis asked Brooks if she thought her co-accused Andy . Coulson - then director of communications for Cameron - would survive . the media fallout on phone hacking. Mr Loenhis said: 'She (Brooks) said she wasn't sure if he would survive it as she felt that the story was not going away.' Mr Laidlaw told jurors Brooks was ‘relaxed' during the dinner for 60 of David Cameron's family and closest friends. Close friends: Mr Loehnis met David Cameron, pictured at the British Curry Awards in London on Monday night, at Eton and was best man at his wedding . Scene: Mr Loehnis told the court about a conversation he had with Brooks while at a birthday dinner for the Prime Minister at Chequers (pictured) He . put it to Mr Loehnis: 'She never hid from you her knowledge that it was . possible to access voicemails from the late 90s or made more than what . was a reflection of common knowledge at the time. 'She certainly did not say or even hint that she had known of phone hacking at the News of The World during her editorship or that she had been involved in the commission of phone hacking.' 'No, she didn't,' the witness replied. Brooks, 45, denies conspiracy to phone hack, conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office, and perverting the course of justice. Brooks is standing trial alongside her husband Charles Brooks, 50, Andy Coulson, 45, news editor Ian Edmondson, 44, managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, former royal editor Clive Goodman, 56, News International head of security Mark Hanna, 50, and PA Cheryl Carter, 49.

Bosses at pizza chain Domino’s put up a sign telling workers they could only speak English. Foreign staff at one takeaway were told they could be sacked for speaking their native tongue. Managers put up a notice which read: ‘All staff whilst you are working at this store you must speak in English. This is for ease of communication, safety and due to some complaints from staff at other stores. ‘Anybody ignoring this could find disciplinary procedures  followed, as it could be seen as a form of workplace bullying.’ Pizza delivery man Stuart Horton has quit his job over a notice written by a Domino's manager warning staff to speak in English or face disciplinary action . The red and blue felt-tip poster had the word ‘English’ boxed in and written in green. Employees at the branch in Preston, Lancashire, claimed the policy was discriminatory. Around . 15 staff work at the takeaway and most, including those from Poland, . Hungary and Asia, do not speak English as a first language. The franchise is operated by the private firm Topwest Limited. Area manager David Woods has reportedly agreed to meet staff to discuss concerns.

Mature college student Stuart Horton, 47, who has worked part time with the firm for five years said around 15 staff worked at the branch, the majority of whom do not speak English as a first language. Among them are Asian, Polish and Hungarian workers. Mr Horton who is studying for a community policing and justice management degree said: 'The notice was on there for about a week. It was long enough to strike fear among people. 'It shocked me and angered me. I’m aware of the health and safety act and having to speak English doesn’t feature in any law. 'The manager took the staff on in the first place knowing full well their native tongues are from different regions and they are trying to learn English. 'Some of them have a basic grasp of English but it isn’t a problem and there isn’t a communication barrier. Everybody speaks English if talking to customers or answering the phone.

American student Amanda Knox, who is facing a retrial in Italy in the murder of her roommate, received some good news this week when forensic experts revealed that there were no traces of the victim’s DNA on the alleged murder weapon. On Friday, experts began tests on a kitchen knife that the Italian prosecutors claimed was used to murder British student Meredith Kercher in Perugia in 2007. Two years ago, Knox and her former boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were cleared of all charges in connection to Kercher’s murder after they had served four years in prison for the crime. Amanda Knox, 26, could be heading for another acquittal in Italy after forensic experts have failed to find any trace of Meredith Kercher's DNA on a knife that was alleged to be the murder weapon . Perugia police seized this large kitchen knife from her lover Raffaele Sollecito's apartment, where Knox allegedly had used it for cooking . In March, Italy's highest court ordered the new trial for the pair, overturning their acquittals. The 26-year-old Knox, who has been attending college in Seattle since her return to the U.S., announced that she will not go to Italy to face another trial. This latest revelation that skin cells found on the knife are not those of Kercher could refute the prosecution’s claim that Knox used the large piece of cutlery to kill the British national. Following Kercher’s slaying in 2007, Perugia police seized the sizable kitchen knife from Sollecito’s apartment, where Knox allegedly had used it for cooking, according to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. DNA testing performed this week have shown that skin cells found between the handle and the blade are those of Knox, not Kercher. The fact that Kercher's blood was not found on the blade could possibly spell a second acquittal for Knox when the retrial comes to a close November 26. Knox’s attorney Ted Simon told ABC News Friday that he was satisfied with this turn of events in Italy. Amanda Knox was all smiles in the rain in . Seattle, Washington, last month as she chatted on the phone while picking up . supplies at a pet store ahead of the re-trial in Italy . Meanwhile, Sollecito's attorney, Luca . Maori, said that all evidence points to the fact that contrary to the . prosecutors’ version of events, the knife that has become the . centerpiece of the case against his client and Knox was not the murder . weapon after all. The forensic experts will officially unveil the results of the DNA tests during a court hearing November 6. The appellate court hearing the new case could declare Knox's in contempt of court for failing to return to Italy for the trial, but that carries no additional penalties. 'We refute the idea that because Amanda is not coming, that Amanda is guilty, that Amanda is using a strategy.

Family: Francesco Sollecito, centre, the father of Raffale Sollecito, was at the hearing although his son was not . 'Amanda . always said she was a friend of Meredith's, Amanda has always respected . the Italian justice system,' Knox's lawyer Luciano Ghirga said before . the trial opened. Knox and Sollecito, now 29, were convicted and later acquitted in Ms Kercher's death. Knox . served four years of a 26-year sentence, including three years on a . slander conviction for falsely accusing a Perugia bar owner in the . murder, before leaving Italy a free woman after her 2011 acquittal. The . bar owner wrongly accused of killing Meredith Kercher today insisted . that Amanda Knox is guilty of the British student's murder. Patrick .

'I think she is guilty, and that is why she slandered me.' Francesco Maresca, representing the Kercher family, said that the . victim's relatives believed Knox was present at the scene of Meredith's . death in the flat the two students shared in Perugia. 'I think she is talking too much, sincerely, and this attitude of continuous playing the victim is inappropriate,' he added.

The evidence that sealed the convictions of Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher is far from conclusive, a new investigation claims. On the eve of the retrial of the former lovers in Florence, a documentary has asked five key questions about the case against them. Miss Kercher, 21, a European Studies student from south London, had her throat slashed on November 1, 2007, at her apartment in Perugia, Italy. She shared the flat with Knox, from Seattle, Washington. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Meredith Kercher, left, 21, a student from south London, had her throat slashed on November 1, 2007, at her apartment in Perugia, Italy, which she shared with Amanda Knox, right, from Seattle, Washington . Following a fast-track trial in 2008, Rudy Guede, 20, was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to 30 years jail, later reduced to 16. Knox and her Italian boyfriend Sollecito faced trial the following year and were also found guilty. Knox was sentenced to 26 years and Sollecito 25 but their guilty verdicts were quashed in 2011 and Knox returned to Seattle. However, this year the Italian courts made the decision to have a retrial. It opens on Monday and could last a month - but Knox is not attending. If she is found guilty again, Italy could apply for her extradition. On the case: The new investigation follows criminal lawyer . Fulvia Guardascione, left, for the prosecution, and criminal litigator . Alexander Guttieres, for the defence, as they scrutinise evidence to try to find out the truth . The new investigation - conducted for a Channel 5 documentary - follows criminal lawyer Fulvia Guardascione, for the prosecution, and criminal litigator Alexander Guttieres, for the defence, as they scrutinise the case in an attempt to find out what happened. Using a purpose-built reconstruction of the Villa de la Pergola, the Perugia home shared by Miss Kercher and Knox, the opposing lawyers set about a CSI-style investigation, consulting with crime-scene specialists including experts in glass shatter, self defence, DNA and sound. Employing high-speed cameras, forensic powder and hi-tech audio equipment, they attempt to answer five key questions that remain about one of the most infamous murders of the last decade. Original investigation: Forensic investigators are seen at work in the Villa de la Pergola, the Perugia home shared by Miss Kercher and Knox, the day after Miss Kercher was found dead with her throat cut . Reconstructed: Using this purpose-built . reconstruction of the flat shared by Kercher and Knox, the two . lawyers set about a CSI-style investigation, consulting with experts in . glass shatter, self defence, DNA and sound . Lone killer? Rudy Guede was . found guilty of Miss Kercher's murder after a fast track trial in 2008 . In the 2009 trial it was argued that Miss Kercher's body showed few or no defence wounds. To the prosecution it meant multiple people had to be involved in her murder - restraining Meredith while she was killed. But the defence argued that it would have been possible for Guede to commit the crime on his own. For the TV investigation Eric Baskind, . a martial arts expert, used a set exactly the same size, layout and . dimensions as the villa in which Miss Kercher was killed. He . tested if he could restrain a model and inflict the fatal knife wound . without the help of others and found that one person could have carried . out the attack. However, he said, to do so would have been 'considerably more . difficult'. Mr Guttieres said: 'I don't think that was conclusive.' On the night of the murder a smashed window was discovered in the room of Filomena Romanelli, flatmate of Miss Kercher and Knox. The rock used to break the glass lay inside. To the defence, this was Guede's way in. But the prosecution argued that this was a cover-up to hide the killer's tracks. How was the window broken? Glass shatter specialist Greg Waite investigated the physics of the smashed window that was discovered in the room of Filomena Romanelli, flatmate of Miss Kercher and Knox . To establish whether the window was broken from inside or out, the investigation lawyers recruited forensic glass specialist Greg Waite. Returning to the scale set, Mr Waite set about throwing a similar rock through a window from the outside-in and then repeated it from the inside-out. After consulting the limited crime scene photographs, he concluded that it was 'more likely' that the rock had come from the outside. He said examining ridge marks of the shards of glass would conclusively determine the direction the rock was thrown. Ms Guardascoine and Mr Guttieres examine the broken window: After consulting the limited crime scene photographs, Mr Waite concluded that it was 'more likely' that the rock had come from the outside . During the 2009 trial the prosecution case relied heavily on placing both Knox and Sollecito at the scene. Traces of Sollecito's DNA were found on Miss Kercher's bra clasp. But at the appeal case his lawyers argued that the clasp had been moved by police and contaminated. To test if this theory could be correct, the documentary team consulted John Manlove, an expert in forensics. A full-scale replica of Meredith Kercher's . bedroom: Traces of Sollecito's DNA were found on the scene on Miss . Kercher's bra clasp. But at the appeal his lawyers argued that the clasp . had been contaminated by police . He applied colourless powder on his hands (a substitute for DNA) before shaking hands with the lawyers. Lights showed how the powder was transferred easily. Guttieres said: 'The police conducted a Mickey Mouse investigation based on presumption, conjecture and intuition and it frightens me to death to think that you can go to jail for a very long time based on that evidence.' Did he leave the footprint? Raffaele Sollecito was convicted alongside Knox of Miss Kercher's killing, but his conviction was also quashed on appeal . An unidentified bloody footprint was found on a bathmat in Miss Kercher's home. Its size appeared too big to be Knox's but if the prosecution could prove it belonged to Sollecito, then it would place him at the murder scene. According to the TV prosecution, Sollecito has a unique arched toe. Forensic podiatrist Dr Sarah Reel carried out a test using ink and a sheet. It demonstrated that an arched toe would provide distinct imprints in either a walking or a standing position. Dr Reel recommended further footprint tests should be taken at the retrial. Guttieres said: 'That could make a difference in terms of identifying the print and whether it is Sollecito's or not.' Guardascione agreed a similar test at the trial could be crucial to the defence or prosecution case. Placing more than one person at the crime scene could prove vital to the prosecution's case. Key witness Nara Capezzali claims to have heard at least two people running away from the scene. Sound . engineer Dr Giancarlo Strani was called in by the documentary team to . establish whether noise of someone running on the metal stairs outside . Meredith's home could be heard from inside Nara's flat. Using high-tech audio equipment, Dr Strani concluded it was 'impossible' to hear running on the metal stairs. Guttieres said: 'We heard the audio specialist say ""impossible"", you can't get any more conclusive an answer.' However, . Guardascione argued the different conditions had to be considered . before dismissing any of the witness testimonies. She said: 'We had . different stairs, we had a different environment, we were in a different . period of the year.' █ Amanda Knox Trial — 5 Key Questions will air on Channel 5 on Thursday 26th September, 10pm.",Investigation comes days before Knox and ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito are to be retried over the 2007 killing of British student Meredith Kercher .

Women who were sexually abused as schoolgirls decades ago have bravely come forward to talk about being molested by a respected and well-connected teacher at the prestigious Potomac School. Laura Gill was just 14 when Christopher Kloman molested her at his home. She told her parents who reported the attack to the elite establishment in McLean, Virginia. However rather than being reported to the police and losing his job, the teenage girl was told that Kloman would undergo counseling and was allowed to return to Potomac - where she faced him in the school hallways. Christopher Kloman was sentenced to 43 years in jail last month for the sexual abuse of girls aged 12 to 14 at Potomac School in McLean, Virginia 40 years ago . Kloman, now 74, was finally sentenced to 43 years in Fairfax County last month for the sexual abuse of young girls in his care. One of his victims came forward in 2011 . after learning that her abuser was now teaching at . her son's school. Kloman was arrested in November 2012. He pleaded guilty in August to the molestations of Laura Gill, Anne Sullivan, Jane Gould, Kim Shorb and Julia Craighill. The disgraced teacher was accused of molesting his . victims, aged 12 to 14, after luring them to isolated locations, some under . the guise of helping them with homework. Kloman, known to students as 'The Wolf', attacked women who are now all in their fifties and sixties. Many have carried the physical and psychological scars of what happened to them during their school days for life. Ms Gill, now 51, was one of five women who have revealed their identity after the abuse. The group, who are being represented by Gloria Allred, are demanding answers from the school on how Kloman was allowed to continue in his job. Most of the victims said they did not tell their parents about the abuse - but Ms Gill and another victim said their parents did tell Potomac. Two former headmasters that Kloman worked for said that they were not aware of the abuse, according to the Washington Post. John Kowalik, the head of Potomac since August, told the  Post: 'What has happened to these women over the years, I can’t comprehend. It deserves our best effort to find out what the school actually knew and when.' Sex abuse has been revealed at the Potomac School in McLean, Virginia by one teacher who was employed from the mid-60s until 1994 . One former student Cricket Beauregard, who was not part of the criminal case, said she was abused by Kloman when she went to his house to clean in a trade for driving lessons. He opened the door in a bathrobe and once she was inside, grinded against her. He told her he had done the same thing with her friend - and then Kloman raped the teenager. Lawyer Gloria Allred is representing the victims who were victims of sexual abuse at the Potomac school . Ms Beauregard told the Post: 'It destroyed my internal compass. I didn’t know what was right or wrong anymore. I couldn’t make decisions for myself...I was an automaton.' Although the student believed she was the only one he had harmed, Kloman had attacked a long line of girls - including one whom he asked to his home for a swim; one babysitting his son; one in his classroom. At least 15 women have come forward to accuse their former teacher of abuse at different times from the mid-1960s until the mid-1980s. Not only was he not arrested or fired, . Kloman was promoted by Potomac before leaving in 1994 - with a . heartfelt yearbook dedication. The . pedophile then moved on to teach at Barnesville School in Dickerson, . Maryland for a brief time before popping up at the Washington Episcopal . School of Bethesda in 1995 as assistant head. The . secret had been long-buried by Kloman's victims - some of whom blamed . themselves for the attacks or spent years avoiding relationships with . men. However Ms Sullivan told the Post that she was walking down the hallway of Washington Episcopal School when she spotted Kloman. She told the Post: 'I thought, ''Oh, man. I can’t live with myself anymore.''' The next week, Ms Sullivan paid a . visit to the police. A year-long investigation was launched and with . each woman who came forward, the group gained strength in learning they . were not alone. Many attended Kloman's trial and watched him sentenced to what will likely be the rest of his natural life in jail. The Potomac is known as a school popular among Washington's political elite for their children's education. When . Kloman was sentenced, he received several letters from high-profile . supporters whose children has been educated at the school - including a former Solicitor-General. Kenneth Starr, who sparked the Monica Lewinsky scandal with his report on President Clinton, came out in support of Kloman. Starr wrote to a Virginia judge, pleading to overturn the 43-year prison sentence handed down to his family friend in October. Yet despite his victims' tearful testimony in court and Kloman's own admission of guilty, Starr and several other high-profile supporters do not believe he should serve a prison sentence. In the letter sent from Starr and his wife, the couple wrote that Kloman should be spared jail because 'he took the time to chat' with their daughter. They added that he had 'made a concerted effort to correct his behavior of the past' and suggested a community sentence would be a more fitting punishment.

President Obama's approval ratings have hit an all-time low as the continued problems with the health care roll out have forced him to apologize once again for his administration's mistakes. A new poll by Quinnipiac University revealed on Tuesday that 54 per cent of Americans disapprove of President Obama's job performance while only 39 per cent approve. Adding to the blow, the latest poll breaks the results down into gender and age demographics, showing that every such group disapproves of the work the President is doing. New lows: President Obama has never had a 39 per cent approval rating, making this the lowest point yet during his two terms in office . Male and female voters, young and old, rich and poor, all have higher disapproval ratings than approval ratings for the second term president. 'President Obama's job approval rating has fallen to the level of former President George W. Bush at the same period of his Presidency,' Quinnipiac University Polling Institute assistant director Tim Malloy said in the release. These new figures show that his public perception continues to deteriorate as just two weeks ago he was at an earlier record low, with only 42 per cent approving in an October 30 poll. The latest hit coincides with the revelation that, in spite of his earlier public promises that anyone who liked their health insurance plan would not be forced to switch, about five per cent of Americans will not be able to retain their current health plans. 'President Obama's misstatement, ""If you like your health plan, you can keep it,"" left a bad taste with a lot of people. Nearly half of the voters, 46 per cent, think he knowingly deceived them,' Mr Malloy said. The only issue area where voters believe the President is doing a good job is that of handling terrorism, where 52 per cent of respondents think he has done a good job with 42 per cent disapproving of his approach on global terror. Keeping his head up: President Obama, seen here on Tuesday with service members and vice President Joe Biden (blocked in view but sitting two seats to the left of Obama), has tried apologizing for the health care roll out to no avail . The Quinnipiac poll offers break outs on his handling of foreign policy, immigration, the economy, health care and the federal budget- all of which came out with deficits. In spite of the opposition to the Affordable Care Act, the biggest gap between disapproval and approval came from in the federal budget arena, with 62 per cent disapproving his handling of the issue and 32 per cent approving. The latest Quinnipiac poll focuses solely on President Obama, but when the previous Wall Street Journal/NBC poll was released on October 30 he was not the only one facing plummeting numbers. Republicans were also feeling the backlash from voters as the government shutdown was still fresh in their minds. The GOP felt the heat with an all-time-low of 22 per cent approval rating and 53 per cent disapproval.","Numbers continue to plummet for the President as his approval rating was two points higher just two weeks ago .

Jailed: Earle was sentenced to six years on Tuesday for brutal attack on his ex-girlfriend Cheryl Thrower . A jilted lover has been jailed for six years after he 'snapped' and brutally stabbed his ex-partner - with a potato peeler. Care home worker Steven Earle, 53, attacked Cheryl Thrower, 55, as she went to make coffee at the home they had shared in Kettering, Northamptonshire. A court heard the couple - who met at a residential home where they both worked - had been together for six years and had been on good terms since their break-up. But the dad-of-two said he 'just snapped' and stabbed his former girlfriend with the six inch kitchen utensil as he visited the property to discuss dividing up their belongings on August 28. After the unprovoked assault, Earle called an ambulance himself and told police they could find him at a nearby community centre. Police arrived at the scene to find Miss Thrower lying in a pool of blood from a stab wound to her lower back and another which punctured her abdomen. She was rushed to Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry where medics discovered one of the injuries had caused a small laceration to her kidney. On Tuesday Earle admitted wounding with intent when he appeared at Northampton Crown Court. Jailing him for six years and four months, Judge Rupert Mayo said: 'You have admitted a serious assault on your partner of six years. 'You used a weapon to inflict these injuries. While short-lived, this was a sustained and repeated assault on the same person.' The court heard Earle launched his vicious assault despite their amicable split earlier this year. No excuse: Earle admitted his vicious assault and even telephoned the police himself to tell them where they could find him . Assault: Judge Rupert Mayo called Earle's attack on Miss Thrower 'serious' and 'sustained' and jailed him for six years and four months . Prosecutor Neil Bannister said Miss Thrower attempted to stem the blood flow by using a tea towel. He said: 'She grabbed a kitchen towel as she was starting to bleed quite heavily. 'Police noticed a great deal of blood on the carpet. 'The defendant called the police and he made admissions as to stabbing his partner. 'He said he just snapped.' Miss Thrower was discharged from hospital four days later. Earle, who had no previous convictions, was described in character references as 'hard-working, reliable and honest.' He was given credit by the judge for for having led a 'useful life' in bringing up his two children on his own, for the remorse shown and for calling the emergency services himself. He is expected to serve up to half the sentence in custody before being released on licence.","Father-of-two Steven Earle, 53, attacked his partner of six years at the home they had shared in Kettering .

Shake-up: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced a string of reforms for the NHS this week . Hospitals have made no improvements in patient safety or care in the three years since the Mid Staffordshire scandal, the health watchdog said yesterday. In a scathing verdict, the Care Quality Commission said the number of warning notices it had handed to NHS trusts for putting patients at risk had more than doubled over the past year. And the number of serious problems – including patients not being fed, being left for hours on trolleys or over serious staffing shortages – had risen by a fifth. The appalling neglect that cost hundreds of lives at Mid Staffs from 2005 to 2009 has put hospitals on notice not to repeat the same mistakes. But the CQC warns they are no better at protecting patients from harm, ensuring they are treated with dignity or respect or in monitoring standards of care. In its annual report on the NHS –  published yesterday – the watchdog states: ‘In the aftermath of the failures of care at Mid Staffordshire NHS foundation trust, our inspectors’ biggest concern in 2012/13 was that acute hospitals made no improvement in assessing and monitoring the  quality of the care they provided. ‘Hospitals did not improve their assessment and monitoring of the quality of the care they provided. There was also no improvement in safety and safeguarding, or in treating people with dignity and respect. ‘We were alarmed to see that there were fewer hospitals where patients were always treated with dignity and their privacy and independence respected.’ This week Jeremy Hunt announced a string of reforms, including jail for doctors and nurses involved in neglect and fines for hospitals that cover up mistakes. Example: The appalling neglect that cost hundreds of lives at Mid Staffs from 2005 to 2009 has put hospitals on notice not to repeat the same mistakes . The Health Secretary admitted that cruelty had been allowed to become ‘normal’ in the NHS but he promised to transform it into one of the best healthcare systems in the world. Grieving families said his plans were inadequate, while nursing unions demanded drastic increases in staffing levels to keep patients safe. Under fire: Chief Executive of the NHS Sir David Nicholson has faced calls to resign since the crisis . The CQC’s report is based on 35,000 inspections of hospitals, care homes, GP practices and dental surgeries last year. It identified poor care in one in ten hospital wards or departments and in a fifth of all care homes. The percentage of inspections that led to hospitals being given warning notices because patients were being put at risk rose from 3 per cent to 6.5 per cent. Dr Johnny Marshall, of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service managers, said the lack of improvement was disappointing. ‘It is absolutely critical that we continue to focus on delivering the highest levels of care and compassion across the entire health system in hospitals, in communities and at home,’ he added. ‘There is no excuse for not treating every patient as an individual, with the highest levels of dignity and respect.’ Peter Carter of the Royal College of Nursing, said: ‘Far too often we have seen decisions based on financial necessity rather than patient need, with services being removed from hospitals while community teams are still pitifully short-staffed.’ The NHS has lost 6,642 nurses since May 2010 and 752 in the past month alone, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.","Care Quality Commission said the number of warning notices had doubled .

But now it seems that you can change people's perceptions - just by choosing the right foundation. Speaking to the Sunday Times Style magazine, French neuroscientist Dr Arnaud Aubert revealed that imperfections can distract the brain, with the result that people with less than flawless skin are ranked lower on the social scale than they otherwise might be. What's more, make-up can also help boost your chances of success in everything from career to love, if Aubert is to be believed. Essential: Make-up can make you appear more trustworthy, likeable and attractive to other people . According to the scientist, who has authored a number of studies reflecting on the links between make-up, appearance and the way people perceive others, the 'social triangle' - the area from the eyes down to the mouth - is key to success. 'All the social information is in the centre of the face,' explains Aubert. 'If the brain is distracted by imperfections [such as spots], it processes less and so has a weaker social assessment of the person it is looking at.' Aubert's contention is backed by a 2011 study by beauty giant Proctor & Gamble that looked at how people reacted to women of all ages and ethnicities in and out of make-up. According to Nancy Etcoff, the lead scientist, those who wore make-up were seen as more likeable, trustworthy, attractive and competent. Gwyneth Paltrow shows off flawless skin but Lady Gaga's heavy make-up could make her seem untrustworthy . Flawless: Concealer can help reduce brain-distracting imperfections - boosting social capital in the process . Even those with thick make-up, although considered less trustworthy, were still thought to be more attractive and competent than those wearing nothing at all. This is something with which Lisa Eldridge, a leading make-up artist, can agree. 'I think make-up is a bit of a calling card because it's the first place you look,' Eldridge told the Sunday Times. 'If someone is wearing too much make-up, it can affect the way people talk to them, especially in the workplace. Bad make-up just looks terrible and can be a hindrance: poorly applied and matched foundation or false eyelashes worn to the office, for example, is too much of a distraction.' The solution? Keep it light, don't forget the BB cream and save make-up free days for the weekend.","French scientist Dr Arnaud Aubert says flaws can distract the brain .

When a star TV presenter told his wife his urge to become a Church of England curate was a ‘higher calling’ she dismissed it as a fad. However, it seems he also could not resist a rather lower calling and, after his ordination, he embarked on an affair with a pretty parishioner who is 20 years younger than him. Just 13 months after being ordained, he has quit the Church in disgrace, left his wife and moved in with his mistress, 38-year-old Jody Morgan. Scroll down for video . Charles Hodson, above, has left his wife and moved in with his mistress, quitting the church just 13 months after being ordained . Regarded as one of the most authoritative voices in international broadcasting, Charles Hodson presents TV company CNN’s World Business Today, attracting a worldwide audience of 200million. In a blog, Mr Hodson, 58, who was at Eton with Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote about the moment he told his wife Heike Bernhardt about his decision to take up ordained ministry. He said: ‘My beloved smiled knowingly and indulgently. “The latest fad,” she remarked, “You’ll have forgotten all about it by next week.”’ However, Miss Bernhardt supported him as he commuted between the B&B they ran on the outskirts of Taunton in Somerset, theological college in Oxford and CNN’s television studios in London. Jody Morgan, 38, from Taunton, (pictured right) is 20 years younger than Mr Hodson, left . In June 2012, at Wells Cathedral, the Bishop of Bath and Wells ordained Mr Hodson as a non-stipendiary deacon. At the time, Mr Hodson joked that his boss at CNN had told him:  ‘Anything you can do to make this place a bit holier, Charles, will be very welcome.’ Soon afterwards, he wrote in his church newsletter: ‘The two lives of curate and TV presenter may seem strange bedfellows – though the transferable skills are many – and I shall be taking care to operate in different modes and disciplines in the parish and in the studio.’ And last January, in a speech to leading City of London figures, he urged his audience to confess their wrongdoings and repent. St Andrew's Church in Taunton, where Charles Hodson is said to have had an affair with Miss Morgan . Miss Bernhardt, 51, confirmed yesterday that her husband had moved out of the B&B and was now living with his mistress. She said it had been ‘a big surprise to me’ when she discovered her husband was having an affair with a parishioner at St Andrew’s Church in Taunton. Mr Hodson's wife Heike Bernhardt, who said that she is no longer living with him . She told The Times: ‘I still have not met her and I have not made any attempts to know her. ‘It was a woman he met at his parish after he was ordained. He is not living with me any more.’ A spokesman for the Diocese of Bath and Wells said: ‘Mr Hodson resigned his post as assistant curate at St Andrew’s, Taunton, after declaring he had engaged in an adulterous relationship with a woman. ‘He agreed to a penalty by consent under the provisions of the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003 prohibiting him, for a period of five years from August 12, 2013, from exercising any of the functions of his orders as a deacon.’ Mr Hodson began his broadcasting career as a BBC trainee after leaving Oxford University and he moved to Channel 4 News before joining CNN International in 1995.

Her firm Dechert is being challenged in the High Court over a £16m legal bill . Miriam Clegg's lucrative work as a City solicitor faces embarrassing scrutiny after a controversial client launched a High Court action against her employer. Dechert, the international law firm, has been hit with a claim over alleged ‘overcharging’ by a  Kazakhstan mining conglomerate for work carried out by the Deputy Prime Minister’s wife and her colleagues. The £16 million bill sent to the Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) covered two years’ work by Dechert, including multiple invoices from Mrs Clegg charged at the partner rate of £570 an hour. The row is likely to prove embarrassing for Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg – whose £134,565 salary is dwarfed by his wife’s estimated earnings of £500,000 – as he tries to court votes by pledging to tackle the soaring cost of living for ordinary families. Mrs Clegg, who uses Miriam Gonzalez as her professional name, charges more than 90 times the current £6.31 per hour minimum wage when billing her multinational clients. The row comes as Lib Dem strategists have persuaded Mrs Clegg to adopt a higher profile – through more public appearances and staged photoshoots – in an apparent attempt to counter the electoral appeal of Samantha Cameron and Justine Miliband. ENRC, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and has extensive mining interests in Kazakhstan, hired Dechert in 2011 to carry out an internal governance review following claims of corruption by a whistleblower. It has lodged a High Court claim challenging £11.6 million of the £16 million bill – although its reasons for contesting the amount cannot be reported because of legal restrictions. The bill included charges by Mrs Clegg for making phone calls, sending emails, interviewing ENRC staff and carrying out background reading on the company. ENRC parted with Dechert earlier this year, and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) is now carrying out a criminal investigation into ‘fraud, bribery and corruption’ at the mining giant. Alleged wrongdoing included  employees using company money to buy a guesthouse, a farming business and a horse farm. Mystery: Details of the case at London's High Court, pictured, are shrouded in legal restrictions . Mrs Clegg previously advised the U.S. food conglomerate Kraft, three weeks before her husband Nick Clegg, right, described its takeover of the British chocolate firm Cadbury as 'just plan wrong' Dozens of employees were also said to have been involved in a network of relationships with suppliers that led to ENRC paying massively inflated prices for old equipment. Dechert, which was ordered to hand over its findings to the SFO, is understood to have complained that its investigation of ENRC was hampered by staff forging documents, wiping computer records, supplying the ‘wrong computer to the investigations team’ and setting up a ‘false office’. Its review is also understood to have concluded that senior executives had funnelled large amounts of resources out of the company into unauthorised projects – including ‘payments to  African presidents’ – and had misled auditors about their activities. Mrs Clegg joined Dechert two years ago as its EU trade chief, on an estimated £500,000 a year, after switching from rival law firm DLA Piper. She made the move shortly after a senior DLA Piper lawyer, Neil Gerrard, moved to Dechert – and brought the ENRC business with him. Mrs Clegg’s work for Dechert has previously caused controversy. Another client, the Moroccan mining giant OCP, has been criticised over mining phosphate in the Western Sahara, with human rights activists complaining about the treatment of local nomadic tribesmen – claims the company strongly denies. And while still at DLA Piper, Mrs Clegg was advising Kraft, the US food conglomerate, just three weeks before her husband called its takeover of Cadbury ‘just plain wrong’. Last night, Dechert and ENRC declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Mrs Clegg said: ‘I have nothing to say on the matter.’","Miriam Clegg's employer Dechert LLP is being challenged in the High Court .

Women who suffer from mood swings while going through the menopause can no longer blame it on their hormones, according to a new study. For decades it has been believed the change of life can cause the blues, with tens of millions of women around the world becoming snappy at this time. But the new American research found changes in the levels of the sex hormone oestrogen, which regulates a woman's periods, were not linked to bad temper. Women who suffer from mood swings while going through the menopause can no longer blame it on their hormones, according to a new study . The menopause is caused by a change in the balance of the body's sex hormones. In the lead up to it - perimenopause - oestrogen levels decrease, which causes the ovaries to stop producing an egg each month. But the new research focusing on a post-menopausal group not using hormone therapy found hormone concentrations were not related to memory, thinking or mood. The one exception was progesterone, which was connected with verbal memory and overall cognition in early menopause, but still not mood. The study, published online in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, is the first to investigate associations between sex hormones and cognition in both younger and older post-menopausal women. It is also the first to determine whether the hormones affect women differently based on their age and how much time has elapsed since they reached menopause. Professor Victor Henderson, of Stanford University in California, said the findings help clarify the role of hormones in age-related brain disturbances. After menopause there is a permanent reduction in a woman's levels of estradiol - the predominant oestrogen beforehand - estrone which is the main one after and progesterone, another hormone involved in the menstrual cycle. The research found hormone concentrations were not related to memory, thinking or mood . Several studies have examined the association between hormone concentrations and cognition but results have been inconsistent. Some researchers have speculated that the effect of oestrogen on cognitive ageing could differ depending on when exposure occurs. Professor Henderson said: 'Some effects might be more beneficial for younger post-menopausal women closer to the time of menopause than for older post-menopausal women.' This is known as the 'critical window.' In a study of 643 middle aged and elderly participants, he sorted his participants - whose ages ranged from 41 to 84 - into those who had gone into menopause less than six years previously and a later group who were beyond ten years. His researchers then gave the women a series of tests to gauge their memory and overall cognition before assessing them for depression and sampling their blood for the hormones. Professor Henderson said: 'We viewed the availability of hormone levels as an opportunity to test one aspect of the critical-window hypothesis - especially since we had two fairly large samples of women.' Based on the critical-window theory - along with past animal studies showing the timing of estradiol replacement affects memory - Prof Henderson had hypothesized higher levels would boost memory in younger menopausal women. He said: 'Instead we found no significant link - positive or negative - in either group.' He said the findings don't 'necessarily mean oestrogens are irrelevant to cognition since we have no way of measuring oestrogen directly at the brain level.' Professor Henderson added: 'But they imply boosting blood levels of estradiol or estrone - even in younger post-menopausal women - may not have a substantial effect on cognitive skills one way or the other.'","New U.S. research found changes in .

A top personal trainer has revealed that it is possible to get the supermodel-like gap-between-the-thighs look without resorting to cosmetic procedures or extreme eating regimes. Following worrying news that the most recent catwalk shows have inspired teenagers and young women to turn to costly fat-freezing procedures and near-starvation diets to get super-slim legs, Matt Townsend says there are exercises that can make a significant difference to the inner thigh area. 'One of the most common questions I receive is how to get rid of inner thigh fat,' he told MailOnline. Thin thighs: The Victoria's Secret Angels, pictured at the 2012 catwalk show, have made no secret of the intense workouts required to get their super-toned bodies . 'Though our body primarily burns fat as a whole and doesn't spot reduce, you CAN target which areas to emphasize a bit more.' But while Mr Townsend's targeted . inner-thigh workout may be healthier, it is by no means an easy option . and requires some serious effort. The Twitter users who admitted they would starve themselves to get the super-slim . thighs of the models they saw at fashion week are not alone. The number of people using social networks to . share 'thinspirational' images has seen a . worryingly sharp rise. There are now Twitter and Facebook accounts . dedicated to the 'thigh-gap' with more than 700,000 followers. In another indication of interest in . the 'trend', a top cosmetic surgery clinic in the UK said it had seen a . 240per cent rise in demand for a fat-freezing treatment on the . inner thigh area. Susan Ringwood, of UK eating . disorder awareness charity Beat, blames the advertising industry and its liberal use of Photoshop. She says: 'Hardly anyone has a thigh-gap without being underweight, or not yet fully adult, yet most . of the adverts we see show grown women with thighs that do . not meet when they stand upright. 'Our . bodies come in a wonderful variety of shapes and sizes - we . need to be able to appreciate and admire them for what they are.' One must do 12-15 reps of each of the five different exercises, which include squats, lunges and the terrifying-sounding Single-leg Romanian Deadlift. On the plus side, they can be done at home as part of a daily routine, as like any workout, keeping it up regularly is key to its success. The workout challenges the commonly-held belief that one must severely-restrict their diet in order to achieve slim upper thighs. Indeed, the 'thigh-gap' first sparked . controversy last month, when young fashionistas started tweeting that . they were prepared to stop eating in order to get the slender legs of the models they saw on the fashion week catwalks. The admissions were akin to the kind of worrying messages usually limited to the 'thinspiration' websites favored by those with eating disorders. But Mr Townsend is adamant that a severe diet is the worst course of action. 'The goal is to effectively target . the muscles so they are healthy and toned, not weak and frail,' he explained. 'So many . of these girls think they need to starve themselves to get skinny. While . I agree that both dieting and genetics do play a role, much of the . starvation aspects can be avoided with a clean diet and exercise. 'Not . only that, you'll feel fantastic the entire time and be full of energy - it's a much more sustainable approach.' Not only will these exercises help tighten up some unwanted areas, . you'll also create a nice synergistic balance with other leg muscles and . burn lots of calories, says celebrity personal trainer MATT TOWNSEND. Perform 12-15 reps per exercise. Squats: Hold your position for three seconds then return to original standing position . SQUATS . While standing tall with feet just beyond shoulder width, place . dumbbells by your sides and slowly squat until your hips are parallel to . ground. Hold your position in the bottom of the movement for three seconds . and return to original standing position. Be sure to not let your knees . hang over your toes while lowering to the ground. Keep your shoulders . pulled back and chest upright. SINGLE-LEG ROMANIAN DEADLIFT . Stand with feet together and emphasizing your heel, hold a dumbbell or . pair of dumbbells with hands slightly more than shoulder-width apart. Make sure your back is straight and abs tight, slowly lower the weight . towards the front foot while raising the other leg behind you for . balance. Once the weight reaches mid-shin level, push through the ground . heel to return to the upright position and squeeze the glutes at the . top position. Repeat on opposite leg once completed with set. GLUTE BRIDGE WITH MEDICINE BALL BETWEEN KNEES . While lying on your back with with knees bent and feet flat, place a . medicine ball between your knees and raise your hips in the area to full . extension. Squeeze your glutes and hold hips in air for five seconds at a . time. Squeeze the ball as hard as possible with your knees as this will . help emphasize more inner thighs. Lateral lunge: Squat as low as possible, holding that bottom position for three seconds . LATERAL LUNGE . Begin with stepping to the right beyond shoulder width while keeping . your toes forward and your feet flat. Squat through your right hip while . keeping your left leg straight.

Celebrities including supermodel Kate Moss, and presenter Fearne Cotton have all featured on the sites, on which anorexics offer tips and motivation to their followers. But those used as pin-ups are largely unaware that their pictures are being used.

She said: ‘I didn’t realise I was on any sites and I certainly can’t take responsibility for something as huge as that,’ she said when alerted to the sites. 'I hope these girls get the help they need.’ Miss Air is believed to be a UK size 4 and appears to have recently lost weight. But she insisted she has a ‘healthy’ body image and is a positive role model to her daughter Freya, 10. She said: ‘I’ve been a skinny girl my whole life. I just don’t sit down – I’m always on the go. 'It must be down to the genes. We have a healthy body image in my house and great appetites. 'It’d be hard for you to find a food I don’t love.’ Miss Air, who rose to fame on the children’s television drama Biker Grove, is known to take Bikram yoga classes to stay in shape. The intense classes, which last 90 minutes long, take place in around 40 degree heat and are a favourite among celebrities including Gwyneth Paltrow. Today a leading education commentator said she feared ‘stick-thin’ celebrities could have a negative effect on young girls. Helen Wright, who has been a headmistress at some of the UK’s leading schools, said: ‘No-one is a good role model for anorexics wishing to get thinner; anorexia is a complex psychological illness, but it is exacerbated by the contributing factors of ‘celebrities’ seeking to be stick-thin. 'We need better for our daughters. ‘Parents should be very worried about pro-anorexia websites. 'They promote incredibly unhealthy behaviours around food and lead to potentially fatal consequences. Distraught: Miss Air, who is dating James Middleton, brother of Kate, said she loves all food and always has . 'There is nothing good about these sites, . and anyone in the public eye who finds themselves associated with them . should be prepared to denounce them in the strongest terms.’ It comes after experts warned young girls were being driven to eating disorders by super skinny models like Cara Delevingne. Miss Delevingne, who is the face of some of the world’s biggest fashion brands, and her ‘thigh-gap’ became an object of fascination for teenagers. They shared tips on how to get legs that, . like Miss Delevingne’s don’t meet above the knee. And they pledge to . starve themselves to reach their goals. However experts said a ‘thigh-gap’ was neither natural nor healthy. 'Thinspiration': Young girls force themselves into starvation to get a 'thigh gap' like model Cara Delevingne . And today a spokesperson from an eating disorders charity warned that images of celebrities are often airbrushed leading to unrealistic perceptions of beauty. Leanne Thorndyke, from b-eat, said: ‘Pro-anorexia sites are dangerous in that they frequently encourage people to believe that eating disorders are a life style choice and not the serious mental illness that they truly are. ‘Pro-ana sites can encourage people to avoid treatment, and that can be life threatening.

It includes extensive farmland, houses and the beach itself at Bantham, which overlooks the famous tidal island of Burgh. The . island inspired Agatha Christie when she wrote And Then There Were . None, as well as the Hercule Poirot mystery Evil Under The Sun. Bantham is home to around 25 houses, a pub, a village store, a famous beach and a farm with acres of farmland overlooking the harbour and Avon estuary. Around 60 residents live there, most renting detached cottages from Evans Estates Limited, a private, family-owned company that was founded in 1956. Many residents also work for the estate, maintaining its breathtaking beach, harbour and public footpaths. Privately-owned homes nearby cost around £350,000 on average but can fetch upwards of £1.5million. The estate at Bantham has been in the same family for several generations. Its website states: '[Our] ethos has always been to allow Bantham to remain a place of outstanding beauty, with the village’s old thatched cottages portraying an image of unchanging charm and the beach and its surrounds staying as wild and natural as can be. 'Evans Estates has consistently set its face against commercialisation of the beach.' Rod Seymour, landlord of The Sloop Inn in Bantham, which is owned by a brewery and not part of the sale, said Evans Estates had been responsible and well-liked landowners over the years and would be greatly missed. 'They have always run the beach with an eye to keeping it very natural and unspoilt, and supported local businesses and families. We are very concerned that a new owner may not share the same attitude.' Mrs Tucker said that Bantham . villagers are planning to set up a committee to deal with the estate’s . land agents, Michelmore Hughes. 'Many of our leases and tenancy . agreements are very old and different from each other, so sorting it all . out would be a real headache. 'We’ve . heard rumours for the past eight months that we could be up for sale, . now it’s confirmed we just want to know what will happen to us. Even . though we don’t own our houses, they are our homes and we love it here.' Mr . Tucker added: 'We don't have a clue why they're selling. I suspect (the . executors) had their reasons, but they are not going to say much.' Rosemary Jeffery, 79, has rented a cottage in Bantham with her husband for 52 years and sells vegetables to locals. She said: 'All the residents received letters confirming the plans last week, but that's all we've heard. Nobody knows a huge amount about it but most of the villagers are feeling worried about it. 'The main worry will be how the estate is run by the new owners as it has been owned and run by the same family for such a long time and it works. 'It's a very tight-knit community as it's so small.'

For James Wannerton these are just some of the strange tastes he experiences as he travels on the London Underground. A journey on the Central Line for the 54-year-old will start off tasting of burnt bacon, and gradually change to taste of cheese, sausage, sprouts and cabbage water. HOVER YOUR MOUSE OVER A TUBE STATION TO ZOOM IN AND SEE WHAT IT TASTES LIKE . Waterloo tastes of fizzy water, London Bridge of lumpy mashed potato, West Hampstead of spam and chocolate and Westminster of After Eights . And the tastes are very real. ‘They are all involuntary and cannot be ""turned off"" or ""toned down"",’ Mr Wannerton told MailOnline. That’s because Mr Wannerton, from Dollis Hill in North London, is one of an estimated two-and-a-half million people who suffer from gustatory auditory synaesthesia. This a cross-sensory neurological condition which means he can literally taste words. The bad news for people in Mile End is their area tastes of fingernails. London Bridge tastes of lumpy mashed potato, West Hampstead of spam and chocolate and Covent Garden of digestives. ‘As a young child I used to travel to school on the London Underground and because of my synaesthesia, on each trip I experienced a taste and texture sensation of each station name,’ said Mr Wannerton. A journey on the Central Line for Mr Wannerton will start off tasting of burnt bacon, and gradually change to taste of cheese, sausage, sprouts and cabbage water . ‘I used to recognise where I was along the journey by taste just as much as by the actual location. ‘I did this every time I travelled on the Underground and it very soon became an involuntary and very automatic additional response to my general perception.’ While he can get tastes and textures from simply reading a station name, the ‘ambiance’ and appearance can also alter that experience. ‘The tastes are 100 per cent consistent in that they never change,’ said Mr Wannerton. After 49 years of collecting and noting down the tastes and textures, he wanted to create a map to raise awareness of his condition. Remarkably, Mr Wannerton didn’t know he had synaesthesia until he was 21. It was only until a visit to the U.S. in 1981 - when he saw a woman on TV explaining that she saw colours when she listened to music - that he realised he might not be the only one who tastes words. On his return home, he made a visit to . London's Maudsley Hospital and underwent a series of MRI scans to look . at the part of the brain linked to taste. When . normal people are given headphones and played music and words, no . activity is recorded in this area. However, the taste area of Mr . Wannerton’s brain lit up significantly. James Wannerton has synaesthesia, a neurological condition that mixes up your senses in the brain. This means he can taste what he sees. Oxford Circus, for instance, makes him taste Oxtail Soup . A standard tube map for comparison. While Mr Wannerton can get tastes and textures from simply reading a station name, the 'ambiance' and appearance can also alter that experience . Victoria – Candle wax . Waterloo – Fizzy water . Leicester Square – Curly Wurly . Covent Garden – Chocolate digestives . Tottenham Court Road – Sausage and egg . Oxford Circus – Oxtail soup . South Kensington – Soft wine gums . Clapham Common – Lemon sponge cake . Brixton – Vanilla ice cream . Warren Street – Raw carrot . King’s Cross St. Pancras – Fruit cake and dripping . High Barnet – Brandy snaps . Camden Town – Dolly mixtures . London Bridge – Lumpy mash potato . Bank – Minstrels . Baker Street- Burn Jam Roly Poly . Paddington – Flumps . Finchley Road – Fresh Peach . Regent’s Park – Malt Vinegar . Bond Street – Hairspray . High Street Kensington – Midget gems . Clapham South – Crisp sandwich . Elephant & Castle – Wet sand . Wanstead – Stamp glue . Stratford High Street – Rubber diving brick . Mile End – Fingernails . Royal Oak – Bic biro ink . Farringdon – Warm semolina . Pinner – Dried Blood . West Hampstead – Spam and chocolate . Canons Park – 3 in 1 oil . Hackney Wick – Sealing wax . West Silverton – Blood and chocolate . Brent Cross – Corgi car tyres . Kilburn High Road - Putrid meat . Latimer Road – Candy shrimps . West India Quay - Wet Wool . Osterley - Sugar sandwich . ‘I was diagnosed with gustatory auditory synaesthesia. At last I had proof that I had a neurological disorder, and it was a huge relief to find out,' he said. ‘I finally felt validated and not mad. Before that point, I'd been frightened of telling people about it for fear of them thinking I was a raving lunatic.’ The systems analyst recalls his earliest memory being in a school assembly chanting The Lord’s Prayer. ‘But it's not the words, the school hall or the teachers I remember most,’ he said. ‘It's the flavours, because The Lord's Prayer tasted unmistakably of bacon.’ Mr Wannerton says, to him, tasting words is as natural as breathing. But concentrating and particularly reading are difficult, as often the words' flavours overwhelmed their meanings. ‘I can't cope with tabloid newspapers either as the flavours are overpowering,’ he said. ‘The Sun and Mirror are the worst. ‘And some words taste better than others. French words are difficult because most of them taste eggy, like the crispy bits under a burnt fried egg. ‘German, which tastes of marmalade, is far more enjoyable. Maybe it's the gutturals.’ One accent that Mr Wannerton can’t bear to hear is cricket commentator Richie Benaud's. ‘Every . word he says has a taste,’ he said. ‘I can work my way round most . things, but with him, the flavours come one after the other. Bang, bang, . bang, bang, bang.’ Since Mr . Wannerton’s diagnosis, he has submitted more than 3,000 words with . flavours to researchers at University College London and Edinburgh . University. ‘Every now and again they ring up . without notice and I have to instantly articulate the taste of whatever . word they give me,’ he said. ‘My answers are instant and they never change, so it's obviously not just a memory thing.’ Synaesthesia is essentially a genetic fault - Mr Wannerton’s mother and sister are also affected, but not as strongly. It is caused when neurological . pathways between the senses are not pruned during brain development, . resulting in an overlap of the senses. Some people can 'hear' textures, others can 'see' smell. ‘I've . avoided weddings and parties over the years, and if I know someone with . a horrible tasting name is going to be at a social situation, then I . just won't go,’ he said. One accent that Mr Wannerton can’t bear to hear is cricket commentator Richie Benaud's (right).  Apparently the name Gordon Brown (left) tastes of muck. ‘Gordon Brown is even worse,’ he said. ‘It's a revolting name - a mixture of mud and Marmite. Absolutely disgusting’ ‘I'm not going to let it dominate my existence to the point where it ruins my life, but it does play a part in the decisions I make. 'Most of my friends have names that taste nice, and I have avoided people on the basis that their names tasted unpleasant.’ Apparently the name Gordon tastes of muck. ‘Gordon Brown is even worse,’ he said. ‘It's a revolting name - a mixture of mud and Marmite. Absolutely disgusting.’ Tony, on the other hand, tastes of desiccated coconut. And Martin, which has a Bakewell tart flavour. ‘My partner is called Jeanette, which is nice, as she's a mild bacon flavour,’ he said. ‘People ask me if I could wave a magic wand would I get rid of my synaesthesia, but I wouldn't live without it, despite the difficulties and the isolation it can bring,’ he added. ‘It forms a big part of my pleasurable memories, so if I didn't have that, my memories would feel very flat.'","James Wannerton spent 49 years creating the map to raise awareness for his condition, synaesthesia .

A Miami park ranger was shocked to discover that an injured chicken that was almost dead when she rescued him last week was later found to have a number of bizarre items sewn into his flesh. Items found inside the bird include what appears to be human hair, several drawings of skulls, and a photo of three seemingly happy youngsters. The ranger – who hasn’t been named – believes the items may be ‘religious artifacts’ and that the animal have been used for a ritual related to the Santeria faith, which is practiced in the Miami area by some people of Cuban decent. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Trouper the chicken was found by a Miami park ranger wondering alone and close to death, it was later discovered that the bird had a number of bizarre items sewn into his flesh including this family photo . The ranger was on patrol at Larry & Penny Thompson Park in South Miami-Dade when the young chick walked toward her, she told Miami New Times. The ranger offered the chick some food and upon inspecting him, she noticed that he was injured along his keel bone on his chest. She initially didn’t think that he would make it through the night, but she cleaned his wound and gave him some medication. For the next three days she put the chicken on a course of dewormer, followed by several days of bird biotic. Items found inside the bird included what appears to be human hair, several drawings of skulls, and a photo of three seemingly happy youngsters . When the bird was recused he was close to death, but after a series of meds plus regular feeding means that Trouper is now in good health . With each passing day the bird, who has been named Trouper, looked progressively better and was eating well. After several days and with the bird’s swelling having gone down she decided to give his injuries a closer look. ‘There were two-three round open marks on either side of the keel bone plus an odd injury right at the top point of the keel bone. It looked as though the keel bone was protruding out of the chest,’ she said. It was then that she noticed that the injuries had been created by someone sewing what she has described as ‘religious artifacts’ into the poor bird’s skin. The artifacts have been removed and the animal’s health has improved, but the question remains: Why would someone cut open a live chicken and sew a family photo inside? There is some speculation that the items could have been placed inside the chicken as part of a ritual to help someone who wants their family members to join them in the U.S. In the reader’s comments section of the Miami New Times' article some have speculated that it could be a ritual carried out by someone who wants their family members who join them in the U.S. It isn’t uncommon for the slaughtered bodies of animals used in Santeria rituals – commonly chicken and goats – to be found in the Miami area. Santeria blends Roman Catholicism with ancient West African traditions. Animal sacrifice for religious ceremony is not legal in Florida.","A park ranger in Miami found the wandering chicken close to death .

Freed: Greenpeace activist Anthony Perrett, from Newport has also been released on bail . They were originally charged with . piracy, but the Russians changed this to hooliganism, which could see . them sent to jail for up to seven years, rather than 15. Miss Harris, 27, who acted as . communications officer on Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise vessel, said: ‘I’m . really happy. It’s not over yet but there’s light at the end of the . tunnel.’ In a recent letter to her parents, the activist had said she . was ‘trying very, very hard not to lose hope’. ‘Surely my future isn’t . rotting in a prison in Murmansk?!’ she wrote. Speaking at the family home in Dolton, . north Devon, her father Cliff said: ‘This is fantastic news for us.

These must have been two incredibly hard months . for her, and we’re incredibly proud of how she has conducted herself . throughout this ordeal.’ Mr Harris, 63, told how as a child, his daughter idolised David Attenborough and was fascinated by news about the environment. He said: ‘Anything that was detrimental to wildlife she would sit up and take notice. ‘I can remember when she was young she . had a poster up of David Beckham. All of a sudden Beckham was out of . favour and David Attenborough was her new hero. She didn’t actually have . any posters, but she really idolised him.’ Miss Harris joined Greenpeace two . years ago in an office-based role and was on her first field trip when . arrested by the Russians. Her father continued: ‘We didn’t envisage that . this whole situation was going to erupt like it did. We’ve found it . very frightening. These are just ordinary people who care about the . environment. The charges are ridiculous – what happened wasn’t piracy or . hooliganism.’ Alexandra Harris has spent two months in prison after being arrested during the protest on the Prirazlomnaya oil platform in the Pechora Sea . Ms Harris said the past two months in prison had been difficult, describing the conditions as 'awful' and the food as 'disgusting' The family of London-based Mr Bryan, . 29, said in a statement: ‘It’s amazing news to know that Kieron will be . released from prison soon. ‘Our relief is obviously tempered by . the fact that he is still facing absurd charges, despite the fact that . he was just doing his job.’ The American captain Peter Willcox was also . bailed but the ship’s Australian radio operator Colin Russell was . refused bail and ordered to remain in jail until February 24.

Anti-virus software entrepreneur John McAfee has been evicted from his Portland apartment and hit with a civil stalking complaint. McAfee, 68, arrived in the Pacific Northwest last winter after fleeing the Central American nation of Belize, where authorities sought to question him in the fatal shooting of a U.S. expatriate who lived near McAfee's home. He has denied any involvement. McAfee moved into a high-end apartment building in southeast Portland. The stalking complaint was filed by Connor Hyde, a property manager with the Riverstone Residential Group, who claims McAfee accused him of being part of a 'conspiracy' and warned him, 'I hope you have a safe to run to.' Get out: Anti-virus software entrepreneur John McAfee, pictured in August, has been evicted from his Portland apartment and hit with a civil stalking complaint . Hyde no longer works at the location, said Crystal Pierce, senior property manager at The 20 on Hawthorne. She said the company does not comment on legal matters. Hyde's court filing, obtained by The Oregonian, says McAfee sent threatening emails and has access to weapons and armed associates from a motorcycle club. McAfee was warned last month that he was late on $2,100 in rent on his luxury apartment, the newspaper reported. The British native said in a phone interview Monday that he moved to Montreal two months ago and just learned of his eviction. He said he had issues with building management over 'willful lapses of security' but was not forced to leave. 'I've never been evicted from anything,' he said. McAfee said he had a 'severe problem' with Hyde but never threatened him with anything except lawsuits.

'He gave keys out to all of his friends, and friends of friends,' he said. 'People were partying in vacant condos. It's turned into a nightmare ever since the new owners purchased the building four months ago.' Multnomah County Judge Steven Evans granted a temporary protective order against McAfee and scheduled a January 3 hearing. McAfee said he does not plan to attend the January hearing. He said the protective order is inconsequential because he's no longer living in Oregon. McAfee has led an eccentric life since he sold his stake in the software company named after him in the early 1990s and moved to Belize about four years ago to reduce his taxes. He has dabbled in yoga, ultralight aircraft and the production of herbal medications. He told The New York Times in 2009 that he had lost all but $4 million of his $100 million fortune in the U.S. financial crisis. However, a story on the Gizmodo website quoted him as describing that claim as 'not very accurate at all.'","The former software entrepreneur moved into a high-end apartment building in southeast Portland, Oregon last winter, after fleeing Belize where police want to question him about a fatal shooting .

Two astronauts resorted to MacGyver like moves to save the $100 billion International Space Station with a $3 toothbrush. Astronauts Sunita Williams and Akihido Hoshide were able to construct a make shift tool, proving that just because they are rocket scientists doesn't mean they can't be handy. Their ingenuity allowed for the installation of a much needed part on the space craft, needed to relay power. Scroll down for video . Saving the day: This $3 toothbrush was used to repair the International Space Station . Trouble on the spacecraft started last week, when Williams and Hoshide were trying to replace a malfunctioning electrical unit, called a main bus switching unit (MBSU), on the space station. There are four 220-pound MBSUs on the International Space Station that are able to harness power from the outpost's solar arrays. But with one of the electrical units not operating, there had been limited power use in the space station and astronauts were called on to replace it with a new one. Williams and Hoshide had been working to install a new MBSU back on August 30 but encountered difficulty in bolting the new unit down to the spacecraft. It appeared that there was significant debris, described as metal shavings, that had amassed inside the bolts and was preventing them from attaching it to the space craft and securing the MBSU. Hoshide was able to maneuver a wire . cleaner around one of the bolt holders, that loosed a lot of metal . shavings but it just wasn't enough, he told the NASA team back in Houston. Their repeated attempts to clean out the bolts drew out their space walk to a daunting 8 hours. 'Over 10 hours in the suit. No bathroom and no lunch,' Williams wrote in her blog about the grueling ordeal, about the total time she was suited up for space. Cleaning house: The astronauts prepared for cleaning the International Space Station (ISS) on September 5, with their toothbrush . Mission possible: Sunita Williams and Akihiko Hoshide perform a spacewalk to complete an equipment installation outside the International Space Station . With the debris around the bolts, there was little chance of a successful MBSU installation. So the space team, along with their . colleagues at NASA back on earth put their heads together to figure out a . way to fix the problem. They decided the outer space team . needed to do some deep cleaning and the idea for the toothbrush tool was born - fastening a simple toothbrush to a metal pole. On Wednesday, Williams and Hoshide took to cleaning the bolts. After about four hours of intense scrubbing, the bolts were pristine and the pair were able to successfully attached the MBSU. 'Looks like you guys just fixed the station,' astronaut Jack Fischer radioed from Mission Control at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. The International Space Station is currently home to six astronauts: Williams and Joe Acaba of NASA, Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, and Russian cosmonauts Gennady Padalka, Yuri Malenchenko and Sergei Revin.

A new website and app that connects home cooks to hungry people in the same area thinks it has the answer. Cookisto allows amateur chefs to sell their food to hungry, time-poor people living nearby. Grubs up: Cookisto, launching in the UK this month, is an app and website that allows amateur cooks to sell their food to hungry people nearby . Launching in the UK this month, Cookisto is already a popular concept in Athens, Greece, where over 12,000 people have signed up to purchase leftover meals for as little as £3 per portion. The site, which takes a 15 per cent cut from the cook's earnings, is ideal for people looking to earn a little extra cash from leftover meals, as well as budding chefs who want to share their culinary skills. Anyone can join, as long as chefs sign up to the terms and conditions relating to UK health and safety standards. 'The public is getting accustomed to using collaborative marketplaces,' says Nikki Finnemore, Cookisto’s UK marketing director. 'And you can easily see that a lot of the home chefs who have signed up are legitimate - they run supper clubs or have their own YouTube channels, or a food blog.' Cook up a storm: The site is ideal for people looking to earn a little extra cash from leftover meals, as well as budding chefs who want to share their culinary skills with the world . On the Athens site, you purchase delights such as boeuf bourguignon and beetroot gnocchi in orange and sage sauce. The site is also set to launch a bespoke service where you can get your favourite cook to create a particular meal, whether it's a Malaysian curry or canapes for a cocktail party. Users can then rate cooks and meals, leading to some chefs becoming pretty in-demand. Prices on the London version will be higher than the Greek version, with meals on sale for around £8. Food for thought: Users can collect their meal or have it delivered and can then rate a chef after they've sampled their culinary delights . The site is the brainchild of Michalis Gkontas, who came up with the the business plan as part of his Masters degree. 'I had this daily problem of wondering . what to eat and I saw so many concepts that build platforms and connect . people and create local markets, and I thought that this idea could . potentially do really well,' he told The Independent.","Connects budding chefs and hungry people living nearby .

Rent boy Ciaron Dodd who is alleged to have had drug fueled sex with disgraced bank boss Paul Flowers . A male escort allegedly paid for sex by shamed Co-operative Bank chief Paul Flowers is a convicted armed robber who attacked a Co-op store, the Daily Mail can reveal. Ciaron Dodd, 21, a part-time model and £650-a-night escort, described this week how the Methodist minister showered him with gifts and took him for nights out to the theatre. However the rent boy did not reveal how as a teenager he was part of a gang which terrorised a string of  convenience stores – including, in an extraordinary irony, a Co-op. Dodd was sentenced to nine months’ detention when he was 17 for carrying out the raids armed with knives and coshes. Targets included the Co-op branch  in the Cheshire village of  Grappenhall, with the gang’s eventual haul including £285 in cash and £1,000 worth of cigarettes and scratch cards. He and six other youths involved in the two-month crime spree appeared before Warrington Crown Court where . Dodd was locked up for nine months at a young offenders’ institution. Dodd has described how he took part in threesomes with Flowers and another rent boy after taking a  cocktail of substances including cocaine, ketamine and the party  drug GHB. He has backed up his claim by producing damning messages sent by Flowers, 63, from his work email – in which he organised the drug-fuelled threesomes.

In one, Flowers wrote: ‘Been waiting for you to come and have some  coke (cocaine) and k (Ketamin) with me.

The government theory that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone was not enough to convince many Americans following the President's assassination, including his own brother. Robert Kennedy, who was the Attorney General at the time, immediately suspected that the CIA had something to do with the President's death in Dallas. President Kennedy and the CIA had butted heads on a number of occasions during his nearly three years in office, and his younger brother thought that a disgruntled member of the clandestine organization may have taken their outrage too far. Scroll down for video . Tense: Some suspected CIA involvement because CIA director Allen Dulles was forced to resign following the failed Bay of Pigs invasion just months into Kennedy's presidency (pictured together in July 1960) Denial: Bobby Kennedy (right), who was the Attorney General at the time, met with then-CIA director John McClune (left) who assured him that there was no agency involvement in the President's assassination . 'Apparently Bobby Kennedy’s first suspicion was that it was some rogue element in the CIA,' author Philip Shenon said in his new book about the assassination. Those fears were not completely unsubstantiated, as CIA director Allen Dulles and President Kennedy disagreed on the failed Bay of Pigs operation. Dulles ended up resigning in early 1962 after the bid to kill Castro went belly-up and questions lingered about how upset Dulles- and his subordinates- were about the ousting. As such, Bobby Kennedy initially is thought to have suspected a splinter group of agents rather than a formal, bureaucratically approved overation. Fatal ride: President Kennedy and First Lady Jackie were in the back of the open-top convertible during their drive through Dallas on November 22, 1963 . Warren Commission: After initial concerns, Bobby Kennedy asked Dulles (second from right) to be a part of the investigating committee who compiled the formal report on the assassination . In the end those concerns were put to rest after the younger Kennedy had a private conversation with the sitting CIA director, John McClune who promised that no one from the agency had a part in the assassination- the fourth in United States history. On top of that, the hard feelings between Kennedy and Dulles- who was appointed as the Director of the CIA under his predecessor, President Eisenhower- were purely professional and not personal. 'Apparently the Kennedy family had no particular hostility toward Dulles,' Mr Shenon told NBC News. The CIA has repeatedly put out statements denying any involvement. Perhaps out of that respect or in an effort to lend credibility to the group of officials who were tasked with investigating the assassination, Bobby appointed Dulles to be a member of the Warren Commission. Still believers: A majority of Americans- 61%- think that there were other people involved in Kennedy's assassination . Aftermath: Bobby Kennedy was at his his sister-in-law's side as she arrived back in Washington in her blood-stained suit following her husband's murder . The Commission determined- after almost a year of interviews and meetings- that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, that one of the three bullets that Oswald fired from the sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository fired the fatal blow to President Kennedy while also striking Governor Connally, and that Jack Ruby was self-motivated in his decision to shoot Oswald. The latest Gallup poll reports that to this day, there are a majority of Americans who do not believe the Warren Commission's findings. The poll found 61 per cent of Americans believe that it was not solely a lone shooter, but there were others involved. While that percentage is the lowest found by the surveying company since the late 1960s in the years immediately following the assassination.","President's brother thought that 'rogue faction' of clandestine service may have been behind the assassination .

Shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne has said lots of people 'feel they pay an awful lot more in than they ever get back' as suggestions emerged that Labour was planning a shift in its approach to welfare . Labour is planning a significant shift in its approach to welfare, suggestions have emerged. Detailed work is under way on possible policy proposals that would mean the amount of benefit payments to those out of work or on low incomes would depend on their previous contributions, it has been reported. Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has said . foreign migrants will have to live in Britain for a year before they . can claim civil legal aid as part of reforms to save £300 million a . year. Labour was . looking to revolutionise the system and address concerns it promotes a . 'something-for-nothing' culture, according to The Observer. The paper has quoted a Labour party source saying: 'The problem at the moment is that you have a person aged 50 who has worked all his life and then becomes unemployed getting much the same as the person next door who has never worked. It is about linking what you take out to what you have put in.' One idea under consideration is the . creation of a payments system which provides higher benefits to those who . have made more national insurance contributions after being in . employment for longer. Party . sources have said the reforms would introduce greater fairness and . create stronger incentives for people to work. In an article for the newspaper shadow work and pensions secretary Liam Byrne said: 'There are lots of people right now who feel they pay an awful lot more in than they ever get back. That should change.' He also said councils will be allowed to prioritise housing 'to those who work and contribute to their community'. Nobody would be able to be unemployed for more than two years - or one year for young people - under Labour's plans. After this time they would be offered . a job funded by taxing bankers' bonuses and restructuring pension tax . relief for the wealthiest. Those who did not take a job would lose their . benefits. Labour's deputy leader today said it was understandable that workers felt 'resentful' about benefits claimants that do not want a job as the party attempted to reposition itself on welfare. Labour is currently working on possible policy proposals that would mean benefit payments to those out of work or on low incomes would vary according to their past contributions, according to reports . Harriet Harman said it was 'not surprising' that people were concerned about the system but claimed the government's failure to install a proper work programme was letting some people 'off the hook'. Ms Harman told BBC 1's Andrew Marr Show: 'The difficulty is for people who are in work, seeing their standard of living pressurised, understandably, they feel very resentful for people who are not working. For people who are looking for a job and can't find work it's deeply frustrating and then of course the small minority who don't want to work - well they are let off the hook by the fact there isn't a proper work programme.' Ms Harman said the party was working up three principles on welfare ahead of the general election.She added: 'One, that work should pay, secondly, there should be obligation to take work and thirdly that there should be support through a contributory principle for people putting into the system as well as taking out.' Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has said foreign migrants will have to live in Britain for a year before they can claim civil legal aid as part of reforms to save £300 million a year . Announcing changes to the civil legal aid available for foreign migrants, Mr Grayling said some migrants were using the system to settle custody cases despite being in the country for 'extraordinarily short periods of time'. He said the measures would be 'difficult but sensible' and insisted the move was 'not about denying people access to justice'. In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph Mr Grayling said: 'There are a number of areas where somebody who comes to this country even on a tourist visa can access civil legal aid. We are going to change that. 'There have been examples of people who have come to the country for extraordinarily short periods of time who have had a relationship breakdown and then they end up in our courts at our expense to determine custody of the children. 'This will exclude people who enter the country illegally, who up to now have been able to access our legal aid system in a way I don't think should ever have happened.' Mr Grayling also said he wants to curb the criminal legal aid bill, telling the newspaper nobody whose earnings came from the public sector 'should reasonably expect' to top the Prime Minister's £142,000 annual salary. The package of measures being unveiled next week will stop prisoners using legal aid for cases that do not relate to the length of their sentences, according to the newspaper. 'I am proposing to take legal aid away from prisoners who don't like the prison they are in, or don't like the cell they are in, or don't like a part of the regime,' Mr Grayling told The Sunday Telegraph. Meanwhile, Coalition benefit reforms are 'putting fairness back at the heart of Britain', David Cameron has insisted in a staunch defence of the controversial shake-up. As the welfare state overhaul continues to fuel an increasingly bitter political row, the Prime Minister said the Government is on the side of 'each and every hardworking person in our country'. Writing for The Sun, he suggested it was 'crazy' that claimants could have a bigger income on benefits than work and argued it is 'fair that we all play by the same rules'. Prime Minister David Cameron (pictured last week visiting a swimming pool manufacturer in Witney, Oxfordshire) has said the Government is on the side of 'each and every hardworking person in our country' Mr Cameron pledged to 'always help' the most vulnerable but insisted 'those who can, should' as he warned that the system was causing 'resentment' across the country. In his article for The Sun he wrote: 'We are putting fairness back at the heart of Britain. We are building a country for those who work hard and want to get on. And we are saying to each and every hardworking person in our country: we are on your side. An opinion poll has found six out of 10 voters believe benefits are too generous and 79 per cent back the Government's plan to cap a family's benefit at £26,000 a year. The figures revealed most people believe at least half of claimants do not deserve any help and are not in genuine need. The YouGov poll for The Sun today also suggests they believe families on low incomes are suffering at their expense. According to the poll, 67 per cent of people think the system needs urgent reform. 'This is a Government for hardworking people: and that's the way it will stay.' Over the last week widespread welfare and tax changes have come into force including a below inflation 1 per cent cap on working-age benefits and tax credit rises for three years. Around 660,000 social housing tenants deemed to have a spare room will lose an average £14 a week in what critics have dubbed a 'bedroom tax' and trials are due to begin in four London boroughs of a £500-a-week cap on household benefits. The welfare state debate became further inflamed over recent days after Chancellor George Osborne linked the case of child killer Mick Philpott to the coalition's benefit shake-up. Mr Cameron said the system had 'lost its way' and had become a 'lifestyle choice for some'. He wrote in The Sun: 'It was designed to bring us together, but is causing resentment. I think the British people are about the most fair and generous people on the planet - but no-one wants to work hard every day and see their hard-earned taxes being used to fund things they themselves cannot afford or keep generations dependent on welfare. 'So this month we are making some big changes. They are changes that have a simple principle at their heart: we are restoring the fairness that should lie at the very heart of our tax and welfare systems.'","Labour planning policy proposals which would see significant welfare reform .

Fifty Iraqis drugged themselves to fake mental illness so they could carry out benefits fraud costing millions of pounds. The group won asylum in Britain after saying they had depression or post-traumatic stress syndrome from the conflict in Iraq. They then claimed disability payments plus housing benefits worth up to £2,000 a week in what was described as a ‘wholesale onslaught on our welfare system’. Many of the fraudsters have Dutch and Danish passports and were believed to be living and claiming further benefits in other EU countries while also letting out their taxpayer-funded homes in Britain. The scandal was exposed when Lindsey Hall, anti-fraud tsar at Westminster council in London, raised the alarm following a massive increase in housing benefit claims after Labour introduced the generous local housing allowance in 2008. She said: ‘The debate about the abuse of the welfare system is shrouded in political correctness. But this is not a witch-hunt, it’s about criminality. ‘These men went to extreme lengths to commit benefits fraud. In some cases they would take drugs to fake delirium to convince doctors they had a mental disability or post-traumatic stress. ‘To keep the ruse up they would continue to regularly pick up the eight or nine medical drugs prescribed by doctors to treat their non-existent syndrome, which they would then dump, adding an extra cost to the NHS. Post traumatic stress: The fraudsters pretended to have mental health problems that have affected many who suffered during the war in Iraq . ‘Once you have secured disability living allowance on the basis of being a PTSD sufferer, the benefit can be granted indefinitely, so they could leave Britain and continue to receive the benefit.’ She said the scandal came to her attention after hard-working Iraqi residents in the area complained that fraud was out of control, but they were terrified of the repercussions of speaking out because of the criminal gang behind it. Miss Hall added: ‘In some of the . blocks of flats we targeted, 95 per cent of the people living there were . not the ones claiming housing benefit on the properties. ‘The . costs from false housing benefits alone when we started investigating . were more than £1milllion and historically could be far more than that. ‘At . the same time we had to close down day care centres which played a . vital role in the local  community because we couldn’t afford the . £100,000 a year to keep them open.’ The Serious Organised Crime Agency investigated and, with the Department for Work and Pensions, has issued a warning to councils about the scandal. SOCA said: ‘In some instances corrupt professionals may have facilitated the criminal activity.’ The fraudsters would often provide false proof of employment, sometimes naming the same fictitious organisation, to qualify for housing benefit on the grounds of low pay. They would then claim up to £2,000 a week in rent. ‘Complicit property agents may have been used to facilitate claimants’ access to high rental value properties,’ SOCA added. Illegal sub-letting of homes offered further gains and ‘in several cases the original claimant was found to be no longer resident in the UK. ‘Claimants who travelled overseas for sustained periods of over 12 weeks were still able to claim housing benefit and it is difficult for the Department for Work and Pensions to establish if a claimant is travelling into or out of the UK.’","Criminal gang won asylum in Britain claiming post traumatic stress disorder .

The filling was ‘lush, spicy and juicy’, while the rich and golden pastry was ‘thin, crisp and light’, according to a blind taste test by leading bakers and pastry chefs. The survey was organised by Which? and reveals it is possible to entertain friends and family with quality food and wine without busting the budget. Aldi's Specially Selected 6 Luxury Mince Pies have trumped brands almost eight times more expensive in an annual taste test by consumer group Which? Harrods only managed fifth place with its Luxury Almond & Brandy Mince Pies at £9.50 for six . Aldi’s Specially Selected 6 Luxury Mince Pies at just £1.69 for six beat 11 other rivals, while second place went to Lidl Snowy Lodge 6 Luxury Mince Pies at £1.79 for six. Harrods only managed fifth place with its Luxury Almond & Brandy Mince Pies at £9.50 for six. Fortnum & Mason, the London store synonymous with quality and style, came in bottom with its Traditional Mince Pies at £12.95 for six. The Fortnum & Mason mince pies work out at £2.16 each, which compares to just over 28p for Aldi’s own luxury version. The pies were scored on appearance, aroma, texture and taste by a panel that included the award-winning baker, Dan Lepard, and renowned pastry chef Will Torrent. Their verdict is a blow for the Piccadilly store, which has a long and proud history dating back some 307 years and is particularly respected for its luxurious Christmas fare and hampers. It could not be more different to the budget chain Aldi, which operates a no-frills approach to shopping. Staff are in short supply, while packing and paying is often hectic given the pace that items are swiped through the checkout. Fortnum & Mason, the London store which is synonymous with quality and style, came in bottom with its Traditional Mince Pies at £12.95 for six . However, the German-owned discounter is seeing enormous growth of more than 30 per cent a year, not least because it is attracting well-heeled and sharp elbowed shoppers from middle and high income families. The success has come on the back of its offer of award-winning prestige wine, spirits and food at discount prices. The mince pies are not the only Christmas products that Aldi can crow about. Its £3.89 Connoisseur Christmas Pudding came top in a blind taste test by the Good Housekeeping Institute, while its Specially Selected Luxury Champagne Christmas Pudding was runner up. Both beat the best that Harrods, Heston Blumenthal and the major supermarkets had to offer. The Which? blind taste tests also looked at the best value sparkling wines and champagne, which suggest putting fizz in to a party can also be done on a budget. The best of the sparkling wines was the Co-op’s Prosecco DOC Special cuvée Brut, which is normally £9.99 a bottle, but is currently on promotion at just £6.49. Second place went to Tesco Finest Prosecco DOC at £9.99, while Lidl’s Conegliano Valdobbiandene Prosecco Superiore DOCG 2012 was third at £7.29. The Co-op said sales of Prosecco from Italy has doubled in the past year and it now outsells Cava from Spain by four bottles to one. The Which? tasters described the winning Prosecco as ‘clean and soft with floral and peachy perfumes and a hint of lemon peel’. The best champagne was from Waitrose with its Blanc de Noirs Brut NV at £21.99, which beat the much more expensive Lanson Black Label Brut NV at £32.99 in to second place. Britain is fast developing a strong reputation for its wine.

Tesco has spent millions relaunching its Finest range after discovering shoppers were turning to Waitrose, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's for upmarket treats. From hand-decorated cakes worthy of the Great British Bake Off to pies filled with the best ale and berries, the revamped range, which went on sale this month, is clearly aimed at wooing affluent customers. But will it work? Or is Tesco inextricably linked in shoppers’ eyes with budget fare? Daily Mail cook ANNE SHOOTER taste-tested the new Tesco products against similar high-end items from Sainsbury’s (which has a rival Taste The Difference range), Waitrose and M&S to find out which supermarket's food really is the finest. Taste tester: Anne Shooter with a selection of supermarket foods . Fabulous: Waitrose Heston Chicken Liver Parfait . Tesco Finest Rannoch Smoked Duck Pate, 113g, £1.50 . Oh dear, not a good start. This pate is very sweet and doesn’t taste of smoked duck at all - not surprising, as it is mostly made of duck liver and pork fat. Yuck. 1/5 . Sainsbury’s Taste The Difference Duck Liver Pate with Grand Marnier, 170g, £2.15 . A traditional pate that transports me to a French charcuterie - creamy with back- notes of orange from the Grand Marnier. The slightly spongy texture disappoints. 3/5 . M&S Chicken Liver Pate, 170g, £1.49 . Savoury and rich, with a lovely warmth that comes from the addition of Madeira. Doesn't look particularly appealing, but tastes utterly yummy. 4/5 . Waitrose Heston Chicken Liver Parfait, 80g, £3.99 . This is pricey but so pretty in its little jar - as well as being delicious. Push aside the buttery seal to reveal a silky pate with layers of flavour - savoury, sweet, creamy, with a warm cognac finish. Fabulous. 5/5 . Winner: Waitrose . Tesco Finest Smoked Haddock Fishcakes, £3 for two . Moist and fluffy, with a lovely smoky flavour from the undyed haddock, and a good crumb. There’s a gooey, cheesey middle, too: unnecessary, but luxurious. 4/5 . Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Smoked Haddock Fishcakes with Cheddar and Leek Centres, £2.99 for two . Comforting, but tastes like potato flavoured with leek and cheese - I can barely detect the fish. Tasty, though. 3/5 . M&S Salmon, Cod and Smoked Haddock Melting Middle Fishcakes, £4 for two . Like a fish pie in a ball shape! The combination of fish flavours works well, but the salmon is dry and I'm sure I am detecting little pieces of undercooked onion. 3/5 . Waitrose Cod Fishcakes with Cheddar and Lemon, £4.19 for two . These look impressive, but are disappointingly bland. They have lots of fish, but it doesn't taste of anything. The overwhelming flavour is lemon from the sauce. 2/5 . Winner: Tesco . Tesco Finest Chorizo and Chipotle Chilli Quiche, 400g, £3.25 . Is this a quiche? All I can taste is the chilli in the pastry (not nice) and the smoky chorizo on a thin eggy layer. It’s more like a pizza. 1/5 . Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Goat’s Cheese & Spinach Quiche, 170g, £1.90 . Very good. Large pieces of light, fresh goat’s cheese atop spinach-flecked custard in a buttery pastry. Looks pretty, too. 4/5 . M&S Slow Roasted Tomato, Feta and Spinach Quiche, £2.29 . This looks rather patchy and  tastes delicious - crisp, perfect pastry and sweet tomatoes that contrast well with the salty feta. 5/5 . Waitrose Balsamic Onion and West Country Cheddar Tart, 400g, £3.49 . A good traditional quiche with a twist - the balsamic onions give a sweetness that works well with the cheese. The pastry is too thick for the thin filling layer, though. 3/5 . Winner: M&S . Sausage test: Waitrose is the winner when it comes to the best tasting sausages . Tesco Finest Pork and Caramelised Onion Sausages, £2.99 for six . A good proportion of pork - 74 per cent, but the onion makes them too sweet. Children will love them, but they are not savoury enough for me. 3/5 . Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Caramelised Red Onion and Pork Sausages, £3 for six . The 77 per cent pork makes these a decent sausage, but they are also very sweet from the onions, and the addition of onion powder gives them an artificial flavour. Good herby notes, though. 3/5 . M&S Gloucester Old Spot Sausages, £3.79 for six . These are like sausages your butcher would make. They have a whopping 90 per cent pork and no rusk or breadcrumbs, so they are uber-meaty. Very 'piggy' - amazing if you like that kind of thing. 4/5 . Waitrose Pork Sausages with Caramelised Red Onion Confit, £3 for six . These are really meaty - 80 per cent pork - with just the right amount of caramelised onion flavour. A truly delicious sausage. 5/5 . Winner: Waitrose . Tesco Finest Traditional Recipe Cherry Tomato and Chilli Pasta Sauce, 340g, £1.65 . Not spicy enough for me and rather sweet, this is also slightly gloopy, probably from the addition of potato starch. 3/5 . Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Cherry Tomato and Chilli Pasta Sauce, 330g, £1.65 . Rich with a good flavour, this has a great chilli kick and a natural taste - but it is on the greasy side, with a film of oil on top. 4/5 . M&S Arrabiata Pasta Sauce, 340g, £1.99 . This has a lovely bright colour and is fresh-tasting with a big chilli hit. It tastes home-made and has no additives. Great stuff. 5/5 . Waitrose Hot and Spicy Arrabiata, 555g, £2.49 . I like the colour and fresh flavour of this, but it is lacking salt and - crucially - sugar, making it bland and too acidic. 3/5 . Winner: M&S . Tesco Finest Slow-Cooked Scotch Beef and Cornish Ale Pie £3.20 . This looks very cute, coming, as it does, in a little flower pot. It's only a shame the pot is plastic and the pie is horrid! The pastry is too soggy underneath and the gravy is gloopy and bitter with the meat disintegrated into it. Back to the drawing board. 1/5 . Sainsbury's Taste The Difference Beef Steak Pie, £3 . A well-filled pie with lots of pieces of meat in good gravy. The pastry is a little too thick, but it's tasty - made with lard as well as butter. 4/5 . M&S Handcrafted Steak and Old Peculier Ale Pie, £3.49 . Dangerously delicious - I dare you to try this pie and not finish it. Well-browned, soft meat chunks in a proper beery onion gravy within fantastic pastry. 5/5 . Waitrose Dark and Velvety Aberdeen Angus Steak and Ale Top Crust Pie, £2.99 . Not enough meat and too much gravy. The flavour of the sauce is good, but the pastry is greasy. Not a great offering. 2/5 . Winner: M&S . Tesco Finest Red Velvet Cake, £10 . Stunning looking cake with three layers of moist, chocolatey sponge and lots of divine cream-cheese frosting, finished with striking red crumbs. Superb. 5/5 . Sainsbury's Red Velvet Cupcakes, £1.35 for two . Pretty, yet so disappointing. The sponge tastes as if it's full of additives - which it is - and the buttercream is sickly sweet. Did anyone taste these first? 0/5 . Too sweet: Waitrose Seriously Fruity Passion Cake, left, but Tesco Finest Red Velvet Cake is superb . M&S Triple Chocolate Brownie Layer Cake, £4.99 . A treat for chocolate lovers, made of layers of vanilla sponge, buttercream and brownies.  Tastes luxurious and rich. 4/5 . Waitrose Seriously Fruity Passion Cake, £4.29 . Like a carrot cake with added pineapple and coconut. I expect it to be moist, but it’s on the dry side and very sweet. The passion-fruit frosting is too sugary. 2/5 . Winner: Tesco . Tesco Finest Morello Cherry Cheesecake, £4.40 . Stylish with its red topping, this has a good cherry flavour that works well with the vanilla filling. But the cheesecake is too set. 4/5 . Sainsbury's Frozen Taste The Difference New York Cheesecake, £3 . A very creamy, silky topping on a great biscuit base. Just a point lost for its unimpressive looks. 4/5 . M&S Lemon and Raspberry Brulee Cheesecake, £4 . Love the crunchy topping, love the base, love the lemon and raspberry combo. But where's the creamy stuff in the middle? 3/5 . Waitrose Frozen Chocolate Cheesecake, £3.79 . Oh. My. Diet. Just. Died. Worth it, though, for this dreamy, creamy concoction that is like a divinely silky chocolate mousse on a biscuity base. Seconds, please. 5/5 . Winner: Waitrose . Waitrose and M&S share the top prize, as each come top in three categories. Tesco is close behind with two - still well ahead of Sainsbury's, which doesn't manage to win a single category. Tesco Finest? It would appear not.","Tesco has spent millions relaunching its Finest range .

"By . Emma Lowe . PUBLISHED: . 17:04 EST, 22 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:57 EST, 23 November 2013 . Paul Hollywood has revealed that he is losing the feeling in his hands – a symptom of his 30-year career as a baker. The Great British Bake Off judge said that decades spent kneading dough has left him  with severe nerve damage in his wrists which would lead to a complete loss of sensation in his hands if untreated. The 47-year-old will now undergo career-saving surgery in the new year. Paul Hollywood has revealed that he is to undergo a career-saving operation, after suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome . Hollywood revealed his diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome at the Good Food Show in London where he resorted to using a food mixer to demonstrate how to make puff pastry. An advocate of mixing and kneading by hand, he apologised to fans for not practising what  he preaches. ‘This is a dough which has been made earlier, I would normally manipulate it and knead it myself but I’ve had a few problems,’ he said. ‘I actually have carpal tunnel syndrome in both my wrists. ‘I went to get it tested about two years ago and they gave  me electric shock treatment  from your finger down to your elbow to see how severe it is. The doctor said “If you don’t have an operation you will no longer have feeling in your hands for the rest of your life”. Around 1 in 20 Britons are affected by carpal tunnel syndrome which causes pain and numbness in the hands . ‘I have been wearing wrist strengtheners on both my wrists. Thirty years of baking has now knackered me, and I have to go for an operation to have them sorted.’ Hollywood revealed that fellow Bake Off judge Mary Berry  also had the operation for the condition and encouraged him to have it done. Confessing he was a little apprehensive about surgery, he said: ‘[Mary] said it really hurt and absolutely killed her. But I think she is winding me up.’ Miss Berry, 78, who was demonstrating alongside Hollywood, quipped: ‘Normally you have it under general anaesthetic and you have a nurse holding your hand. Knowing you it will be a very pretty nurse.’ This month Hollywood admitted to cheating on his wife of 15 years Alexandra, 49, with Marcela Valladolid, his co-judge on the American version of Bake Off which he filmed earlier this year. Paul Hollywood works dough in the kitchen . Around one in 20 Britons are affected by carpal tunnel syndrome which causes pain and numbness in the hands. It is caused by the compression of one of the nerves in the hands called the median nerve. The condition is very common in pregnant women – around half experience symptoms – and it often occurs during the menopause. It is also common among adults who do a lot of strenuous work with their hands, for example typing or kneading bread. Often it will disappear without treatment. In pregnant women it usually goes away within the first three months, while mild symptoms can be controlled with wrist splints or steroid injections. More severe cases may require surgery to cut a ligament to ease pressure on the nerve.","Great British Bake-Off judge to have career-saving surgery .

A couple have told of their shock after their two-year-old daughter, who they thought just had a cold, was diagnosed with leukaemia. Mandy and Bob Holmes became concerned when Jessica developed a cold which showed no sign of improving after a few days. Mr Holmes, 43, took her to Royal Lancaster Infirmary's A&E on September 29 to get checked over and was sent home with antibiotics for a chest infection. Jessica Holmes, two, was diagnosed with leukaemia after she developed a cold which failed to clear up . However, three days later, Jessica still showed no improvement - and deteriorated to a point where she was not eating or drinking and was sleeping 23 hours a day – so she was taken back to hospital. Doctors carried out chest X-rays and told the family Jessica had pneumonia. But, after getting the results of blood tests, on October 3 doctors gave Jessica a blood transfusion and rushed her to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital. Mrs Holmes, 40, said: ‘At this point, we had no idea what was wrong - at worst I thought it would be asthma or diabetes. ‘They put us on a ward where there were all these children with no hair and I thought it was just while they were waiting to put us on a different ward. ‘Then a Macmillan nurse came and introduced herself to us but I could not understand why we needed a Macmillan nurse.’ Jessica (pictured with her mother, Mandy) was initially diagnosed with a chest infection and given antibiotics but her parents took her back for further tests after her condition deteriorated and she stopped eating . Jessica was transferred from Royal Lancaster Infirmary to Royal Manchester Children's Hospital where her parents say they were taken to a cancer ward before being told she had leukaemia . A consultant arrived shortly after and asked Mr and Mrs Holmes to come for a private chat in his office. They were told Jessica has acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a cancer of the white blood cells. Mrs Holmes said: ‘It was just awful. It was even more upsetting than when my father died - and that's saying something. ‘But I was so overwhelmed by the shock it felt like I had been switched off - I went completely numb and nothing was registering. ‘The doctor was going on-and-on and I couldn't hear a single word he was saying. Jessica (pictured with her parents, Mandy and Bob, and her brother, Dylan) is now having intensive treatment for her cancer, including chemotherapy and blood transfusions . ‘I was just looking into this forest landscape painting that was hung on the wall. ‘The doctor could have been repeating “I'm a monkey, I'm a monkey” and I wouldn't have noticed.’ Jessica spent a month in hospital after her diagnosis and had intensive chemotherapy and steroid treatment as well as five blood transfusions. After returning home briefly, she went back for more chemotherapy and is now going back to hospital twice a week. Mother-of-five Mrs Holmes said: ‘We just take each day at a time and try not to look too far ahead.’ Mrs Holmes said: 'They put us on a ward where there were all these children with no hair and I thought it was just while they were waiting to put us on a different ward.' Mr Holmes, an HGV driver, said: ‘Jessica is my first child and when she was born, I was ecstatic as she is all I ever wanted. ‘When we found out she had leukaemia, I went to pieces. But everybody has got behind us and without the support we have had, we would have cracked long ago.’ Jessica is now undergoing intensive treatment which will continue for at least two years and she has already lost her curly hair following chemotherapy. Mrs Holmes, who has her own business called Mandy's Home Help, said: ‘You never expect something like this to suddenly happen to your child and when it does, it knocks you sideways. Mother-of-five Mrs Holmes said: 'We just take each day at a time and try not to look too far ahead' ‘When the specialist mentioned the word “leukaemia”, my first terrified thought was that Jessica was going to die. ‘When I was at school, a girl I knew got leukaemia and she died and I instantly thought of that and it frightened me. ‘But luckily, medical advances have been made since then and we have to take each day at a time and hope that Jessica's leukaemia will be cured.’ Mr and Mrs Holmes, who live in Preston, Lancashire, revealed that they couldn't have coped without the support of friends, family and the community who have rallied around and raised funds to help them through the financial difficulties that their situation has suddenly landed them with. Mr Holmes said: 'Jessica is my first child and when she was born I was ecstatic as she is all I ever wanted. When we found out she had leukaemia, I went to pieces' Mrs Holmes, who has children Carlyanne, 21, Sophie, 20, Lauren, 16, and Dylan, 12, from a previous marriage, said: ‘There are lots of extra costs when your child has cancer but people in the community have been so kind and we have set up the Jessica Holmes Family Fund and have had around £400 in donations. ‘The Royal Bank of Scotland branch in Garstang have been fundraising and lots of other people have been so generous by giving us food and money to help us through a difficult time. ‘We cannot claim any financial support as you have to wait for three months after diagnosis. But once we can claim, I am planning to raise to raise money for the Ronald McDonald house where we stayed and for CLIC Sargent, the children's cancer charity.’ A spokesman for Central Manchester University Hospitals said: 'We are sorry to hear that the family have concerns about their transfer to Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital. 'We would urge them to speak to a member of ward staff or contact our PALS department and we would be happy to look into any issues that they may have.' Leukaemia is a cancer of the white blood cells. Acute leukaemia means it progresses rapidly and aggressively. Acute leukaemia is classified according to the type of white blood cells that are affected - lymphoblastic leukaemia is cancer of the lymphocytes which are white blood cells used to fight viral infections. Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness and having repeated infections. About 7,600 people are diagnosed with leukaemia every year in the UK - about 650 of these have acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. It is the most common type of cancer to affect children and one in every 2,000 will develop it. In about 85 per cent of cases, it affects children under the age of 15 - the majority of cases develop in two to five-year-olds. The outlook for children with the disease is usually good - almost all children will achieve a period of remission and 85 per cent will be completely cured. Only 40 per cent of adults with the condition are completely cured. Source: NHS Choices .","Jessica Holmes was taken to A&E when her cold failed to improve .

Four out of 10 doctors do not think inquiries into NHS failings - such as at Mid Staffs - will have a positive impact on the way their hospital works. Almost half also remain fearful of the personal consequences of raising concerns about poor patient care, a poll of 800 hospital doctors for the Medical Protection Society found. Around a third admit to having witnessed poor patient care that they did not report but now wish they had. Four in ten doctors do not think that inquiries into NHS failings will have a positive impact on their hospital . When asked why they did not report the incident, 67 per cent worried that they would not be supported by management, 48 per cent worried they would not be supported by their colleagues and 49% feared raising concerns would have an impact on their career. Of the 371 who raised concerns about a colleague, 47 per cent said their concerns were addressed. But for the 178 who raised concerns about their organisation, only 18 per cent found their concerns were addressed and 43 per cent said nothing happened at all. Two-fifths of all doctors surveyed have 'little or no confidence' that the recent inquiries into failings in healthcare will have a positive impact on the culture of their health trust. And 65 per cent said imposing criminal sanctions on staff for wilful neglect would create a culture of fear. Dr Stephanie Bown, director of policy and communications at the Medical Protection Society, said: ""The Medical Protection Society has long argued that better care for patients in the NHS would come through creating the right culture; this cannot be achieved through legislation. Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust was the subject of a damning inquiry into standards of care . 'By creating a culture of openness and learning, we believe doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals will not only be in a position to raise patient safety concerns with confidence that they will be supported, but they will also be in a position to drive continuous improvement in standards of care. 'Whilst introducing a new criminal offence for wilful neglect may seem like a strong measure, our survey of hospital doctors shows many believe it is more likely to create a greater climate of fear with the risk of less focus on patients, not more. This is not what the NHS needs.'","A third of doctors admit to witnessing poor patient care, but did not report it .

A gang of armed robbers recruited two teenage girls to clean £38,000 in stolen cash using nail varnish and bleach. Nakitta Morrison and Holly Davidson, both 19, were called in to help when an exploding dye pack threatened to spoil a loot of stolen bank notes, Liverpool Crown Court heard. The flatmates became involved with the group known for targeting security guards delivering cash after Miss Davidson 'fell for' their leader, Big Marlon Benjamin. Holly Davidson (left) and Nakitta Morrison (right) pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods at Liverpool Crown Court . Police recovered £15,340 in £20 notes from the girls' Liverpool home, along with a power saw that had been used to break into the box containing the stolen money. A bin bag full of discarded cash was found elsewhere in the building as well as empty bottles of bleach and a dye-stained t-shirt. The court heard how the girls purchased nail polish remover, bleach and Lucozade from a local convenience store to help the criminals who robbed a G4S driver at a Shell petrol station in Upton. Members of the violent gang beat the driver with a crowbar after leaping out from behind a hedge, forcing him to surrender the cash. Davidson (left) was ordered to participate in a turnaround scheme for female offenders while Morrison (right) was told to take part in a drug rehabilitation programme by Judge Aubrey QC . The girls became involved with the gang after Davidson allegedly 'fell for' its leader, Marlon Benjamin (left). Gang member Adam Haid (right) was jailed for 12 and a half years . But, an exploding dye pack that bursts if the box is forced open stained the bank notes, prompting the gang to enlist the girls' help. Each was given 16-month prison sentence suspended by Judge David Aubrey QC yesterday after pleading guilty to handling stolen goods, and will be subject to curfews for the next four months. Asher Bedwell was also jailed by a judge who described the gang's activities as 'a campaign of terror' Miss Davidson was ordered to take part in a women's turnaround programme for female offenders while Miss Morrison was ordered to take part in a drug rehabilitation scheme. Gang leader Benjamin was jailed for 13 years and six months at an earlier hearing for theft, robbery, attempted robbery and conspiracy to rob. Five other men received prison sentences for offences relating to robbery, theft, handling stolen goods and forging registration plates. The same judge told the men: 'All these victims are probably scarred for life. 'All probably are now looking behind them when they hear footsteps. 'The anxiety and fear you caused to them cannot in my judgement be overestimated. 'It is quite apparent from your attitude and demeanour in the dock you care not.' 'Some of you have embarked on a campaign of terror. 'These offences were well planned and committed as a group.' Detective Inspector Tom Keaton of Merseyside Police said: 'The group targeted security guards transporting money and ran a highly sophisticated operation, from the point of preparation, right through to the execution of the robbery and the cleaning of the money, everything had been thought of. 'I hope the sentencing of these individuals sends out a strong message that this force is committed to taking people involved in serious and organised crime off our streets and we will use all available resources to tackle them and put them behind bars.'","Nakitta Morrison and Holly Davidson helped gang who stole over £50,000 .

If you anger animals on an Antarctic isle, they won't attack you, they'll just sit on your stuff - as this unfortunate wildlife photographer found out. He did his best to save what belongings he could, but the fate of his tent was already sealed. A herd of four-tonne female elephant seals belly-flopped across the ice and parked themselves squarely on his temporary home, crushing it beyond recognition. Scroll down for video . No need to blubber! The crew did their best to save their belongings, but the fate of their tent was already sealed . Tent up aggression: The seals writhed and yelped as they made sure there was nothing left of the orange tent . Criminal damage... within tent: This is all that was left of the tent by the time the seals rolled off . Despite his, and his colleagues', attempts to shoo them away, the group of animals refused to budge until they'd had their fun. After some 15 minutes they got bored of the prank and finally rolled off, grunting and yelping, to rejoin their herd. The seals launched the surprise attack as the team, from London-based film company Atlantic Productions, filmed emperor penguins on South Georgia, a remote and rugged British island between Argentina and Antarctica. Anthony Geffen, the film’s producer, said: 'The crew were camped out for months on South Georgia to get the amazing story of a young King Penguin, and each day they set off to film in different locations around “Penguin City” where up to a million penguins live.

Dancer Natalia Vyskubenko told the LA Times: 'Some people get parts and positions in one way, some in another. What Joy is telling you is not far from reality.' Yet others reacted with anger and indignation. Soloist Alexander Petukhov told the paper. 'I have worked with the company for 28 years now and I am not aware of such facts. 'If she knows something, let her name those people. Why smear the theater like that?' But scandal has long been endemic behind the cream-colored, eight-columned facade close to Red Square. The Bolshoi reopened to great fanfare in 2011 after a $700-million, six-year renovation that restored the theater's opulent tsarist beginnings, doused its interior in gold-leaf and introduced cutting-edge acoustics. The theater's history is laced with tales of tricks to put off rivals: needles left in costumes; crushed glass in ballet shoes; an alarm clock timed to go off during a particularly intense dance sequence; even a dead cat thrown on stage. Suspect: Former ballet star Pavel Dmitrichenko is on trial for allegedly organizing the acid attack on the Bolshoi chief in a difficult year for the theater . Management of the theater has also seen controversy: in 1995, the departure of the artistic director sparked a wildcat strike by dancers, in turn prompting jeering and foot-stamping from an angry audience that had paid to see 'Romeo and Juliet'. In 2003, world media had a field day when Bolshoi bosses tried to fire ballerina Anastasia Volochkova for being too heavy. And in 2011, deputy ballet director Gennady Yanin - then seen as a candidate for the artistic director post - quit after pornographic images of him appeared on the Internet.","Joy Womack, 19, was born in California, but moved to Russia at the age of 15 for a place at the prestigious Bolshoi academy .

John Lewis’s Christmas advert has given the retailer its best ever start to the festive period. The department store took £101million in the week after The Bear and the Hare first aired – the earliest it has ever topped £100million in the Christmas build-up. But while the marketing campaign set new records for sales, its heart-warming story is one some viewers say they have seen before – 33 years ago. Scroll down for video . Asleep: The advert's bear in his cave before waking up to see Christmas for the first time . Hibernating: Yogi and Booboo settle down for a winter's sleep but are woken by friends . The concept featured in the classic children’s film Yogi’s First Christmas, made in 1980 by American studio Hanna-Barbera. John Lewis denied that the film had any influence on their creative team at advertising agency Adam & Eve DDB. But viewers were quick to point out the similarities this week, with some even accusing the company of ‘ripping off’ the film. They pointed out that both stories focus on hibernating bears seeing their first Christmas – and both feature a magic alarm clock. Film critic Scott Jordan Harris wrote on Twitter: ‘The John Lewis Christmas ad is lovely (though no 2011 Xmas ad). And, wonderfully, it owes something to Yogi’s First Christmas. #bearandhare.’ Charlie Talbot said: ‘Surely it is just the plot of Yogi’s First Christmas? Or am I the only one who remembers this classic...’ Robert Graham added: ‘John Lewis ripping off Yogi’s first Christmas.’ Inspiration: Yogi Bear's magic clock (left) and the John Lewis alarm clock used in this year's advert . The advert, which was first broadcast two weeks ago today, cost £7million to make. But it has already had nearly six million views on YouTube and the store’s takings for the week ending November 16 were £101.45million – 10 per cent up on 2012 and 19 per cent on 2011. The animated advert tells the story of a bear who always misses Christmas because he is hibernating – until his friend the hare buys him a John Lewis alarm clock. He is woken in time for December 25, when he emerges from his cave to discover a beautiful Christmas tree and his animal friends celebrating. The plot bears a striking resemblance to the Yogi Bear film, often shown at Christmas in the 1980s. Yogi and his friend Booboo go to bed for the winter, setting their magic alarm clock for spring. But they are woken just before Christmas by friends who enlist Yogi to ‘save Christmas’ from the troublesome Snively and Herman. Response: The store denied their creative team had been influenced by the 1980 film . Philip Hesketh, who worked in advertising for 20 years, said taking inspiration from other sources was part of the creative process. ‘Any creative person will be exposed to a range of influences in their lifetime, going back to childhood,’ he said. ‘Often these influences are stored in the subconscious brain, and you can’t unlearn what you’ve already learnt.’ A John Lewis spokesman said the advert was unique, adding: ‘Our creative team wasn’t aware of Yogi’s First Christmas … the stories are very different. Fortunately for our bear, all the characters in the John Lewis ad love Christmas.’","The department store took £101million in the week after advert first aired .

New limits on EU migrants who claim benefits in Britain are to be a key demand in the Government’s attempt to negotiate a looser relationship with Europe. David Cameron is expected to flesh out his goals next week in a planned renegotiation of our ties with Brussels ahead of an in-out referendum on EU membership due by 2017. Cabinet sources say the right to ‘shut the door’ on unemployment benefits for newcomers and existing migrants who have not lived here for a minimum period would be top of the list. David Cameron is expected to announce he is targeting migrants' benefits when he fleshes out plans for new ties with Brussels next weeks . Britain is also expected to demand the right to stop making payments, such as child benefit, to the dependent children of migrant workers. The move comes after a poll for the Mail identified deep public anxiety about the ending of transitionary immigration restrictions on new EU members Romania and Bulgaria in January. The poll found that 82 per cent did not want citizens of the two countries to gain free access to the UK, 85 per cent said they feared schools and hospitals could not cope and 76 per cent said young Britons could lose out on jobs. Ministers insist they are powerless to prevent a potential influx of workers because of EU rules. But after the Mail’s bombshell poll Tory backbenchers urged Mr Cameron to stand up to Europe. Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘This poll shows exactly where the British people are.  The Prime Minister should listen to that, make a stand, and extend the transitionary arrangements for a further five years. 'My advice to him is not to worry what the EU say – it is a discredited body. He should listen to the British people.’ Douglas Carswell, Tory MP for Clacton, said: ‘You almost have to be a member of the government not to get it. The Prime Minister and his colleagues need to stop listening to the forces of inertia, and need to get on and act. ‘He promised he would reduce inward migration to the tens of thousands, and if he doesn’t act within the next eight months, that promise is going to look pretty hollow.’ The poll also found more voters trust Labour on immigration (17 per cent) than the Tories (11 per cent). Some 44 per cent said they trusted no party. Philip Hollobone, Tory MP for Kettering, said: ‘We need to make it clear that transitional controls will not end on December 31, and this would send a strong signal to the EU that Britain is absolutely serious about renegotiating our terms. 'Ahead of the next election, the Conservatives have to win back the trust of the people on immigration.’ Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch think tank, said it was ‘astonishing’ that Labour came out ahead in the survey. He added: ‘It was under Labour that four million foreign migrants arrived in Britain, and it was they who left the immigration system in absolute chaos.’ Next week, a group of Tories will unveil their own blueprint for reform of Britain’s relationship with Europe. Andrea Leadsom, Chris Heaton-Harris and Tim Loughton, from the Fresh Start Project, have identified at least five major changes to EU treaties they say should be at the heart of Britain’s renegotiation. They include reforms to protect our financial services industry and an end to limits on work hours. Tory Eurosceptics also want reforms to energy policy, the common agricultural policy, defence and immigration. Ministers are already furious that the European Commission has taken legal action to try to prevent welfare curbs on non-British EU citizens. Brussels claims making migrants show they are ‘habitual residents’ before they can claim child benefit, child tax credit, jobseeker’s allowance and state pension credit breaks the right to free movement. Migrants would have to be actively looking for work and have a realistic prospect of getting a job to claim unemployment benefits. Mr Cameron is thought to be ready to insist on tougher time limits. Some immigrants already have to wait a year for certain welfare payments, but this would be bolstered to ensure they ‘pay in’ to the British system before they can take out.","David Cameron expected to flesh out first details of UK demands from new EU Treaty as soon as next week .

A financial adviser stole almost £1 million from friends, a charity and investors to feed his online gambling addiction. Michael Garner, 53, frittered away astronomical amounts on an online casino - placing bets totalling an astonishing £1.5m, but only winning back around £750,000. To feed his gambling habits, he began stealing from the Cheadle and Gatley Round Table charitable organisation, where he was the trusted treasurer and later president. He stole ticket money, totalling £2,500, which had been collected by the likes of Cheadle Primary School's PTA and Mathers bakers, in Cheadle, Greater Manchester. A court heard he also swiped £3,500 from the charity's coffers by forging a signature and paying a cheque from its account directly into his own. But, as his gambling addiction escalated, so did his stealing. Garner, a well-known self-employed financial and pensions adviser from Heaton Mersey, Stockport, convinced long-time friend and client Dr Ken Jones, 80, to invest in a trading opportunity he had identified in Switzerland. Dr Jones, a retired biochemist, cashed in his £100,000 stocks and shares and then paid the money into his trusted pal's account. But Garner blew the lot on online gambling site Jackpotjoy within a month. Stole: The 53-year-old stole ticket money, totalling £2,500, which had been collected by the likes of Cheadle Primary School's PTA (pictured) Garner's stealing continued and became more audacious as he scammed a dozen successful businessmen who had been persuaded to invest in the Swiss scheme. The Escrow Trading Trust, based in Alderley Edge, Cheshire, was set up to hold the investors' cash with Garner and two other people as trustees. Garner forged a bank mandate without the knowledge of the other trustees that allowed him to withdraw money from the trust's account. Between December 2011 and May 2012, he stole almost £900,000 and paid it into the account he shared with his wife. The court heard Garner was gambling on average about £10,000 a day on Jackpotjoy - and up to £80,000 a day on some occasions. Online gambling: Garner blew the money on online gambling site Jackpotjoy. The court heard Garner was gambling on average about £10,000 a day on the website - and up to £80,000 a day on some occasions . His crimes were uncovered when one of the trustees spoke to their bank manager and realised the cash had gone missing. Garner was arrested at his home on Woodside and later pleaded guilty to five counts of theft relating to the Round Table, and two counts of fraud and 22 counts of theft relating to the Swiss investment opportunity. Sentencing Garner to five years and eight months in jail, Recorder Michael Hayton QC described Garner's breach of trust as 'grotesque'. He added: 'Your life has been ruined by this addiction.' Anna Mackenzie, defending, told the court Garner was remorseful and understood his actions had 'devastated' the lives of himself, family, friends and victims. She added his marriage appeared to be over and his matrimonial home, his only asset, had been sold to help pay off a civil claim made by the investors against him.","Michael Garner, 52, placed bets totalling £1.5m, but only won £750,000 .

When he saw a woman jumping from the upper deck at the Oakland Raiders' stadium on Sunday, Donnie Navidad said his military instincts immediately kicked in as he lunged forward trying to catch her. But though he was injured in the process and authorities say he saved the woman's life, he maintains that he's no hero and that he would do it again. 'I just wished I would've grabbed her and held on to her,' Navidad said. 'I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do anything.' No regrets: Donnie Navidad, 61, left, laughs with former Oakland Raider Willie Brown on Monday as he talks about saving a young woman's life after a Raiders NFL football game at the Coliseum on Sunday . Both Navidad and the woman hit the concrete hard from the impact about 15 minutes after the Raiders' 23-19 loss to the Tennessee Titans. Navidad said he was among several people pleading with the woman not to jump as he positioned himself to try catching her. When she plunged about 45 feet from the upper deck at the O.co Coliseum, Navidad, with his arms open, ended up breaking her fall. The 61-year-old Marine Corps veteran was hospitalized overnight and was recuperating from a severely bruised arm at his home in Stockton. Scene: The woman threw herself off the tarp-covered upper deck of the coliseum, which was closed to the public, after the game. The Marine vet saw her as he was walking by . 'He simply saved her life,' Alameda County sheriff's Sgt. J.D. Nelson said. 'Otherwise, she'd be dead.' The woman remained hospitalized in critical condition. Her name has not been released. A Raiders season ticket holder, Navidad said he was with a buddy lingering near the Al Davis commemorative flame at the Coliseum when he saw and heard the commotion around the woman, who was on the ledge in the upper deck concourse area that's covered by tarp. 'I yelled up at her yelling, ""Don't do it, don't do it. Please don't jump,'"" Navidad said. 'And she started to descend and she let herself go.' Navidad said his military instincts kicked in as he lunged toward the woman trying to catch her. 'He couldn't grab and hold her, and that's what bothers him,' his wife, Lora Navidad, said on Monday. 'He had no fear or thought for his own well-being.' Stadium: The incident happened as fans were filing out of the O.co Coliseum after the Oakland Raiders play ed the Tennessee Titans on Sunday November 24 . Navidad said well-wishers have besieged . him, including Raiders' hall of fame cornerback Willie Brown, who . visited personally. Team officials came to his home, and he received a . phone call from Hall of Fame wide receiver Fred Biletnikoff. Nelson, who visited Navidad in the hospital Sunday evening, called him 'a hero.' Navidad, a father of four with 12 grandkids who works as an inventory surveillance worker for the General Services Administration in nearby French Camp, Calif., modestly thinks otherwise. 'They want to label me a hero, but how do you define a hero?' Navidad asks. 'I would've done it for anybody.' He plans to be at the Raiders' next home game against the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 15.

This is despite the fact the market price for 16GB of additional memory is only £5.95, the watchdog claims. Which?

Apple was found to charge £80 for the extra storage on its new iPad Air, pictured, even though the market price for the same amount of storage is just £5.95 . The report comes just weeks after figures from analytics firm IHS found Apple makes £225 profit on every iPad Air it sells. The Colorado-based firm took the tablet to pieces and worked out how much each individual component would cost to manufacture.

Google charges an extra £50 to increase the memory on its Nexus 10 from 16GB to 32GB, while Amazon charges £40 for the same storage increase on its Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. Which? described the markups as ‘outrageous’ and advised potential customers to buy a tablet with an SD or microSD slot and add a memory card for a fraction of the cost. The report said: ‘The best thing about using a tablet is filling it with apps, songs and videos that you love. But all of this content gobbles up storage space fast, and tablets use flash memory that's limited in size. ‘Unlike with PCs, tablet storage is difficult to upgrade after you've purchased your model. That's because most tablet bodies are sealed and don't let you install further hardware.’ Which? also added the true amount of storage space is not the same as advertised because operating systems and built-in apps take up space. It found just 10GB of free space was left available for the customer's songs, apps and photos on a 16GB Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, for example. Google charges an extra £50 for a 32GB model of its Nexus 10, pictured, compared to the smaller 16GB version. There is also a £40 difference between the 16GB and 32GB models of its Nexus 7 . Ben Miles of Chillbast, a UK-based computer manufacturer which buys its flash memory from some of the same suppliers who make the flash storage components found in tablets, told Which?: ‘16GB of flash memory is mind-numbingly cheap now. Which? also found full storage space is rarely what's advertised. For example, there is only 10GB free space on a 16GB Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, pictured . ‘As a general rule, for manufacturers like ourselves, flash costs less than 40p per GB, so for companies to charge so much for an extra 16GB seems scandalous. ‘The difference in cost between manufacturing a product with 16GB and 32GB of memory would probably equate to less than $10 (£6).’ Which? editor Richard Headland added: ‘With tablets in demand this Christmas, buyers will be shocked to discover what a raw deal they're getting on built-in memory.'

Zimmerman, who was acquitted this summer of murdering teenager Trayvon Martin, is 'millions' of dollars in debt and relying on public defenders for his legal team, his attorney revealed. TMZ.com reports that Shellie Zimmerman has been trying to divorce George since September - but she can't because court agents have not been able to track him down and hand him the paperwork formally notifying him of the divorce. He finally got the paperwork today in the Seminole County jail. Zimmerman was seen for the first time since on Tuesday when his two new lawyers accompanied him to the first appearance hearing where a judge heard arguments over whether or not he should be released on bail while waiting for his charges to be brought to court on January 7. The judge ordered that he will be . allowed to be released but he must not contact Ms Scheibe and stay away . from two specified residences - one of which is her home. Scroll down for video .

In . addition, the judge explained that he was assigning the $9,000 bail bond . by valuing the aggravated assault charge at $8,900 and $100 for each of . the misdemeanor charges of battery and criminal mischief that he faces. He will also have to remain in the state of Florida, wear an ankle monitoring bracelet, and surrender any and all weapons.

Some reports place the liabilities at higher than $2million but attorney Daniel Megaro would not confirm that number as he said he has not yet looked over the affidavit. Zimmerman kept his responses short during the court appearance, saying that he did understand the charges and conditions of his bond.

Fastfood giant McDonald's has apologised to a grandfather and his toddler grandson who were blasted by rap music peppered with explicit sex lyrics as they ate. A song by x-rated American rapper Rucka Rucka Ali blared out across the Haverfordwest restaurant of the chain, in west Wales, last Friday. Steve Davidson, of Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, was having breakfast with 20-month-old grandson Charlie when the controversial song was broadcast over the outlet's sound system. Breakfast rap: Fast food giant McDonald's has apologised to grandfather Steve Davidson for playing a foul rap song about prison rape when he took his grandson for a meal . The track is called 'Only 17',  and is from the controversial rapper's 2011 album called Probably Racist. The song, too explicit to quote, talks in detail about anal rape, underage sex and prison violence. Stunned Mr Davidson, a landlord who runs the Three Crowns pub in neighbouring Milford Haven, said the disgusting lyrics were 'bordering on pornography'. McDonald's explained today that a late shift employee working after the outlet shut had left his private listening linked to its public sound system by mistake. It apologised for the 'isolated lapse in our rigorous standards' and acknowledged that the content of the song lyrics were 'wholly inappropriate'. Controversial: The song was 'Only 17' by American rapper Rucka Rucka Ali. It contains incredibly obscene and sexist lyrics about prison rape and underage sex . 'The bottom line is that it's bordering on pornography. It certainly shouldn't be playing in a restaurant where they sell Happy Meals to children,' Mr Davidson told the Western Telegraph, in Haverfordwest. 'The lyrics are disgusting, they are very explicit - not just a bit risque or a bit of swearing. 'It's not what you want while you're having your breakfast. Filth: Mr Davidson said: 'The lyrics are disgusting, they are very explicit - not just a bit risque or a bit of swearing. It's not what you want while you're having your breakfast' 'You have to be over 18 to download it, for them to be playing it somewhere that attracts children is obviously a concern.' A McDonald's spokesman said: 'We offer our sincere apologies to Mr Davidson for any offence caused by the music playing in our Haverfordwest store last Friday morning. 'The content and lyrics were wholly inappropriate and had no place in McDonald's. 'The previous evening while the restaurant dining area had been closed to members of the public, an employee had connected their personal music player to the restaurant sound system while working the overnight shift. 'This music device was inadvertently left connected to the system when the restaurant reopened the following morning. 'Management have spoken to the crew member involved and reminded all employees about the policies in place and the reasons for them. 'McDonald's is a family-friendly restaurant and we endeavour to provide a restaurant environment that is welcoming, comfortable and enjoyable for everybody. 'The vast majority of our restaurants, including Haverfordwest, have external music providers dedicated to creating playlists that have been thoroughly screened for appropriateness of language and content.

"By . Gerri Peev and Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 17:19 EST, 25 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:21 EST, 26 July 2013 . The Archbishop of Canterbury today admitted he was 'embarrassed' to discover that the Church of England had a stake in controversial payday lender Wonga. The Most Rev Justin Welby has declared war on companies charging inflated rates of interest and vowed to expand credit unions to act as an alternative, in a move backed by the Government. But yesterday it emerged that the CoE's pension fund invests in one of Wonga's key financial backers - and the Archbishop said today that the Church must 'ensure this doesn't happen again'. Battle: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has vowed to put Wonga out of business and even met with the payday lender's founder Errol Damelin (right) to tell him. But tonight it emerged the Church is linked to the firm . The fund, which claims to have an . ethical investment policy that bans companies involved in payday . lending, has a stake in Accel Partners, a US venture capital firm which . raised funds for Wonga in 2009. When asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether he was 'embarrassed' by the revelation, Mr Welby replied, 'Yes I am', adding: 'I was irritated for a few minutes, but these things happen.' He vowed that the Church would withdraw its investment from Wonga, saying: 'It shouldn't happen - it's very embarrassing, but these things do happen. We have to find out why and make sure it doesn't happen again.' The Archbishop suggested that the CoE would revise rules allowing it to invest in companies which make up to a quarter of their revenues from lending at sky-high rates of interest. 'They shouldn't be invested in Wonga, we don't think it's a good thing,' he said. 'We have to review these levels and make sure that we are consistent between what we're saying and what we're doing. 'We think that the payday lenders charge vastly excessive amounts for the loans they make. This is something that really matters to me.' Objections: Payday loan company Wonga charges 5,853 per cent annual interest rates on short term loans. To great embarrassment, the CoE’s pension fund admitted it invests in one of Wonga’s key financial backers . However, Mr Welby also insisted that . mistakes such as this one are inevitable in world of investing, due to . the complicated nature of the financial world. 'We've got to live in the real world, . and living in the real world means that life is complicated and you . can't escape the complexity,' he said. Asked if the Church of England was breaking its rules, he replied: 'It's a perfectly valid point. Is a little sin intolerable? 'Sin is a bad thing by definition. Just for the record, I'm not in favour of sin.' By launching an attack on payday loan firms the Archbishop of Canterbury has sent a message that they are the scourge of the high street. He clearly believes the Church could and should offer better help to the most financially in need. But innovative as his plan is, it will never be the answer to this spiralling debt crisis. Credit unions are too small, extremely localised and many aren’t well enough financed to cope with the soaring demand from those who want to borrow for just a few days. They are bound by tight regulations, while many loan firms operate in the Wild West. Rather, the Archbishop should point a finger of blame at the banks and encourage them to do more. Many are forced into the arms of payday lenders because the cost of short-term borrowing at the banks is so high. Borrowing £200 in an unauthorised overdraft for ten days at one major high street bank would cost £87. That’s an interest rate, known as an APR, of 15million per cent. With Wonga the same borrowing costs £26.05 at an APR of 5,853 per cent. Yet few have questioned why banks have been allowed to wash their hands of small borrowers. It is little wonder those forced to look to less well-known firms found themselves in trouble. Last year 36,413 borrowers contacted debt charity StepChange because they were struggling with payday loans of an average £1,657. Just 12 months earlier, the number of complaints was half this amount and the size of the debt about a third less. Thousands of customers have been allowed to take five or more loans and three-quarters of firms fail to check incomes of applicants. The cowboys are ruining lives and it is going to take a new sheriff and a few good men such as the Archbishop to stop this scourge. Some have suggested that Church . should not be involved with the financial markets at all - the credit . unions they are supporting charge annual interest rates of up to 80 per . cent, far more than High Street banks. But the Archbishop said the CoE . should 'put our money where our mouth is', adding: 'We don't stand on . the sidelines on some sort of great podium lecturing everyone else.' He continued: 'I don't think capitalism is necessarily amoral - it can sometimes be immoral, but it is not of itself immoral.' Although much of the debate has . focussed on high-profile lenders such as Wonga, Mr Welby said that 'the . worst people are not Wonga' and claimed his campaign was targeted more . at loan sharks than professionally managed companies. A Lambeth Palace spokesman said: ‘We . are grateful to the Financial Times for pointing out this serious . inconsistency of which we were unaware. ‘We will be asking the assets . committee of the Church Commissioners to investigate how this has . occurred and to review the holding.’ After Boris Johnson added his voice to those criticising what he called 'Wonga-nomics', calling the Archbishop's plans 'interesting and right', the lender hit back by insisting it was not an 'unacceptable business'. In a statement setting out '10 commitments' to being a responsible body, Wonga said it agreed with much of what Mr Welby has said and vowed to prevent customers from racking up spiralling levels of debt. The Archbishop's 'comment that he wants to ""compete Wonga out of existence"" has been interpreted by some as meaning we are an unacceptable business,' the firm said. 'Some have taken it a step further, saying we make unaffordable loans to the most vulnerable in society. We respectfully disagree.' The company promised to be transparent about the price of its loans, carry out thorough credit checks, and freeze interest after two months to protect defaulting customers. Ministers have been criticised for failing to cap interest rates, which can top 5,000 per cent a year. But Chancellor George Osborne said he . agreed with much of what the Most Rev Justin Welby is proposing. He told . Channel 4 News: ‘I also agree that we’ve got to make sure that payday . lending and the like is properly regulated, which it hasn’t been before. ‘I have huge amount of time and . respect for Justin Welby. I personally appointed him to the Banking . Commission because of his expertise.’ Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable . also backed the Church’s intervention, declaring: ‘The Archbishop of . Canterbury has hit the nail on the head.’ He told Channel 5 News: ‘Credit unions . are a better way of providing credit for people on a lower income who . are not credit-worthy and can’t use banks. ‘We’ve got to have an alternative and . the Archbishop is right not just to condemn abuse but to offer . alternatives which are more ethical.’ The Archbishop wants credit unions . to use church buildings across 9,000 communities to expand access to . credit unions. He has called for volunteers who have . experience in finance to come forward and help run credit unions to . compete with the £2billion-a-year payday industry. Credit unions are . community based not-for-profit organisations offering loans, savings . accounts and even mortgages. Deadlock: Papiss Cisse has refused to wear Newcastle's new strip sponsored by loans company Wonga . They are usually linked to one . community or industry, such as the Police Credit Union, and have been . regulated by the Financial Services Authority since 2002. Around one million Britons are members . of the nation’s 500 credit unions. Firms such as Wonga have grown in . popularity as banks tightened up their lending in the wake of the . financial crisis. In an interview with Total Politics . magazine the Archbishop, a former oil executive, said: ‘I’ve met the . head of Wonga and we had a very good conversation and I said to him . quite bluntly “We’re not in the business of trying to legislate you out . of existence, we’re trying to compete you out of existence”. ‘We’ve got to have credit unions that . are both engaged in their communities and much more professional and the . third thing is people have got to know about them. It’s a decade-long . process. We’re putting our money where our mouth is, we’re starting a . Church of England staff credit union.’ Wonga’s chief executive Errol Damelin . said: ‘I’m all for better consumer choice. The Archbishop is clearly an . exceptional individual and someone who understands the power of . innovation.’ He said they discussed banking, financial services and the digital society and had a ‘meeting of minds on many big issues’. The payday loan industry was referred . last month to the Competition Commission for an investigation over . concerns some lenders were trying to ‘distort’ competition.","Justin Welby has vowed to help grow Britain's 500 financial co-operatives .

A 4,400-year-old love story has been uncovered in the ancient Egyptian burial ground of Saqqara. Archaeologists excavating a tomb of a couple and their children have revealed a relief painting depicting a love scene. The tomb belonged to a singer working for the Pharaoh, named Kahai, and his priestess wife Meretites. The scene shows the husband and wife gazing lovingly into each other's eyes, with the priestess Meretites placing her hand over her husband's right shoulder . The colour painting, dating back to the time when the great pyramids were being built in Egypt, is extremely rare. The scene shows the husband and wife gazing lovingly into each other’s eyes, with Meretites placing her hand over her husband's right shoulder. Only a handful images showing an affectionate embrace survive from the Old Kingdom (2649 B.C. to 2150 B.C.). In the scene, Kahai is wearing a leopard’s skin and is is holding a staff and scepter, which served as symbols of authority. A look into the 4,400-year-old tomb from ancient Egypt that held a priestess and her husband, a singer in the pharaoh's palace . The tomb at Saqqara (pictured) held the couple, their children and perhaps their grandchildren. It has now been studied in closer detail by Macquarie University's Australian Center for Egyptology . Saqqara is an ancient burial ground in Egypt located near the entrance of the Nile Delta. Most of Saqqara was buried in sand until the mid-19th century, when Auguste Mariette uncovered the Serapeum. Since then, it has been a gradual process of rediscovery. Old Kingdom pharaohs were buried within Saqqara’s 11 major pyramids, while their subjects were buried in the hundreds of smaller tombs.  The name Saqqara is most likely derived from Sokar, the Memphite god of the dead. Meretites is wearing a long, tight dress with shoulder straps that appear to leave a breast exposed. The tomb was first discovered in 1966 and published in a book in 1971, but the discovery was mainly recorded in black-and-white. At the time of the discovery, mummified remains were also found, but it is not certain if they belonged to the family members. The image has now been unveiled in all its incredible colours by Macquarie University's Australian Center for Egyptology. Miral Lashien, a researcher at Macquarie University told LiveScience that the tomb of Kahai is an example of the importance of women. The frequency of their representations in the artwork in the tomband the equal size to their husbands or brothers suggest equal status. This kind of embrace was not limited to romantic love. Another image showing a similar pose was found from Pyramid Age Egypt depicting two men who were likely twin brothers, said Ms Lashien. The discovery was made in Saqqara is - an ancient burial ground in Egypt located near the entrance of the Nile Delta .","Painting dates back to a time when the pyramids were being built in Egypt .

The Manchester United squad narrowly avoided crashing with another plane last night as they came in to land in Cologne. The Reds' chartered Monarch Airbus A321 plane was seconds away from touchdown at Cologne when it had to abort the landing. The aircraft, carrying the team and back room staff, was 1,312ft from the runway when the pilot was alerted to another plane on the ground and had to quickly abandon the descent and rise sharply. The Monarch airlines plane that carried the Manchester United team to Cologne had to abort its landing . The 185-seater jet circled around and landed safely 10 minutes later, with the captain apologising for the incident. After landing, United captain Rio Ferdinand tweeted: 'Landed in Germany....just...I've only just recovered after that choppy landing.' United captain Rio Ferdinand tweeted: 'Landed in Germany... just... I've only just recovered after that choppy landing.' The incident came just days after Munich air disaster survivor Bill Foulkes died aged 81. The club lost eight players in the 1958 disaster, which claimed the lives of 23 people. The crash happened on February 6 as Manchester United players and staff returned from a European Cup game in Yugoslavia. After the plane failed to take off on two previous efforts, the pilot attempted a third attempt. The . aircraft rose a few feet off the ground but ran into a wooden fence. The port wing hit a building and the plane caught fire. One member of the United camp who on the plane, which had earlier departed from Manchester Airport, said: 'It was quite frightening. 'We were coming in to land when we had to pull up suddenly because it appears there was a plane on the runway. 'The captain came on the intercom to apologise for what happened and then we landed safely.' It's understood neither former manager Sir Alex Ferguson, nor Sir Bobby Charlton were on the plane. It is thought that Sir Alex will fly to Germany today. A clutch of current United stars, including skipper Nemanja Vidic, Michael Carrick and Robin van Persie, also missed the drama. United have flown to Germany to take on Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League group stage tonight. Rio Ferdinand's panic at the near-collision was palpable from his relieved tweet . Manchester United's Wayne Rooney, center, trains with teammates Ryan Giggs, left, and Rio Ferdinand, second left, before the flight . Ferdinand and his teammates will wear black armbands for the Leverkusen game in a tribute to Foulkes. The incident delayed manager David Moyes' Champions League press conference for the Leverkusen match in the BayArena. When a plane aborts a landing on the flight's final approach, it is known as a 'go-around'. There are several situations in which a captain makes the manoeuvre, such as objects on the runway, hazardous weather or faulty equipment. According to aviation experts a go-around is not classed as an emergency and is not uncommon. Monarch Airlines confirmed the incident had taken place but declined to comment further.","Reds' chartered Monarch Airbus A321 plane was seconds away from touchdown at Cologne when it had to abort the landing .

Warning: Prime Minister David Cameron said he would target green levies and company profits to bring down energy bills . Huge rises in energy bills are ‘morally wrong’ at a time when costs for power firms are not rising, David Cameron said today. The Prime Minister took aim at companies which have announced price hikes of up to 10 per cent in recent days, as he promised ‘action’ to curb the profits of the Big Six energy firms. It also emerged Number 10 want to cut the green levies on bills by £50, to counter claims the government is not acting to ease the rising cost of living. The UK is second only to Estonia among European nations for the number of people who are struggling to pay their energy bills, according to research by the fuel poverty alliance Energy Bill Revolution. ScottishPower yesterday became the latest firm to announce eye-watering price rises, warning bills will go up by 9 per cent within weeks. It follows Npower announcing a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas promising a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. At a press conference in Brussels, Mr Cameron was asked if the energy giants were ‘morally wrong’ to increase their costs, following rises by four of the Big Six firms. Mr Cameron said: ‘On power bills I think it is wrong for bills to go up when wholesale prices are not going up substantially, but we have to look at the causes of why bills are going up and act on those causes rather than just have some sort of blanket policy that doesn't work. ‘That's why I've identified, of the four parts to a bill - you've got the wholesale prices, the transmission costs, the green taxes and charges, and then you've got the profits that the companies are making - it's those last two where we need action. ‘So, on the profits you need more competition, you need more challenge, I want more companies in that sector, I want the competition in the market properly reviewed every year, and we will have that. ‘On the green charges, yes, we should be trying to roll the cost of those back, in the best way that we can because that is one of the things that has been adding to bills in recent years.’ Charges: Four of the Big Six energy firms have announced price hikes of up to 10 per cent in recent days . The threat to target the profits of energy firms comes after former Tory Prime Minister Sir John Minister this week called for an ‘excess profits tax on the energy companies’ to claw back  money to money help for the elderly to keep warm this winter. Mr Cameron has rejected the idea, insisting a review of competition in the industry, due to be announced next week, will bring more competitors into the market and p to cut bills. The Prime Minister is also locked in negotiations with his Lib Dem deputy Nick Clegg over the future of green levies which push up bills by more than £100-a-year. Warning: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted he would not allow green levies to be scrapped altogether . Government insiders indicate that Mr . Cameron wants any change to green levies to have a significant impact on . bills, and hope to be able to promise customers a reduction of at least . £50. Mr Clegg today said he would not . allow all green levies to be axed following the PM's surprise . announcement earlier this week that ‘roll back’ the charges. But they could be paid for from general taxation instead of added costs on energy bills. The Liberal Democrat leader told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine: ‘Removing all the levies is an incredibly bad idea and I would never support it. ‘It's certainly not an idea which this coalition Government is going to put forward.’ Official advice issued by Public Health England (PHE) says people should keep their homes warm, with living room temperatures of 21C (70F) and bedrooms and the rest of the house heated to 18C (65F). It says temperatures above this 'may waste money' but below this 'may risk your health'. If people are unable to afford to heat all their rooms, they are advised to heat their living room during the day and bedrooms just before going to bed. But Mr Clegg insisted: ‘I'm certainly not giving people advice on what to wear and what to do with their own thermostats.’ the cost of going green . The Prime Minister insisted that any action the Government took on green levies would be done in a transparent fashion. He . repeated his assertion that Ed Miliband's pledge to freeze bills if he . won power in 2015 was a ‘con’ because no politician could prevent . fluctuations in the oil and gas markets. ‘What matters is getting to grips with the causes of things that are causing the bills to rise,’ he said. ‘That must be done in an open and transparent way, so that if you end what's causing the charge to rise that's transparent, if you move a charge from a bill to somewhere else that's transparent. ‘What is a con is saying “I'm going to cap energy prices” when actually you're not doing anything to deal with the reason why they are increasing.’ He said the British public are ‘basically very smart and they know that energy bills can go up when the world price of oil and gas goes up’.","David Cameron wants to reduce bills by £50 by reducing green levies .

"PUBLISHED: . 21:40 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:40 EST, 14 November 2013 . It has been revealed that Caroline Kennedy was headed to her first ever sleepover the moments when news broke of a shooting near the President during a trip to Dallas. One of Jackie Kennedy's former Secret Service agents has written a new book about the first family's heartbreak following the assassination of President Kennedy, now giving a first person account of the tragic ordeal. Clint Hill, who has written Five Days In November, was assigned to protect the First Lady and was following the open-top convertible as the President was shot. Moments before: President Kennedy and Jackie were in the back of a convertible on November 22, 1963 when he was killed by an assassin's bullet . Brave face: Mrs Kennedy told her children Caroline and John Jr what had happened to their father once she arrived back in Washington DC (seen on the day of the funeral three days later) Staying together: At the time of the shooting, Caroline was on her way to her first sleepover when the first shots were reported over the radio but her friends' mother who was driving the car said she probably didn't hear . Iconic: On the day of his third birthday, John F. Kennedy Jr saluted his father's casket . Instead, it was agent Tom Wells who was in charge of protecting the children, 5-year-old Caroline and 2-year-old John Jr. Neither traveled with their parents on that fateful trip to Dallas. John Jr. was too young to know what was going on, but the agent feared that Caroline might. She was headed to her friend Agatha Pozen when the first reports of the shooting were broadcast over the radio. Mr Wells signaled for Mrs Pozen to stop the car, and though she told him that the girls were playing and probably did not hear the report, he decided that he had to get Caroline back to the White House. Heartbreaking: When the President left for trip to Arkansas more than a month before his fateful Texas trip, it was very clear that his young son did not want him to leave . Working together: One of the final photos of JFK and his son was captured in a tender moment on October 15 when the toddler played under the Resolute Desk . Playful: Caroline is seen sitting on her father's lap and John John on Jackie's while they watched drills and dances from the White House portico on November 13 . Close care: While his mother Jackie was panicking in a Dallas hospital, John Jr was in the care of his nanny Maude Shaw (seen together in May of 1963) Constant presence: Mrs Shaw, seen in the car with then-President-elect John Kennedy and Jackie headed home from the hospital with baby John Jr in her arms with nanny Shaw with them . 'Caroline, there has been a change in plans, and you mother has asked that you come back,' Mr Wells told the little girl. Mr Hill's book, a preview excerpt of which was published in People Magazine, reports that John Jr was with his nanny, Maud Shaw. Once Mrs Kennedy arrived back in Washington later on the evening of November 22, she and Mrs Shaw were the ones to tell the children that their father had died. 'She was very strong through the whole ordeal,' Mr Wells said in the book. That was far from her only act of strength during that difficult time, as Mr Hill said that he was concerned for her own safety as she tested the limits while trying to catch a piece of her husband's skull that had been shot off and flew out the back of the open-top convertible. Horrific: Agent Clinton Hill was the one who ran up to the back of the convertible to protect Jacqueline as she tried climbing out of the back of the car to get a piece of her husband's head that had been shot off . Special event: Though she was in mourning just over a week after he husband's assassination, Mrs Kennedy made a point to attend the award ceremony honoring Clint Hill (seen at her left) He recalled the moment when he had to run and climb into the car from the back before it sped away: 'Mrs Kennedy, her eyes filled with terror, is crawling out of her seat and onto the trunk, Oh God... The car is beginning to speed up and if I don't get to her, she's going to be thrown off. I push her back into the seat.' One year later: The Kennedy family had moved to a townhouse in the neighborhood of Georgetown by the time they visited his grave on his birthday on May 29, 1964 . Mrs Kennedy spearheaded the logistics of planning a state funeral as soon as she arrived back in the Capitol, after standing by her husband's Vice President's side when he was sworn in to take over on board Air Force One. The next three days were a blur of seemingly-unending memorial engagements. After the formal funeral ceremony, there was a much more light-hearted event that she had to plan, which agent Hill asked her about as soon as she got back to the White House. '""Oh and Mrs Kennedy? I hate to bring it up. Have you thought about doing anything for John's birthday?"" Her mouth breaks into the slightest of smiles. ""Oh Mr Hill, you never forget anything, do you? In fact that's what we're going to do now, have a little celebration,""' he wrote of their exchange. Relatives and close friends had gathered in the private residence on the second floor of the White House and sang Irish songs and said funny poems in celebration of the slain President's son's third birthday. 'There are presents and cake and the laughter of children is the sliver of sunshine amid the blackness of the past four days,' Mr Hill wrote.","Agent Clint Hill has written a book timed with the 50th anniversary .

The youngest daughter of New York mayor Michael Bloomberg has revealed how proud she is to share her millionaire father's name - a decade after telling the world it 'sucks'. Georgina Bloomberg, who is who is reportedly worth $11.5 billion and is due to give birth to her first child in December, made headlines in 2003 when she told an HBO documentary that: 'Having the last name Bloomberg sucks.' Four years later, the tongue-pierced socialite and professional show jumper, 30, was named the fourth 'most intriguing . billionaire heiress' by Forbes for 'defying the stereotype of the bon-bon popping princess'. Indulgent: Mr Bloomberg, 71, has indulged his daughter's passion for equestrian and paid for at least six horses, which she keeps on estates in North Salem, New York, and Wellington, Florida . But describing herself as a 'rebellious teenager [who] wanted to get things pierced and smoke cigarettes on the street corner', she told Glamour.com she now regrets making the statement. 'I was only 19; 11 years later I feel completely differently,' Georgina said. 'Today I’m very appreciative of who my family is and how hard my father works. I’m proud to be a Bloomberg.' The Bloomberg family are among the . richest in America and Mr Bloomberg has an estimated personal fortune of . $18.1billion earned through his eponymous financial information . company. But the . 69-year-old has made no secret of the fact that his daughter’s career . costs a lot of money as show horses can cost hundreds of thousands of . dollars a year to keep. Intriguing: The tongue-pierced socialite and professional show jumper, 30, was named the fourth 'most intriguing billionaire heiress' by Forbes for 'defying the stereotype of the bon-bon popping princess' 'My father lacks a filter, and it’s gotten him in trouble,' Georgina said. 'A couple of years ago, he gave a speech at the Nathan’s hot . dog eating contest at Coney Island. It was badly written and cheesy, . and he stopped and said loudly over the microphone, ""Who wrote this . sh**?"" 'Something about that moment made me realize how glad I am that he is . my father. He’s not just your typical politician: He says what he . believes, no matter how it comes out. I willingly inherited that trait, . and one day I’ll share that story with my son.' 'This sucks': She made headlines in 2003 when she told an HBO documentary that: 'Having the last name Bloomberg sucks' Saying she and Argentinian boyfriend Ramiro Quintana have no plans to marry despite having a baby together, she added: 'Ramiro and I won’t be typical parents, but that doesn’t mean we’ll . be worse parents: I believe in love as much as the next person, and I . would love to be with one person for the rest of my life. But I don’t . need a marriage license and a party. 'I believe it takes more strength to do this than to go get engaged like everybody else.' Mr Bloomberg, 71, has indulged his daughter's passion for equestrian and paid for at least six horses, which she keeps on estates in North Salem, New York, and Wellington, Florida. The family also have a lavish property portfolio including neighboring waterfront homes in Bermuda for Miss Bloomberg. But their personal lives were thrown into the spotlight two years ago when Miss Bloomberg published her novel 'The A Circuit.' The book concerns Wall St billionaire Rick Aaronson, his two daughters and their family squabbles. His eldest daughter Camille went to an Ivy League colleague and wants to move into politics. His youngest daughter Tommi is an award-winning horse rider who refuses to do what her father tells her. 'She wasn't afraid to say no to her father,' Tommi says in the book. 'Even if half of Wall Street was.' By coincidence, Miss Bloomberg's sister Emma went to Princeton and now works with her father City Hall in New York. Another parallel is Miss Bloomberg's own interest in horses. Georgina is due to give birth on Christmas day with Mayor Bloomberg's first grandchild. But she has said she is not planning to marry her boyfriend Argentinian equestrian Ramiro Quintan anytime soon.","Georgina Bloomberg told documentary in 2003 'being a Bloomberg sucks'

"By . Louise Eccles and John Stevens . PUBLISHED: . 18:15 EST, 14 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:24 EST, 15 November 2013 . A man whose wife was diagnosed with terminal cancer two days ago made a dramatic public protest against bosses at a scandal-hit  hospital yesterday. Gary Brigden’s voice shook as he claimed that delays in treating his wife Lisa at Colchester Hospital may have condemned her to death. He stood up at a public meeting at  the hospital to lambast executives for  not tackling problems with cancer waiting times sooner. Inoperable stomach cancer: Lisa Brigden pictured with her granddaughter Lilie Mae in 2011 . Mr Brigden told how his 46-year-old wife had been diagnosed with inoperable stomach cancer the previous day, after a catalogue of delays and misdiagnosis. He said later: ‘I am going to lose my childhood sweetheart. I wanted to grow old with my wife.’ Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust was placed in special measures yesterday by the health sector regulator Monitor following a damning report by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). The CQC found the records of 22 cancer patients, out of a sample of 61, had been altered to disguise the ‘extensive’ delays for treatment, which in some cases could have put their lives at risk. Police are now looking into claims that staff were ‘pressured, bullied and harassed’ to alter the waiting times in a bid to meet national targets. During a heated meeting with Trust board members yesterday, angry relatives shared deeply personal stories about their loved ones who had passed away or were still fighting cancer, who they said had endured unacceptable delays in diagnosis or treatment. Mr Brigden said his wife had been . diagnosed with breast cancer in August 2008, after it was initially . dismissed by the hospital as ‘fatty tissue’. The grandmother of one was . successfully treated, but she began to feel unwell again last November . and – three months after her first consultation – was diagnosed with . secondary breast cancer. Construction . worker Mr Brigden, of Manningtree, Essex, said: ‘She had chemotherapy . and it seemed to be working, but then she started to get acid reflux. She kept saying I know something is not right, but there were delays in . their response and action was not taken. ‘We had to wait long periods between scans and appointments. ‘Yesterday . they finally confirmed she had stomach cancer. It is too late though, . it is terminal. The delays in her treatment may have cost Lisa her . life.’ Protest: Gary Brigden, Lisa's husband, said delays at Colchester Hospital have condemned her to death . He questioned why the Trust had failed fully to investigate claims that cancer waiting times were being altered when whistleblowers first alerted managers to the problem at the start of last year. He said: ‘I want to know if this affected Lisa. I want to know why didn’t they finish their inquiry into it in 2012. One or two people may have already lost their lives since then. They were playing with people’s lives by ignoring it.’ Yesterday . they finally confirmed she had stomach cancer. It is too late though, . it is terminal. The delays in her treatment may have cost Lisa her . life . Gary Brigden, Lisa's husband . Yesterday, the Trust’s chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts said it was ‘deeply regrettable’ that they did not act sooner. He added: ‘It did not seem to be as serious at the time as it was. That is a deep regret.’ Government standards state the first phase of cancer treatment should be completed within 62 days, but the CQC found some of the patients whose records had been changed had waited more than 100 days. One patient waited 126 days. Occupational health therapist Anna Barnes said yesterday that doctors ‘wrote off’ her sister and delayed her chemotherapy until it was too late. Care manager Irene Moules, 52, of Clacton-on-Sea, died from pancreatic cancer two months ago, leaving behind her husband, two children and year-old grandson Harry. Speaking after the meeting, Mrs Barnes said: ‘My sister had a very aggressive form of pancreatic cancer and when she was diagnosed she was told it was terminal. ‘She was offered chemotherapy to prolong her life. She just wanted to meet her second grandchild, and her daughter was expecting her first child. She is due in February. Investigation: Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation was placed in special measures yesterday after a damning report by the Care Quality Commission . ‘The delays were terrible. Several weeks would pass and you wouldn’t hear anything. She was given a date for a CT scan for five weeks away but I had to argue with them and tell them she didn’t have that long. ‘By the time she was about to have her chemotherapy, she was too weak and they never gave it to her. She felt they didn’t care. The doctors knew she was terminal so they didn’t want to bother with the chemo.’ She added: ‘I believe there is a great deal of emphasis on meeting targets at the cost of patient experience.’ A woman, who gave her name as Anna at the meeting, told hospital bosses how her 73-year-old grandmother has only weeks to live because of delays to her treatment. Delays: The CQC found some of the cancer patients whose records had been changed had waited more than 100 days for the first phase of their treatment . Her grandmother was diagnosed with soft tissue sarcoma in June and had been told she had a good prognosis if she received immediate radiotherapy. But Anna said it was delayed twice and when her grandmother finally started the radiotherapy, she was told the cancer had spread to her lungs and they could only give her palliative care. An independent review has now been launched. Dr Sally Irvine, chairman of the Trust board, said: ‘On behalf of the board, we deeply regret and apologise for the distress and concern that the contents of the CQC report have caused for patients and their families.’ Under special measures an improvement director will be appointed by Monitor to ensure the trust turns itself around.","Lisa Brigden, 46, was diagnosed with an inoperable stomach cancer .

Tyne Yates, 23, has been jailed for 18 months for theft, burglary, taking two vehicles without consent and driving while disqualified and without insurance . The granddaughter of a respected magistrate made sexual advances towards elderly men so she could pickpocket their wallets. Tyne Yates, 23, targeted vulnerable old men out walking alone and then distracted her victims by hugging or groping them. While manhandling them she would put her hand into their jacket pockets and steal their wallets and mobile phones before walking off. Yates, who has serious drug and drink problems, targeted the vulnerable old men as they walked on Blackpool Promenade. One 87-year-old widower, who was on a break in the seaside resort following the death of his wife, was a victim of her ‘Kiss Me Quick’ thefts. In a two-year campaign she is believed to have struck numerous times but many of her victims are thought to be too embarrassed to report it to police. Last night Yates was behind bars, starting an 18-month jail term after she admitted four charges of theft and a burglary. She also admitted taking two vehicles without their owners’ consent, driving while disqualified and driving without insurance. Preston Crown Court heard Yates shunned her middle-class background and went off the rails despite her grandparents being pillars of the community and leading political figures in the Lancashire town. Family: Yates grandmother Sylvia Taylor, pictured left, is a magistrate, Labour Councillor and a former town mayor while her grandfather Ivan Taylor, pictured right, is a prominent member of Blackpool Council and also a former town mayor . Her grandmother Sylvia Taylor, a . magistrate and Labour councillor, was a former mayor of the seaside . resort until she retired earlier in the year. Yates’s grandfather Ivan . Taylor, a company director, was also a former mayor of  the town, head . of education and social services and sits on the joint executive and . scrutiny panel for Blackpool Council. The . couple, both 74, who had adopted Yates’s mother Lisa as a child and . later set her up in her own home, were too upset to talk about the case . yesterday. When contacted about her granddaughter Mrs Taylor said: ‘I’m sorry but we don’t want to talk about it.’ But . one of their neighbours said: ‘It’s such a shame because they’re a . lovely couple who have given so much public service and done so much . good in Blackpool. They doted on this girl yet it seems she has just . thrown it all back in their faces.’ Yates’s descent into crime began when she was just 15 years old and began to play truant from her high school. Yates, who has serious drug and drink problems, targeted the vulnerable old men as they walked on Blackpool Promenade . Life of crime: Preston Crown Court heard Yates, pictured in 2009, had a comfortable middle class upbringing but turned to drugs and crime . In . 2005, her mother was hauled into court after her daughter went to . school on only four out of a possible 110 days over a four-month period. The . teenager had an average attendance rate of just 4 per cent and carried . on truanting despite repeated visits by education officials. As a result . her mother was ordered to complete community service for failing to . ensure Yates went to school. Her . mother died in 2007, at the age of 38. Her death led Yates further into . crime and in 2011 she was charged with stealing a wallet containing £80 . after hugging a 74-year-old man on the promenade. At the time the victim said she asked him for a cigarette then got hold of him by the hips, hugged him and asked him for sex. He . said ‘no’ and walked away but two witnesses believed a theft had taken . place and alerted police who arrested Yates and were able to return the . wallet to the victim. During . a subsequent police interview Yates said she needed to steal the money . because she had a serious drug and alcohol habit to feed. Pickpocket: Yates targeted men on Blackpool Promenade, distracting them with hugs and sexual advances so she could steal their wallets and belongings . Troubled teenager: Yates, pictured after her arrest, was a notorious truant at school and her mother Lisa had to complete community service for failing to make her daughter attend classes . She . was tagged and ordered to go into drug rehabilitation course but she . was arrested again after she drunkenly crashed a Ford Mondeo car while . chauffering a 71-year-old businessman from a football match. The . court heard that in May, Yates had approached a 17-year-old boy and . asked him if he ‘fancied a cuddle’ before stealing his mobile phone. Two . days later she approached a 73-year-old man waiting at a bus stop and . asked for sex in return for money, and began touching him over his . clothes. The pensioner said . he wasn’t interested but afterwards realised his wallet, containing £10 . cash, and his mobile phone had been stolen. Later .

In a land as riddled with fakes as China, it’s perhaps not surprising that a less-than-authentic Thor: The Dark World poster ended up in the foyer of a cinema there. Rather than showing the film’s hero, played by Chris Hemsworth, wrapping his muscly arm around Jane (Natalie Portman), it features Thor embracing his evil brother, Loki (Tom Hiddleston). The poster, while not genuine, inadvertently gave Marvel’s publicity campaign a huge boost, as it went viral. Brotherly love: The fan-boy poster, left, appeared in the foyer of a Chinese cinema. Pictured right is the real deal . Nat's amazing: Ms Portman poses for the cameras at the Dark World premiere in Hollywood on Monday at the El Capitan Theatre . It was posted to Reddit and quickly amassed hundreds of comments from amused internet users. Some approved of the effort that had gone into the image. Friendofabook said: ‘It's interesting how the fan made poster looks better than the real one.’ Hellmark agreed, commenting: ‘Is it just me or the poster they used look more natural than the actual poster?’ In the sequel to 2011’s smash-hit, Thor battles to save Earth and the Nine Realms from a shadowy enemy called Malekith, ruler of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim – and tries to get his intergalactic dating with Jane back on track. But Malekith has a super-weapon called the aether that stands in the way. Antony Hopkins, as Odin, describes it as ‘an ancient force of infinite destruction’ and Jane as something that can ‘tear apart the very fabric of reality’, so Thor certainly has his work cut out.

Charged: Gilbert Villanueva, 26, has been accused of stabbing his girlfriend and killing her mother last night . A 22-year-old single mother whose criminal ex-boyfriend allegedly stabbed her and killed her mom had dropped a restraining order against him just weeks before last night's brazen attack. Camden's Gilbert Villanueva, 26, was today charged with fatally stabbing Suzanne DuRocher, 50, and viciously wounding his former flame Kristen DuRocher in their Merchantville, New Jersey home. Villanueva allegedly broke into the women's house on the 100 block of Prospect Street about 10.30pm, and went up to Kristen's bedroom on the second floor. When Suzanne heard the confrontation, she  tried to make Villanueva leave and he stabbed her with a pocket-knife, according to CBS. Police said he then stabbed Kristen. Kristen’s young daughter was also in the house but was unharmed. She is not Villanueva's child. Kristen and Villanueva had reportedly once dated, but their one-year relationship was tumultuous. CBS reported Kristen had taken out a restraining order against Villanueva on October 27, but dropped it on October 31. Villanueva, a father of two, also reportedly had four prior arrests for weapons and terrorist threats, including three convictions. Victims: Villanueva is accused of wounding 22-year-old Kristen Du Rocher, left, and stabbing her mom, 50-year-old Suzanne DuRocher (right) to death last night . Last night, neighbor Andrew Kuppler told WPVI Kristen knocked on his door about 10.30pm and said she . needed help for her and her mother. 'She . looked like she was in shock. She had some obvious wounds to her arm,' Kuppler said. 'She just said she was attacked, she was stabbed, and that . she needed some help, so we called 911 and told the police what was . going on.' Suzanne, a mother of three, was rushed to Cooper University . Hospital where she died from her wounds, while Kristen Durocher was in a . stable condition. CBS reported investigators interviewed Villanueva’s sister who claimed she picked him up from behind a Dunkin’ Donuts on Marlton Pike. Police said he confessed to his sister that he stabbed the two women. Officers then found Villanueva after nurses at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden reported they were treating the man with suspicious 'knife wounds' on his hands about 11.30pm. Service provider: Suzanne DuRocher, 50, was an Associate Chief Nursing Officer of Operations at Temple University Hospital . Sketchy history: Kristen DuRocher, left, had taken out a restraining order against Gilbert Villanueva, right, on October 27, but had it dropped on October 31 . Courier-Post reported Kristen met Villanueva about a . year ago at a Brooklawn Taco Bell where they both worked.

Courier-Post also reported the murder suspect has another restraining order against him, which is still in place, that was filed by a woman in Burlington County in 2006. He has two children and another on the way. Scene: Gilbert Villanueva allegedly broke into the DuRocher's Merchantville, New Jersey home (pictured) before attacking the women .

Frederick Sanger, the ‘father of genomics’ and a two-time Nobel Prize winner, has died at the age of 95. The Gloucestershire-born biochemist is described as ‘one of the greatest scientists of any generation’. He pioneered methods to work out the exact sequence of the building blocks of DNA and was also at the forefront of work to uncover the structure of proteins. Frederick Sanger, the 'father of genomics' and a two-time Nobel Prize winner, has died at the age of 95 . Dr Sanger won his first Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1958 for work on determining the structure of insulin . He set out to determine the entire sequence of chained-together amino acid building blocks in a protein. This involved separating the different fragments of protein on filter paper and then moving them with an electrical current. The result was a distinct pattern on the paper, which Dr Sanger called a 'fingerprint'. The information about these fragments then had to be reconstructed in the correct order. Using . these methods, Dr Sanger revealed the entire sequence of the 51 amino . acids that make up insulin, and showed how they linked together. It was the first conclusive evidence that proteins are constructed from a defined molecular sequence. He was one of only four people to have won two Nobel prizes, the highest honours in science – and the only person to have won two Nobel prizes in chemistry. Frederick Sanger’s name was adopted by the world famous Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, where Human Genome Project scientists conducted much of the research leading to the first complete blueprint of the human genetic code. In 1958 Dr Sanger received the honour for his work on the structure of proteins. Then, in 1980, he shared half of the chemistry prize for his contribution to research on DNA sequencing.

Dr Sanger revealed the entire sequence of the 51 amino acids that make up insulin, and showed how they linked together . Sir Sanger pioneered methods to work out the exact sequence of the building blocks of DNA and was also at the forefront of work to uncover the structure of proteins . Dr Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said: ‘Fred can fairly be called the father of the genomic era: his work laid the foundations of humanity’s ability to read and understand the genetic code, which has revolutionised biology and is today contributing to transformative improvements in healthcare. Professor Colin Blakemore, former chief executive of the Medical Research Council, called Sir Sanger ‘a real hero of 20th century British science’. Dr Frederick Sanger was born on August 13, 1918, into a Quaker family in the village of Rendcombe, Gloucestershire. His father, also Frederick, was a local GP. He . was educated at Bryanston School in Blandford, Dorset and then St . John’s College, Cambridge, where he studied natural sciences. At . Cambridge, Dr Sanger became interested in the emerging field of . biochemistry, believing it could offer a way to understand and tackle . medical problems. Dr Sanger took his degree in 1939 just as the Second World War broke out, . but as a conscientious objector stayed on at the university for a . further year to take an advanced course in biochemistry. Earlier he had not shone as a student, taking three years to complete the first part of his degree, yet he obtained a First. From . 1940 on he conducted research at Cambridge University’s Department of . Biochemistry. In 1951 he was awarded the Corday-Morgan Medal and Prize . of the Chemical Society, in 1969 the Royal Medal of the Royal Society, . and in 1977 the Royal Society’s Copley Medal. He was honoured with the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award in . 1979, and the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1983. Dr Sanger became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1954. He was appointed CBE in 1963 and made a Companion of Honour in 1981, but turned down a knighthood. 'A . knighthood makes you different, doesn’t it, and I don’t want to be . different,' he was quoted as saying. However he accepted the Queen’s . special gift of the Order of Merit in 1986. Dr Sanger retired in 1985, after which he was said to have devoted much of his time to his garden.He . married his wife, Margaret Joan Howe, in 1940, who he said contributed . more to his work than anyone else by providing a peaceful, happy home. The couple had two sons and a daughter. ‘His invention of the two critical technical advances - for sequencing proteins and nucleic acids - opened up the fields of molecular biology, genetics and genomics,’ he said. Professor Blakemore added that Dr Sanger was a ‘disarmingly modest man’ who once said: ‘I was just a chap who messed about in his lab.’ Born in 1918 in Gloucestershire, Sir Sanger initially planned to follow his father into medicine, but instead pursued a career in biochemistry. Professor Sir Mike Stratton, director of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said: ‘His work for his second Prize, a method to decode DNA, has transformed our understanding of life on earth and is the foundation of developments in healthcare from understanding inherited disease to developing new cancer treatment.’ ‘It was an honour for this Institute when Fred acceded to founding director John Sulston’s request that we be named after him. Fred’s only stipulation was that “it had better be good”. ‘That typically Fred response is our inspiration and will continue to be so.’ Dr Sanger was a 'disarmingly modest man' who once said: 'I was just a chap who messed about in his lab'","Dr Sanger was the only person to have won two Nobel prizes in chemistry .

Former members of Rob Ford’s staff told Toronto Police that they saw him drink 20 ounces of vodka, snort cocaine, smoke weed, and take OxyContin while spending time with a suspected prostitute on St. Patrick's Day last year, according to reports released on Wednesday. The police documents were made public on the same day that Ford admitted to the Toronto City Council that he had bought illegal drugs. According to the documents, former Ford staffer, Issac Ransom, told police that, on the night of March 17, 2012, he saw Ford drink half of a 40 ounce bottle of vodka while hanging out with an escort and talking about how he was going to get laid.

According to the police documents, a waiter said he saw Ford and a woman with their heads down, trying to hide what they were doing, and then heard ‘two sniffs’. He was told by a Ford staffer not to tell anyone what he had seen - which he said confirmed for him that he had seen the mayor do coke, reports the Toronto Sun. According to the documents, there were four or five people in the private room including some women who didn't appear to be staffers. About an hour and a half later, the waiter heard that Ford went to the dance floor and pushed people out of the way.

The streets of Boston were filled with overexcited fans following the Red Sox World Series win but the police seem to have a handle on the situation. Seven people were arrested for unruly behavior and the Boston Police Department used their Twitter feed as a way to send a stern warning them: ‘don’t be number 8’. That edict was believed to be broken shortly after 1am with new reports that a mob of revelers overturned a parked vehicle, and the police later updated that count to include nine people before telling Twitter followers to '#GoHome #CelebrateResponsibly'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A car was overturned on Boylston Street more than an hour after the victory celebrations began . Crowd control: Thousands of fans filled the streets of Boston to celebrate the first home-game World Series win for the Red Sox since 1918 . Potential disaster: The crowds of people made it difficult for police to control the area but they were out in full force, lining the sidewalks in preparation . In spite of the low arrest count, spectators on the streets reported massive crowds of people who were starting to make mayhem but were eventually stopped by police who arrived at the last second. Boston Globe reporter Billy Baker was constantly updating his Twitter feed from Boylston Street and he describe the scene at the landmark spot of the Marathon finish line where two pressure cooker bombs went off killing three and injuring hundreds just months ago. ‘As far as I can see, mob scene on Boylston is over. Was tense, and took police a long while to make way to marathon finish, but it’s over,’ he wrote just after 1am. In the minutes immediately following the Red Sox’s blowout 6-1 finish against the St Louis Cardinals, there was little order and a sense of possible violence. Not messing around: Security has been higher in the city following the April bombing at the marathon finish line . Ready to roll: Groups of police officers were using bikes to get around the city so that it would be easier to get through the mobs than if they were in patrol cars . ‘We now have a definite mob at marathon finish line. Getting thicker by minute. Starting to feel unruly. Street blocked. No cops here,’ Baker wrote shortly after midnight. ‘Young guys really beating on cars now. Tender scene at marathon finish line has been taken over by bros with beers. Still no police.’ The crowds apparently did start back up, however, as two other local reporters both showed pictures of an overturned car on that same street and WFXT uploaded a video. Boston Globe reporter Martine Powers said that one person was arrested following the overturned vehicle, ‘but it was actually for a guy throwing bottles at police/crowds, others dispersed’. Different lineup: Local officials encouraged the die hard fans to 'celebrate responsibly' after the game . Revelry: Many of the crowds of people chanted the hometown slogan of 'Boston Strong' that has long been used for the baseball team but took on deeper meaning following the bombings in April . There were some other violent altercations further afield as campus police at the University of New Hampshire used pepper spray to break up a mob of unruly students who were celebrating after the landmark win. Boston police and local officials had a reason to be afraid of chaos as the city has seen violence break out following home team celebrations in the past. When the Red Sox last won the World Series in 2004 while out of town, a 21-year-old college student was killed after being shot by policeman with a pepper pellet. More recently, a 22-year-old died after being taken into custody by police during the Celtics NBA celebration. Happy night: The Red Sox beat the St Louis Cardinals in the sixth game of the series on Wednesday night . The police and Mayor Thomas Menino were careful to try to enforce the peace without taking the fun out of the celebration, as Wednesday’s win was the first time that the baseball team has won the league’s highest title in their beloved home stadium of Fenway Park since 1918. ‘Get the ducks ready, we’re having a parade! Please, be responsible and let’s celebrate! Thank you @RedSox. #bostonstrong,’ the outgoing Mayor tweeted. The police department tried launching their own hashtag- #CelebrateResponsibly- and encouraged fans to ‘engage in championship behavior off the field’.","Nine arrests were reported as thousands flooded the streets .

Social media users who declare support for charities may look good but they are less likely to hand over cash, according to a new report. The token activists who do not dig into their pockets to give financial support have been dubbed 'slacktivists' by researchers. 'Charities incorrectly assume that . connecting with people through social media always leads to more . meaningful support,' said Sauder PhD student Kirk Kristofferson, of the University of British Columbia's Sauder School of Business. Social media users who declare support for charities may look good but they are less likely to actually hand over cash, according to a new report. The more public the declaration, the less likely a person was to donate . 'Our research shows that if people are able to declare support for a charity publicly in social media it can actually make them less likely to donate to the cause later on.' Scientists say it is vital for charities to take note of the findings, which hint at a long-term loss of income . In a series of studies, researchers invited participants to engage in an initial act of free support for a cause - joining a Facebook group, accepting a poppy, pin or magnet or signing a petition. Participants were then asked to donate money or volunteer. They found that the more public the token show of endorsement, the less likely participants are to provide meaningful support later. If participants were provided with the chance to express token support more privately, such as confidentially signing a petition, they were more likely to give later. The researchers suggest this occurs because giving public endorsement satisfies the desire to look good to others, reducing the urgency to give later. Providing token support in private leads people to perceive their values are aligned with the cause without the payoff of having people witness it. With the holiday season being the biggest fundraising period of the year, the researchers say it is vital that charities take another look at their strategies and plan appropriately. The study features in the forthcoming Journal of Consumer Research.","Many charities believe that social media is an efficient way to boost income .

Ed Miliband sent potentially damaging emails to a party official plotting to smear opponents, Gordon Brown’s former spin doctor claims in an explosive new book. The allegation from Damian McBride is the latest to link the Labour leader to a toxic culture of spin inside government. The memoir suggests Mr Miliband might ‘have problems’ if his exchanges with Labour insider Derek Draper are revealed. The tell-all autobiography, serialised in the Mail, has sent shockwaves through the party ahead of its conference in Brighton. And it has prompted senior figures to question what Mr Miliband and Ed Balls knew of Mr McBride’s dirty tricks. Both were at the heart of Mr Brown’s political operation and worked closely with the spin doctor who used smears and clandestine briefings to destroy ministers including Charles Clarke and John Reid. Yesterday former Labour minister Tessa Jowell said she was sure Mr Miliband knew about the underhand tactics. And former No 10 spin doctor Lance Price said: ‘It’s pretty clear Ed Miliband must have known what was going on.’ Other revelations in today’s extracts from the book include: . Mr McBride was forced to resign in 2009 when it emerged he sent Mr Draper emails containing unfounded smears about Tory MPs for an anti-Conservative gossip website called Red Rag. The emails included fabricated slurs about the politicians’ health and private lives. Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries, one of those targeted, launched legal action over the ‘100 per cent untrue’ allegations. Mr Draper, a former adviser to Lord Mandelson, was then the party’s unofficial internet campaign chief. Secrets: The allegation has been made in an explosive book written by Gordon Brown's (centre) former chief spin doctor Damian McBride (left) He had started planning Red Rag with the help of Mr McBride. Labour-supporting journalists were contacted and asked to supply potential stories. Emails suggested ‘putting the fear of God’ into shadow chancellor George Osborne by spreading unfounded rumours about him, David Cameron and other Tory MPs. The book, Power Trip, does not suggest Mr Miliband was involved in the Red Rag project.Mr McBride recalls learning on a trip to South America with Mr Brown that his email exchanges with Mr Draper had been leaked. Suing: Nadine Dorries MP took legal action after false allegations were made against her . In extracts that will appear in full in the Mail next week, he tells of meeting Mr Draper on his return to the UK. He writes: ‘“But how could anyone have got into your emails?” I asked him. ‘“Oh God”, he sighed, “I’ve been extremely naive on my password. I’ve changed it now, but it was pretty obvious before”.’ Mr McBride asked Mr Draper: ‘What’s the worst anyone could have found if they’ve been in your emails?’ Mr Draper reeled off a list of ‘ministers I am in contact with who would have problems because of things they’ve written to me’. The names were: ‘Peter Mandelson – definitely, James Purnell – definitely and Ed Miliband – probably.’ Mr McBride warns Labour officials: ‘If somewhere sitting in a drawer, waiting to be deployed before the next election, are any damaging emails from Ed Miliband to Derek Draper, then I’d suggest this needs some attention.’ Friends of Mr Draper last night admitted he had been in regular email contact with Mr Miliband at the time and some of these exchanges could be potentially embarrassing. But one friend said: ‘At no stage did Derek ever receive or send emails to Ed Miliband regarding Red Rag or anything related to it, and therefore it is impossible that such emails could ever emerge in the future.’ Mr McBride’s book also alleges that, later, Mr Miliband’s inner circle was behind ‘anonymous and aggressive’ attacks on Mr Balls, the shadow chancellor and former Labour leadership contender. It says Mr Miliband ‘clearly inherited all the ruthless genes in that family’ and determined to stand against his brother David in the battle to succeed Mr Brown – and further his Marxist father’s legacy. Headlines: From yesterday's Mail . What did he know: Question marks have been raised over what Ed Balls knew about what Gordon Brown's chief spin doctor was up to . Dame Tessa said extracts from the book about the ‘malign and awful’ briefings against senior Labour figures were ‘truly shocking’ she was concerned that the ‘awful, evil influence of people like Damian McBride’ would overshadow Labour’s achievements. The leading Blairite added: ‘I don’t think it’s damaging for Ed Miliband. I’m sure he knew that this was going on. He was actually away a lot of the time.’ Mr Price, who was Alastair Campbell’s deputy in Downing Street, said: ‘It’s pretty clear Ed Miliband must have known what was going on. ‘They were part of the same operation to get Gordon Brown in place of Tony Blair as prime minister. Angry: David Cameron sent Gordon Brown a furious Christmas card after he was accused of using his children as props . Derek Draper was Lord Mandelson's (left) adviser. Some of Draper's exchanges with Mr McBride are included in the book which Dame Tessa Jowell (right) described as malign and awful . ‘The question for today’s politics is whether or not Ed Miliband can convince the British public that he has moved on from this style of politics.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘Ed Miliband was not involved in any plan to smear or spread lies about opponents.  Any suggestion he was is totally untrue. 'He has no recollection about any emails setting up this website or any similar attempt to smear opponents.’ A source added: ‘He told Gordon Brown in September 2008 he was concerned about Damian’s activities and disapproved of them.’ Mr Draper declined to comment. Victim: Charles Clarke was destroyed by McBride's brazen tactics in 2005 . Damian McBride’s memoir, Power Trip, is the most eagerly awaited political book of the year and is being serialised by the Daily Mail. The first instalment of our series – published yesterday – began the extraordinary story of how the former Cambridge graduate used the political dark arts as Gordon Brown’s chief spin doctor to destroy his boss’s internal enemies at both the Treasury and at No 10. In what is being described as the frankest account of New Labour’s toxic culture of smears, Mr McBride says he routinely discredited opponents by tipping off newspapers about ‘drug use, spousal abuse, alcoholism and extramarital affairs’. Mr McBride also admits logging in to Mr Brown’s office email and leaking details of restricted or confidential documents with the consistent aim, he writes, to ‘protect Gordon Brown’. He said: ‘Everything I did as Gordon’s spin doctor, I did out of devotion, out of loyalty and out of some degree of love for the greatest man I ever met.’ Mr McBride’s brazen tactics helped destroy ex-Home Secretary Charles Clarke. In 2005, when Mr Clarke was a threat to Mr Brown’s hopes of succeeding Tony Blair, Mr McBride manufactured an apparent briefing war between him and Blair’s anti-social behaviour ‘czar’ Louise Casey. Newspapers were duped into thinking the pair were bitter rivals – a clash that contributed to Mr Blair sacking Mr Clarke in 2006. Mr Brown’s most implacable opponent, John Reid, quit the same Cabinet post after details were leaked of his alleged ‘drinking, fighting and carousing’. One story published at the time included lurid claims of ‘drink-fuelled indecent proposals’. Lord Reid was alleged to have asked Brown ally Dawn Primarolo, now deputy Speaker of the Commons, to go to bed with him during a parliamentary trip to Berlin in the late 1980s and later told her at a Commons bar: ‘I want sex with you.’ Another minister, Ivan Lewis – still a Labour frontbencher – found claims that he pestered a female aide leaked to punish him for criticising Mr Brown’s tax policies. Mr McBride admits ‘all sense of right and wrong disappeared out of my head’ but claims he was never reprimanded by Gordon Brown. Smears: John Reid quit as home secretary over allegations . Proposition: John Reid is alleged to have asked Dawn Primarolo, pictured, to go to bed with him . ‘There was something unspoken between us ...the unspoken word was from me to him, and said, “Don’t question my methods”,’ he said. The book also exposes Mr Brown’s relationship with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls, who now run Labour. Mr Brown was said to have privately thrown his weight behind Mr Miliband, rather than his closest ally Mr Balls, during the 2010 Labour leadership contest. Mr Brown allegedly told Mr McBride to stop Mr Balls striking a deal with David Miliband to prevent his brother Ed winning. And in revelations that could fuel tensions between the two Eds, he says the current Labour leader gave ‘anonymous and aggressive briefings against Ed Balls’ – now his shadow chancellor. Ed Miliband, the son of Marxist academic Ralph Miliband, is also said to have knifed his older brother and ran for the leadership in order to ‘achieve his father’s vision and ensure David Miliband did not traduce it’.","The allegations were made by Gordon Brown's spin doctor Damian McBride .

Liverpool brothel in 2004, following a series of stories about Rooney's 'suggested . use of prostitutes', the jury was told. The mother-of-seven said in a statement she was worried about the Manchester United striker's future when he visited a second time, and urged him to flee. Court statement: Massage parlour receptionist . Patricia Tierney, 58, told the Old Bailey in a statement she pulled Wayne Rooney into a room and . told him to leave the brothel when he visited in 2004, pictured right at the time . ‘This incident, which is not true, was alleging I had a sexual encounter with Wayne Rooney and that he paid me for sex on a particular night when I was working at a massage parlour,' she said. 'I do recall Wayne Rooney visiting with a number of other males. Several days later he came on his own. 'This . time I pushed him into a room and told him to pull his hat down and get . out before he was destroyed and his career was over.'

A computer download named 'Project Patricia Tierney' was also discovered. 'I believe this is in relation to the . incident at the massage parlour', Ms Tierney said, adding: 'I was offered . £30,000 for the story but I refused.' The phone hacker's notebooks also contained information with details relating to Rooney's mother, the court heard. At . a later date he made a note of the mobile phone details of a Harrods . beautician called Laura Rooney. Last week it emerged that she was targeted solely because they mistakenly believed she was related to Manchester United and England forward. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the jury: ‘Laura Rooney was phone hacked because they thought she was related to Wayne Rooney, who was also phone hacked. ‘She wasn’t, she was not related to Wayne Rooney and has nothing to do with him. ‘She is a hairdresser who does not know Wayne Rooney but found herself being investigated just in case she did.’ Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire; ex-spin doctor Andy Coulson, also 45, from Charing in Kent; former NotW head of news Ian Edmondson, 44, from Raynes Park, south west London; and the tabloid's ex-managing editor Stuart Kuttner, 73, from Woodford Green, Essex, are all on trial accused of conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3 2000 and August 9 2006.

A teenager who considered killing herself because online bullies made her life hell has shared her story in the hope it will help other victims. Amy Louise Paul, from Peterborough, features in a new video for counselling service Childline who helped her through her ordeal. She said: 'When I was 13 I had a disagreement with one of my friends at school and I thought it was all sorted. Then one of my other friends said ""she's made a Facebook group about you for all the people who wish I was dead already.""' Amy Louise aged 13 with her mother, Lisa: They have both praised Childline for their support after she was a victim of online bullies . She added: 'The website was shared and sent out to people to join the group and as far as I'm aware many people did.' People joined the Facebook group and left cruel comments about the teenager. Amy Louise said the impact of the bullying affected her happiness and wellbeing. 'Before the cyber-bullying started I was happy but afterwards I didn't want to talk to anyone or be around anyone and I even cut myself off from my family, she said. Online abuse: The teenager felt suicidal after a hate group was set up to taunt her on Facebook . 'I . used to love school and was always excited to be going in to learn new . things but I started to dread going. And I couldn't just leave it at . school because it followed me home. I'd go on the computer and I'd be . worried that someone would say something about it while I was online. It invaded everywhere.' She said it became so upsetting, it made her question her will to live and she even contemplated suicide. She . recalls: 'I was very upset, words can't describe how upset I was. I . thought everything had been taken away from me and I didn't know what to . do. 'It made me so I . didn't want to wake up in the morning. I didn't want to go to school or . see anybody and it made wanting to carry on living very difficult. At . one point I did want to take my own life.' When . Amy Louise's mother, Lisa, 45, a shop manager, found out about the hate . group set up to target her daughter she was furious but felt helpless . about what could be done. Moved on: The student is smiling again now the Facebook group has been taken down and she got the help she needed to overcome her ordeal . In a previous interview with the Daily Mail said said: 'The first I heard about the hate group was when I collected Amy Louise . after school; she was crying uncontrollably and told me what happened. 'I was absolutely furious that the school knew and had . not called to tell me what was happening. Then I discovered they had not . punished the girl responsible. I had frequent meetings with . them but they weren't interested, they didn't take it seriously and I . think the problem is some governors don't even understand what a . computer is, let alone cyber-bullying.' She added: 'The police came 24 hours after I reported what was happening but then never got back to us. 'People sweep it under the carpet but they are playing with children's lives. My daughter was in such a terrible state.' The bully was made to take the Facebook group down by their headteacher but Amy Louise continued to feel the impact on her confidence and because 'people were still talking about it'. It was Childline who eventually helped her after she reached out to them via their website. Lisa said: 'The only people who've been really useful are ChildLine - they have been brilliant and gave us lots of good advice.' No escape: Age 13, left, Amy Louise felt she had no way to get away from the online bullies but now she's happier, right, age 17 and urging other victims to seek help . Some adults who grew up in a world where there were no mobile phones or social network websites may struggle to comprehend the scale and impact of cyber-bullying. But NSPCC statistics reveal that 38 per cent of young people have been affected by it. A third have received abusive emails and 24 per cent have received abusive text messages. It can lead to depression and anxiety, and in some tragic cases, teenagers have taken their own lives because they have felt unable to cope. The NSPCC offer advice on their website to children and parents on how to deal with cyberbullying including tips on online safely and privacy settings. Amy Louise urges anyone suffering from cyber-bullying to seek help, either by confiding in their parents or teachers or in Childline like she did. 'Quite simply if I hadn't spoken to Childline I doubt I would still be here today,' she admits. Now Amy-Louise has finally been able to move on from her ordeal and has even drawn some positives from it. She said: 'It was a horrible experience but from it I . learnt that I can be strong and not let people get to me. The . experience made me strive to push myself and I'm off to college now to . study law, politics and English. I also joined the Air Cadets and play . in their band at an international level.'","Amy Louise Paul was victim of online bullying .

On leave: Steubenville High School Superintenent Michael McVey was placed on leave after new charges in relations to the rape of a girl, 16 . The superintendent and two other employees at Steubenville High School have been placed on leave after they were charged in relation to the rape of a 16-year-old girl by two high school football players, school officials said. The Steubenville school board did not address the allegations against the employees and referred all questions to the state attorney general, who is leading the investigation. The employees were placed on leave at an emergency board meeting on Monday in Ohio and a former superintendent is set to run the district temporarily, the board said in a statement. In March, promising high school football stars Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were found guilty of raping the teenage girl in a series of back to back house parties in 2012. Mays was sentenced to a minimum of one year in juvenile detention for the two counts on which he was convicted: raped and possession and distribution of pornographic material involving a minor. Richmond was charged only on the count of rape and sentenced to a minimum of one year. Both face a maximum of detention until the age of 21 and have to register as sex offenders thereafter – a punishment against which Richmond has since appealed. The school board said yesterday: 'Our primary focus is on making sure the School District is able to conduct the business of educating our students.' A grand jury on Monday charged superintendent Mike McVey with felony for tampering with evidence and obstruction of justice and three others with lying or failing to report possible child abuse after an investigation prompted by the rape of the West Virginia girl following an alcohol-fuelled party in August 2012. Football team strength coach Seth Fluharty, volunteer football coach Matthew Belardine and elementary school principal Lynnett Gorman were also charged on Monday. Belardine was charged with allowing underage drinking, obstructing official business and making a false statement while Fluharty and Gorman were charged with failure to report child abuse. Trial by social media: The messages over . Twitter, Instagram and text that were exchanged on the night of the rape . and the following day were central to the case - and to the outrage it . has caused . nationwide . All four are due in court on December 6. McVey, Fluharty and Gorman were placed on leave. Belardine is not a school employee. The . investigation included crimes committed in connection with the case . against two members of the celebrated Steubenville High School football . team as well as a separate alleged rape that happened in April 2012, . four months before the assault that drew nationwide attention over . demands that prosecutors should have charged more players. McVey's . charges include felony counts of obstructing justice and tampering with . evidence and a misdemeanor charge alleging he made a false statement in . April 2012. Efforts to contact him on Monday and Tuesday have not been . answered. Belardine, . whose house authorities said was the scene of the underage drinking . party that preceded the rape last summer, faces several misdemeanor . charges, including making a false statement and contributing to underage . alcohol consumption. Board's ruling: The four employees were placed on leave after an emergency board meeting at the school (pictured) and a former superintendent is set to lead the district temporarily . Charges: Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announces indictments against four additional people in relation to the 2012 rape of a high school student . Defense . attorneys Brian Duncan and Adam Nemann, who previously represented one . of the football players, said in a statement that the charges against .

Prime Minister David Cameron said he had been assured by Spain that there would be no repeat of the opening of diplomatic bags . David Cameron today condemned Spain’s ‘extremely serious’ act of opening a diplomatic bag as Tory MPs called for warships to be sent to Gibraltar. Spanish officials were compared to Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe yesterday after they violated international law by opening the British diplomatic bag at the border with Gibraltar. The Prime Minister said it was a ‘breach of the principle of state immunity’ and vowed to stand up for British sovereignty. The search of the bag is the latest incident in a growing diplomatic stand-off between Britain and Spain over the future of the Rock. It is not known what was in the bag or why police wanted to search it, something that has not happened since a diplomatic bag was opened in Zimbabwe 13 years ago. Mr Cameron said last Friday’s incident, in which Guardia Civil officers stopped a courier travelling from the Rock into Spain, must not be repeated. He was challenged by Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former UN commander in Bosnia, to set out ‘further measures, political - and indeed any other measures - we can take towards Spain to stop this harassment of our people in Gibraltar’. Mr Cameron told the House of Commons: ‘First of all, you are right to raise this because it is a breach of the principle of state immunity and the principles underlying the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations. It is an extremely serious action that took place. ‘We asked the Spanish authorities to investigate urgently and they have done that. We have now received an explanation from the Spanish. ‘We are reassured that this will not happen again but let me be absolutely clear - we will always stand up for the rights of people in Gibraltar and the sovereignty of Gibraltar.’ Scroll down for video . MPs in the Commons lined up to urge the government to take a tougher stance with Spain, including sending home its ambassador and order British warships into the region . Later Europe minister David Lidington was called to make an urgent statement to MPs on the breach. He revealed that two bags had been opened by Spanish officials - despite being clearly marked as containing official UK correspondence and communications - in breach of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the principle of state immunity. Mr Lidington told MPs that Spanish officials had explained away the latest incident by claiming it was the result of a mistake at a ‘junior operational level’ and insisted Britain's approach was working. MPs lined up to urge the government to take a tougher stance with Spain. Motorists queuing at the border crossing between Spain and Gibraltar in September. The Foreign Office has demanded an explanation after a British diplomatic bag was opened and searched by Spanish Guardia Civil officers on the border with Gibraltar . Tory MP Bob Neill urged ministers to . ‘redouble your efforts to explain through our Nato allies that the . behaviour of the current Spanish government, which is frankly stooping . to the levels of Franco's, is not that of a Nato ally and is not . acceptable’. He added: ‘Will you perhaps consider reinforcing the naval deployments available to us in Gibraltar?’ Tory . MP Peter Bone said he backed Royal Navy ships making a ‘goodwill visit’ to the UK overseas territory, adding ‘preferably a couple of gunboats’. Fellow . Conservative Sir Edward Leigh questioned which warships are in the . region and insisted the best way to preserve peace was by the strength . of the Royal Navy. He said: ‘What Royal Navy warships are . in place at the moment in the waters around Gibraltar and don't these . provocations give a lie to those who complacently have argued for years . now that the Royal Navy was not important? The best preservation of . peace is the strength of the Royal Navy.’ Mr . Lidington replied: ‘I think that no-one in this Government has ever . decried the importance of the Royal Navy and you would not, I'm sure, . expect me to comment on ship deployments.’ Tensions . have risen since July after Gibraltar dropped concrete blocks in its . waters to create what it said was an artificial reef to encourage sea . life to flourish in a marine reserve . Others suggested the Spanish ambassador should be ejected from London. Veteran Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman said: ‘If this alleged error by a jobsworth was the only act of interference and aggression by the Spanish authorities on the frontier with Gibraltar it might just get by. ‘But this is a whole succession of harassment after harassment after harassment and it will not do. The softly, softly approach of this Government is simply not working.’ He said that ‘if anything like this ever happens again, the Spanish ambassador should be expelled from this country’. Conservative Andrew Rosindell also questioned whether the ambassador should be expelled immediately. Former Liberal Democrat leader Sir Menzies Campbell said: ‘We are entitled to press the Spanish government further as to what the protocol is and what is the understanding of those who have the responsibility for these matters at the border.’","Prime Minister insists Spain has promised not to open other bags .

Owner Paul Wood, 48, from Stoke-on-Trent, said the shop was 'totally trashed'. He said: 'I came into the shop in the morning and I couldn’t believe my eyes. I was in shock. 'There was a hole in the wall of my office which had been chiselled away and clearly was how he got in. 'It . would have been a tight squeeze - only enough room for someone quite . small. I thought at first they must have sent a child in. 'The . shop was totally trashed, with glass and bricks everywhere. I couldn’t . understand it because I have good security - bars on the window and CCTV . in every room.' Eagles had spent the hours before the raid chipping away at the external wall, which was accessible by an alley way and had created the hole as a way to sneak into the jewellers. He stole £10,000 of gold jewellery, porcelain and pottery from the jewellers and caused significant damage during the break in. Police later found some of the stolen . pottery displayed on the mantlepiece at the house of Eagles’ heroin . addict girlfriend, Victoria Walters. Eagles chiselled away at the wall of the jewellers to create this hole which he then used to steal the gold and pottery . Eagles spent the hours before the raid chipping away at the external wall . Mr Wood said: 'I was in shock for days after the raid. 'He had stolen cash from the office, jewellery, figurines, and smashed open a safe in the back room. 'Watching the CCTV footage back, I saw him go up to the cameras and turn them all away. He didn’t try to break them though or steal the hard drive so I handed it over to the police straight away. 'I’m glad they have both been jailed, but they will be out before I know it and I fear they will come after me again. 'It has cost me thousands of pounds to repair the damage, and although I did get some of the items back, the psychological impact has been the worst. 'One of my staff left shortly afterwards, . which may have been for the best. I would rather if they come back that . none of my staff have to suffer.' Owner Paul Wood has said he has been left in fear following the burglary in June . Eagles chipped away at the wall so he was then able to enter the shop from this alleyway . Mr Wood said he has now been left in fear . after the burglary, which happened in June. He said it has taken him . four months to return the shop back to normal. Eagles was jailed for two years at Stoke-on-Trent Crown court after admitting the burglary. Judge Paul Glenn, said: 'The property was stolen in a professionally-executed shop burglary committed by Christopher Eagles. The police then recovered items of high value, almost the entire haul from the burglary.' Jailing Walters for 12 months for handling stolen goods, the judge said: 'You and Eagles plainly planned to make a significant amount of money had you not been caught with the property.'","Christopher Eagles spent hours before raid chipping away at jewellers' wall .

A block of luxury seaside penthouses have been lying empty since February following a legal row over a six-inch strip of land. Developers of the £1m flats have been locked in a long-running legal battle with the owners of a 'ransom strip' which runs between the newly-built flats and a neighbouring block. But now the developers of the Nirvana apartments, in the Leas, Westcliff, Essex, which were completed earlier this year but have still not gone on the market, have said the matter is 'about to be resolved'. The luxury seaside Nirvana apartments were completed earlier this year but are still not on the market following a legal row over a six-inch strip of land . Owners of the ransom strip have said residents of the flats would not be able to use the underground car park because they would have to drive over the disputed land . The 45 apartments were approved by Southend Council in 2007 and the development was finished earlier this year but they are still not on the market . The owners of the ransom strip have previously said residents of the flats would not be able to use the underground car park because they would have to drive over the disputed land. Mike Gray, managing director of Dedman Gray, the marketing agent for the site, indicated a resolution was close. He said: 'The strip of land did stall the marketing during the summer months and this matter quite clearly is about to be resolved. 'Taking into consideration the December and Christmas market is soon upon us, the relaunch and full marketing of these apartments will now be set up for the middle of January in the New Year.' Lucy Courtenay, secretary of the local Chalkwell Ward Residents’ Association, said: 'The view was that it’s not the most attractive of buildings but having built it, it’s a great shame it’s still standing empty.' Jane Hendry, also a member of the association, said: 'We’ve been trying to find out the situation from our councillors, but there seems to be little information available.' Ransom strips, commonly used between developments, are lodged with the Land Registry and prevent any extension or encroachment by a neighbouring property .

The artist and percussionist has so many possessions that she has been unable to get into her bedroom since moving in five years ago and sleeps in a chair instead. The 64-year-old blames her mass of belongings on a love of second-hand clothes – but her landlord thinks her huge collection is a fire risk and she faces eviction today from her one-bedroom flat in Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex. Her effects, which also include books, ornaments, TVs, clocks and bric-a-brac, are piled high in the lounge, kitchen and even the toilet. The collection has grown so big because she enjoys supporting charity shops and cannot bring herself to consign anything to the dustbin.

A sobbing mother recounted for California jurors Thursday the final horror-filled moments before her husband and elder daughter were murdered in their home at the hands of an acquaintance six years ago. Leela Dhanak broke down on the stand as she talked about still hearing her spouse’s screams of terror in her sleep years later. Under cross-examination, Mrs Dhanak told the Orange County courtroom that she was attacked when she came home in May 2007 and fell unconscious. Alleged killer: Leela Dhanak testified how Iftekhar Murtaza, seen in this August photo, murdered her husband and elder daughter in a failed attempt to win over her younger daughter . The woman woke up from a coma three weeks later to discover the family’s Anaheim Hills mansion had been burned, and her husband, 56-year-old Jaypraykash Dhanak, and elder daughter, Karishma Dhanak, 20, killed. Last month, a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak was alive when  her throat was slit and her body was doused with gasoline and set on fire. Autopsy results showed Jayprakash Dhanak suffered 29 stab wounds to his body. He also had his skull fractured, resulting in a fatal brain injury, according to Orange County Register. The man was dead by the time his was set alight, according to the medical examiner's testimony. His wife, Leela Dhanak, was stabbed in the stomach and had her throat slashed, but she survived after police found her lying unconscious on her neighbor’s lawn. ‘I do hear him screaming, crying. In my sleep I do hear,’ Dhanak testified during the trial of her younger daughter's ex-boyfriend Iftekhar Murtaza on charges of carrying out the fatal attack. Inferno: This is all that was left of the Dhanka family's mansion in Anaheim Hills, California, which was burned down after becoming the scene of a double homicide . Bloodbath: Autopsy showed Jayprakash Dhanak (left) suffered 29 stab wounds to his body, while a pathologist testified that Karishma Dhanak (right) was alive when her throat was slit and her body was set alight . Delusional: Prosecutors said urtaza was hoping that after the attack, his ex-girlfriend would see him as a ¿white knight¿ and come back to him . She then lost her composure, reached for a tissue, and the court took an early recess for lunch. Dhanak's testimony Thursday came in the trial of now 29-year-old Murtaza, who prosecutors say carried out the attack on the family in an ill-conceived plot to reunite with his then-college freshman girlfriend Shayona Dhanak. Prosecutors said that Murtaza was hoping that after the attack, his ex-girlfriend would see him as a ‘white knight’ and come back to him. Shayona blamed their breakup on differences between her Hindu family and his Muslim faith. Murtaza is charged with two counts of murder with special circumstances of burglary and kidnapping, attempted murder and conspiracy. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. Two of Murtaza's friends have been convicted in the killings and one of them has been sentenced to life in prison. Orange County Superior Court Judge Thomas M. Goethals on Thursday reprimanded Murtaza for speaking out during Dhanak's testimony and warned he might be removed from the courtroom if it happened again. Murtaza had refuted Dhanak's account, yelling out ‘that’s not what happened!’ while she testified about how he and another man grabbed her and slit her throat, said prosecutor Howard Gundy. Dhanak later conceded her memory of exactly what happened during the attack has varied since the incident. The widow told the court her younger daughter had dated Murtaza but told her she didn't have deep feelings for him. Ball and chain: In 2011, Murtaza (left) tied the knot with fellow suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti (right), 20, in a jailhouse ceremony where the newlyweds were separated by a chain-link fence . As a mother, she said she wished her daughter had dated someone of Indian heritage, like her family, but above all wanted her to concentrate on her studies at University of California at Irvine. Dhanak said she didn't particularly like Murtaza, but had her daughter truly loved him, she would have supported the young couple. ‘She was too young to fall in love with any guys,’ she told the court. In June 2011, Murtaza married 20-year-old suspected murderer Marissa Star Bilotti in a jailhouse ceremony after exchanging letters for five months..","Iftekhar Murtaza, 29, is on trial in California in connection to 2007 fiery attack on the Dhanak family .

Under pressure: Higher oestrogen levels helped women multitask under pressure, according to PhD student Alexandra Ycaza (file photo) Taking Hormone Replacement Therapy could help prevent older women from suffering embarrassing ‘senior moments’. Levels of the hormone oestrogen plummet around the menopause, but a study suggests that replacing it helps keep the mind sharp when under pressure. Women with high levels of oestrogen did as well on a memory test when stressed out as when relaxed, but others were forgetful when pressurised. The U.S. study tested 42 post-menopausal women, half of whom had been taking HRT for about five years, on their working memory. This is the type of memory we use to hold one thing in mind while doing something else – for instance, remembering a phone number while asking someone for a pen and paper. To put the body under stress, the women held their hands in a bucket of icy water for three minutes. They then did a test of working memory in which they had to remember lists of words while reading sentences and checking them for grammatical errors. The test was also done in more relaxed circumstances, in which the bucket was filled with pleasantly warm water. Women with low levels of oestrogen did much worse on the memory test when their hands were cold. However, those with high levels of the hormone didn’t falter, the Society for Neuroscience’s annual conference heard. Saliva samples showed that levels of the stress hormone cortisol shot up in the women with low oestrogen – but only rose slightly in those with large amounts of the sex hormone. Researcher Alexandra Ycaza said her findings suggest oestrogen helps protect the brain from the effects of stress. The fall in oestrogen that occurs with age means that older women lose this ‘built-in protection’. HRT tablets. The study was carried out on 42 post-menopausal women, half of which were taking HRT . Miss Ycaza, a PhD student: ‘If you are taking oestrogen after menopause, you may have some kind of protection from the effects of stress on memory. ‘It may be as simple as higher oestrogen reduces the amount of cortisol released and so there is less of the stress hormone around to affect memory processing.’ She stressed that health concerns surrounding HRT mean any women considering starting it should discuss the issue carefully with their doctor. The drug is very effective at easing the symptoms of menopause and can cut the odds of brittle bones and bowel cancer, according to the NHS. It warns that HRT slightly increases the risk of stroke, breast cancer and ovarian cancer and cancer of the lining of the womb but says that if taken for under five years, most experts agree that the benefits outweigh the risks. Miss Ycaza added that controlling stress may have benefits beyond improved memory. ‘Stress, whether at home or at work, can have negative effects on the body and brain, hurting and killing brain cells and producing problems with mood, memory and sleep,' she said. ‘Women who are going through the menopause or post-menopause are still working and raising families and these are stressful daily life events. ‘Discovering factors that might protect people from stress could have huge impacts on how people perform in their daily lives from work, to relationships at home.’","Hormone Replacement Therapy boosts oestrogen levels in the over-50s .

Furious: Newly released documents show that Iain Duncan Smith accused the BBC of promoting Labour's views by calling a key welfare reform a 'bedroom tax' Iain Duncan Smith accused the BBC of promoting Labour’s views by calling a key welfare reform a ‘bedroom tax’, newly released documents show. In a furious letter, the Work and Pensions Secretary said the corporation was misleading viewers and the phrase was ‘innately political and indeed factually wrong’. Documents released under Freedom of Information legislation show Government officials have complained repeatedly about BBC coverage. Former immigration minister Damian Green wrote to bosses saying its reports were ‘inconsistent and unacceptable’. There is growing pressure on the corporation from Tories angered by its perceived bias. On Sunday, party chairman Grant Shapps said it could lose its exclusive right to licence fees in the 2016 charter review. Mr Duncan Smith wrote to Fran Unsworth, then acting head of news, on March 7 to complain about use of the term ‘bedroom tax’ in reports on his housing benefit reforms, which cut handouts to working-age claimants in social housing with more bedrooms than they needed. Accusing the BBC of a ‘public disservice’, he said: ‘It is not a tax and it is wrong to describe it in this way. ‘A tax, as the Oxford English Dictionary makes clear, is a “compulsory contribution to state revenue, levied by the  government on workers’ income and business profits, or added to the cost of some goods, services and transactions”. What this policy does is reduce some social housing tenants’ benefits if their home has one or more spare bedrooms. This cannot in any way be described as a tax.’ He added: ‘What should not happen, is for the BBC to adopt the language of the Labour Party without making it clear that the phrase is innately political and indeed, factually wrong. We do not believe it is the job of the BBC to use misleading terms and promote the views of the Labour Party.’ On September 3 last year, Mr Green – now police minister – said the BBC did not report immigration data accurately. He said it was ‘mystifying’ that a 36,000 drop in migration was described as ‘a slight drop’. Criticism: Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps, left, has said the BBC could lose its exclusive right to licence fees, while former immigration minister Damian Green, right, said its reports were 'inconsistent' The minister added he was ‘very unhappy’ with a Radio 5 Live show in which he was asked to debate with a representative of the National Union of Students. He said: ‘Immigration is a  sensitive and serious topic. It deserves to be treated as such.’ On Sunday, Mr Shapps criticised a report by BBC home editor Mark Easton on a Brussels study of migrants’ benefits and said the BBC could see its licence fee cut unless it addresses accusations of bias and a culture of secrecy and waste. A BBC spokesman said it ‘aims to provide clear, impartial and balanced coverage’, and added: ‘Inevitably there will be disagreements about the reporting of any given political story, however we are satisfied that on the whole our coverage is fair, accurate  and impartial.’","Iain Duncan Smith said in letter that BBC was misleading viewers .

Ed Miliband's most senior adviser, Lord Stewart Wood, says a future Labour government should swing sharply to the Left . Ed Miliband’s most senior adviser says a future Labour government should swing sharply to the Left, overturning many of the economic reforms brought in by Margaret Thatcher. In a hard-hitting speech to a conference sponsored by the Unite trade union, Lord Stewart Wood launched a fierce attack on privatisation, the cutting of business regulation, tax cuts for higher earners and the Coalition’s austerity programme. He called for a ‘high-wage, high-skills’ economy and worker representation on company boards. Lord Wood strongly hinted that a Labour government would return to tax, borrow and spend policies, rejecting the charge that record high public spending and borrowing under the previous government had been in any way responsible for the crash. ‘The Conservatives are wrong about so many things,’ he said. ‘They are wrong about the nature of the crisis in 2008. Their view was that it was a crisis of overspending. This is simply untrue.’ Lord Wood, who is in the shadow cabinet and advises Mr Miliband on strategy, said the next Labour government would usher in a new economic settlement. ‘What is the settlement I have in mind? A supply-side revolution,’ he said. ‘Like the idea of the Thatcher years but a Left supply-side revolution is what we need.’ He said that Tory liberal economic policies would not keep Britain out of recession in the long term. ‘They are as wrong about that as they were about the policies of the 1980s and the origins of the crash,’ he said. In his speech to the Centre for Labour and Social Studies (Class), a new trade union think-tank, he admitted that the previous government had presided over a full-scale ‘depression’ rather than a recession. ‘I mean what looks like a depression in retrospect on government revenues and the increase in government spending,’ he said. Lord Wood, who served as an economic adviser to Gordon Brown before being ennobled by Mr Miliband, also conceded that ‘inequality rocketed to shameful levels’ under Labour and then effectively condemned his party’s record on education. He said that ‘poor people are leaving school without any kind of skills’. Lord Wood said Labour should overturn many economic reforms brought in by Margaret Thatcher when he launched an attack on privatisation and tax cuts for higher earners . In a further admission, he said Labour had not done enough to create jobs. ‘We need to renew our focus on work. We went silent on work for too long over the past 20 years,’ he said. He said that getting people into work should be a cornerstone of policy on the welfare state but it was ‘also about pay’. ‘We have to look at strengthening the minimum wage, supporting the Living Wage, and finding ways to promote that,’ he said. Lord Wood’s speech was given a rapturous reception. Steve Hart, a former political director of Unite, said it signalled the biggest change in Labour thinking since the 1945 Atlee government introduced the welfare state. The peer’s refusal to concede that the previous Labour government spent and borrowed too much is echoed by Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor. Yet only last week even Tony Blair admitted that Labour should have started cutting spending as early as 2005. Lord Wood who served as an economic adviser to Gordon Brown before he was ennobled by Labour leader Ed Miliband . Lord Wood, a politics tutor at Magdalene College, Oxford, was the keynote speaker at the first conference of Class, which was set up last year by the unions. The think-tank is based at the London headquarters of Unite, which is Labour’s most generous benefactor, having given almost £9million since the election. The union is at the centre of the row over vote rigging in Falkirk. Len McCluskey, its militant general secretary, told the conference of 500 delegates they had nothing to be ashamed of after the Daily Mail’s revelations about the union’s bullying leverage tactics.‘Ugly trade unionism is effective trade unionism,’ he said. Tory MP Damian Hinds described Lord Wood’s comments as ‘a nightmare vision of Labour’s secret plans’. ‘Labour still want more spending, more borrowing and more debt – exactly what got us into a mess in the first place,’ he said. ‘It shows hard-pressed people would be crushed by higher taxes if Labour win in 2015.’","Lord Stewart Wood launches a fierce attack on privatisation .

Unions were due to meet defence chiefs today to discuss the future amid speculation more than 1,000 jobs may be axed. BAE is expected to announce the cuts as early as tomorrow. The future of the yards has been in question for months amid fears there will be no new work once two aircraft carriers are completed. Livelihoods: Workers at the BAE Systems shipyard in Govan, Glasgow. As many as 1,000 jobs may be lost at three of the company's UK shipyards amid fears there will be no new work once two aircraft carriers are finished . Some of the jobs set to be lost at the Portsmouth, Govan and Scotstoun shipyards may be offset by a contract to build a new Royal Navy carrier, the Type 26 Global Combat Ship. But BAE Systems has yet to announce which of its UK bases will carry out the work. The Govan and Scotstoun yards in Scotland are politically sensitive ahead of next year’s referendum on Scottish independence. A BAE spokeswoman said: ‘We continue to work closely with the Ministry of Defence to explore all possible options to determine how best to sustain the capability to deliver complex warships in the UK in the future. ‘This work is ongoing and we are committed to keeping our employees and trade unions informed as it progresses.’ Scotland’s Finance Secretary John Swinney said: ‘We have been in dialogue for some time with BAE Systems on the issues surrounding the future of the Clyde shipyards. ‘We are awaiting the outcome of BAE’s discussions with the Ministry of Defence and are very alert to the situation concerning both yards. ‘We are seeking urgent clarity on the future for both Govan and Scotstoun.’ What's next? A computer-generated image of the Type 26 Global Combat Ship that could keep work going . Hugh Scullion, Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions general secretary said: ‘We have secured talks with senior BAE systems executives early next week to examine the business case of the forthcoming announcement. ‘Now is not the time for idle speculation or indeed party political point scoring, this is the future of an industry and we need to know from the company and the government directly what their plans for the future of UK shipbuilding are. ‘The shipbuilding workforce throughout the UK are working flat out to deliver the aircraft carriers for the defence of the UK and they need to know what lies in store for them, their families and their communities.’ A GMB union spokesman added: ‘Full time union officials and shop stewards will meet BAE next week to go over the detailed business case on how work will be organised once the carrier programme winds down.’ BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago. Vernon Coaker MP, Labour’s shadow defence secretary, said: ‘There will be huge anxiety amongst the highly skilled workforce, their families and the communities they live in. ‘This has significant consequences for the future of shipbuilding in the UK and has implications for the future defence of our country.’","Axe likely to fall at Portsmouth, Govan and Scotstoun shipyards .

A dying eight-year-old boy's last wish to meet his idol Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been left unfulfilled after the footballer was 'too busy to meet him'. Leukaemia sufferer Hajrudin Kamenjas, who doctors say has a month to live, travelled to Paris from his home in Bosnia to see the footballer after his parents arranged a meeting through Paris Saint Germain. Parents Amela and Mustafa had already been told Ibrahimovic could not travel to Hajrudin's home in Vares because of Champion's League commitments. Eight-year-old Hajrudin Kamenjas's dying wish to meet his football idol has been left unfulfilled despite his family saying they had arranged a meeting through his club Paris Saint Germain . The little boy's mother is devastated she could not fulfill her dying son's wish to meet Ibrahimovic . But when the family moved Hajrudin and all his medical equipment to France they were again told the Swedish footballer could not meet the dying boy, even though they were at the stadium. Ibrahimovic suffered a knee injury on November 1 when Hajrudin had tickets for the match. However, the family claim they were told the football star would be available the following day. Friends of the family and the German charity Light For Tomorrow helped pay for and organise the trip so Hajrudin's final wish could be fulfilled. Mrs Kamenjas, 35, said: 'We knew it would be next . to impossible that he came here but we did ask, and were politely told . that it wasn't possible. 'But then local people gathered round and asked . us if they could help send him to France where he plays for club Paris . Saint Germain.' The family say they were told by the club that it would be possible for him to meet Ibrahimovic if he was in Paris. But they claim once they arrived in the French capital, problems began to emerge. The couple say various promises were not kept and eventually Hajrudin turned up to watch a game in which his idol was . not present because he was injured. The Paris Saint-Germain footballer has since sent Hajrudin a signed shirt and a video message . They say the schoolboy was told repeatedly the following day that Ibrahimovic would see him soon, he was forced to return home to Bosnia before a meeting could take place. Mrs Kamenjas said: 'I did not succeed in giving my son his last wish, and that hurts.' Trip organiser Thea Rekic, who runs the charity and travelled to Paris with the family, claims they were told repeatedly a meeting would happen but were constantly let down. She said: 'We thought we could meet him, but . despite contact with PSG and huge effort on our part, we did not . succeed, and needed to tell Hajrudin a lie that Zlatan was ill and in a . hospital.' She said the story could have been a 'fairytale' but does not have a 'happy end'. Hajrudin has had a bone marrow transplant in his fight against cancer and has been treated by top doctors in Germany. However, they have said there is nothing more that can be done for Hajrudin and have given him a month to live. Before the failed attempt to meet Ibrahimovic in Paris, the footballer had sent Hajrudin a message and signed shirt as he could not travel to Bosnia to meet him. In a video he said: 'Hello Hajrudin, I am Zlatan. Since I heard of you, I thought a lot about you. 'I am sorry I can’t come, but I have a present for you. I have signed my autograph on a jersey and I want you to know that I think a lot about you. 'I will also give this jersey I wore yesterday when I scored two goals.' Ibrahimovic, who has a Bosnian father, earns a reported 14million euros a year after tax, believed to be a record in French football. His 20million euro move to PSG from AC Milan made him the most expensive footballer in combined transfer fees.

His Republican opponent Joe Lhota agreed and said he’s . supported such a revision of the public school schedule throughout his . candidacy. Scroll down for video . 'Different faiths coming together': NYC mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio spoke to Muslim Americans in Brooklyn Wednesday, where he said he supports two new school holidays for religious observance . ‘We're not going to lose the school days,’ Lhota said . Wednesday. ‘We'll have to extend the school days by . those two days. But nonetheless those who are Muslim will be allowed to have . that day off to celebrate their holidays.’ 'Those who are Muslim will be allowed to have that day off': de Blasio's Republican rival Joe Lhota said Wednesday that he's supported Muslim holidays in NYC schools throughout his campaign . Both candidates support days off for New York City’s nearly . 150,000 Muslim public school students on the two most holy days of the Muslim . calendar, Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. ‘The origins of this nation, people of many different . faiths coming together,’ said de Blasio. ‘That's why we have to respect Muslim . faiths by providing the Eid school holidays for children in our school system.’ De Blasio pointed out that, like Hanukkah or Easter, these . Muslim fall on different days each year, which can force students to choose . between education and faith. ‘A child who has an exam on a day that right now is one of . the Eid holidays, they're either respecting their religious obligation or . they're doing what their education requires of them. They can't do both under . our current system,’ de Blasio said Wednesday at an event in Brooklyn for . Muslim Americans. In 2006, an Eid holiday fell on a day of required state-wide . tests. Arguments for and against the instatement of Muslim school . holidays have been echoing around New York City for years, but three-term Mayor . Michael Bloomberg has continued to oppose them. ‘Everybody would like to be recognized, but the truth of the . matter is we need more school days, not less,’ the mayor said in 2009. Unfair? While both Jewish and Christian students see their holy days observed with days off from school, the city's nearly 150,000 Muslim students get none of their holidays off from school . Two more holidays would bring the number of days off per . year for New York City students to 15. Currently, none of those days are for Muslim holidays, . though around 13 percent of public school children in the city are believed to . practice Islam. State law requires all schools be open for 183 total days, . but does not stipulate which days specifically. The issue is one on which the two starkly different . candidates can actually agree. At a televised debate Tuesday, they disagreed on issues . ranging from tax hikes to public safety to their baseball allegiances, each . presenting themselves as the most qualified choice to lead a city preparing to . take its first steps beyond the 12-year reign of Mayor Michael Bloomberg. New Yorkers will cast their vote and despite between the two starkly different candidates November 5.

Tony Blair took his earning power to astonishing new heights yesterday when he pocketed £150,000 for just an hour’s work. The former Prime Minister, who is said to have amassed a £50 million fortune since leaving office, was paid the staggering sum for conducting two 30-minute events in Dubai. His fee for talking about global affairs in the fabulously wealthy Gulf state worked out at £2,602 per minute. His work as a Middle East ‘peace envoy’ is unpaid but his latest trip to the region was as guest of honour of Arabian Business magazine, which is presided over by its chairman, journalist and BBC broadcaster Andrew Neil. Mr Blair, who was accompanied by his wife Cherie, gave a 30-minute speech on Monday on global and economic affairs to 600 of the Gulf region’s key business leaders at the newly-opened JW Marriott Marquis hotel in Dubai, the world’s tallest hotel. His appearance was arranged to mark the magazine’s business achievement awards. That was followed yesterday by another 30-minute engagement on stage with Mr Neil at the annual Arabian Business forum, also in the JW Marriott. A source said he was being paid a $250,000 fee - equal to £156,124. In addition, a source said his team of eight was being put up in the finest Dubai hotels and entertained with no expense spared by their Middle Eastern hosts. Mr Blair was offered accommodation in the £7,140-a-night penthouse suite of the JW Marriott but demanded to be moved, according to sources. The hotel has already won accolades as a feat of engineering while its restaurants and bars have garnered regional awards. The penthouse suite features two bedrooms and a dedicated butler to cater to any whim but the offer was not taken up. No expenses spared: The Blairs are said to have been offered accommodation at a £7,000-a-night hotel . Luxury: A source said the entourage of eight have been put up in luxury Dubai hotels including JW Marriott . A source said: ‘He felt it was too . accessible to the public, who could get to it using the common area . lifts. He wanted something away from any public access for security . reasons.’ He is now staying at another luxury hotel nearby. A spokesman for Mr Blair last night refused to comment on his fee and denied he had asked to be moved for security reasons. Host: The event is run by political broadcaster Andrew Neil who presents BBC's Daily Politics . The spokesman said: ‘He does not have an “eight-strong entourage” - he is travelling with his wife and one member of staff and his usual security team. ‘Where he is staying has nothing to do with security - he’s not at the Marriott because he’s staying with Mrs Blair, who is doing an event for her foundation in a different hotel. We don’t comment on fees.’ In his speech yesterday, Mr Blair told the audience he first visited Dubai in 1976 as a young lawyer when there was ‘nothing but sand and a few buildings. There was sand everywhere.’ He pledged his support for Dubai’s bid to host the World Expo in 2020, adding: ‘What has driven the changes here is imaginative leadership determined to open this city out to the world. ‘What’s been created here is something powerful.’ The business forum usually attracts Arab royalty. In previous years, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, and King Abdullah II of Jordan have attended. In September, it emerged Mr Blair had been using a £30million private jet to travel around the world in his role as a public speaker and business consultant. As Prime Minister, he was refused a presidential-style jet because it was too expensive but he now seems to be paying for his own private £7,000-an-hour plane, which comes complete with stateroom, lounge, kitchen and bed. He has been seen regularly stepping out of the Bombardier Global Express, using it to travel to Thailand, Sardinia and the US.","Peace envoy work is unpaid but this was for an Arabian Business magazine .

Kennedy — from the ill-fated presidential limousine, to the grave site eternal flame, to the historic Air Force One plane where Lyndon B. Johnson took the oath of office — are now available for public viewing, 50 years after his death. In some cases, officials had to scramble to make that happen. Aboard the plane, now in a hangar at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, visitors squeeze down a narrow walkway to stand where people packed into its sweltering state room to watch Johnson, Kennedy's vice president, sworn in, with Jacqueline Kennedy alongside in the suit stained by her husband's blood. 'It's getting hotter and hotter, people are crammed in, emotions are getting higher and higher,' explained Jeff Underwood, historian of the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, reflecting the famous images from the plane. Jeff Underwood, historian for the National Museum of the US Air Force, stands in the area of President John F. Kennedy's Air Force One that was where Lyndon Johnson took the oath of office after Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The museum is in Dayton, Ohio . In this Nov. 22, 1963 file photo, Lyndon B. Johnson is sworn in as President of the United States of America in the cabin of the presidential plane as Mrs. Jacqueline Kennedy stands at his side in Dallas, Tex. The historic aircraft is on display at the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. This is the area of President John F. Kennedy's Air Force One that Jacqueline Kennedy would have sat with the casket after Kennedy's assassination in 1963 . As on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, it wasn't clear in the first hours after the shooting what was unfolding, he said. Johnson wanted to show the nation that a constitutional transfer of power had been made, and Mrs. Kennedy insisted upon being there, Underwood said. Visitors can also see the saw cuts in a rear wall hastily made by Air Force crew members who didn't want the late president's coffin carried in the cargo hold. They removed two rows of seats for the coffin, which Mrs. Kennedy sat across from on the flight back to Washington. Experiencing history in a personal way by being where it happened goes beyond reading it, Underwood said Friday during a news media tour. 'Sometimes I see the looks on the faces (of visitors), and it all comes back to me,' said Underwood, a fourth-grader in 1963. 'The story is so visceral.' Lonna McKinley, of the National Museum of the US Air Force, looks through the log for President John F. Kennedy's Air Force One at the museum in Dayton, Ohio. The blanket at center was used by President Kennedy on the plane, and the blanket at left was used by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy . A page from the log for President John F. Kennedy's Air Force One on the days surrounding his assassination in 1963 . The federal spending reductions of the sequester had in May halted shuttle bus trips from the museum to the hangar, but museum officials decided to resume the tours on a trimmed schedule with the anniversary approaching. The Boeing jet — built specially in 1962 for presidential use — was retired by the Air Force in 1998, having flown eight presidents, starting with Kennedy. Among the other items that were part of the events of late November 1963 on display around the county: . - The limousine the Kennedy's were riding in when the president was fatally shot in Dallas is at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. - The flag that draped the president's coffin and the saddle, sword and boots from the ""riderless horse"" in his funeral procession are among the artifacts being exhibited for the first time starting Nov. 22 at the Kennedy Library in Boston.

They are among assassination-related items and documents kept by the National Archives and Records Administration.

Cleveland Police, said society was becoming 'quite intolerant of young . people' in public spaces . A top police officer has called for more tolerance of antisocial yobs because much of their boisterous behaviour is just part of ‘growing up’. Jacqui Cheer, the chief constable of Cleveland Police, said society was becoming ‘quite intolerant of young people’ in public spaces. She said detectives had to decide whether annoying or noisy behaviour in a small group merited police action that could ‘antagonise’ teenagers. And she warned that new legislation against yobs could lead to childhood behaviour that was tolerated in previous generations being criminalised. Under Home Secretary Theresa May’s new antisocial behaviour bill children as young as ten can receive injunctions for ‘causing nuisance’, and older children can be jailed for breaching such injunctions. The chief constable, who speaks for police chiefs on children and young people, said: ‘What’s antisocial to one person is just what I did and what many young people do. ‘We’ve closed down a lot of places that people are allowed to go to. 'We’ve fenced off school grounds, I get it, but where do people collect? When you’re in a crowd of three or four it can get a bit noisy, is that antisocial? 'When you’re walking down a street and might be having a bit of a laugh and joke, is that antisocial?’ Jacqui Cheer was speaking to the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children which is conducting an inquiry into the relationship between children and the police. She added: ‘I’m not saying that we will tolerate behaviour that is harassing, that is making people feel fearful, that is preventing other young people from going out because they don’t want to walk down that street or through that park. ‘That is our job. We are here to protect everybody. But we need to be careful where the line is. 'I think we are too ready as a society - as the police and particularly with some legislation coming up on the books - to label what looks like . . . growing up to me as antisocial behaviour.' 'We've closed down a lot of places people . are allowed to go to': Ms Cheer spoke to the All-Party . Parliamentary Group for Children which is conducting an inquiry into the . relationship between children and the police (file photo) The police recorded 2.3million incidents of anti-social behaviour in 2012-13, down from 3.7million on a year earlier. However HM Inspector of Constabulary . has warned that there is wide variation in the way different forces . treat offences, with some recording crimes wrongly as anti-social . behaviour while others over-report minor incidents. Campaigners have warned that the Government's Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill will criminalise more youngsters. The ASBO introduced by Labour will be replaced, with a much lower test to prove anti-social bejhavour. Offenders will only have to commit conduct 'capable of causing nuisance and annoyance' rather than being likely to cause 'harassment, alarm or distress'. Hilary Emery, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, predicted that the antisocial behaviour bill would have perverse and harmful consequences. She said: ‘We are concerned that children and teenagers will get into trouble with the law just for being annoying, and that it will penalise them from doing things that all children do as part of growing up – playing in the street, kicking a ball around in a public space or hanging around with their friends. ‘It threatens to further increase the divide between generations, alienate children and divert the police from fighting genuine crimes.’ Home Office ministers say new ‘streamlined and flexible’ measures are needed to replace antisocial behaviour orders, more than half of which are breached at least once. Other measures have proved ineffective or inadequate.","Cleveland chief Jacqui Cheer warns of intolerance towards youths .

They say that lightning never strikes twice, but one Michigan man has achieved it in the form of two lottery wins within two years. Officials say Barrytown man Joseph Palmarchuk, 66, won a $1.35 million lottery jackpot Wednesday in Michigan's Classic Lotto 47 game. Two years ago, Palmarchuk has also won a $1 million lottery game in Tennessee. Two in a million: Joe Palmarchuk and his wife Phillis with their latest lottery win . The retiree and his wife Phillis moved to Mecosta County, north of Grand Rapids, in 2011 from Tennessee to be close to family. Six months later he received a call from Tennessee informing him he had won $1 million in a second-chance lottery draw. 'I moved to be close to family so they could help take care of me,' Palmarchuk said in 2011. 'Now I can help take care of them!' Palmarchuk has seven children, 23 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. This latest win earned him the jackpot of the Classic Lotto 47. He says he likes to buy lottery tickets that retailers put aside as mistakes and believes his wins are the result of karma. Palmarchuk predicts another win in the next year, although not another million. 'I play the lottery numerous times everyday,' Palmarchuk told 9 and 19 News. 'I've learned that it works... You can't win if you don't got a ticket.' In it to win it: Palmarchuk plays the lottery several times every day .

Cameras are to be allowed into court for the first time from today, ending a 90-year ban. The decision to allow filming of the closing stages of cases at the Court of Appeal has been hailed as a ‘landmark moment for justice and journalism’. Ministers rejected fears it would lead to ‘Americanising’ of the justice system, where trials of the likes of OJ Simpson to Michael Jackson have become treated as entertainment. In focus: Cameras have been positioned around the Royal Courts of Justice to broadcast live pictures from selected court cases from tomorrow . Hidden: Remote-controlled cameras tucked away on bookcases will capture the summing up and sentencing of selected cases . It will be the first time that cameras have been allowed in courts other than the Supreme Court since filming was banned by the Criminal Justice Act 1925. Lawyers' arguments and judges' summing up, decision and - in criminal cases - sentencing remarks may be filmed. However victims, witnesses and defendants will not be captured on camera and proceedings will only be shown from one courtroom per day. Small, remote-controlled cameras will be operated by the court video journalist Matt Nichols, who has both legal and journalistic qualifications. While the footage can be used by news and current affairs programmes but it cannot feature in adverts or on comedy shows like Have I Got News For You. The filming could be extended, with ministers now considering allow cameras to capture sentencing remarks in Crown Courts, with victims, witnesses, offenders and jurors still protected. Limits: Court video journalist Matt Nicholls will operate the cameras and ensure that no witnesses are seen on screen . From Judge Judy to Judge John Deed, from OJ Simpson to Michael Jackson, a host of pop-culture personas have been cited when airing anxieties over filming in court. A fear of ‘Americanising’ the justice system has been frequently raised by critics of allowing cameras in court, particularly in the wake of the trials of OJ Simpson and Dr Conrad Murray in the US and Amanda Knox in Italy. The Simpson murder trial in LA, where the former professional American football player was accused of killing his wife and a friend, was one of the first major cases to catch the public's attention. Footage of Simpson's lawyer, Johnnie Cochran, standing in front of the jury holding a glove saying ‘If it doesn't fit, you must acquit’ has gone down in courtroom history. Simpson was acquitted in 1995. Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, who enjoyed a lengthy career in broadcasting before joining Parliament, said: ‘This is not about transparency or democracy, it is about television showbusiness and we do not need our law courts to be turned into yet another reality TV show.’ The decision to open up courts to the TV media comes after years of campaigning by broadcasters BBC, ITN, Press Association and Sky News. James Harding, BBC director of news and current affairs, said: ‘This is a landmark moment for justice and journalism. It is a significant step on the way to helping millions of viewers gain a greater understanding of how our judicial system works.’ Judges hope the move will allow the public to better understand what actually happens in court. The most senior judge in England and Wales, Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas, said: ‘‘This will help a wider audience to understand and see for themselves how the Court of Appeal goes about its work.’ There are a number of safeguards in place to protect the administration of justice, ensure no disruption to proceedings and protect witnesses and victims. Some cases will be broadcast live with a 70-second delay to allow the removal of anything that contravenes broadcasting regulations or standard court reporting restrictions - such as contempt of court laws and court orders. In addition, appeals against conviction which might result in a re-trial will only be shown once the case is decided, and and the judge can order no filming or broadcasting if it is in the interests of justice. ITN chief executive John Hardie said: ‘Filming in courts has been a long time coming and is for the benefit of open justice and democracy. Never before will television viewers have had such an insight to justice being seen to be done.’ Head of Sky News John Ryley said: ‘Seeing justice being done will no longer be restricted to those members of the public who have the opportunity and time to go to court. ‘We anticipate that the next step should be to allow the filming of sentencing remarks in criminal trials, which the coalition Government envisaged when it first announced the lifting of the camera ban two years ago.’ Almost all the proceedings of the Supreme Court have been filmed since it opened in 2009 and are sometimes broadcast on major TV and radio news networks. And broadcasters in Scotland have been allowed to apply to film in court since 1992, but only with the consent of all parties. Screen: The cameras will be monitored from the floor of the court, as seen here in Court Four at the Royal Courts of Justice in London . A pilot took place in the Court of Appeal in the Royal Courts of Justice in 2005, in which cameras were allowed to film in the court. Footage from the pilot study was not broadcast. Courts minister Shailesh Vara said: ‘This is a landmark moment that will give the public the opportunity to see and hear the decisions of judges in their own words. ‘It is another significant step towards achieving our aim of having an open and transparent justice system. ‘We are clear that justice must be seen to be done and people will now have the opportunity to see that process with their own eyes. It will also help further the public's understanding of the often-complex process of criminal and civil proceedings.’ Captured: One of the most famous snatched pictures from an English court was taken of Dr Hawley Crippen with Ethel Le Neve, his alleged accomplice, during their trial for murder in 1910 . The ban on bringing cameras into court - including video cameras - dates back to 1925. But even before this date, taking pictures was not supported by the court and photographers were supposed to seek permission. One of the most famous ‘snatched’ pictures from a courtroom was taken of the notorious Dr Crippen and his mistress Ethel Le Neve in 1910 as he stood trial for the murder of his wife. While publishing photos from courtrooms was debated in the House of Commons and broadly opposed by politicians, it was not until 1925 that legislation was brought in banning photos and sketches. A small passage in the Criminal Justice Act 1925, which mainly dealt with the system of probation, said: ‘No person shall (a) take or attempt to take in any court any photograph, or with a view to publication make or attempt to make in any court any portrait or sketch, of any person, being a judge of the court or a juror or a witness in or a party to any proceedings before the court, whether civil or criminal; or (b) publish any photograph, portrait or sketch taken or made in contravention of the foregoing provisions of this section or any reproduction thereof.’ More recently, individuals who have taken photographs in court have been dealt with under contempt of court laws rather than under the 1925 Act. A 19-year-old man who took pictures inside Luton Crown Court on his mobile phone was jailed for two months in 2011, while a Frenchman was held behind bars for two hours after taking a picture during Julian Assange's appearance at the High Court. Since it opened in 2009, almost all the proceedings of the Supreme Court are filmed and are sometimes broadcast on major TV and radio news networks. Even under the latest changes there is no chance of a Dr Crippen style shot - only judges' remarks will be shown - not those of victims, witnesses, offenders or jurors.","Filming to be permitted in court for the first time since 1925 .

The court heard Corrupt detective Daniel Withnell was 'living in a realm of fantasy' A corrupt detective who tried to frame an innocent man, water down criminal charges against a drugs suspect and even falsely claim a hit man was out to kill him has been jailed for four years. Det Con Daniel Withnell, 30, was arrested after he offered to plant a shotgun and drugs on the ex-partner of a high class escort in exchange for £19,000. He turned to corruption after his life 'spiralled out of control' due to a failed business and living well beyond his means. He made friends with gangland villains in the hope they could help him pay off his massive debts. During one incident Withnell illegally accessed a police database to alter the charge sheet of a suspected drugs baron who had been arrested on suspicion of a £495,000 drugs and money laundering racket. Posing as a prosecution lawyer the crooked constable - based at Salford, Greater Manchester - sent ‘advice’ suggesting the investigation against his friend should be shelved or made subject of lesser allegations. His scam unravelled after he met with 48-year-old escort Claire Smethurst who wanted to set up her ex-lover Leroy Thomas after a stormy break-up. Withnell suggested planting drugs and a shotgun in Mr Thomas’ car after Smethurst text him saying ‘the f****er needs sorting out’. She gave him £19,000 in cash but got cold feet the following day and called the plan off - before reporting Withnell to police during a meeting at a Manchester hotel. He was arrested and suspended from Greater Manchester Police on October 22 last year but then sent an anonymous text to another officer posing as an informer and warning a hitman was out to kill Withnell. Smethurst received a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for her part in the plot after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice . Believing the text was a real threat to his life - police deployed 20 officers, three sergeants and two armed response unit vehicles to find the fictional gunman. But after further investigations it emerged Withnell had sent the texts himself as part of a plan to an 'engineering a sense of duress for the ongoing investigations.' Withnell, from Bolton, whose father was also a police officer pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice. The court heard he was 'living in a realm of fantasy' when he intimated he could use his position and contacts within the police force to get his acquaintance off the drugs supply charge. He has since quit the force. Passing sentence Judge Michael Henshell told his offences represented a 'gross breach of trust.' The judge told Withnell: 'At the time you had 12 years of service and some of that time was as a detective and I am sure for most of that time you would have been an effective police officer who gave reason for your family to be proud of you - especially your father. Claire Smethurst paid Withenll to frame her ex-boyfriend on a trumped up charge. She gave him £19,000 in cash but got cold feet the following day and called the plan off - before reporting him to police . 'Your personal life was out of control. You made extremely unwise relationships for a police officer. 'The fact you were crippled by debt meant that when you saw the opportunity of obtaining a large sum of money you did. 'The scandalous nature of that case is perhaps misleading as I am satisfied that there really never was any intention of planting the shotgun and you didn’t have any corrupt colleagues and anything you said to her was little more than sales patter from nothing more than a corrupt sales person. 'This is a man who has squandered a successful future'Judge Michael Henshell on Withnell . 'You are entirely the author of your own fortune. Whatever your personal circumstances were, the means you used to relieve yourself of the burden was entirely wrong and criminal.' In mitigation, defence lawyer Mr Alex Leach said: 'He was crippled by debt as a result of repeated financial failure in business. 'It prevented him from being able to provide fully to the children of which he is a father. 'His father described his son as becoming vacant, withdrawn and illogical. It’s obvious the defendant was much changed. 'By the time he came to offer to commit the offence with Claire Smethurst he was overwhelmed by circumstance. 'It’s to his credit he never acted on any of the foolish ideas proposed. It was all fantasy. Withnell, from Bolton, whose father was also a police officer pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to two counts of misconduct in a public office and perverting the course of justice . 'He had 12 years of service and in his earlier career he did not begin his service motivated by greed or dishonesty rather than altruism and serving the public where he worked hard and well. 'This is a man who has squandered a successful future and who will live with the consequences long after custody has expired.' After the case Assistant Chief Constable Dawn Copley of Greater Manchester said: 'The conduct of former DC Daniel Withnell fell well short of what is expected of a police officer. 'Police officers, staff and the communities of Greater Manchester would be appalled by his actions, which detract from the hard work that our officers and staff do on a daily basis. 'GMP expects the very highest standards of all its officers and staff. They should be honest and act with integrity and should not compromise or abuse their position. Smethurst received a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, for her part in the plot after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice last month. Smethurst, of Westhoughton, Bolton, was sentenced to 15 months imprisonment in prison suspended for two years after she was found guilty of perverting the course of justice at an earlier hearing.","Det Con Daniel Withnell, 30, was arrested after he offered to plant a shotgun and drugs on the ex-partner of a high class escort in exchange for £19,000 .

Children as young as 12 are being given nicotine patches as part of a national bid to help them quit smoking. Health advisers are being sent into schools to conduct ‘Support to Stop Smoking’ sessions with the schoolchildren. The children - between the ages of 12 and 17 - are then offered vouchers which can be used to 'buy' nicotine replacement products such as lozenges and patches at pharmacies. The legal age to buy cigarettes is 18. Children as young as 12 are being given nicotine patches as part of a national bid to help them quit smoking . NHS guidelines say children as young as 12 can access nicotine patches from chemists and GPs throughout the country, but that it is at the discretion of individual primary care trusts which services they offer. The project is already underway at schools in North Somerset. Nailsea School holds quit smoking sessions on Tuesdays, which are led by the school’s first aider, who has undergone the smoke free training. Becky Pollard, director of public health at NHS North Somerset, which took over responsibility for public health in April, said: 'We are delighted that the school is committed to providing this valuable service. 'Young people can become addicted to tobacco very easily, and this can affect their ability to concentrate, as well as leading to them to smoke on site and can result in smoking-related exclusions. NHS guidelines say children as young as 12 can access nicotine patches from chemists and GPs . 'Smokefree North Somerset works closely with schools providing programmes that prevent the uptake of smoking in young people and supporting schools to support young people who smoke. 'The service is based on behavioural support and Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) which is available for young people aged 12 and over as recommended in the NICE guidance. 'NRT is usually via patches and lozenges as gum is not acceptable in schools.' The service, which is being run by the council’s Smoke Free North Somerset team, has been offered to all secondary schools and academies across the district. So far Nailsea School, Gordano School in Portishead and Hans Price Academy in Weston-super-Mare have signed up. As well as the nicotine therapy, students work with advisors to learn about the health dangers of smoking. Statistics by charity Cancer Research show an estimated 545 young people start smoking in North Somerset each year. Councillor Reyna Knight, North Somerset Council assistant executive member for public health, said: 'If we can intervene early and stop children from developing a smoking habit it will prevent problems in the long term, not only for their health but also for the NHS. 'Also if children are in class and craving a cigarette, they will not be concentrating on the work they are supposed to be doing.'","Advisers are being sent into schools for ‘Support to Stop Smoking’ sessions .

Too many social workers view parents, drug addicts and alcoholics as ‘victims’ who are powerless to turn round their own lives, Michael Gove warned today. The Education Secretary said his own life was ‘transformed’ by good social workers, who took him into their care before he was adopted. In an emotional speech today he said the best social workers deserve to be viewed on a par with doctors, barristers and teachers, but he will warn that the training of social workers needs major reform. Tough message: Michael Gove, . Secretary of State for Education, said some social workers 'acquiesce' the bad choices of feckless parents . Mr Gove was born in August 1967 to a young student single mother, and was adopted four months later. Describing his own experience today, he said: ‘As someone who started their life in care, whose life was transformed because of the skill of social workers and the love of parents who were not my biological mother and father but who are - in every sense - my real mum and dad, this is personal. ‘A child’s opportunity to flourish should not be a matter of chance - it should be the mission which guides all our actions.’ He warned: ‘I believe that we have not been either systematic, radical or determined enough in our efforts to reform the system of child protection in this country. But that is changing.’ Pledging to ‘strip out’ trendy attitudes within the profession, Mr Gove said that many social workers believe their main role is to secure benefits and services for their clients rather than forcing them to address their problems. Playing around: Michael Gove aged 11 months with his mother Christine at the beach . Many are too quick to ‘explain away’ appalling behaviour that can lead to domestic violence and child abuse, he said. And he warned that the training of social workers needs major reform. ‘In . too many cases, social work training involves idealistic students being . told that the individuals with whom they will work have been . disempowered by society,’ he said. Overhaul: Sir Martin Narey, above, the former chief executive of Barnardo's, is carrying out a review of social worker training . ‘They . will be encouraged to see these individuals as victims of social . injustice whose fate is overwhelmingly decreed by the economic forces . and inherent inequalities which scar our society. ‘This . analysis is, sadly as widespread as it is pernicious. It robs . individuals of the power of agency and breaks the link between an . individual’s actions and the consequences. ‘It risks explaining away substance abuse, domestic violence and personal irresponsibility, rather than doing away with them. ‘Social workers overly influenced by this analysis not only rob families of a proper sense of responsibility, they also abdicate their own. ‘They see their job as securing the family’s access to services provided by others, rather than helping them to change their own approach to life. Instead of working with individuals to get them to recognise harmful patterns of behaviour, and improve their own lives, some social workers acquiesce in or make excuses for these wrong choices.’ Mr Gove’s comments are made in a speech to the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. They come ahead of the publication tomorrow of a serious case review into the shocking case of Hamzah Khan who was starved to death by his mother and left in his cot for almost two years. Sir Martin Narey, the former head of Barnardo’s, is currently carrying out a review of social worker training for Mr Gove, and is expected to call for major changes. Sources said Mr Gove said better training was vital in improving standards in a profession that has been rocked by a string of scandals. Mr Gove highlighted the success of the new ‘Frontline’ initiative, which aims to fast-track top graduates into social work. More than 4,000 people have applied for the scheme in its first six weeks.","The Minister's comments will come in a speech to the NSPCC .

Marion Hill, 42, and Lyndsay Millett, 37, were involved in a 'commercial enterprise' snatching wreaths to sell on from at least one cemetery, Liverpool Magistrates’ Court heard. They were caught on camera taking two wreaths just hours after they had been left by the grieving family of Bridget Jennat, 82, when she was buried the city's Allerton Cemetery. Callous: Marion Hill, left, and Lyndsay Millett, right, leave Liverpool Magistrates' Court after an earlier hearing.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor and Business Correspondent . PUBLISHED: . 06:04 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:39 EST, 12 November 2013 . Inflation dropped sharply last month – but there is little cheer for families because the rate is still rising three times higher than the average pay packet. The consumer prices index fell from 2.7 per cent to 2.2 per cent between September and October – the lowest rate for 13 months, the Office for National Statistics revealed yesterday. The Prime Minister hailed the ‘significant drop’ – driven by decreases in the cost of fuel and the smaller-than-expected impact of higher university tuition fees – as ‘encouraging news for hard-working people’. Costs: The CPI rate of inflation has fallen to 2.2 per cent, the lowest level for a year . But over the past 12 months the average worker has earned a pay rise of just 0.7 per cent, amid a backdrop of crippling double-digit energy bill increases and a 4.3 per cent rise in food costs. To add to the pressure on households, it has now been four years since the Government has kept the inflation rate below its 2 per cent target. Pay rises have also remained below inflation throughout that period. Economists predict that last month’s drop in inflation could be reversed when the recent spate of energy price increases take effect. Fuel prices fell between September and October, with petrol down by about 5p per litre and diesel around 3p per litre cheaper. The impact of the rise in tuition fees to up to £9,000, introduced last autumn, did not have the same impact, said the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said transport prices overall fell 1.5 month-on-month in October, largely as a result of supermarkets rushing to cut prices. Chancellor George Osborne is under pressure to use next month's Autumn Statement to tackle the cost of living . There were also downward contributions from air fares and prices for secondhand cars. Food inflation fell from 4.8 per cent to 4.3 per cent, easing some pressure on household costs. In a message on Twitter, Prime Minister David Cameron said: ‘Encouraging news for hard-working people with a significant drop in inflation - this Government is sticking to a long term plan for Britain.’ Ministers hope that pay rises will overtake increases in prices before the 2015 election so that voters start feeling better off as a result of the economic recovery. However, the latest round of energy price hikes of up to 10 per cent are not included in the figures and are likely to drive up inflation from the new year. EDF today announced rises 3.9 per cent amid reports E.ON will push up prices by 6.6 per cent. ScottishPower bills are going up by 9 per cent, Npower announced a 10.4 per cent price hike, British Gas a 9.2 per cent rise and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent increase. The prospect of falling inflation will ease fears that the Bank of England will put up interest rates any time soon. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘October's inflation data suggests that the UK economy is hitting a sweet spot of accelerating growth and falling inflation. ‘Looking forward, inflation may tick up a touch in November as some of the recent announcements of hefty increases in energy prices start to take effect.’ Motoring: Falling petrol prices were the biggest factor in reducing the annual rise in the cost of living . Motorists have seen the cost of filling up their tank fall in recent weeks, after months of rises. Petrol prices fell by 4.9p per litre between September and October this year, to stand at 131.6 pence. Catherine McKinnell, Labour's shadow treasury minister, said: ‘This fall in the inflation rate is welcome, but with prices still rising much faster than wages the cost-of-living crisis under David Cameron continues. ‘And with inflation-busting hikes in energy prices in the pipeline families and pensioners will carry on feeling the squeeze.’","Consumer Prices Index falls to 2.2%, down from 2.7%, lowest for a year .

Facing life: Former NFL star Sam Hurd was arrested by undercover police after trying to buy large amounts of cocaine and cannabis to distribute around the Chicago area . A former NFL wide receiver faces a possible life sentence in a federal courtroom today for his role in a cocaine and cannabis distribution scheme. Sam Hurd pleaded guilty in April to one count of trying to buy and distribute cocaine and marijuana after being arrested in a police sting outside a Chicago steakhouse. Authorities say that while NFL teammates and friends knew Hurd as a hardworking player and married father, he was fashioning a separate identity as a wannabe drug kingpin with a focus on 'high-end deals' and a need for large amounts of drugs despite being on a $5million contract. Hurd claimed in an interview published yesterday that he sold marijuana to his Dallas Cowboys teammates, but didn't ask for any profit, and smoked during the last three to four years of his career 'all day, every day.' 'I'm in the NFL, and I'm gonna ask people for a few hundred dollars on top of what I paid for it? Nah,' Hurd told Sports Illustrated. 'Slide me what I got it for and take it. Enjoy it.' Today, Hurd will enter a Dallas courtroom with his future in tatters as he faces possibly spending the rest of his life in prison. The charge carries a minimum 10-year sentence, but prosecutors may push for a sentence up to life. His December 2011 arrest outside a Morton’s steakhouse in suburban Chicago came after he tried to buy a kilogram of cocaine in what turned out to be a sting. According to a federal complaint, Hurd told an undercover agent that he wanted 5 to 10 kilograms of cocaine for $25,000 per kilogram and 1,000lbs of marijuana per week to distribute in the Chicago area. Hurd (pictured with Dallas Cowboys, left, and the Chicago Bears, right) claimed in an interview this week that he sold marijuana to his Cowboys teammates and smoked the drug for years during his career 'all day, every day' Hurd was arrested after he tried to buy a kilogram of cocaine in what turned out to be a police sting outside a Morton's steakhouse (above) in suburban Chicago . Video Source YouTube . He claimed he was already distributing 4kg a week, according to the complaint. A kilogram is about 2.2lbs. At the time, Hurd was a wide receiver with stints for the Bears and Dallas Cowboys who had played most of his five seasons on special teams. He was in the first year of a three-year contract reportedly worth more than $5 million. The Bears soon cut him. Hurd was . released on bond and returned to Texas, where he grew up, but soon fell . into trouble again, according to court documents. He allegedly tried to buy more cocaine and marijuana through a cousin, Jesse Tyrone Chavful, and failed two drug tests. Court sketch: Sam Hurd sketched in court on his first appearance after his arrest in December 2011 . That led a magistrate judge in August 2012 to revoke his bond and order him returned to jail. In . April, when the tall, lanky Hurd stood before a judge in an orange . jumpsuit and pleaded guilty, he asked to address the court. 'I'm sorry for everything I've done,' he told the judge. Cowboys . coach Jason Garrett, asked Tuesday about Hurd's claims he sold drugs to . teammates, declined to comment 'because I just don't know anything . about that.' Cowboys defensive tackle Jason . Hatcher, a former teammate of Hurd's, called Hurd a 'great guy in the . locker room' and a 'great teammate.' 'It's very shocking to hear,' Hatcher said. 'But as far as everybody smoking in the NFL, I don't know. 'As . long as you keep your business, whatever you do off the field is your . business. I really don't know what to say about that situation.' Intent to distribute: Hurd wanted to purchase up to 10kg of cocaine each week . One of Hurd's attorneys, Jay Ethington, has said that Hurd was given no promise of leniency for pleading guilty and avoiding trial. Sentence recommendations from prosecutors and Hurd's attorneys are sealed, though attorneys for both sides are expected to make their case before U.S. District Judge Jorge Solis today. Chavful and another co-defendant, Toby Lujan, have both pleaded guilty to being involved in the conspiracy. Solis, who will sentence Hurd, gave Chavful eight years in prison for a much smaller role in the scheme. Lujan will be sentenced in January. There is no parole in the federal system, though inmates can typically apply for early release after completing 85 per cent of their sentences. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the average sentence handed down for drug trafficking cases in Texas' Northern District, where Hurd is being prosecuted, was about nine-and-a-half years between October 2011 and September 2012, the most recent period for which statistics are available.","Former wide receiver Sam Hurd admitted role in drug distribution scheme .

A&E departments will be closed or face cutbacks, forcing patients to travel further to casualty supercentres under new government plans. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt today said a review of emergency services due tomorrow would not shy away from taking ‘difficult decisions’ as he hinted at closures. It came as the government admitted it has held talks with private sector hospitals about treating NHS patients to ease pressure on the NHS this winter. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said 'difficult decisions' will need to be made over the future of A&E departments, raising the prospect of closures . The NHS's top doctor, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, will publish a report tomorrow on why the network of small unites across the country is not working. The health service’s medical director is expected to argue that the most seriously ill patients should be taken to bigger super-centres – bypassing local units altogether. He will argue that patients should be taken to larger hospitals, with more specialist doctors, even if it means they have to travel further. In the Commons today, Labour said the A&E system was in crisis, after it emerged at least 12,000 patients spent 12 or more hours on trolleys in casualty units last year. Crisis: At least 12,000 patients spent 12 or more hours on trolleys in casualty units last year . Another 250 waited for a minimum of 24 hours and one was left for 71 hours and 34 minutes. Mr Hunt was called to the Commons to give details of the Keogh Review, because MPs break up for a mini-recess tonight. He said the report will examine how to make it easier for the public to access emergency health care. And he sought to pin the blame on Labour, accusing shadow health secretary Andy Burnham of failing to make the hard choices needed. Mr Hunt added: ‘Why are we having an A&E review? It's to clear up the mess and confusion caused by 13 years of Labour mismanagement of our emergency services. ‘You talk about walk-in centres. Why were they introduced? They were introduced because of the disastrous mistake of the GP contract and the brave thing for (you) to do would be to admit that you got that wrong and reverse it. ‘But no, you didn't do that. You introduced a whole new raft of services which confused the public - A&E, walk-in centres, GP surgeries, telephone helplines. ‘Tomorrow sorts out those problems and, yes, there are difficult decisions. But they are decisions that your government ducked and left the public exposed as a result.’ The number of patients arriving in A&E has soared by a third over the past decade and 22million were logged last year. Rising numbers of old people and the decline in out-of-hours care by GPs have been blamed. Monitor, a hospital watchdog, warned the closure of 50 walk-in centres had piled further pressure on casualty units. NHS medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh has written a major report on A&E closures but shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused the government of presiding over 'the worst year for A&E in a decade' Labour’s Mr Burnham said: ‘People are increasingly asking “Where is the Government and what is it doing about it?” So far all they have heard is “Crisis, what crisis?”. ‘What is going on and why are you running scared, blaming NHS England and trying to keep this House in the dark?’ Yesterday it emerged that Prime Minister David Cameron has taken personal charge of A&Es this winter crisis, demanding weekly updates on waiting times to prevent the government being hit by an NHS crisis. Health minister Earl Howe today revealed that discussions had been taking place with private hospitals to see ‘whether and to what extent there is capacity to absorb elective care patients over the winter when needed’. He said there was ‘everything to be gained’ from a process that had been adopted by the previous government. ‘We think it is right that the independent sector, where appropriate, should play its part in relieving the burden from the NHS.'","Jeremy Hunt warns the public has been confused by access to care .

US Secretary of State John Kerry helped the two sides reach an agreement to bring them back to the negotiating table . Their release just after midnight Tuesday was the second of four prisoner releases meant to restart Israeli-Palestinian talks in an effort to reach a final agreement between the two sides. The Palestinians had long refused to resume peace negotiations with Israel unless it ends construction in territories that Palestinians seek for their state. Israel refused, insisting that settlements and other core issues, including security, should be resolved through negotiations. The prisoner release was part of an agreement brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, which brought Israel and the Palestinians back to the negotiating table after a five-year hiatus. The talks had been paralyzed since 2008. Earlier this year, Kerry managed to persuade Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to drop the settlement issue as a condition for restarting negotiations. In exchange, Israel agreed to the prisoner release. The amnesty involved releasing all of the Palestinian prisoners in return for dropping the issue of settlements .

In total, Israel has agreed to release 104 Palestinian inmates as part of the amnesty . In all, 104 Palestinian convicts are to be released in four rounds over the coming months. The east Jerusalem construction move angered the Palestinians but it was not immediately clear if it would directly impact the talks, which are taking place behind closed doors and away from the public eye, which both sides had agreed to. Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas condemned the move, saying that 'it is destructive to the peace efforts and will only lead to more tensions.' Last night's prisoner release opened fissures in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rightist government. A pro-settler coalition partner, the Jewish Home party, and members of his own Likud, called on the leader to cancel the amnesty.

Last night's prisoners were the second of four groups to be set free as part of the agreement brokered by the US to bring the two sides back to negotiations . Meanwhile, Israel's Interior Ministry announced it would proceed with a plan for 1,500 new housing units in Ramat Shlomo, a settlement in an area of the occupied West Bank that Israel considers part of Jerusalem. Those plans were first announced in 2010, clouding a visit to Israel at the time by U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who condemned the project, which was subsequently shelved. Israel announced last December it would proceed with the construction but froze the move again ahead of a visit by U.S. President Barack Obama in March this year. The Palestinians, who want to establish a state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, territories captured by Israel in a 1967 war, condemned the move.

Yuval Steinitz, Israel's strategic affairs minister and a Likud member, made clear in a radio interview yesterday that by agreeing to the prisoner releases, the government effectively had quashed a Palestinian demand to halt settlement building. But at the celebrations in Ramallah, Abbas denied any connection between the prisoner release and settlement expansion.

Apocalypse buffs with unlikely predictions of impending Armageddon seem to think so - including an author who . claims to have been a consultant to former Israeli Prime Minster Benjamin . Netanyahu and who seems to have the ears of former presidential candidates Rick . Santorum and Rick Perry. 'The innocent blood shed by the Assad regime is reprehensible and . heart-breaking and is setting the stage for a terrible judgment,' best-selling author and self-described Jewish believer in Jesus Joel C. Rosenberg wrote in a blog post last year. However . unlikely the wild theory may seem to established foreign policy experts, the . fringe belief that the conflict in Syria could be the beginning of the end for . mankind stems from an Old Testament prophecy called the 'burden of Damascus,' which is found in Isaiah 17. Armageddon? Evangelists fear the conflict in Syria is the beginning of end times, as described in the Old Testament . Burden of Damascus: Author Joel Rosenberg's biblical theories about the Middle East are getting a lot of attention as the crisis in Syria escalates . The prophecy contends that conflict in the Middle East will ultimately leave Damascus - Syria's capitol - in ruins, which, the prophecy claims, will bring the world one step closer to Armageddon. 'Damascus is about to be removed from being a city, and will become a fallen ruin,' the prophecy states, implying that the city will be destroyed by God on behalf of Israel as one of the final struggles for mankind. How will Damascus fall? As Rosenberg notes, the Bible isn't exactly clear. However, one of his books offers his prediction - and it starts starts in Damascus. Rosenberg's Twelfth Imam series describes the emergence of . the Mahdi, the Muslim messiah, which leads to the rise of a new Islamic . caliphate in the Middle East. The new caliphate, Mother Jones explains, then 'prepares to decapitate Israel by . launching nuclear warheads from Damascus.' Powerful friends: Rosenberg has the ear of former presidential candidate Rick Santorum . Texas Governor Rick Perry subscribes to Rosenberg's theory on the 'burden of Damascus' Rosenberg's series is described on Amazon as 'a . great read for anyone interested not only in the prophetical future of . Israel but for Iran and Syria as well…[It] makes one want to keep his or . her eyes wide open on current day Middle East events, and see if they . line up to eschatological Old Testament passages.' Rosenberg's prophecies may seem somewhat out there, but he's regarded by many as 'a modern-day Nostradamus' for his expertise on nuclear policy, particularly as it pertains to the Middle East. Santorum even wrote a foreward for the hardcover version of Rosenberg's most-recent novel, Damascus Countdown, and even had him on his radio show to discuss the book last spring. Texas Governor Rick Perry - who ran for the presidency in 2012 and is expected to do so again in 2016 - met privately with Rosenberg in March to discuss Damascus Countdown . Other Christian doomsday mouthpieces are capitalizing on the burden of Damascus theory - Jan Markell, a Christian radio host frequented by former Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann, sent out an email blast last spring warning of the tension in Syria leading to the end of the world. Doomsday: Rosenberg plans to meet with Kansas Governor Sam Brownback this weekend to discuss the situation in the Middle East . On Friday, just before President Barack Obama announced he was taking his plan to launch missile attacks on Syria to Congress, Texas-based evangelist Hal Lindsey - who has been warning of the burden of Damascus for years - offered a dire warning on his television program. 'As I prepared for this weeks program, I was again struck by the speed . with which events are moving into the scenario the prophets predicted . for the end times,' he told his audience. 'I believe we're there. People . on the street are talking about what all of these things mean. Folks . that wouldn't go darken the door of a church or pick up a Bible are now . very curious. This may be our greatest opportunity—maybe even our last . opportunity—to share the gospel of Jesus Christ before we're silenced by . political correctness.'

Poundstretcher's vouchers are said to be a bid to boost breastfeeding in the UK . New mothers will receive up to £200 of store vouchers in return for breastfeeding under a controversial scheme partly funded by the taxpayer. They will be given coupons for stores such as Poundstretcher, Asda, Tesco and John Lewis as a reward for not relying solely on formula milk. The pilot scheme will involve 130 women in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, but it could later be rolled out nationally. But critics say it is a form of bribery, with the nanny state trying to control mothers. There are also concerns it is a short-term fix that will not help those who do not breastfeed due to stigma or discomfort. Britain has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe – only a third of women feed for the recommended six months. Yet it is known to protect babies from stomach upsets, chest infections, allergies and obesity and may even boost IQ. It also reduces a woman’s risk of breast cancer and can help her to bond with a newborn. The trial, which starts today, will see women offered £40 in vouchers if they breastfeed for two days, another £40 if they do it for ten days and another £40 if they carry on for six weeks. They will get £40 at three months and again at six months. Women still breastfeeding by then will have received £200. The team in charge admit they have no way of proving whether someone is breastfeeding. Women will simply fill in a form saying they are doing so, and it will be signed off by a midwife. The trial is based in areas where breastfeeding rates are half the UK average and strong social stigmas about breastfeeding in public persist. It is run by researchers from Sheffield and Dundee universities, who also oversaw an NHS scheme that paid obese patients up to £425 to lose 50lb (23kg). It has since been abandoned. The team insist the latest trial is at a very early stage. If it is deemed successful, a national study will be carried out next year and eventually it could be used across the NHS. Dr Clare Relton, of the University of Sheffield, said: ‘We think there are benefits to babies, mums and to society for breastfeeding. We are exploring one particular way that might improve breastfeeding rates.’ Janet Fyle, of the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘Whilst we are not against financial incentives for the right reasons, there is a much bigger social and cultural problem here that needs to be tackled instead. Formula: Research reveals 34 per cent of British women feed their babies milk formula for the first six months . ‘In many areas, including those in this study, there are generations of women who may not have seen anyone breastfeeding their baby, meaning it is not the cultural norm.’ Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is yet another example of public health officials believing that the nanny state knows best for every single family.’ Just 1 per cent of UK women feed babies only breast milk for six months, as recommended by the World Health Organisation. Around 34 per cent give them a mixture of breast milk and formula for this period.","South Yorkshire women will be given vouchers to spend on things other than formula milk and must fill out a form to say they are breastfeeding .

"By . Steve Nolan . PUBLISHED: . 11:15 EST, 30 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:08 EST, 30 October 2013 . Spain has finally emerged from a two-year recession with figures showing that the country's economy grew in the last quarter in spite of extremely high unemployment. Burgeoning exports saw the economy grow 0.1 per cent in the third quarter, according to figures from the National Statistics Institute released today. But economists still warned that the road to recovery will still be a tough one for the Eurozone's fourth-biggest economy and that unemployment, which is still just under 26 per cent, will remain exceptionally high for at least another five years. Recovery: Spain is the latest Eurozone country to exit recession as figures show its economy grew by 0.1 per cent in the last quarter . Meanwhile, house prices in the Irish capital Dublin are rising faster than they were during the height of the property boom, just months after the country's economy emerged from recession. House prices rose almost 4 per cent in just four weeks in September and are expected to have risen some 20 per cent before the year is out. Both countries have been bailed out by the Eurozone after hitting trouble following the 2008 crash. Although the Eurozone offered Spain almost 100 billion Euros (£85.5 billion) in bailout payments last year, it only accepted 41 billion (£35 billion) in exchange for reforms and close international monitoring. Ireland meanwhile accepted a three-year, 67.5 billion euro (£57 billion) bailout from the Eurozone and the International Monetary Fund. The 0.1 per cent growth to the Spanish economy signals the end of the country's second recession in five years sparked by the collapse of a building boom in 2008. The Institute's figures confirm earlier projections from Spain's central bank. Not all joy: Despite signs of recovery, queues like this can still be expected at Spanish job centres with unemployment expected to remain above 25 per cent until at least 2018 . But the International Monetary Fund has warned that unemployment in the country will remain above 25 per cent until at least 2018. And analysts believe that a full recovery could be held back by a lack of domestic consumer spending. A report compiled by Capital Economics said: 'While economic prospects are considerably better than a year ago, particularly in the external sector, domestic weakness is like to hold back any recovery in the wider economy. 'We expect the unemployment rate to remain around its current high levels for some time yet and public debt to continue to climb.' 'We expect the unemployment rate to . remain around its current high levels for some time yet and public debt . to continue to climb.' - Capital economics . The Spanish government expects an overall growth of 1.3 percent for 2013 - slightly better than the 1.6 percent in 2012 - before a return to timid growth of 0.7 percent in 2014. Consumer price inflation in Spain slowed in October to 0.1 percent compared to a year earlier, according to other preliminary data from the statistics institute and EU estimates. The institute attributed the easing in October to a fall in the price of food and a smaller rise in university fees than in the previous year. Inflation has been easing in Spain since peaking in October 2012, in line with a general easing in the Eurozone indicated by the European Union data agency Eurostat. Spain has pushed through painful spending cuts to bring down its soaring public deficit under pressure from the European Union. It also last year passed labour reforms that have made it cheaper for companies to hire and fire workers. Bust and boom: Property prices in Dublin, pictured, are rising at a quicker rate than they were at the height of the property boom according to latest figures . Rocketing prices: Homes in the city are expected to have risen by around 20 per cent over the course of a year . Spain resisted pressure last year to seek a full bailout from its neighbours but accepted 41.3 billion euros (£35.3 billion) in Eurozone rescue loans for its banks. Meanwhile, despite only announcing that it had emerged from recession last month, the property market in Irish capital Dublin saw house prices rise by 3.9 per cent last month - a faster rate than during the property boom. That rise means that property prices in the city have rocketed a staggering 12.2 per cent over 12 months. That annual increase is expected to reach 20 per cent by the end of the year. During September, the price of a 300,000 Euro (£256,000) home rose by around 12,000 Euro (£10,278) according to the Central Statistics Office. According to the Irish Independent, a combination a pent-up demand from cash buyers and a shortage in family homes is the cause of the rapid rise. The rise comes amid warnings of a property bubble in Dublin, and the Government is being urged to ease pressure on the housing stock by ensuring that families have access to cheap housing. Rural areas have not seen the same rise. Overall, house prices are still down almost 50 per cent in Dublin since they were at their peak during the boom in 2007. Planning permission has already been secured for 10,000 new homes in the capital.","The Spanish economy grew by 0.1 per cent according to latest figures .

Dementia sufferer Janet Tierney was severely injured after allegedly being attacked by a male resident at their care home . These shocking images show the appalling injuries suffered by a 91-year-old dementia patient after she was allegedly 'kicked like a football' by a violent male resident in her care home. Widow Janet Tierney has spent almost seven weeks in hospital recovering after she was left badly battered and bruised. Janet, a retired bus conductor and grandmother-of-two, was allegedly hurt by a fellow dementia patient in his 70s, who attacked her in her room at Bloomfield Court Care Home in Tipton, West Midlands, on September 24. The home, which specialises in dementia care for residents, is run by Ideal Care Homes. Both the care home and Sandwell Council, who helped place Mrs Tierney in the residence, say it is unclear what happened to cause the widow's bruises. Mrs Tierney's daughter Margaret McFerran, 52, from Coleshill, Warwickshire, was called to the care home after the attack. She . said: 'When I arrived there were a couple of small bruises on her face . but she burst into tears and was adamant she had been kicked 'like a . football'. 'With people with . dementia you sometimes wonder if they are not sure whether something . happened, but she was so stressed I was sure she was right. 'She was taken to hospital and the nurses showed me huge bruises all the way down from her head to her feet.

I called social services and they said they would investigate. 'But it’s been seven weeks since the attack now and nothing seems to have been done. Mrs Tierney was moved to the care home in December last year . 'I’m terrified for the safety of my mum and his safety really, they can’t assure me of anything. 'There . is no way she is going back to that home, she’d be terrified. It’s got . to be against her human rights, she’s stuck in the hospital.' Sandwell Council say they are working with the widow to find her a new home for her to be cared in. Mrs McFerran said: 'My mum is a tough woman, but even she is left struggling after this. 'She was in a care home, she should have been safe there of all places. 'It’s an appalling way to treat an elderly woman in her nineties.' Janet, who was widowed 10 years ago after her husband Patrick lost his battle with cancer, moved to the care home in December last year when she was diagnosed with dementia. Ideal Care Homes managing director Mark Greaves said he was aware 'of a resident-to-resident altercation involving the lady in question'. He said: 'The home fully reported [it] to the relevant authorities and is being dealt with within the Safeguarding Procedures of Sandwell Council. 'I understand that the lady has been reassessed by the home’s manager and it has been determined that her needs cannot be met within this setting.'

Though '60 Minutes' initially stood by him- believing his claims . that he was the subject of a slander attack by the State Department- . they issued a public apology for their mistake on the following Friday. Dylan Davies previously worked as a security contractor hired by the State Department and he told 60 Minutes that he was not on the ground of the Special Consulate when the attack began on the night of September 11, 2012, but he rushed over as soon as he heard. Lara Logan on '60 Minutes' on Sunday where she recounts a false broadcast on Oct.27 and issues an apology . '60 Minutes' correspondent Lara Logan made a second apology on air for trusting an untruthful source . ‘The most important thing to every . person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and today the truth is we made a . mistake. That's very disappointing for any journalist, that's very . disappointing for me,’ Logan said when she gave an on-air mea culpa . during CBS This Morning on November 8. ‘Nobody . likes to admit that they made a mistake, but if you do, you have to . stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you were wrong . and in this case we were wrong.’ During . the original interview, Davies- who went by the pseudonym that he used . while writing a book about his version of events, Morgan Jones- said . that he scaled a 12 foot wall and fought off a terrorist when he arrived . at the consulate on the evening of the attack. Apology on Nov.8 : Lara Logan said that they were wrong to air her interview with a man called Dylan Davies who, it has since been revealed, lied about his role on the night of the attacks on the American mission to Benghazi . Multiple stories: Dylan Davies, who went by the pseudonym Morgan Jones during the interview, told his security company and the FBI something different than he told CBS during his interview that aired at the end of October . He also said that he later saw the body of Ambassador Chris Stevens when he went to a local hospital that evening. It was later revealed that in . reports he made both to his company, Blue Mountain Group, and the FBI, . he said that he never made it to the compound on the night of the . attack. He said in those reports that he never made it to the Special . Mission compound until the next morning on September 12. Logan . said that they were aware of the discrepancy between the version of . events that he was telling CBS and the Blue Mountain Group report, . saying that before they aired the piece he told them that he lied in the . company’s report to go along with his boss’ story which said that . Davies tried going to the mission but there were roadblocks and he . couldn’t make it. Lies: Davies told 60 Minutes that he scaled a 12-foot wall to get into the compound and then fought a terrorist to the ground once he got inside. He also said he saw the dead body of the American ambassador . ‘His boss is someone he cared about enormously. He cared about his American counterparts in the mission that night, and when his boss told him not to go, he couldn't stay back. So that was always part of the record for us,’ Logan said. She made it clear that what they did . not know was that Davies had given that account to the FBI in their . incident report. His involvement with the FBI report came via The . Washington Post after the 60 Minutes piece aired, and Logan said that . when they confronted him over the claims, he denied it. Logan . said that they have since tried contacting Davies about the situation . and they have not been able to get in touch with him. ‘We . were misled and we were wrong and that's the important thing and that's . what we have to say here: we have to set the record straight and take . responsibility,’ she said. Placing the blame: While she repeatedly said 60 Minutes was taking responsibility, she said that they were 'misled' by Davies who did not tell them that he gave a different version of events to the FBI . Davies . motivation to lie presumably has something to do with the fact that he . is coming out with a book about alleged warnings that he gave the U.S. government about security flaws before the attack. The publisher of the book, The Embassy House, has now said that they have retracted the book. Pulled: The publisher announced on Friday that it will stop selling Davies' book . It had already been on sale online and an unknown number of people had already bought the book. Simon & Schuster announced that 'in light of information that has been brought to our attention' they will no longer be selling the book. Anyone who purchased the book in the past week since the story aired and it went on the market can now return it to the publisher, Politico reports. The book itself was another problem for '60 Minutes' because while they did disclose that Davies had a book that was being published, they failed to mention that Threshold Editions is an imprint of Simon & Schuster which is owned by CBS. CNN said that they got a statement from Davies who said that his book is 'consistent' with what he told U.S. authorities and the FBI, but their own reporter said that there were discrepancies between his book and official reports. When asked about what steps they took to vet that Davies was telling the truth before they put him on air, Logan said that they did independent research and also used material that he provided. 'We verified that he was who he said he was, that he was working for the State Department at the time, that he was in Benghazi at the Special Mission compound the night of the attack,' she said on CBS' morning news show. 'He gave us access to communications that he had with government officials. we used US government reports and congressional testimony to verify many of the details  of his story and everything checked out. He also showed us photographs that he had taken at the Special Mission compound the following morning.'

Jonas Zimicki, 31, from Cambridge, has now been offered a string of modelling jobs after placing fourth overall in the Miami Pro UK Championships. The gym instructor, who has no right leg, had hoped to compete as a sprinter for Team GB in last year's Paralympic Games. But after he failed to make the cut he switched his focus to fitness modelling in the hope he could offer an example to other disabled people. Super fit: Jonas Zimicki wearing his winning costume. The 31-year-old, from Cambridge, has . now been offered a string of modelling jobs after placing fourth overall . in the Miami Pro UK Championshipshere . His efforts were rewarded when he was crowned fitness modelling fancy dress champ at his first attempt, complete with wooden leg. Lithuanian-born Mr Zimicki was born with a deformed right leg which surgeon's amputated when he was 19. He moved to Britain in 2004 and wanted to compete for his adopted country after training alongside Jonny Peacock. But he missed out on a place with Team GB and instead had to watch from his sofa. 'I took up fitness modelling off the back of devastating disappointment when I failed to make team GB at the Paralympics last year,' he said. 'I had been training with Jonny Peacock at Lea Valley in the 100 metre sprint throughout 2011 and 2012 but wasn't successful. I didn't know what to do next.' Determined: Mr Zimicki, a gym instructor who is originally from Lithuania, took up fitness modelling after missing out on a place to represent Britain as a sprinter at the Paralympic Games in London last year . He started work as a gym instructor in Cambridge and visited schools in the city to lend children tips and advice on how to keep fit. A colleague then encouraged him to train for fitness modelling and gave him tips on nutrition and exercises. He entered the under 75kg category in the Miami Pro UK Championships and finished fourth out of more than 40 competitors overall. Hard competition: Mr Zimicki alongside fellow contestants at the Miami Pro UK Championships . He said: 'What I did is fitness modelling rather than body building as it focuses very much on looking healthy and feeling healthy. 'I really enjoyed it. I didn't know how the audience and other competitors would react to me but they were all really supportive and the comments were great. 'I've been approached by magazines and agencies who have never met an amputee doing what I am doing. 'It is really positive for me both as a person and as a businessman. 'I don't want to tell other people with similar issues like mine what to do with their lives, but I can go out and do something and hopefully that can provide some sort of inspiration.'","Jonas Zimick took up modelling after failing to make British Paralympic team .

The binmen, from Midlothian Council, said that new health and safety rules meant they couldn't collect the waste, claiming the bag had become jammed. Susan Wright, 39, from Dalkeith, owns the bin and has called the decision 'bonkers'. Susan Wright, 39, a mother-of-three from Dalkeith has hit out at Midlothian Council after workers refused to empty her bin which had a bag caught in the lid . The mother-of-three said: ‘Surely there’s common sense that tells you that you can lift a bin lid up to see if the bin is overflowing or not, or whether a bag’s just caught. 'They didn’t even bother to do that. They go on about health and safety of their workers, but what about the health and safety of my family? 'We’re a family of five, I’ve got a young baby and I’ve now got to store a month’s worth of bin rubbish.’ However when she complained officials told her she would have to wait a fortnight for the binmen to come back, as workers are being told not to empty any bin which is left open, whether it is overflowing or not. In a statement, the council said: ‘As you know, due to health and safety regulations, the binmen are now not emptying bins where the lid is open.

Taxing man: Quarry Bank School reports scolded John Lennon, centre, for 'fighting', 'shoving' and having 'no interest whatsoever'. This image of him in 1957 was itself auctioned in 2009 . His rebellious nature would one day help to change modern music. So it is unsurprising that John Lennon was not the most well-behaved schoolboy. Detention sheets from when the Beatles legend was 14 and 15 revealed that he was punished for ‘fighting in the classroom’, being a ‘nuisance’, ‘shoving’ and showing ‘just no interest whatsoever’. On two occasions he even managed to receive three detentions in one day, for behaviour including ‘silliness’ and ‘chewing’. Another time, he gave an ‘impudent answer to question’. The documents, which are estimated to fetch between £2,000 and £3,000 at  auction, uncover Lennon’s antics at Quarry Bank High School for Boys, in Liverpool, where he was renowned as a ‘class clown’. The sheets cover the periods when he was in Class 3B in May and June 1955, and in Class 4C from November 1955 to February 1956. They were discovered in the late 1970s when a member of staff at the grammar school was asked to clear out a storage room and burn all of the books inside. Fortunately, while burning several books, he spotted the name ‘Lennon’ at the top of some of the pages and realised who they related to. A Hard Day's Night: How teachers refused to leave the future pioneer of pop and rock to his own devices . The document recording 15-year-old John Lennon's behaviour was discovered in storage in the 1970s . A staff member saw 'Lennon' at the top of the sheets and tore them out, burning the rest of the book . According to auctioneers  TracksAuction.com, he tore the sheets out and kept them as a keepsake. They have been authenticated by Lennon’s close school friend, Pete Shotton, who wrote a book John Lennon: In My Life. Peter Beech, Lennon’s general science teacher at the time, said: ‘The sheet is typical of John Lennon, he was an extremely cheeky boy. He did, however, know his  limits. In the classroom, if you  settled John down, you generally settled the class down.’ Mr Beech added: ‘His chemistry teacher, Eric Oldman, said that John could actually go far.’ The singer, who was murdered in 1980, said of his rebellious teenage years: ‘I was the one who all the other boys’ parents would say, “Keep away from him”. ‘The parents instinctively recognised I was a troublemaker.’ Online bidding at TracksAuction.com starts on November 22 and the auction concludes with a live online sale beginning at 5pm on December 1. Other items in the Beatles memorabilia sale are a signed White Album, expected to fetch between £60,000 and £80,000, handwritten lyrics to an  unpublished 60s song by Sir Paul McCartney and an unpublished Lennon sketch.

Goldman Sachs has banned its bankers from their offices between Friday nights and Sunday mornings in a bid to tackle 'burn out' and improve 'work-life balance'. A memo issued to executives at the investment bank, who often work up to 100 hours a week, told them to stay away from work for the 36-hour period. But many will still have to knuckle down on Sundays which are not covered by the edict, designed to foster a friendlier atmosphere in an industry famed for its ferocious work ethic. Take a break: Financial professionals stand in the Goldman Sachs booth on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange . To enjoy their 'Goldman weekend' to the full, junior bankers must leave the office by 9pm on Fridays not to return until 9am the following Sunday, though they 'are still expected to check their blackberries [sic] on a regular basis', it said. And those seeking to shirk the mandate and slog from the comfort of their own living rooms were told: 'Work . should not shift from office to home.' The memo also states that staff are 'strongly encouraged' to take three weeks holiday a year'. 'If a team needs a professional exception to the Saturday rule (ie a junior banker needs to work on Saturday and/or the entire weekend), please email [a senior manager] by 9am on Friday for approval. Exceptions will not be the norm and should be used sparingly,' it adds. Overworked: Moritz Erhardt collapsed and died . in the shower at his student halls flat in Bethnal Green, east London, . after allegedly working through the night eight times in a two week . period . High pressure: Young bankers often feel obliged to prove their mettle by enduring dangerously long shifts, and working several nights without sleep, sometimes pepped up by caffeinated drinks and drugs . 'All analysts and associates are expected, and will be strongly encouraged, to take three weeks of vacation a year. This should include at least one, but preferably two, protected one-week vacations. Vacations will be tracked and reported on a quarterly basis. 'All analysts, including new first . year analysts, are expected to take time off (preferably one week) before the end of the year in an effort to focus on work-life balance.' The banking industry's tough work expectations were thrust into the spotlight in August after trainee Moritz Erhardt died in the shower this year after working 'crazy hours' at Goldman rival Merrill Lynch. Goldman Sachs was founded in 1869 by a German Jewish immigrant called Marcus Goldman who pioneered the idea that entrepreneurs could issue short-term bonds to finance the expansion of their businesses. His first partner was his son-in-law Samuel Sachs and they built up the firm so it could buy a seat at the New York Stock Exchange. By 1906, the new bank managed the biggest ever flotation by bringing retailer Sears, Roebuck and Company to the market. The next generation of brains included Sidney Weinberg who took control during the Great Depression in the 1930s and developed the advisory, lending and trading arms of the bank. When it decided to float on the stock market in 1999, most partners took away tens of millions of pounds and several drifted off into public service. On Wall Street, Goldmans continued as a profit-making machine, making an astonishing $17.6billion in 2007 and rewarding staff with record bonuses. The 21-year-old, who was reportedly on the verge of landing a £45,000-a-year job with the bank, collapsed and died in the shower at his student halls flat in Bethnal Green, east London, after allegedly working through the night eight times in a two week period. Even before the tragedy was formally confirmed, internet forums were rife with stories about investment banking interns feeling obliged to prove their mettle by enduring dangerously long shifts, and working several nights without sleep, sometimes pepped up by caffeinated drinks and drugs. When he did not show up for work, another intern who lived in the same flat called the building managers, who found Erhardt's body in the shower at about 8.30pm on August 15. It is believed he may have had an epileptic fit possibly caused by exhaustion. Talented Mr Erhardt had already completed placements at KPMG Consulting, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank's corporate finance division before working for Merrill Lynch. Goldman Sachs was hit by a £1.3billion backlash last year after one of its senior executives quit before launching a devastating attack on it's ‘morally bankrupt’ practices. The global investment bank’s share price fell after Greg Smith said Goldman staff referred to clients as ‘muppets’ and ripped them off for as much money as possible. Mr Smith, announcing . his resignation in an open letter in the New York Times, blamed two of . the bank’s top bosses for the ‘decline in the firm’s moral fibre’. He . claimed that Goldman’s chief executive Lloyd Blankfein and its . president Gary Cohn ‘lost hold of the firm’s culture on their watch’. Former executive Greg Smith (left) quit his job last year claiming the bank was 'morally bankrupt' and that it’s . chief executive Lloyd Blankfein (right) and its president Gary Cohn ‘lost hold . of the firm’s culture on their watch’ Shares in the bank fell 3.4 per cent . in New York trading as the shockwaves hit, although it still left the . company worth an estimated £36billion. Mr Smith, 33, an executive director, was . praised for his moral courage after quitting his £3million a year job . in despair at the company’s dubious ethics. However, an internal . investigation by the investment bank claimed that Greg Smith demanded to . be put on $1million a year, which was double his $500,000 salary at the . time.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 22:45 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:10 EST, 14 November 2013 . Ronald Phillips is a death row inmate who raped and killed a three-year-old girl . The governor has now changed his mind and decided to delay a death row inmate's execution so that they can see if there is a way to donate his organs to his sick relatives. Convicted child killer Ronald Phillips made a last-minute request have his organs to both his sick mother and members of the public, and initially prison officials said no because of security issues. Phillips' mother has kidney disease and is on dialysis and his sister has a heart condition. Governor John Kasich also rejected Phillips' plea of mercy last week, but after the murderer's lawyers submitted a request to have his organs be put to good use, the state officials have decided to try to make the option work. Phillips was scheduled to die on Thursday for the rape and death of his girlfriend's 3-year-old daughter in Akron in 1993 but now his death has been pushed back. The death row inmate had maintained through attorneys that the request was not a delay tactic but a final gesture of goodwill. His execution has now been pushed back to July 2. In stopping the execution, Kasich said he wanted to allow time to study the request the 40-year-old inmate made Monday to see if a donation could help someone else. Kasich said that if Phillips is found to be a viable donor to his mother, who has kidney disease and is on dialysis, or to others awaiting live transplants of non-vital organs, the stay would allow time for those procedures to be performed and for Phillips to be returned to death row. Kasich said that while Phillips' crime was heinous, his willingness to donate organs and tissue could save another life and the state should try to accommodate a donation. Phillips was sentenced to death for raping and killing his girlfriend's daughter, three-year-old Sheila Marie Evans (pictured), in Akron in 1993 . 'I realize this is a bit of uncharted territory for Ohio, but if another life can be saved by his willingness to donate his organs and tissues then we should allow for that to happen,' Kasich said in a statement. Some 3,500 people in Ohio and more than 120,000 nationally are currently awaiting organ donations, said Marilyn Pongonis, a spokeswoman for the Lifeline of Ohio organ donation program. A spokeswoman said the department moved swiftly to evaluate the request but determined it was not equipped to accommodate pre- or post-execution organ donations. Phillips also wants to donate his heart to his sister, who suffers a heart ailment. It appears that request would not be possible under the governor's directive, since the heart is a vital organ and cannot be donated after death. The person must be alive when the organ is donated. 'It just wouldn't be possible,' Pongonis said. Phillips will be injected with a never-been-used combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller. He has been languishing on death row for 20 years . 'Organ donation occurs following brain death and the organs are maintained on a ventilator. When a prisoner is executed, the oxygen stops flowing, the heart stops beating, the blood stops flowing.' Vital organ donations raise larger ethical issues and have so far not been allowed during U.S. executions, said Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. Phillips made his request after the governor denied him mercy and Phillips had exhausted his other legal options. His attorney said it wasn't a delay tactic but an attempt to do good.

False alarm: The Forestry Commission has received hundreds of calls from people mistaking the withering of seed pods for symptoms of ash dieback . The onset of the first winter frosts have led confused tree owners to inundate officials with false reports of ash dieback disease. The Forestry Commission said it has received hundreds of calls from concerned members of the public mistaking the withering of seed pods for symptoms of the deadly infection. Chalara ash dieback, which has ravaged ash populations across Europe, is believed to pose a major risk to Britain's estimated 80million ash trees. But outbreaks have so far been concentrated around recently planted sites in the South East and, despite fears, just 607 cases have been confirmed since it was first spotted in February last year. As ash trees start to feel the effect of plummeting temperatures, the commission has reminded horticultural enthusiasts that falling leaves do not necessarily indicate dieback. A spokesman said the first false alarms came in the south, where ash pods ripen and wither first, and have spread north in line with regional changes in the seasons. John Morgan, head of the commission's . plant health service, said: 'We welcome reports of suspected cases, . especially in new areas. 'However, . we do encourage people to check first that the tree really is an ash . tree and the symptoms are Chalara symptoms, and we have published . identification guides on our website. 'What . some people are mistaking for symptoms of disease are actually a sign . of the exceptionally productive fruiting season, or ""mast year"", we've . had. 'The clumps of seeds, . known as keys, can sometimes look like the blackened and shrivelled . leaves which are a symptom of the disease, so it is easy to see how the . mistake can be made. 'The . best way to recognise Chalara in the autumn is by the elongated, . diamond-shaped lesions, or discolouring, which it causes in the bark of . stems and branches around points where leaves, twigs and branches are . attached. This discoloured bark often has splits in it.' Warning sign: Elongated lesions in the bark of ash trees like these are symptoms of ash dieback infection . A year after the disease first appeared in the UK, conservation groups are still relying on public sightings to help them contain its spread. Chris Blincoe, programme manager for the group behind AshTag, a charity that catalogues potential sightings of Chalara, said there have been more than 12,000 downloads of AshTag and around 2,000 sightings submitted since the project launched in October last year. 'After an initial flurry of submissions in the first couple of months, the numbers have remained fairly steady with no recent noticeable rise,' he said. 'The success of AshTag has demonstrated just how willing the public are to support efforts to maintain the health of our countryside and handheld technology such as smartphones provide a new avenue to make this possible. 'We actively encourage the participation of the public in AshTag, the focus of which is now on using citizen science to identify and track healthy ash trees, particularly those that are surrounded by infected trees, as they may be less susceptible to ash dieback. 'This data will help those scientists aiming to understand and ultimately limit the impact of ash dieback.' Epidemic: A map prepared by the Forestry .

Death: Peter Barnes, 32, hung himself in the grounds of Cygnet Hospital in Wyke after he was let out for a cigarette by staff . A psychiatric patient was found hanged a few yards away from hospital after he was let out for a cigarette. Peter Barnes, 32, vanished from Cygnet Hospital in Wyke, Yorkshire in October. He was found hanged a week later just 30 yards from the hospital’s front door. Mr Barnes was allowed out unescorted for a 30-minute cigarette break despite previously talking about killing himself, an inquest at Bradford Coroner's court heard. A senior clinician at the hospital had not been told by nurses about marks seen on his neck or how he had been talking about ending his life hours before. The inquest heard how one nurse told police investigating his disappearance, 'I think he will be sat somewhere with a couple of cans of Stella'. Post-mortem examinations showed he was likely to have died just hours after he went missing. Mr Barnes was let down by 'gross failures and neglect' at the hopsital on 13 October, 2011, the inquest heard. Speaking today his mother, Karen Barnes, 54, from Lincoln, said she hoped lessons would be learned from her son's death . She said: 'At long last Peter’s voice has been heard through his inquest. We have heard what he was feeling - making himself heard was something he had to fight for all through his illness. 'He was failed by Cygnet. We now hope what happened to Peter and the outcome of the inquest will be used as a precedent and lesson to be learned stopping any other families going through the agony we have suffered. 'It is just heartbreaking these people are in the profession of looking after vulnerable people and yet they haven’t got any compassion. 'There is nothing they can see to make me feel any better. Incident: Mr Barnes was a patient at Cygnet Hospital, Wyke, West Yorkshire . 'A former member of staff came up to me and told me they had planted a tree in the grounds for Peter and one member of staff who died, and I just looked at her and thought that’s really apt isn’t it. Have they got no sense?' Mother-of-three Mrs Barnes said her son suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and was psychotic. She explained he was diagnosed at 16 and had been in and out of hospital since then. She said he was put on an intensive care secure unit at Cygnet after he attacked a doctor. He was there for just over three weeks before he hung himself. The inquest heard Dr Keith Rix had . allowed Mr Barnes unescorted leave because he hadn’t been warned that he . had marks on his neck or had talked about killing himself. Neither had those details been flagged up by nurses to the ward manager responsible for safety. During the inquest the jury heard evidence from Donna Bingley, a senior nurse at the privately-run West Yorkshire hospital. Devastated: Mr Barnes' mother Karen, pictured, said her son was failed by the hospital and she hope lessons would be learned for the tragedy . This . included a 999 call in which the nurse told the operator Mr Barnes had a . long-history of violent behaviour and he could be of risk to . others when his medication wore off. But she made no mention of potential self-harm. Miss . Bingley told the inquest: 'I wasn’t demanding they get the helicopters . out. I was just following procedure to report it to the police.' The jury heard when the operator asked . her, 'So is there any genuine concern at all?' she had replied: 'I . think really he will just have gone off and have a couple of cans of . Stella or make his way home to Lincoln, but I think he will be sat . somewhere with a couple of cans of Stella', adding, 'Usually they go up . to the Co-op'. Mother Mrs Barnes said it wasn’t until . six days later an officer 'just happened' to pick the case up and . brought it to her boss’ attention. The next day they searched the . grounds and found Peter’s body in ten minutes, Mrs Barnes said. The jury ruled unanimously that Mr Barnes had taken his own life while the balance of his mind was disturbed. Assistant Coroner Neil Cameron said he would write to the hospital about his concerns following the verdict. The jury also stated the hospital’s systems and methods of communication ensuring Mr Barnes' clinician had all the information needed to decide whether or not to allow unescorted ground leave had been 'inadequate'. They said this led to an error which gave him the opportunity to take his own life. The response of the hospital and its staff to his disappearance and the efforts they made to find him were 'untimely and inappropriate', they ruled. The jury foreman concluded: 'His death was contributed to by neglect, namely by the aforementioned gross failures of hospital systems and the failure to communicate and identify significant events which led to him wrongly being granted unescorted ground leave.' In a statement last night a Cygnet spokesman said: “We were struck during these proceedings by the love and care that Mr Barnes was given by his family all through his life and our thoughts are with his family and friends at what must be an incredibly difficult time.” “We have already made numerous changes to further improve our services. Communication inside Wyke has been totally overhauled.”","Peter Barnes, 32, vanished after going for a smoke at Cygnet Hospital in Wyke, Yorkshire, and was found hanged just 30 yards away a week later .

A woman who said she grew cannabis to . sacrifice to the Hindu god Shiva because the world was about to end has . been cleared of intending to supply the drug. Katarzyna . Dryden-Chouen, 46, and her husband Clive, 60, had been accused of . making £277,000 by dealing cannabis over a six year period. Police alleged that almost £13,000 found in their home in Littledean, Gloucestershire, was also the proceeds of drug dealing. But . Mrs Dryden-Chouen, who is originally from Poland, insisted that apart . from what she and her husband smoked, the cannabis was to be burnt as a . religious sacrifice. Mrs . Dryden-Chouen, who claimed to have a talking pet mouse, said it would . all have been offered to Shiva ahead of December 21 last year, when she . believed the world would end. She . and her husband admitted growing the cannabis. Plants capable of . yielding up to 2.9lb of the drug - worth about £6,000 - were found . growing throughout their home, a former pub. But . they denied having the drug with intent to supply as well as money . laundering charges and were found not guilty adter a three-week trial at . Gloucester Crown Court. Her . husband said that the £13,000 cash and the £277,000 which went through . their hands in six years was the proceeds of his business converting . cars to run on liquid petroleum gas. He admitted he did not have a bank account and had not paid tax on income which he said he was paid in cash. The . main evidence in the trial had been detailed diaries kept by Mrs . Dryden-Chouen in which she appeared to note details of cannabis growing . and selling. But she . told the jury the notes were a fiction, created in her imagination as . she meditated for long periods at a time without eating. The couple had both pleaded guilty at the start of the trial to cultivating cannabis between January 2009 and August 2012. Mrs Dryden-Chouen denied possessing cannabis with intent to supply between November 2003 and January 2004. She and her husband both denied a similar charge between January 2004 and January 2009 and a third charge relating to the period between January 2009 and August last year when police raided their home. Mr and Mrs Dryden-Chouen further denied a money laundering offence - converting £277,559 which was the proceeds of crime between June 2006 and August 2012. They also denied that the £12,890 found near a 'shrine' in the house was criminal property - the proceeds of drug dealing. Mrs Dryden-Chouen denied a further charge of possessing diazepam tablets with intent to supply on 6th July 2012. After almost five-and-a-half hours of deliberations, a jury found the couple not guilty of all outstanding charges. But Judge Alastair McGrigor warned them they may still face jail on the cultivation of cannabis charge. He bailed them for pre-sentence reports and adjourned to a date to be fixed. The jury heard that when Mrs Dryden-Chouen was arrested in July last year she said she was a homeopath and healer and that she did not know having cannabis was illegal. She said she grew cannabis for religious purposes and medical research. She also said she believed the world was coming to an end on December 21 last year and she intended to create a Homa (a burning pit) for a ceremony to burn the cannabis. Gloucester Crown Court: Judge Alastair McGrigor warned the couple they may still face jail on the cultivation of cannabis charge. He bailed them for pre-sentence reports and adjourned to a date to be fixed . Prosecutor Paul Grumbar said that 'just about every room in the house had cannabis in it' when police stormed in. In all, said Mr Grumbar, the police recovered 15 established plants and 41 juvenile ones which would have yielded 2.866lb of flowering head cannabis. The drug sells for about £2,250 a pound. Also found in three locations in the property were 1,844 blue Diazepam tablets. And in a white metal box in an office/meditation room there was £12,890 in cash which the prosecution claimed was the proceeds of drug dealing. After the jury gave its verdict the judge asked whether Mr Dryden-Chouen might now be prosecuted for not paying income tax. He said it would be helpful to know before he passes sentence on the couple whether the Customs and Revenue will be following that up. Mr Grumbar said: 'The Revenue will no doubt be contacted.' Judge McGrigor granted Mr Grumbar's application to have all the drugs and growing paraphernalia found in the house destroyed. Bailing the couple he told them: 'This matter is not entirely over. You are going to be sentenced in relation to the material that was found in the house. All options are still open to the court.'","Katarzyna Dryden-Chouen and her husband Clive grew cannabis at home .

A playground scrap saved a boy’s life when it led doctors to discover a dangerous tumour wrapped around his spine. When Ryan Savage returned from nursery complaining of a tummy ache, his mother Lisa put it down to bruising sustained in rough-and-tumble games with his friends. But at a check-up, it was revealed that Ryan’s pains were in fact a sign of aggressive neuroblastoma which, if left unchecked, could have become untreatable. Ryan Savage (pictured this time last year), seven, was diagnosed with aggressive neuroblastoma after a playground scrap left him with a stomach ache . On Wednesday Ms Savage, 32, received the amazing news that, following an intensive course of treatment, seven-year-old Ryan is now free of cancer. She said: ‘Were it not for the knock Ryan received at nursery, things could have been very different. ‘Neuroblastoma sometimes has flu-like symptoms but Ryan gave none of the signs. It’s often only diagnosed when it’s in its late stages, when it’s too late to do anything. ‘It was an amazing stroke of luck that doctors examined Ryan when they did.’ When he returned from nursery school in October 2009 Ryan, then aged three, rapidly deteriorated. Ms Savage said: ‘I dropped Ryan off at school in the morning. At midday I got a call saying Ryan had been thumped in the tummy while he was playing, as boys do. It was nothing serious. Ryan has just been told he is cancer-free for the first time in four years but his parents are aware the disease could return at any time . Ryan (pictured in hospital) has to have further . check-ups in January but his parents say they are currently just happy . that he is okay for now . ‘But then Ryan refused to eat and was in absolute agony. I took him to hospital, where they first thought the pain was caused by trapped wind. We were sent home, and I was told Ryan would get better. ‘He only got worse. I took him back to hospital where they decided Ryan had constipation. ‘Two days later, he had a high temperature, extreme pain and, worryingly, he couldn’t move his legs. Ryan (pictured at Christmas in 2010) was diagnosed with cancer in October 2009 after doctors found a tumour wrapped around his spine during a check-up after a playground fight . Ryan (pictured in November 2010) received treatment for the tumour in his back before doctors found more tumours in his chest which meant he required further surgery and chemotherapy . ‘I asked to speak a senior trauma doctor . who requested an immediate MRI scan. When he looked at the result the . colour flushed from his face. ‘They told me and my ex-husband Tim, who is Ryan’s father, that we had better sit down. They had found a tumour wrapped around his spine. 'We had to prepare for the worst. They said Ryan could have less than two months to live, and he might not reach Christmas.’ Ryan (pictured with his mother, Lisa) was only given two months to live when he was first diagnosed in 2009 and doctors said he only had a five per cent chance of making a full recovery . Doctors estimated Ryan had just a five per cent chance of making a full recovery. His . devastated parents, who were living in South Africa at the time, . mustered all their strength to support their boy through a course of . strong medication, followed by emergency surgery and a round of . chemotherapy tablets. They were told Ryan, who is a little brother to the couple’s daughter Sheila-Ann, 13, had miraculously entered remission shortly before the family relocated to England in October 2010. But when they got to their new home . in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees, senior clinicians at the Royal Victoria . Infirmary in Newcastle discovered that Ryan’s situation was in fact . graver than anyone realised. Ryan's mother, Lisa, said: 'Were it not for the knock Ryan received at nursery, things could have been very different. It was an amazing stroke of luck that doctors examined Ryan when they did' ‘I . had a feeling - a mother’s intuition - that Ryan wasn’t in the clear,’ said Ms Savage. ‘A professor at the hospital rang to tell me that they’d . found another tumour in his chest. ‘Not only was Ryan not in remission, he was in fact in worse shape that I’d known. It was a terrible blow.’ Ryan . was put on a new regime which required him to brave three different . types of chemotherapy treatments for five days at a time, every three . weeks. He also received stem cell transplants. In 2011 he underwent more surgery to remove cancerous growths, including one which was wrapped around one of his ribs. Ms Savage (pictured with Ryan) said: 'We might have faced a worse-case scenario if we hadn't caught Ryan's illness early. In almost eight out of ten cases, neuroblastoma isn't diagnosed until it's in the last stages' The . treatment exacted a heavy toll on Ryan’s body and, exhausted, he took a . turn for the worse in early 2012. But by March that year the only . tumour left in his body was a growth behind his heart. His . chances of survival began to climb significantly and for the first time . Ryan’s mother dared to dream that her son might pull through. On Wednesday, Ms Savage, a former estate agent, was given the wonderful news that the heart tumour no longer appeared on scans. She said: ‘There’s no evidence of the tumour any more. His blood test is fine. ‘He . has a curvature of the spine and he has hearing and speech . difficulties, but with therapy these challenges can be overcome. It’s no . surprise he’s got some catching up to do - he’s been in hospital so . many times over the course his life. Ryan (pictured with his sister, Shelia-Ann at Halloween 2010) has been left with speech and hearing difficulties. He also now has a curved spine but he now has a chance of survival . ‘We have another test in January and we’re aware that the cancer might come back at any time, but for the moment, we’re so happy. ‘We might have faced a worse-case scenario if we hadn’t caught Ryan’s illness early. In almost eight out of ten cases, neuroblastoma isn’t diagnosed until it’s in the last stages. ‘If it wasn’t for that punch to the tummy, we would never have known it was there.’ Ms Savage paid tribute to the tireless efforts of the staff who brought Ryan back from the brink. She said: ‘Chance played a part, but so did a lot of hard work and generosity. If it wasn’t for the doctors and the people who donated blood and platelets, we would have lost Ryan.’ Neuroblastoma is a rare childhood cancer which develops from nerve cells called neuroblasts. It usually starts in the child's abdomen, often developing in the adrenal glands above the kidneys. It can then spread to other areas such as the bones, liver and skin. The cancer affects about 100 children in the UK each year and is usually diagnosed in under-5s. It is the most common form of solid tumour cancer in childhood after brain tumours. The symptoms depend on where the cancer is and whether it has spread. Initial symptoms often include aches and pains and loss of appetite. The most common symptom when the cancer has developed is a lump or swelling in the child's abdomen. Other possible symptoms are a lump in the child's neck, bone pain, weakness in the child's lower body, anaemia and bluish lumps in the skin. Because the early symptoms are vague, the cancer is often not diagnosed until it has spread around the body. The outlook is better if the child is younger and the cancer is slower growing. It is common for the cancer to return after treatment and treatment tends to be less successful in older children.

It . usually develops within six weeks of giving birth and can come on . gradually or suddenly, and can range from being relatively mild to quite . severe. Sufferers may feel sad or low, unable to cope, and hostile or indifferent to their husband, partner or baby.  They may have thoughts about death, be unable to sleep, and feel hopeless about the future. Many of those who . suffer from it do not want to admit to it, but doctors say that if PND . is diagnosed and addressed, it is likely to pass sooner and to be less . severe. Treatments for PND . include counselling and psychotherapy, and antidepressants, which can be . very effective.  Tranquilisers and sleeping pills may also be offered . for short-term use. Some . women find complementary therapies such as cranial osteopathy, massage, . and reflexology can be a help in reducing symptoms of depression and . anxiety. Practical and . emotional support from friends and family has also been shown to be a . great help to those suffering from PND.  Getting out to meet other . parents can be a lifeline to new mothers who are feeling isolated and . anxious after having a baby, while exercise can also work as an . antidepressant.

Just after Andy Kaufman’s brother told a New York comedy club crowd Monday that the famed comedian known for having an obsession with faking his own death could still be alive, a woman claiming to be Kaufman’s daughter took the stage and claimed it is true. Though the world mourned the Taxi star’s death from lung cancer in 1984, Michael Kaufman told attendees at the 9th Annual Andy Kaufman Awards on Monday that he subsequently found elaborate plans his brother had for pulling off his greatest, and final, public stunt. The unnamed woman’s very believable tale of being raised by Kaufman in obscurity had the audience and conspiracy-loving internet abuzz, but it has now been revealed as a hoax and the woman a hired actress. Scroll down for video... Shocker: A woman took the stage at the 9th Annual Andy Kaufman Awards in New York claiming to Kaufman's brother Michael (right) that she was the late actor's daughter and that he is still alive, living in obscurity . Channeling the master? The woman turned out to be actress Alexandra Tatarsky, whose convincing act had much of the internet, audience members, and Andy Kaufman conspiracy theorists fooled . The Smoking Gun reports that Michael . Kaufman met the actress, 24-year-old Alexandra Tatarsky, at an . exhibition of memorabilia of his brother earlier this year and enlisted . her to carry on a tradition that Kaufman himself began. Michael . Kaufman first primed the audience with a recounting of how he, . following his brother’s death, uncovered the comedian’s plans to stage . his death. Michael said . the plans contained instructions to meet Andy at a restaurant on . Christmas Eve 1999. Michael claimed he did this and was handed a letter . that detailed Andy’s decision to leave the spotlight and live an average . life. Then a mysterious woman took the stage from the audience and her story seemed to match Michael’s tale very well. Mastermind? Kaufman's brother Michael helped laid out the bait for the audience before Tatarsky--who he recruited--did her act . She said Andy had become a stay at home dad after meeting her mother and becoming a father but that he watched the annual awards show dedicated to his memory very closely. Michael . Kaufman appeared shocked and confused by the incident. He asked the . audience if they believed the woman then escorted her offstage and told . attendees to respect her privacy. Years of worth of conspiracy theories about the performance artist suddenly seemed proven as fact. Even audience members who knew that the woman was a student of theater in New York bought the act. Life's dream? The funnyman was notorious for his elaborate stunts, such as his stint as a 'lady' wrestler (left). Kaufman was also well known to be obsessed with the idea of staging his own death .

The move follows news earlier this week that it has been overtaken by Sainsbury’ s in terms of market share, pushing it down to third in the supermarket league. The chain is owned by America’s Wal-Mart, which is the largest and richest supermarket chain in the world, and positions itself as the cheapest of the UK’ s major grocers. ASDA in Clapham, South London: The chain is pledging a new effort to win over shoppers by pledging to spend £1bn on keeping prices low over five years after losing its second-place market share spot to Sainsbury's . Independent research shows it is routinely cheaper than Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, but despite this it has been losing shoppers to thriving budget chains, such as Aldi and Lidl. The group is now pledging a new effort to win over shoppers by pledging to spend £1billion on keeping prices down over the next five years. However, it is unclear whether this scheme will mean real reductions in the cost of putting food on the table or – more likely – efforts to curtail future rises. The company certainly has the financial muscle to demand low prices from suppliers and make savings by buying in bulk, however shoppers have become sceptical about price cut claims. All the major stores make great claims to offer low prices and match the deals of others, however the reality for struggling families is that food bills have risen faster than wages over the last five years. Asda yesterday unveiled a five year strategic plan that will also include hundreds of smaller convenience stores and 1,000 click and collect sites where shoppers can pick up purchases made online. Budget: Independent research shows Asda is routinely cheaper than Tesco, . Sainsbury's and Morrisons, but despite this it has been losing shoppers . to thriving budget chains, such as Aldi (pictured) and Lidl . The chain’s chief executive, Andy Clarke, said stores are performing well and sales in the July to September period were up by 0.3per cent on the previous three months. ‘We’ve continued to invest in lowering prices which has held them down for our customers while driving volume growth,’ he said. And he promised more action on prices, saying: ‘Looking to the longer term, we recognised some time ago that no matter whether the macro economy is slowly improving, every day finances remain under pressure and our customers have less time. Consequently, they are changing the way they live, budget and shop, to adapt to this new economic reality. ‘We regard ourselves as the UK’s leading value retailer and it is against this backdrop that I have today set out our strategic priorities which will improve, extend and expand the business over the next five years. ‘There are three major components to this approach which will redefine value.  First, we will build on our heritage of low prices by rebasing our pricing to the tune of £1 billion. ‘Secondly, we will make a £250 million investment in quality, style and design and thirdly, we will expand Asda to reach new customers in the UK, particularly London and the South East.’","Asda is owned by Wal-Mart, the world's largest supermarket chain .

The parents of four-year-old girl have spoken of their heartbreak after she died just 11 days after being diagnosed with leukaemia. Alexia McArthur’s parents Gaz McArthur and Jade Ellerby were told there was nothing more doctors could do as the disease took hold of their daughter's body. Ms Ellerby, 25, said: ‘I was laid on the bed with her singing her favourite One Direction songs. I had my arms around her and felt her take her last breath.’ Alexia McArthur, four, died just 11 days after being diagnosed with aggressive leukaemia. She had chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant but doctors could not save her . Mr McArthur, 28, added: ‘You couldn’t even call her one in a million - you would need a much bigger number. She was a little star. She touched everyone.’ Alexia, from Kimberworth Park, Rotherham, was taken ill after going to the cinema with her parents. The next morning, she was sent by her GP to Rotherham Hospital where staff suspected leukaemia and transferred her to Sheffield Children’s Hospital. After more tests Alexia was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia - a fast growing blood cancer which affects 350 children a year in the UK. She had treatment including chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant but lost her battle for life last Friday. Ms Ellerby said: ‘After we’d been to the pictures we noticed Alexia had lost her colour and looked yellowish. Since then our world has been turned upside down. Alexia was diagnosed after her parents noticed she had turned 'yellowish'. Her cancer was too aggressive to be successfully treated . ‘It’s happened so quickly. Last Tuesday she took a turn for the worse. She was just staring into the corner of the room. I said “Can you see mummy?” and she said “no”.’ Alexia was moved to intensive care but doctors realised during an MRI scan that no treatment would save the youngster. Ms Ellerby said: ‘She went for the scan and never woke up. Basically it was just a matter of time. ‘They said we could have as long as we wanted but she would either go in her own time or we could make the decision to switch off the machine.

She looked so peaceful and comfortable.’ More than 50 relatives and friends were at the hospital when Alexia died, including her older sister Kenzie, and the family received thousands of messages of support and sympathy. Ms Ellerby, 25, said: 'I was laid on the bed with her singing her favourite One Direction songs. I had my arms around her and felt her take her last breath' Mr McAurthur said: ‘We’re so grateful to the hospital staff for all they did and to everyone for their support.

Lymphoblastic leukaemia is cancer of the lymphocytes - the white blood cells that fight viral infections. Symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia include pale skin, tiredness, breathlessness and repeated infections. It affects about 650 people a year in the UK and is the most common type of cancer in children. Approximately one in every 2,000 children will develop it. About 85 per cent of cases occur in children under the age of 15. The outlook for children with the disease is usually good - almost all children will achieve a period of remission and 85 per cent will be completely cured. The outlook for adults with the disease is less good - only 40 per cent are completely cured. Source: NHS Choices .","Alexia McArthur was diagnosed with leukaemia after turning 'yellowish'

The author of a Jane Austen biography has spoken out against a portrait that will appear on banknotes, claiming it makes the famous novelist look 'dim-witted'. Paula Byrne, writer of The Real Jane Austen, said today she finds the selected image 'unforgivable' as she believes the author 'is made to look like a doll'. Speaking on BBC 4's Today Programme, Dr Byrne compared the portrait to 'a Katie Price makeover'. Scroll down for audio . Dr Paula Byrne spoke out against the portrait of the famous author comparing it to a 'Katie Price make-over' Dr Byrne said she felt the image was 'Victorian' and 'highly sentimentalised', suggesting it 'perpetuates this image she is a safe, cosy writer when she is not.' She said: 'She is a subversive writer, a feminist writer that writes about the social classes' - adding the image had been 'airbrushed' to make the author seem more feminine. But Elizabeth Proudman, of the Jane Austen Society in West Sussex, did not share the biographer's view. 'I agree her eyes are over-larged but she does not look like a doll,' said Ms Proudman, who helped the Bank of England in their selection of pictures. After disagreeing with Dr Byrne's categorisation of the author as a 'proto-feminist', she said: 'Oh come off it. Yes it is prettified and yes she is wearing a bonnet but she always did.' An 1810 watercolor portrait of the author completed by her sister (left), on which an 1870 version (right) was based . The image, known as the Memoir Portrait, is considered to be the only authentic painting of the author, which makes it difficult to know for certain what the she actually looked like. It will replace Charles Darwin on Bank of England £10 notes in 2017, accompanied by the words: 'I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading.' The line is taken from the 1813 novel Pride And Prejudice and is uttered by the character Miss Bingley - an unpleasant woman who has a crush on male protagonist Mr Darcy. However, critics have poked holes in the choice of quotation - which is in fact a vain attempt to seduce Mr Darcy who is busy reading. Indeed, in a bid to distract him from his own book, Miss Bingley professes her love of literature when in fact she is bored senseless with the evening she has spent with a book. Today's heated discussion comes after . the discovery of a second painting of the writer which is said to portray her in a . different light. A second painting was discovered in 2011 that Dr Byrne believes is a more accurate portrait of the author . Dr Byrne uncovered the work in 2011, which she believes shows a different side to the writer she hails as 'the funniest to walk the planet'. She told the Christmas Times: . 'Scholars know there was so much more to her. And for me this new . picture encapsulates – almost too perfectly – that other side. 'She's a professional woman . presenting herself to the world with the tools of her trade. It's the . image of Jane Austen so many of us have been waiting for.' Speaking at the time of her discovery, she said the Memoir Portrait 'annoyed her' as it made the writer seem 'pretty and dim'. The 1870 portrait selected by the Bank of England is based on a watercolor sketch by the author's sister, Cassandra Austen, completed in 1810. It appeared in the pages of A Memoir Of Jane Austen, published after the author's death in 1817. Written by the author's nephew James . Edward Austen-Leigh, the book has been criticised by experts for its . domestic portrayal of Austen-Leigh's 'Dear Aunt Jane.' A second edition was published in 1871, which included previously unknown material written by the Sense And Sensibility author. The portrait of Jane Austen was selected in July after a lengthy campaign to see a female face on banknotes, following the announcement that Winston Churchill would replace Elizabeth Fry on £5 notes. Florence Nightingale was the first woman to be featured, appearing on £10 notes from 1975 until 1994. The decision sparked concern over an apparent lack of female representation as, aside from the Queen who appears on all notes, no women would have appeared. Scottish philosopher, Adam Smith is currently the face of £20 notes, while steam engine manufacturers Matthew Boulton and James Watt appear on the new £50 notes. Boulton and Watt replace Sir John Houblon, the first Governor of the Bank of England.","Dr Paula Byrne said the portrait was 'unforgivable' and 'airbrushed'

Confirmation: This credit card statement the family possess 'proves' that they paid a tip and their bill came to a total of $111.55 as shown on their receipt and that something has gone wrong at the New Jersey restaurant .

The husband said far from being homophobic he actually refused to vote for New Jersey Governor Chris Christie because the governor opposes same-sex marriage. 'Never would a message like that come from us,' he protested. Morales announced last week she would donate thousands of dollars in gratuities from supporters to the Wounded Warrior Project. Suspicious: A reporter from NBC New York went to confront the owners of the restaurant as to why their customer was billed - including their tip - but their gay waitress received an abusive message and no tip . But the wife countered this gesture of apparent good will saying: 'I just felt like people have a right to know that - it's fine if people want to donate to her or to the Wounded Warriors but they're doing it under a false pretense.

I feel sorry for their kids.' Morales later responded that it took every fiber of her being not to spit in the couple's food, but her faith in humanity was now restored.

Arias filed a handwritten motion in Maricopa County Arizona Superior Court on Tuesday asking that Kirk Nurmi be fired as her first attorney, citing his ‘utter poverty of people skills’ and lack of ‘tolerance for my emotional and psychological shortcomings.’ Meanwhile, the convicted killer's Twitter count sent out a plea Monday seeking donations to get 'Justice4Jodi.'

Surrey, leader of the North Downs Pony Club, a fetish club, outside . Guildford Crown Court today . The manager of a fetish club faced court today accused of flogging female slaves in front of a child and inviting the youngster to take part. Brian Thornhill, 'Trainer' at the so-called North Downs Pony Club near Gillingham, Kent, admitted he enjoyed dressing in leather and using whips and torture implements. But the 59-year-old denied engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and other charges relating to possession of extreme pornography. And he claimed that although visitors to the Pony Club - a venue where people dress up in equestrian-themed bondage gear - had taken part while almost completely naked, their activities were entirely non-sexual. The jury at Guildford Crown Court heard when police raided Thornhill's home officers had discovered obscene videos and photographs involving people and a dog. Prosecutor Simon Shannon told the jury: 'It is about his enthusiasm for bondage and bestiality and how he drew a boy into that lifestyle and into his practical fetish for keeping female slaves.' He told the court that Thornhill was arrested after a social worker saw a photograph of him with a naked woman and a teenage boy by his side. Thornhill was charged with engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, including accusations that he performed corporal punishment on 'slave' women in front of the boy. As well as the extreme pornographic photographs, officers searching his home and possessions found 43 video clips of a similar nature, said Mr Shannon. They also discovered a video showing an act which was said to have resulted in, or been likely to result in, serious genital injury, the court heard. Jurors also heard evidence from Thornhill's ex-wife, Sarah Baker, to whom he was married for ten years until 2002. She described how their initially normal sex life had, at his instigation, gradually evolved over the years to include acts which involved inflicting pain on each other. 'I didn’t like it,' she said, 'I don’t like pain. He was very interested in hurting me but he was also interested in my hurting him.' The 59-year-old is alleged to have flogged a female 'slave' in front of a 14-year-old boy and then invited the youngster to have a go. He is also accused of possession of extreme pornographic images and videos . Taking to the witness box himself, Thornhill said the activities he indulged in, in what he called 'the lifestyle,' were all about pleasure. But the 59-year-old denies engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and other charges relating to possession of extreme pornography . He said the advantage was that people . could get a high and it was entirely legal and did not involve hanging . about on street corners for class A drugs. He also insisted that the activities at the Pony Club, despite participants being almost completely naked, were non-sexual. 'In the nearly seven years there I’ve never seen any sex,' he said. 'It’s pure escapism. They just lose themselves. They’re happy.' The defendant denied that the boy had flogged one of the slave women, although Thornhill admitted he had taken her housecoat down and invited the 14-year-old to do so. 'There was nothing sexual behind it,' he said. Charlotte Surley, for the defence, asked: 'What makes you say that?' He replied: 'Because it was way outside of his remit. I personally don’t think he would have been sexually motivated towards that. 'To me and to him there was no difference to trying it out on the settee.' Miss Surley asked: 'What would be the difference between a flogging that would be sexual and this scenario?' The defendant answered: 'It would be between two consenting adults, setting out to enjoy a play scene with each other with the aim of pleasuring each other for the end result.' He said there was 'no similarity whatsoever' between the two scenarios. Thornhill, of South Godstone, Surrey, denies five counts of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and six counts of possession of extreme pornographic images or videos. The trial, before Judge Neil Stewart at Guildford Crown Court, continues.

A burglar has been jailed following a string of break-ins after a Find My iPhone app was used by police to help finally capture him. Ion-Liviu Radita broke into 11 properties over the course of just three weeks, stealing more than 100 pieces of jewellery. In two break-ins, he left an unusual calling card by relieving himself on the homeowners' beds. The 36-year-old's downfall came after an iPad he took from one of his victims allowed detectives to trace him to his home, in Ilford, Essex, through the Find My iPhone app the owner had installed. A police spokesman said: 'Detectives tracked a red Nissan Primera that was seen outside one of the properties and were able to prove that it travelled to Kent at the exact time each of the 11 burglaries were committed. 'A search warrant was carried out at Radita’s property on May 30 and he was found in possession of a jewellery box with about 100 items of jewellery. 'He was arrested and charged with the offences.' Radita, of Ilford, Essex, denied involvement, but was convicted of conspiracy to commit burglary in connection to seven raids in Dartford, Kent - five in the same part of the town in just eight days. He had also carried out break-ins in Sevenoaks and one in Greenhithe, also in Kent. A spokesman for Kent Police said: 'Radita stole laptops, mobile phones, cash and jewellery and in each burglary entry was gained by smashing a back door or window. 'He then placed furniture against the front door to prevent anyone entering while he carried out the burglary. 'In two of the burglaries in Dartford, both in Myrtle Road, he was found to have urinated on the bed.' Radita was found after an iPad like this one that he had stolen was located using the Find My iPhone app (right) Detective Constable Bill Looker of Kent Police added: 'Radita was calculated about the way he went about these burglaries. 'He knew what he was after; laptops, electronic devices and jewellery, which are items he knew he could move on quickly and make a quick buck. 'With the help of the Find My iPhone app, we were able to tie his location down to a small number of addresses and from there it was a case of using other tools available to us such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras to keep tabs and track the car we knew was being used to commit these burglaries. 'The cameras proved the car was in the area of those burglaries at that time and was seen to go back to Essex after they were committed.'

A teenager who drowned on New Year's Eve after jumping off a ferry may have done so for a £100 bet, an inquest has heard. Jordan Cobb, 16, was more than twice over the drink driving limit when he leapt from the boat, as it travelled from Devonport in Devon to Torpoint in Cornwall last year. Plymouth Coroner’s Court was told that the teenager turned to friends and asked: “Shall I jump off?” He then dived off the vessel when it was 230ft (70m) from the shore. The student was initially seen to resurface and swim but the inquest heard how he quickly disappeared from view in the River Tamar. Despite a huge search operation Jordan’s body was not found, until January 16 this year, when it was discovered by a ferry worker. Ian Arrow, coroner for Torbay and South Devon District, ruled that Jordan had died accidentally. He said: 'He had been to meet with friends and all had consumed some alcohol over a period of time and decided to take the ferry to Torpoint. 'I am satisfied from the evidence I have heard that Jordan decided to dive off the ferry. 'We know he entered the water, sadly I conclude he didn’t leave the water. I suspect he died that day. 'We can’t be certain why he dived off, whether it was bravado or for some other reason. I am satisfied he certainly didn’t expect to die.' The inquest heard Jordan, from Plymouth, went to celebrate the new year with friends. Vaughan Boltwood, who had known Jordan for five years, told the inquest they drank Carlsberg and a bottle of Jagermeister together. The Torpoint Ferry in the River Tamar, near Plymouth, Devon . Mr Boltwood did not know how much Jordan drank but said he had personally consumed eight cans of Carlsberg in an hour and a half. At around 8.30pm, the group walked to the ferry and boarded the 9pm boat before playing on games and slot machines. He told the inquest: 'As the ferry approached the Torpoint side, we all moved to the front side of the ferry so we could get off. 'We were all stood around the area and Jordan Cobb said something like ‘shall I jump off?’ I can’t remember what brought this conversation up. 'We were all laughing and not taking the conversation seriously. I walked towards Jordan and he said to me ‘hold my bag for a second’. 'He handed me the bag, walked outside the passenger door, climbed on top of the barrier and dived overboard. 'I could see Jordan go under the water, he re-emerged and began to swim away from the ferry. I lost sight of him. We all began to panic.' Jordan Cobb drowned in the icy river after drinking cans of lager and leaping off the ferry (pictured) The group raised the alarm and a large search operation began in a bid to find the teenager. Holly Glynn, who was out celebrating with friend Nicola Thomas, told how she was walking by the ferry when she saw a group of 'angry lads'. Miss Glynn recognised one of the group, Jack, as a neighbour’s grandson and began to talk to him and another boy called Nathan. She told the inquest that Nathan had told her that he felt that Jordan's disappearance was his fault, because he was the one who was supposed to take a £100 bet to do the jump but the missing boy had done it instead. Miss Thomas, who also spoke at the inquest, said: 'Nathan said ‘it was a bet of £100 and it was me who should’ve jumped it but Jordan did it himself. 'I couldn’t comprehend why anyone would want to do this.' Detective Constable Barry Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, told the inquest how he spoke to Nathan Watch at his home address. He said Nathan confirmed there was talk about someone jumping off the ferry but did not see Jordan - who was known as Cobby - jump in. Ferry worker Philip Barsley discovered Jordan’s body floating on ferry chains in the River Tamar on January 16 this year. Jordan's body was discovered with his headphones still in his ears and attached to his HTC mobile phone, wearing new trainers. His body was identified by distinctive tattoos, including one which reading 'In memory of granddad Cobb' on his arm and a five-pointed star on his ankle. Pathologist Dr Dean Harmse, of Derriford Hospital, said: 'In my opinion, the cause of death was drowning, with the adverse effects of alcohol use.' Jordan’s blood contained 196mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood, which is more than twice the drink drive limit of 80mg in 100ml of blood. Dr Harmse added: 'The alcohol concentration is likely to have resulted in an impairment of motor and cognitive function.' Detective Constable Mike Lugger told the coroner Jordan could not have accidentally fallen from the ferry. He said: 'We have carried out extensive inquiries, part of that is video and witness statements. 'One of the videos does clearly show that Jordan did dive off the side of the ferry. 'Whether it was for a bet or a prank, we cannot say.'","Jordan Cobb had drunk beer and Jagermeister on the night he died .

'Poisoned': Yasser Arafat (pictured here in London in 1997) a chief Palestinian investigator says Israel is the 'only suspect' Israel is the only suspect in the 2004 death of Yasser Arafat, the chief Palestinian investigator in the case says. He was speaking a day after Swiss scientists said the Palestinian leader was probably poisoned by radioactive polonium. The investigator, Tawfik Tirawi, spoke at a news conference held by the Palestinian team that has been investigating Arafat's death. Mr Tirawi said that Arafat did not die a natural death, but was evasive when asked repeatedly whether he believed Arafat was poisoned by polonium. 'It is not important that I say here that he was killed by polonium,' said Mr Tirawi, who heads the Palestinian committee investigating Arafat's mysterious death. 'But I say, with all the details available about Yasser Arafat's death, that he was killed, and that Israel killed him.' At another point, he described Israel as the 'first, fundamental and only suspect in the assassination of Yasser Arafat.' Israel has denied any role in Arafat's death, saying it had politically isolated him at the time and had no reason to assassinate him. 'Let me state this as simply as I can: Israel did not kill Arafat,' Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said on Friday, in response to the latest allegations. 'The Palestinians should stop this nonsense and stop raising these baseless accusations without any shadow of proof,' Mr Palmor added. Mr Arafat's widow, Suha, has called on the Palestinian leadership to seek justice for her husband, saying: 'It's clear this is a crime.' She did not mention Israel but argued that only countries with nuclear capabilities had access to polonium. In another interview she described her husband's death as a 'political assassination' and 'the crime of the century' and called the new testing conclusive for poisoning. She said she could not predict who was behind the death, but added: 'Whoever did this crime is a coward.' Justice: Mr Arafat's widow, Suha, has called on the Palestinian leadership to seek justice for her husband . Arafat died on November 11, 2004 at a French military hospital, at the age of 75, a month after falling ill at his West Bank compound. At the time, French doctors said he died of a stroke and had a blood-clotting problem, but records were inconclusive about what caused that condition. Arafat's grave was opened earlier this year, enabling Swiss, Russian and French scientists to take bone and soil samples for separate investigations. A Swiss team presented its findings on Thursday, saying it found abnormal levels of polonium-210 and lead in Arafat's remains that could not have occurred naturally and that the results ""reasonably"" support the theory that Arafat was poisoned by polonium. They said the timeframe of Arafat's illness and death was consistent with poisoning from ingesting polonium. The substance is rare and lethal even in minuscule amounts, and nine years on, it would be difficult to track down anyone who might have slipped it into Arafat's food or drink. The Palestinians themselves could come under renewed scrutiny, since Arafat was holed up in his Israeli-besieged West Bank compound in the months before his death, surrounded by advisers, staff and bodyguards. Russian findings were summarized on Friday by a member of the Palestinian team, Dr Abdullah Bashir. He said the Russian team also found that Arafat died as a result of a toxic substance, but did not find sufficient evidence to point to polonium as the ""cause of radiation that led to the death.""

The BBC is too big and too left wing and should lose some of its licence fee, the Corporation’s former head of TV news has warned. Roger Mosey claimed the BBC had wrongly kept critics of Brussels, benefits and immigration off the airwaves and veered to the left on many issues. He said it would ‘enrich the nation’ if rival commercial broadcasters had access to some of the licence fee to take on the BBC’s dominance. Warning: Roger Mosey, a former head of news at the BBC who oversaw the London Olympics coverage, said the Corporation had become too big and the licence fee should be shared with other broadcasters . There has been growing pressure on the BBC over the £145.50, with 70 per cent of viewers saying they want it cut or abolished. Tory ministers have warned it could be cut or opened up to other broadcasters if the BBC cannot repair the damage to its reputation caused by the Savile abuse scandal and huge pay-offs to senior managers. Mr Mosey, who was head of BBC Television News and oversaw the BBC’s coverage of the London Olympics, said there should be a debate about how the next licence fee settlement ‘helps pluralism and diversity’. Writing in The Times, Mr Mosey said that while the corporation faced widespread competition in network television, its market share of 70 per cent of all news consumption on both TV and radio was something that ‘even long-term loyalists find uncomfortable’. He suggested that while the BBC's stance of co-ordinating its editorial content across the organisation was a good thing, it can ‘lead to homogeneity’ and conformity. Mr Mosey said: ""On the BBC's own admission, in recent years it did not, with the virtue of hindsight, give enough space to anti-immigration views or to EU-withdrawalists; and, though he may have exaggerated, the former Director-General Mark Thompson spoke of a 'massive bias to the left' in the BBC he joined more than 30 years ago. ‘I share Mark's view that there was more internal political diversity in recent times, but that isn't enough unless it's evident in a wider range of editorial view on air.’ BBC-wide policies on news programmes created 'homogenity' on the right and wrong way to cover issues like benefits and immigration, Mr Mosey warned . The BBC lost £100million in a disastrous takeover of the Lonely Planet travel guide business, an internal report has revealed. In . a damning analysis, the corporation’s governing body accused its . commercial arm BBC Worldwide of getting ‘carried away’ with ‘highly . optimistic’ plans to buy the struggling brand six years ago. It . was forced to sell the business to US-based company NC2 Media at a huge . loss earlier this year, prompting an internal inquiry. The full scale of the waste is . £20million more than was previously thought because BBC Worldwide . continued to inject funds into Lonely Planet despite the fact it failed . to generate the expected profits. The . BBC Trust report criticised the Worldwide division for being ‘too . aggressive’ in its forecasts, saying the potential for the travel guide . to succeed as an online venture was ‘unproven’. Editors’ views are ‘influenced by like-minded peers’ and co-ordination of policies across programmes can lead to homogeneity, he warned. ‘That can be intensified by regulation that sees there being “right” and “wrong” answers. ‘The BBC Trust speaks the language of diversity but in its edicts it promotes conformity, whether it’s about an agreed approach to the science of climate change, “correct” terminology in the Middle East or the way a documentary about benefits should be constructed.’ Mr Mosey said this was not an argument to take a ‘wrecking ball’ to the corporation, but to examine how the licence fee can bring about diversity in broadcasting. He pointed to a past attempt by Channel 4 to launch a radio service to rival the BBC. ‘If that couldn't work as a commercial enterprise, might it enrich the nation if similar bids were open to funding by the licence fee? ‘A properly resourced service independent of the BBC could provide bracing competition and increase choice for audiences.’ He called for the BBC to still have the ‘dominant slice of the licence-fee pie’, but added: ‘The hard question for the corporation is why in a digital age it should have the whole pie to itself forever - when doing something different might be better for the public good.’ This week BBC Director General Lord Hall warned the BBC must end its big spending culture and return to the low-pay era of Morecambe and Wise. He said staff had to get used to the idea of spending . the licence fee money ‘as if it were our own’ and not an endless supply . of cash. He said BBC employees also had to remember their job was to provide programmes which could not be found anywhere else. Culture: Lord Hall said staff at the BBC had to treat the licence fee as if it were their own money . It is thought stars like Graham Norton and Gary Lineker both earn about £1.5million a year at the BBC. But . Lord Hall called for a return to the culture of the 1970s and 1980s, . when the BBC had a reputation for being tight with money and paying in . ‘small cheques’. Speaking . at the CBI annual conference in London, he said: ‘We are owned by . householders who pay the licence fee in this country and we have got to . remember that every time we spend money. ‘There . was a Morecambe and Wise sketch on quite regularly in the 70s and 80s . on the BBC, where Wise would say to Morecambe “Nice suit”. ‘And Morecambe would say to Wise “It’s a BBC suit - small check”. It still works.'","Roger Mosey said more of the licence fee should be open to rivals .

A grandfather spent his final four days of life begging for food and water, his distraught family claim - attributing his suffering to a controversial end-of-life programme. The pensioner's daughter has slammed under-fire Basildon Hospital in Essex accusing staff of treating her dying father without compassion. Ron Jee, From Grays in Essex was admitted to Basildon Hospital in June after suffering a stroke. But when the 80-year-old contracted pneumonia and his condition deteriorated in August doctors placed him on the plan, similar to the Liverpool Care Pathway (LCP), his family claim. A spokeswoman for the hospital said the pathway used at the trust is their own local version of the end-of-life programme. His daughter Christine Coleman, 52, said her father was subjected to four days without food, water and medication. She claimed her elderly father was reduced to begging, leaving his family to resort to dabbing a wet sponge around his mouth in a bid to relieve his suffering. She said: 'He was spending his days crying. 'He was asking us ""am I going to die?"", he knew what was happening to him and it was heartbreaking for us all. We felt helpless, like there was nothing we could do. 'He was begging for water - we had to wet a sponge and put it around his mouth. 'If I did to my dog what they did to my father I would not be allowed to own a dog again. 'No one should have to spend their final days like that.' Mrs Coleman, of Averley near Thurrock, claims her father was placed on the programme, which is usually reserved for patients who are predicted to die within hours of going on to it, prematurely. She said her mother was consulted about doctors' decision to initiate the pathway, but adds that what it would entail was not explained properly. She told the MailOnline: 'If I knew then what I do now there is no way we would have let doctors him on the pathway. 'No one explained to us in detail what it meant. When they (doctors) told us there was nothing they could do, I thought he was hours away from death not days.' The grandmother backed the Government's decision to phase out the controversial LCP, adding: 'It is wrong to treat people like that. My dog was treated better when she had cancer. 'This is not about compensation, I want people to know and be aware so they can prevent it happening to their relatives. 'I have already made my children promise me that they will never allow me to be put on a pathway like this. It is the same as assisted death.' She added: 'Before his stroke he was the life and soul of any party, and even after he suffered a stroke he knew how to enjoy himself. 'We held an 80th birthday party for him in January, he loved it. He was a hardworker and a great dad and grandfather. Everyone thought the world of him.' The controversial LCP, which was designed in the late 1990s by the Royal Liverpool University Hospital's Marie Curie Hospice, aims to reduce suffering in the last hours and days of a dying person's life. A spokeswoman for Basildon Hospital said an investigation into what happened to Mr Jee is still ongoing . The idea behind the Liverpool Care Pathway is to allow people with a . terminal illness to die with dignity regardless of whether they are at . home, in hospital or in a hospice. It was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University . Hospital in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute. It gives doctors the opportunity to review whether further tests or . medication are helpful, to consider how to keep the patient as . comfortable as possible and to decide whether fluids and food should . still be given. It was recommended by the Department of Health as a model of best practice and was adopted by most hospitals. It was introduced because during the 1990s there was increasing . consensus that standards of end-of-life care were patchy and that some . hospices were providing excellent care while others were not. Particular concern was expressed about patients being subjected to . invasive treatment that offered no chance of preventing death and of . people being put through unnecessary suffering by needlessly prolonging . life. It involves doctors withdrawing life-saving treatment, including fluids and drugs or putting patients on continuous sedation if they are deemed close to death. Death typically takes place within 29 hours, studies have found. The idea was to allow terminal patients the opportunity to die with dignity whether they were at home, in hospital or being cared for at a hospice. But the plan has been criticised by some experts and presented as a cost-cutting way to bring about the premature deaths of elderly patients. In July ministers condemned the pathway as 'a national disgrace'. An inquiry – led by Baroness Julia Neuberger – unearthed ‘distressing’ evidence of ‘desperate people', vindicating the Daily Mail’s persistent highlighting of relatives’ concerns last year. Mrs Coleman has lodged a formal complaint with hospital bosses, also cataloging a string of basic-care failings, including a lack of compassion from staff. Her dossier includes claims that her father was left to sleep in urine and faeces-stained sheets and that his call button was left out of his reach. Doctors took the decision to place Mr Jee, who used to work for Thurrock Council, on the pathway on August 5. They found they could no longer connect a food supply to feed the pensioner telling the family his organs were too badly damaged by his illness. He was put into an induced coma and died four days later on August 8. In September the Department of Health announced the hospital - which has been criticised by health inspectors for persistently high death rates - would be paired with the London's Royal Free Hospital in a bid to drive up care standards. The trust is in the process of investigating what happened to Mr Jee. A Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'The trust appreciates that the past few . months have been extremely difficult for Mr Jee's family, and has . offered its apologies face-to-face in a meeting which took place on . Tuesday, October 8. 'The trust is committed to listening and learning. 'As discussed with the family, we will . continue to have an open dialogue with them and will be providing them . with a written response to their complaint once the investigations are . completed.' Baroness Juila Neuberger led a recent inquiry into the Liverpool Care Pathway, recommending it be phased out . In December 2012 it was revealed up to 60,000 patients die on the Liverpool Care Pathway each year without giving their consent, according to a joint study by the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute in Liverpool and the Royal College of Physicians. A third of families are also kept in the dark when doctors withdraw lifesaving treatment from loved ones. Records from 178 hospitals showed that thousands of people on the pathway are left to die in pain because nurses do not do enough to keep them comfortable while drugs are administered. An estimated 130,000 patients are put on the pathway each year. Concerns have been raised that clinical judgments are being skewed by incentives for hospitals to use the pathway. It emerged health trusts are thought to have been rewarded with an extra £30million for putting more patients on the LCP. Critics say it is a self-fulfilling prophecy because there is no scientific method of predicting when death will come. MP Norman Lamb, the care services minister, launched a review in November 2012, saying there had been too many cases of families not being consulted. In July, following an inquiry led by Baroness Julia Neuberger, ministers branded the LCP a 'national disgrace'. The study unearthed 'distressing' evidence of 'desperate' people and vindicated a campaign run by the Daily Mail to highlight relatives' concerns last year. It found families whose loved ones were put on the pathway suffered ‘poor care, appalling communications and of a lack of attention or compassion’. The inquiry heard ‘heartbreaking accounts of people desperately sucking at sponges used to moisten their mouths’. In all, the scathing report made 44 recommendations – including plans to phase out the LCP in favour of a reformed system based on individualised ‘End of Life Care Plans’.In future: . Relatives of people who died on the LCP have broadly welcomed the inquiry and the Government’s promise to put its recommendations into operation. But they questioned how the replacement care plans would work. Lady Neuberger said ‘the LCP was designed for the best reasons and absolutely the right principles lay behind it’. However, she said it had become a ‘tick-box exercise’. Insisting on a complete overhaul, she called for an end to the cash incentives – revealed by the Daily Mail and paid to hospitals that hit targets for numbers of patients on the pathway. She said the cash raised the ‘suspicion that people are being hastened towards death to help the financial situation of the trust’. But while the report said the Liverpool Care Pathway should be phased out in six to 12 months, it left few details of the proposed replacement ‘End of Life Care Plans’. Lady Neuberger said a new system of ‘guides and alerts’ should be individually tailored to patients, backed by medical professionals and patients, and inspected by the Care Quality Commission.","Daughter said Ron Jee survived without food or water for FOUR days .

Jeremy Bamber's father had a premonition that there would be a shooting shortly before he, his wife, and their daughter and grandsons were shot dead, it was revealed today. Nevill Bamber, who was murdered with his family by their adopted son Jeremy in their Essex farmhouse in August 1986, told his farm secretary he thought he might die in a serious shooting accident just weeks before the slaughter. Barbara Wilson, who worked at the Bambers' farm before and after the murders, has told a new investigation that the atmosphere at White House Farm in Tolleshunt d'Arcy changed dramatically a few months beforehand. Nevill and June Bamber, both 61, were shot dead by their adopted son Jeremy, right - Nevill foresaw his death . Sheila Caffell, Jeremy Bamber's adoptive sister, and her twin sons Daniel and Nicholas, six, were killed . She said the elder Mr Bamber looked tired and worried and told her he feared something appalling was going to happen. Mrs Wilson said: 'For some weeks he looked really drawn and ill.  He seemed to stoop and seemed to have the worries of the world on his shoulders. 'I thought he might have cancer... He said he hadn't got anything like that but he had got great problems. 'I asked him to elaborate and he said that he thought he might die.  I said ""What makes you think that?"" and he said there might be a serious shooting accident.' 'Knowing what had been going on, [I] thought that he knew that Jeremy was going to perhaps shoot him.' Weeks later, Nevill and June Bamber, their model daughter Sheila, 28, and her six-year-old twins Nicholas and Daniel were shot dead at the Essex farmhouse. Killing scene: White House Farm, at Tolleshunt D'Arcy, where the mass murder took place in August 1986 . Accused of the murders, privately-educated Jeremy Bamber told the court his father rang him in the middle of the night to say that Sheila had gone mad, before the phone went dead. He claimed his sister, who developed schizophrenia, had shot everyone before shooting herself, but prosecutors said this was impossible because a silencer was found with Sheila's blood on it, and Bamber was found guilty on a 10-2 majority verdict. In a TV interview for a new documentary, Countdown To Murder, Mrs Wilson said that Bamber, now 52, would provoke his mother, June, by riding his bike round and round her in circles, trying to hit her. She said he also once left a bag of live rats in his adopted mother's car, while he would torment his magistrate father by wearing make-up in public. Bamber, now 52, has always maintained his model sister Sheila, right, killed her family in a psychotic episode . Mrs Wilson added: 'Jeremy would put over a face of being a very sort of nice person and then he would go and do something really nasty... 'There seemed to be an awful lot of bickering.  Sometimes when Jeremy came up they would have a hectic row... Whenever Jeremy was around the atmosphere was so different.' She said that when Bamber took over his father's farm after the murders, she never once saw him grieving for his family. 'I wanted to shout out to him ""I know what you've done"" but I didn't have the guts to do it.... 'I think I might have ended up the same way as Mr and Mrs Bamber.' Jeremy Bamber, seen here with his then girlfriend Juilie Mugford at one of the funerals after the slaughter . Detectives investigating the murder found a silencer with Sheila's blood on it. It was argued that without a silencer, the 25 shots that were fired would have alerted the victims to the danger.  And if the silencer had been attached to the gun, it would have been too long for Sheila to have shot herself with it. The prosecution argued that Jeremy Bamber had no interest in inheriting his father's business, but wanted the £436,000 family fortune. When Nevill Bamber offered his son a job on the farm in 1986, it was the catalyst for the younger man, who lived in a cottage provided by his parents a few miles away, to plan a way to get the money for himself. Bamber, one of only 38 prisoners in England and Wales serving a whole-life sentence, has pleaded innocence consistently since he was sent to jail in September 1986. However despite several appeals and reviews, and despite former Tory MP Andrew Hunter saying last month that he believed Bamber was innocent, the mass murderer remains in jail.

More than a decade after fragments of an ancient Egyptian collar were found in Greece, an artist has pieced the 2,300-year-old ornate item of jewellery back together. The collar is painted in a variety of colours and features images depicting the Egyptian god Horus as well as goddesses believed to be Isis and Nephthys, the goddess of mourning. Researchers from Penn State University found the fragments in a tomb in Thebes, north of Athens, and it is thought to have been worn by the mummy of an undertaker, or Padihorwer. Researchers from Pennsylvania found fragments of the collar, pictured, in a tomb in Greece. The 16-inch jewellery is painted in a variety of colours and shows the ancient Egyptian god Horus among other religious symbols of that time including the jackal-headed Anubis, associated with the afterlife . There were two main types of collars . worn by ancient Egyptians. Wesekh collars, which means wide . collars, were traditionally made of beads and worn by by royalty, . although not exclusively. When a person died, a collar made from cartonnage was painted with religious or traditional ancient Egyptian symbols and presented to the deceased by family members. After a person was mummified, the collar was fitted and buried with the mummy. The human remains of the mummy who wore the collar found in Thebes have been removed, yet a mud-clay seal discovered nearby suggests it belonged to a wealthy undertaker, also known as Padihorwer. Researchers claim ancient records additionally confirm that such a man was buried in . Thebes at the same time. Also pictured on the collar is a Ba bird – a bird with a human head – which is said to represent the soul of the mummy and lotus flowers blossoming, which were a symbol of Upper Egypt. There is additionally a deity pictured that researchers claim is Anubis, a god with a jackal’s head associated with mummification and the afterlife. Anubis was the son of goddess Nephthys. The collar is made from an ancient Egyptian material called cartonnage, traditionally created using linen or papyrus covered with plaster. Fragments of the 16.5-inch collar were found during excavations in 2000 and 2002 by a team of researchers led by Professor Susan Redford. When pieced together, the collar is almost nine inches tall. Professor Redford told LiveScience that the fragments ranged from ‘palm-sized to dime-sized’ and described the project as a ‘giant jigsaw puzzle’. The human remains of the mummy who would have worn the collar are thought to have been removed or destroyed, yet Redford also found a mud-clay seal nearby that gives clues to its owner. The human remains of the mummy who wore the collar found in Thebes have been removed, yet an inscription written in a mud-clay seal, pictured, found near the fragments suggests it belonged to an undertaker, or Padihorwer. It is thought the collar was presented to him as he was mummified . An inscription on the seal makes reference to a man called Padihorwer, believed to be a wealthy undertaker, and ancient records confirm that such a man was buried in Thebes at the same time, according to Redford.

Campaigners are calling for a rationing ban to be lifted on a drug that gives an extra nine months of life to women with ovarian cancer. The drug, Avastin, slows the advance of the disease, meaning that sufferers can experience extra months of quality life with their families, according to new trial data. Doctors claim it is the first major advance for almost 20 years in tackling the disease, known as the ‘silent killer’ because women are often diagnosed too late for a cure. Avastin, slows the advance of the disease, meaning that sufferers can experience extra months of quality life with their families, according to new trial data . Ovarian cancer affects almost 7,000 women a year and kills more than 4,000 women - the disease claims the lives of over 85 per cent of patients if found at a late stage when it has spread to other parts of the body. Around 2,000 women a year could benefit from Avastin, but earlier this year it was rejected for routine NHS use for ovarian cancer by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) on cost grounds. The drug which costs around £25,000 for an average patient, has been made available in England through the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF), although funding is due to run out in two years’ time. The fund does not serve women in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The new data found when women at highest risk of their cancer recurring received Avastin in combination with chemotherapy, and then continued maintenance Avastin, they lived on average 9.4 months longer. The survival average was 39.7 months compared with 30.3 months for women on chemotherapy alone. Avastin is the first drug that has . been shown to improve outcomes for women with advanced ovarian cancer in . recent years and can halt the progression of first-line disease for an . average of an additional six months, compared to chemotherapy alone. Data . was presented at the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO) meeting in Liverpool from the international phase III ICON7 study of . 1,528 ovarian cancer patients, which included 46 trial centres in the . UK. Ovarian cancer affects almost 7,000 women a year and kills more than 4,000 women - the disease claims the lives of over 85 per cent of patients if found at a late stage . Study leader oncologist Dr Tim Perren, from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, said: ‘The improvements in overall survival for women with high risk advanced ovarian cancer treated with Avastin are a real breakthrough. ‘We already knew Avastin delays the time to disease progression for women with this disease. ‘We now know Avastin also significantly extends some patient’s lives. Avastin is well tolerated and although treatment has to continue for a total of 12 months this is acceptable to most patients. ‘Ovarian cancer currently has the worst outcomes of all gynaecological cancers and halting disease progression for six months is an important step forward in treating this condition.’ Annwen Jones, chief executive of Target Ovarian Cancer charity said: ‘This new survival data for women treated with Avastin, who have the highest risk of their ovarian cancer recurring, is extremely positive. ‘Avastin is the first new life-extending drug in 20 years, and could potentially benefit up to 2,000 women a year in the UK. We hope that National Institute of Health and Care Excellence and the Scottish Medicines Consortium will now reconsider their earlier negative decisions on the drug and work with the manufacturer to secure NHS access for all those who could benefit. ‘Women in England are given access to the drug currently through the Cancer Drugs Fund, but those living in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have no such guarantees. ‘We believe women should get the drug according to clinical need and not their postcode, and we hope this new data will help strengthen equality of access.’ Avastin, made by Roche which is also known as bevacizumab, is already widely used in patients with colon cancer, and doctors believe it will become a standard treatment for ovarian cancer. Avastin is a ‘targeted’ cancer therapy that works by blocking the development of new blood vessels and interfering with the tumour’s ability to grow and spread to other parts of the body.","Avastin can give ovarian cancer patients an extra nine months of life .

"PUBLISHED: . 15:28 EST, 9 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:17 EST, 9 November 2013 . Since going public on Thursday, Twitter is valued in the multi-billions. And in less than a week, the social media powerhouse co-founder Jack Dorsey's value on paper soared to more than $865million. While Twitter's market capitalization, based on its stock price, fell back to around $22.6billion Friday after topping $24billion Thursday, the highly anticipated IPO did not disappoint Twitter bosses, who became multi-millionaires overnight. But Time Magazine says Twitter's 230million unpaid employees/active users deserve part of the cut. Their argument being - millions of tweeters are responsible for generating site's content, thereby building Twitter ad revenue and thus are owed for their feeds. Twitter went public on INovember 7, 2013. Now worth billions, how much does the social media site owe its followers? Millions according to Time Magazine . According to the social media site, active users are responsible for creating 500million Tweets per day. Celebrity tweeters like Katy Perry and Justin Bieber drive mass amounts of people to Twitter everyday. According to Time, Dorsey and fellow Twitter bosses should feel especially indebted to celebrities like Perry. The singer recently overtook Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter. The 29-year-old star now has 46,903,486 subscribers to her account - compared to Bieber's 46,737,099. With 40.5milllion subscribers, Lady Gaga . is a bit more popular on Twitter than President Barack Obama who is . followed by 39.5million. Justin Bieber's nonstop tweets are followed by 46,737,099 people. According to an equation devised by Time Magazine, the singer is owed a whopping $20,916,384. Time came up with a . equation to determine just how much of the cut people like top tweeters, Perry,  Bieber . and the President deserve. It's based on number of followers and tweets per day. According to Time's formula, Bieber, a nonstop tweeter, is due a . whopping $20,916,384 while President Obama is owed just over $5million. Kim Kardashian, Rhianna, Ashton Kutcher and Perry are each owed several . million for their devotion to the site. Katy Perry recently overtook Justin Bieber as the most followed person on Twitter. The 29-year-old star now has 46,903,486 subscribers. According to Time Magazine's equation, Twitter owes her over $4million . By dividing a person's tweets by the number of days they have had a Twitter account and then multiplying that amount by the number of followers, Time has determined how many potential eyeballs per day a Tweeter generates. That number is then multiplied by 25 per cent. (The magazine cited a study that 'suggests that around three-quarters of tweets are ignored.

Ryan Guntrip, 21, told his girlfriend he wished he had never got her pregnant before punching her in the stomach . A man who told his girlfriend he wished he had never got her pregnant before punching her in the stomach has been jailed after she lost the baby. A medical examination carried out the day after Carina MacKay miscarried revealed that the baby had died, but prosecutors could not prove Ryan Guntrip, 21, was responsible. Colchester Magistrates’ Court heard yesterday that he and Ms MacKay had been arguing at her home in Clacton, Essex, where he was staying on June 18 this year. He flew into a rage, told her he wished he’d never got her pregnant and punched her in the stomach. He also put his arms on her shoulders to move her out of the way, the court heard. The next morning Ms MacKay noticed she was bleeding and went for tests, which revealed the baby was dead. The court heard she was in the early stages of pregnancy and medics could not be certain what caused the baby’s death. Guntrip, who has a history of violence, admitted assault by beating. He was out on licence at the time of the incident for a previous domestic assault, the court heard. District Judge John Woollard jailed Guntrip for 16 weeks. He said: 'You have an appalling record of violence. I’m not sentencing you for the tragic consequences. 'The crown has decided it can’t prove what caused it, but you did punch a woman in the stomach when she was expecting a child.' A medical examination carried out the day after Carina MacKay miscarried revealed that the baby had died, but prosecutors could not prove Guntrip, 21, was responsible . Speaking after the hearing, Ms MacKay, a restaurant supervisor said: 'I was so angry when I heard he had only been sentenced to 16 weeks. 'In my eyes, he deserved a lot longer.' She said the couple had been on the verge of breaking up when Guntrip attacked her.  She said: 'He was really drunk and was throwing things around the room in our flat. 'I had told him that I did not want to be with him anymore and it was then that he punched me in the stomach. 'It was a single punch - his arm was against his waist and then he threw it forward and I felt a sharp, shooting pain and then it subsided. Guntrip has been jailed for 16 weeks after she lost the baby. Colchester Magistrates' Court heard yesterday that he and Ms MacKay had been arguing ahead of the assault . 'He was saying he regretted getting me pregnant - I did not know what was going through his mind but I was so scared.' The following morning she said she noticed she was bleeding and a hospital scan revealed her baby had died. It was eight weeks and five days old. Ms MacKay said medics told her the baby was eight weeks and five days old when it died in her womb . Ms MacKay added: 'It was horrible - I had lost a baby before so for this to have happened was just so upsetting. 'Seeing . the picture of the baby made it hard to take but Ryan did not care. He . just said 'there's no reason for us to have contact anymore now'.' Medics told Miss MacKay that they could not prove the punch killed the child. According to her, when the couple first met in December 2012, Guntrip was the perfect gentleman. But Guntrip was out on licence following a prison sentence for an attack on his ex-girlfriend, she said. She . said: 'When we got together I did not know he had been in prison - it . was only three months into the relationship that I found out.' 'I asked him what it was for and he admitted it was for beating up his ex girlfriend. 'But . I was not too worried at the time because at the beginning, he was the . perfect gentleman. He looked after me and cared for me and was always . there for me. 'If I needed him, he would be there and he was also very protective of me.' She said things deteriorated when their relationship started to break down, and he began to drink heavily. She added: 'I just hope that by speaking out, it will mean that other girls won't end up in the same situation that I was in. 'I . have moved on with my life now, but I know there are other people who . are in abusive relationships and they should get help as soon as they . can, ' she said. The court also made a restraining order, banning Guntrip from contacting Ms MacKay, going to the street where she lives or to her grandmother’s house. Roger Brice, mitigating, said Guntrip wants closure and said there is no link between this incident and the tragic consequences. He said Guntrip has been using his time in custody productively.","Prosecutors could not prove Ryan Guntrip, 21, was responsible for death .

Just six people successfully enrolled in health insurance plans through healthcare.gov during the first day of the Obamacare system's operation, according to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services meeting notes released Thursday night by a congressional committee. By the end of the second day, a total of 248 people nationwide had bought insurance policies through the federal government's online portal, whose disastrous launch has become the stuff of late-night TV jokes and a Saturday Night Live skit. The bombshell documents reflect summaries of 'war room' meetings held at least twice a day during the system's chaotic start by a technology working group inside the Center for Consumer Information & Insurance Oversight, a CMS division tasked with putting the website's plan into action. Turned over by a private Obamacare contractor at the request of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, . not by the Obama administration, the four pages paint a picture of a . multidisciplinary team trying to right a sinking ship, and collecting . statistics as it takes on water. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . We signed up how many? President Obama will have a new round of explaining to do, now that enrollment numbers have leaked out of a 'war room' set up to solve the healthcare.gov website's countless tech problems . On the morning following the first full day of the healthcare.gov website's operation, troubleshooters learned that just 6 people had successfully signed up for new health insurance plans . 'Six': Fox News host Megyn Kelly shows that she can count the Obamacare website¿s first-day success stories on two hands . The committee issued a subpoena for . similar documents from the Department of Health and Human Services after . the agency stalled for three weeks on requests from chairman Rep. Darrell Issa. Committee staff provided the documents to reporters on Thursday . evening while the White House was in the middle of a trick-or-treating . event for children of military families. The Obama administration has said publicly that 4.7 million unique website visitors came to healthcare.gov in its first 24 hours beginning at midnight on Tuesday, October 1. But war room meeting notes from the following morning showed that 'six enrollments have occurred so far with 5 different [insurance] issuers.' The lucky few chose insurance policies with BlueCross BlueShield North Carolina; BlueCross BlueShield Kansas City; the Ohio-headquartered CareSource; and Healthcare Service Corporation, a Chicago-based company that sells BlueCross BlueShield plans in Illinois, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas, . By the afternoon of Oct. 2, war room meeting notes reflected 'approximately 100' successful enrollments. That number grew, modestly, to a total of 248 by day's end, according to notes from the morning meeting on Oct. 3. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Marilyn Tavenner refused to provide hard numbers to the House Ways and Means Committee on October 29, saying only that 'We'll have that information available until mid-November' Kiss of death: A website that wasn't adequately tested, and was built for a relatively small traffic load, had no chance on day one, and the enrollment figures are proof . Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Fox News Channel on Thursday evening that the documents 'appear to be notes' and don't reflect official totals, which the agency has repeatedly said it plans to withhold until mid-November. 'We are focused on providing reliable and accurate information and we do not have that at this time. ... We have always anticipated that the pace of enrollment will increase throughout the enrollment period,' she said. Hedging his bets? On Oct. 21, Obama said 'the number of people who have visited the site has been overwhelming ... [and] thousands of people are signing up' The full open enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act will last for six months, ending March 31. By then, the administration hopes 7 million Americans will enroll in medical insurance plans through healthcare.gov and the similar websites run by 14 states and the District of Columbia. At that rate, the government needs to find about 38,500 new paid enrollees every day, on average. some of the state-run programs have faced their own challenges. Halfway through October, Delaware's exchange reported signing up just one person, Alaska had enrolled seven, and Wisconsin's total was less than 50. By October 18, Oregon conceded that it hadn't yet processed any applications for private insurance through its exchange. Sources inside HHS told MailOnline in mid-October that 52,000 people nationwide had completed applications for coverage by the end of the first week of October. That number likely included consumers whose applications weren't processed immediately, but also a much larger number who elected to sign up for Medicaid coverage instead of enrolling in plans they will pay for themselves. Those Medicaid enrollments will add only to the overall cost of the Affordable Care Act – unlike private insurance policies, whose premiums will subsidize the expense of medical care provided to others in the system. Pants on fire? 'We do not have any reliable data around enrollment,' insisted HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius on October 30 during a congressional hearing. 'The system isn't functioning, so we're not getting reliable data' House oversight committee chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, an anti-Obamacare partisan, released the documents on Thursday night, which his committee got from a private contractor doing work on the Obamacare website . Obama spoke to adoring throngs in Boston this week, including one fan whose 'I (heart) Obamacare' cast he gladly signed . Numbers from the war room meetings include only the successful sign-ups completed through healthcare.gov, not through any of the state-based insurance exchanges. They also, according to an HHS spokesperson who talked to CBS News, do not include applications from people who chose to fill out paper applications or register by telephone. But those other methods, along with assistance from 'navigator' program helpers, also rely on the website. Cal center operators and navigators enter consumers' information into the website in real-time, and a contractor enters handwritten information into the website days or weeks after ink hits paper. Given the tech woes that plagued healthcare.gov early on – and continue to knock it offline on a regular basis – it's unlikely anyone had significantly greater success. Medical insurance industry consultant Robert Laszewski told Fox News that 'the White House does not want insurance companies talking about what's going on here.' 'If four weeks ago the enrollment numbers were public,' he said, 'it would look very bad. I can tell you based upon the information that I continue to get, this trickle of enrollment ... for the first three days has really continued for the first month.'

The lives of one out of two Britons are so hectic they never have time for a lie-in, according to a survey. More men than women - 49 per cent compared with 41 per cent - complained they don’t have lazy mornings. With the prospect of an extra hour in bed when the clocks go back this weekend, the poll found that only a quarter ‘regularly’ or ‘always’ sleep through the night. Rarity: 49 per cent of women surveyed complained that they don't have lazy mornings . When asked how often they had a lie-in, 44 per cent of those polled said they 'never' enjoyed one. People in Northern Ireland have the most lie-ins, followed by the South East and Scotland, while those in the South West have the fewest. Parents may not be surprised to hear that people aged 16 to 24 have more lie-ins than other age group while those aged 55 and over miss out the most. Although many Britons would like more sleep, 48 per cent said they were unwilling to give up anything to spend longer in bed. Just nine per cent said they were prepared to spend less time with friends, four per cent less time with loved ones and two per cent less time with their children. One in five would sacrifice watching their favourite TV shows, 15 per cent 'pampering' time and 3 per cent part of their salary for extra sleep. Troubled: The survey of more than 2,000 people suggested that quality of sleep is an issue for many . The survey of 2,044 UK adults also suggests that quality of sleep is an issue for many, with just a quarter either either 'regularly' or 'always' sleeping through the night. In contrast, 42 per cent wake in the middle of the night, 30 per cent toss and turn most nights and 29 percent take a long time to nod off. Furthermore, almost a quarter said they tended to wake too early. But it seems people still turn to traditional methods when they need to get to sleep. Reading a book was the most popular choice, followed by listening to music and herbal remedies, while counting sheep was fifth. Twice as many men (31 per cent) than women (16 per cent) said they never did anything to help them drop off at night. Dr Nerina Ramlakhan, Silentnight’s sleep expert and a sleep therapist at Capio Nightingale Hospital, said: 'Many people are simply too busy these days to enjoy a lie in, so it’s hardly surprising that almost half of us never get to treat ourselves. 'Although a good night’s sleep is clearly a problem for many people, only a minority are prepared to sacrifice doing other things to get it, whether that’s spending time with people close to them or even watching their favourite TV shows. 'But sleep deprivation can have a huge impact on people’s lives so it’s important they evaluate their lifestyle to ensure they are not burning the candle at both ends - getting enough sleep is important for everyone’s well-being.'","Survey of more than 2,000 people found Britons yearn for more sleep .

The Obamacare website went down on Sunday night after a connectivity issue at its data center - in the latest problem to hit the health insurance program's troubled rollout. The data center, operated by Verizon's Terremark, experienced the connectivity issue during planned maintenance - halting online enrollment at Healthcare.gov for uninsured Americans across 50 states. It came just hours after Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius praised the data services hub, writing online: 'The Hub is on the job, and so are we.' The data center issue also affected similar sites operated by 14 states and the District of Columbia, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Oops: The website for Obamacare went down on Sunday after connectivity issues at its data center . Latest issue: A connectivity problem at the data center responsible for running Healthcare.gov - the beleaguered website for Obamacare - forced it to crash across all 50 states on Sunday . Separate technical problems that have . stalled enrollment on Healthcare.gov since its launch on October 1 are . at the heart of a new Republican effort to discredit the healthcare law, . largely through congressional investigations to determine what went . wrong in building the costly sign-up system. Sebelius is due to testify later this week before a House of Representatives committee, while contractors work around the clock to improve the site. The outage that started in the early hours of Sunday caused the data center to lose network connectivity with the federal government's data services hub, an electronic traffic roundabout that links the online health insurance marketplaces with numerous federal agencies and can verify people's identity, citizenship, and other facts. Without the hub, consumers are unable to apply online for coverage or determine their eligibility for federal subsidies to help pay for insurance premiums. On Saturday, Sebelius praised the hub's . ability to perform complex calculations in quick time as an example of a . successful segment of the system. Troubled: Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, pictured on Friday, will testify later this week before a House of Representatives committee about the problems faced by the site . HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters said Sebelius spoke with Verizon's chief executive officer on Sunday afternoon to discuss the situation: 'They committed to fixing the problem as soon as possible.' The outage was affecting enrollment in all 50 states, as well as Terremark customers not connected with the marketplaces, according to the HHS spokeswoman. She said the data center's network connectivity went down during planned maintenance to replace a failed networking component. A spokesman for Verizon said the problem would be fixed 'as soon as possible'. 'Our engineers have been working with HHS and other technology companies to identify and address the root cause of the issue,' Verizon spokesman Jeff Nelson said. The administration has expressed confidence it can fix underlying problems with Healthcare.gov by early December, in time for people to meet a December 15 deadline to enroll in new health plans to receive benefits on January 1. Struggle: As Obama encourages people to sign up for the healthcare, Congressional Republicans are waging war against the hapless site and hoping it leads to the destruction of the system . Further delays would jeopardize its ability to enroll as many as 7 million Americans for coverage during Obamacare's first year. Sebelius, who faces Republican calls for her resignation, will be grilled about her role in the Obamacare rollout on Wednesday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Contractors have already blamed the administration for not conducting enough vital system-wide testing and for a last-minute design change requiring online visitors to set up accounts before window-shopping for insurance. The change is widely blamed for creating early bottlenecks as millions of people flooded the website. Health officials in Connecticut, one of the 14 states that constructed their own marketplaces, were the first to report on Sunday that potential customers would not be able to complete the sign-up process for some services but could create accounts and search for pricing comparisons.","Uninsured Americans were unable to enroll at Healthcare.gov after site went down in the early hours of Sunday .

Doctors have not been able to explain why Jameson Davis' arms stopped growing in utero. The eighteen-month-old was born without hands and only partial arms. But thanks to a team of engineers and technicians in Portland, Oregon, the adorable toddler has been fitted with state-of-the-art bionic limbs. The new arms, designed by the team at Advanced Arm Dynamics, are powered by Jameson's own muscles. When he goes to grab something, the downward movement of his triceps activates the hands to reach and then close. Rehab coordinators at the center had to develop a way to keep the little guy interested while showing him to use the 'new toys', and so he was taught to operate them by picking up M&Ms. Scroll down for video . Lucky: Despite being born without hands, Jameson Davis, 1, was fortunate to get feeling in his nubs. He has taught himself to use what he was given to the best of his ability. But now he has been fitted with bionic arms . Even without fully-grown arms, Jameson Davis does pretty well on his own. His parents moved to Portland to get him the treatment he needs. He has become so use to the arms he does have he can even pick up a penny from the ground . Testing out the new toys: This is the moment Jameson Davis first tries out his bionic arm . Jameson Davis may be the youngest person ever to have been fitted with prosthetic arms. He is eighteen-months-old . Learning fast: Jameson Davis manages to grab the finger of rehab specialist Kerstin Baum, who taught the toddler to use the arms with toys and candy . Rehab specialist Kerstin Baum said the main issue in teaching Jameson was keeping him focused and looking ahead to work out what he'll want to do in the future, such as ride a bike. 'What kinds of things is he interested in - what does he like to play with - that's what we had to work out,' she said. Engineer Mac Lang, who created the bionic limbs using information from Baum, said it is major development giving such advanced equipment to a child. 'We wanted to make it as functional as possible to give him the best ability to use it and to want to use it,' he said. Because of their size, the arms will only last Jameson until he is three. He will have to get new arms every few years until he is a fully grown man. Taking candy from a bionic boy: Specialists had to teach Jameson Davis to grab for the first time. They did so by using things that he wanted to reach out to, such as M&Ms . These new arms have expandable fittings and will last Jameson until he is about three. He will need to get new arms ever couple of years as he grows, up until he is an adult . A community outreach program has been opened to help the Davis family fund Jameson's expensive arms. They are only partially covered under insurance . 'We just wanted to be able to give him the tools that other little kids have,' his mother, Brooke Davis said. Jameson's father Jim Davis said that, thanks to the advancement of technology, bionic limbs are getting better and better. 'Imagine where prosthetics will be when he's in high school,' he said. 'I mean, imagine the possibilities. 'So why not give him the tools available so that as he grows up, that's what he knows.' Scientists believe that by the time Jameson is an adult, he won't need to operate the prosthetic s with his muscles. That is because he will be able to use his brain. Jameson's parents, Brooke and Jim Davis, moved to Portland so they could give their son the treatment he needs and are happy with the results so far . Doctors still don't know why Jameson's arms stopped growing in the womb. Apart from his impairment he was born a healthy baby . Advanced Arm Dynamics engineer Mac Lang, who created the bionic limbs, explain how they work. Mr Lang said that like any child, Jameson will break an arm, but they will be able to fix it . The Davis', from Spokane, said they couldn't believe the support they had recieved for their son. A community outreach program was started in Jameson's name to help the family fund his expensive medical bills. Over $25,0000 has already been raised. 'We couldn't ask for any more for our baby, the love that we felt from the community is awesome,' mom Brooke said.

An Army machine gunner accidentally shot his colleague several times by mistake in Afghanistan in just one of a catalogue of military gun blunders, it can be revealed. The guardsman from the First Battalion of the Welsh Guards hit his colleague repeatedly in the leg at Camp Bastion with the light machine gun in April last year. It is unclear if he was disciplined following the accident and the Ministry of Defence refused to release any further details. Fatal gun accident: Fusilier James Wilkinson, 21, who was shot dead by mistake in 2011 as his colleagues took a barrel off a machine gun in Kenya . An investigation found soldiers have accidentally shot themselves 14 times and hit colleagues three times with stray bullets in the last two years. In total, there were 30 recorded cases where troops have fired off their guns by mistake since January 2012, according to figures released to MailOnline under the Freedom of Information Act. All the incidents came after Fusilier James Wilkinson, 21, was shot dead by mistake in 2011 as his colleagues took a barrel off a machine gun during a live firing exercise while it was was pointed directly at him. In other incidents: . There are fears the total number of gun accidents may be far higher as troops are only obliged to report negligent discharges where there are injuries. Gun accident victim: Fusilier Wilkinson, of Bury, Greater Manchester, from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed by his own men in an accident in Nanyuki, Kenya, in 2011 . Critics said that troops cannot properly be held to account unless all gun accidents are properly recorded. Fusilier Wilkinson, of Bury, Greater Manchester, from the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, was killed by his own men in an accident in Nanyuki, Kenya, in 2011 which was described as 'wholly and utterly avoidable' at a court martial. The weapon jammed during an exercise - and Fusilier Wilkinson was shot in the neck as troops removed the barrel to inspect it. Staff Sergeant Patrick Price and Corporal Colin Bell were jailed for 21 and 14 months respectively after being found guilty of negligently performing a duty by the court martial. A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said the figures should be viewed 'in context'. 'Of approximately 6000 personnel currently serving in Afghanistan all carry a personal weapon and some personnel may have two, for example a pistol and a rifle,' he said. 'All military personnel are required to train on live weapons as part of routine military training. In order to maintain operational effectiveness approximately 180,000 serving members of the Regular Armed Forces will regularly train with live ammunition.

A court yesterday heard the two had been arguing for hours, and when they got home to their flat in Rumney, Cardiff, Neil attacked his son. Fight: Convicted father Neil Davies, 53, (pictured left) told Cardiff Crown Court he stabbed his son son Joshua, 24, (pictured right) while he was making sandwiches late at night. The pair were three times over the drink limit . Joshua's jugular vein burst in the attack - and his distraught father rang 999 to say: 'I just stabbed my son, please help'. A neighbour overheard Davies crying: 'He’s dying, what have I done, what have you done?' He later told police: 'He is my boy - he’s a boxer and gave me a black eye.' The pair had been drinking for almost 12 hours at a pub and a British Legion club in Cardiff. They had been watching the final day of last season’s Six Nations competition in March when Wales beat England by a record score of 30-3. CCTV footage at the club showed the couple pushing each other and arguing shortly before they left just after midnight before heading home, Cardiff Crown Court heard.

Tory MPs hit out last night after the global boss of Nissan warned that his company would ‘reconsider’ its future in the UK if the country left the European Union. Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of the Japanese car giant, said it could pull its investment and thousands of jobs if the UK voted to leave the EU – despite his high praise for the firm’s ‘blessed’ Sunderland factory. Eurosceptic Tory MPs said it was . ‘scaremongering on an industrial scale’ by a pro-European business . leader speaking to a ‘biased’ BBC with a political agenda. Sceptical: Brazilian-born Carlos Ghosn said a UK out of Europe is 'completely different' to the current system . They insisted that Nissan would be more likely – not less – to invest in a Britain freed from the shackles of Brussels bureaucracy. Independent Labour peer Lord Stoddart accused Mr Ghosn of ‘bully-boy’ tactics of which he  should be ‘ashamed’, saying his intervention into UK politics was ‘extremely inappropriate and offensive’. The row erupted after Brazilian-born . Mr Ghosn, who also has French and Lebanese roots, unveiled Nissan’s new . British-built Qashqai model with an effusive speech in London. His . presence was hailed by Nissan executives as a major coup and a vote of . confidence in Britain and the Sunderland factory which employs 6,500 . people. But pressed later in a BBC interview as to whether Nissan would pull out of Britain if the UK voted to leave the EU, Mr Ghosn said: ‘If anything has to change we (would) need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future. It will have implications, obviously.’ David Cameron has promised a vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the general election in 2015. Mr Ghosn added: ‘You cannot consider the UK independent of its environment. If the UK is part of Europe it’s a completely different situation than if it is not part of Europe.’ Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash said: ‘This is scaremongering on an industrial scale. It also smacked of left-wing leading of the witness by a biased BBC. 'The whole interview sounded as if it had less to do with economic reality and more to do with pursuing an EU federalist agenda. ‘Why would Nissan want to jeopardise their success  by withdrawing the billions of  investment they have already made?’. But Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg welcomed Mr Ghosn’s ‘timely’ warning. He said: ‘As the Conservative MPs tie themselves up in knots in Westminster today about their European obsessions . . . the head of Nissan says, “look, if you pull out of Europe, don’t think that companies like mine are necessarily going to carry on investing and employing many people”.’","Carlos Ghosn said Japanese company would 'reconsider' its future in UK .

A U.S. study has found that checking text messages or taking a call during a meeting or business lunch is unacceptable to the majority of people. But the researchers found that women were twice as easily offended by men by the antisocial behaviour. The study found that three out of four people said checking texts or emails was poor behaviour in business meetings, while 87 per cent termed answering a phone call in a meeting 'unacceptable' Co-author of the study, Peter W. Cardon warned discourteous behaviour in the workplace can have real implications for careers, hiring and even workplace efficiency, with tension among coworkers harming productivity. The study, by the USC Marshall School of Business and Howard University claims to be the first to provide an empirical baseline for how attitudes towards mobile phone use breaks down across gender, age and region in the U.S. Published today in the journal Business Communication Quarterly, the research offers a baseline for how attitudes toward technology may change over time and serves as a guide to navigating social expectations around polite smartphone use, the researchers said. The researchers found that women were more easily offended by men by the antisocial smartphone behaviour in meetings . Dr Cardon said: 'Hiring managers often cite courtesy as among the most important soft skills they notice. 'By focusing on civility, young people entering the workforce may be able to set themselves apart' The study found that three out of four people said checking texts or emails was poor behaviour in business meetings, while 87 per cent termed answering a phone call in a meeting 'unacceptable'. Even at more informal business lunches, 66 per cent of people thought writing a text and sending message is rude. Men were nearly twice as likely as women to consider mobile phone use at a business lunch acceptable. Women were touchier about phone behaviour at work: Almost 60 per cent of men said it was okay to check text messages at a power lunch, compared to a third of women who thought checking texts was appropriate . Almost 60 per cent of men said it was okay to check text messages at a power lunch, compared to a third of women who thought checking texts was appropriate. Similarly, half of the men surveyed men said it was acceptable to answer a call at a power lunch, compared to just over a quarter of women. Despite the casual reputation, professionals from the West Coast of the U.S. were less accepting of mobile phone use in meetings than people from the East Coast. Higher-income professionals who took part in the study had less tolerance for smartphone use in business meetings than workers who earned less. The scientists also said there seemed to be a dramatic age gap in opinions about mobile phone use at work. Younger professionals were nearly three times as likely as older professionals to think tapping out a message over a business lunch is appropriate. Younger professionals were nearly three times as likely as older professionals to think tapping out a message over a business lunch is appropriate . Two thirds people under 30 said texting or emailing was okay, compared to just 20 per cent of those aged 51 to 65. People who frequently attend working lunches in a group of five could find that even having a phone on display is offending someone, as 20 per cent of professionals said simply having a phone out at a business lunch is rude. Saying 'Excuse me' to take a call also did not spare people's feelings, according to the study, which found almost a third of people still found it to be rarely appropriate during informal lunch meetings. With sample of more than 550 full-time working professionals in the U.S. the study claims to reveal what business professionals perceive as acceptable, courteous or rude use of mobile phones in the workplace. Two thirds people under 30 said texting or emailing was okay, compared to just 20 per cent of those aged 51 to 65 . The researchers first identified the most common grievances people had about smartphone use among their colleagues, including browsing the Internet and checking text messages. They then asked working professionals earning at least $30,000 a year to identify which of these behaviours they considered acceptable and which ones are flat-out rude. 'Not surprisingly, millennials and younger professionals were more likely to be accepting of smartphone use, but they might be doing themselves a disservice,' Dr Cardon said. 'In many situations, they rely on those older than them for their career advancement,' he said.","A U.S. study found that three out of four people said checking texts or emails was poor behaviour in business meetings .

But by the day's end the 53-year-old father-of-two was on his way back to his native Czech Republic thanks to a group of selfless strangers. Jaroslav Nemcovsky flew from his home outside Prague to Orlando, Florida, in September but lost his job and traveled to Manhattan in a desperate bid to find work. Once there however, things only worsened for the already down-on-his-luck immigrant when he was robbed after falling asleep charging his cell phone at Port Authority. Scroll down for video . Selfless: Brandon Levithan, center, and his girlfriend Simona Kanevsky, left, were able to help homeless man Jaroslav Nemcovsky, right, return to his native Czech Republic on the weekend . With no money, no passport and no shoes, Nemcovsky thought he would die on the harsh, and increasingly wintery, streets of the Big Apple. But all that changed when Brandon Levithan, owner of clothing company Thread Society, and his friends came across him sitting solemnly in Union Square last weekend. 'We didn't think he was homeless. We weren't sure we wanted to approach him,' Levithan, who was distributing warm clothes to the city's poor at the time, told the New York Daily News Tuesday. In a heartwarming YouTube video that has now gone viral, Levithan is seen approaching Nemcovsky, who doesn't speak English but was able to communicate with Levithan's girlfriend, Simona Kanevsky in Russian. 'I explained to him that we were a clothing company giving out sweatshirts, hats and gloves,' Kanevsky said. 'I asked if he wanted anything and all he responded with was, ""I just want to go home... to Czech.""' Help: The group took Nemcovsky to a hotel to get cleaned up and gave him new clothes and pizza . Barber: They then took him for a haircut and a shave . First things first, the couple, and their friends, took Nemcovsky, who hadn't showered for two weeks to a nearby hotel where they got him cleaned up, gave him new clothes and fed him some New York pizza. They then took him to a corner barber for a shave and a hair cut. He was a new man. 'He was so grateful, explaining to me that he has never had a beard so long in his life and hasn't been able to shave in two months,' Kanevsky told the Daily News. Back at the hotel, he elaborated on his struggles since arriving in the states. 'He was robbed of his phone, his passport. He had $1,000 -- they even took his shoes,' Levithan said. 'He said he went to police for help and they laughed at him.' Tears: Explaining his struggle, the 53-year-old teared up and was so grateful . Friends: The group left Nemcovsky at the hotel to rest for a while as they pondered how they could help fulfil his wish to return to Czech . The Czech Consulate were able to replace his passport, but gave him no other help in getting home.After 10 days of sleeping in a homeless shelter, he said he was kicked out and, when Levithan and his friends found him, he was sleeping in Union Square. Describing how he just wanted to get home and see his son and daughter, he teared up. The group left Nemcovsky at the hotel to rest for a while as they pondered how they could help fulfil his wish to return to Czech. When they returned, they surprised him with a one-way ticket leaving from JFK Airport early the next morning. Surprise: They then surprised him with a one-way ticket to his home in the Czech Republic, taking him to JFK airport, pictured . Flight: Levithan said they got him on the flight, pictured, around eight hours after they first met him, desperate and alone, in Union Square . 'I can only imagine being on the street, alone in a different country where nobody speaks the language. We just wanted to get him home with his family,' Levithan told the Daily News.

And they're looking forward to hearing from him once he's settled back home, Levithan said, adding that they exchanged contact information. But for now, the group are just happy at the difference they were able to make in helping a complete stranger who was down on his luck, and hope their selfless actions inspire others to assist those less fortunate. 'It's the holiday season. We were there to do good. Giving shirts and warming people is really nice deed. Giving him a fresh start and getting him where he needs to be — that's what motivated us to go through with this,' said Levithan. 'I think I got more out of it than I thought I would.'","A homeless man who came to New York to find work woke up Saturday poor and despondent but by day's end, Jaroslav Nemcovsky, 53, was on his way back to the Czech Republic thanks to some selfless strangers .

Alexander Paton is said to have married three women illegally between 2006 and 2012. The 68-year-old appeared at Kirkcaldy Sherriff Court today where he maintained pleas of not guilty to the charges. Paton is accused of marring Filipino mortgage funder Perla Montilla (left) in 2006 despite already being married to another woman. He is also accused of marrying Judit Gherghiteanu (right) while still married to Ms Montilla . It is alleged that Paton, from . Kirkcaldy bigamously married Filipino mortgage funder, Perla Montilla, . 65, at the registrars’s office in Glenrothes, Fife, on October 14, 2006, . despite already being married to another woman, Dorothy Campbell, and . cohabited with Ms Montilla as her husband. The . second charge alleges that less than a year later on June 20, 2007, at . the same registry office he married Romanian engineer Judit . Gherghiteanu, 67, while still married to Ms Montilla. He . is also accused of bigamously marrying Margaret Nicol, 66, from Fife, . at Prospecthill Christian Fellowship church, in Greenock, Renfrewshire, . on July 14, 2012, again while still married to Ms Montilla. Sheriff Kevin Veal continued the case for trial on December 12, with a further preliminary hearing on November 29. He told Paton: 'I think your attendance can be excused on that date, unless a plea is agreed beforehand.' Bigamy is generally defined as the crime of marrying a person while already legally married. Paton appeared at Kirkcaldy Sherriff Court (pictured) today where he maintained pleas of not guilty to the charges . In Scotland, penalties range from fines to substantial prison sentences. A bigamist is seen as perpetrating fraud against the state, causing a disruption in record keeping and, in some cases, upsetting the practice of inheritance and estate laws. If the second spouse is unaware of a still-valid prior marriage, the bigamist may also be seen as causing him or her to enter into a legal agreement under false pretences, which may be another form of fraud.

The average Briton spends almost a year of their working life off sick, new research has revealed . The average Briton spends almost a year of their working life off sick, new research has revealed. Workers take an average of 360 days sick leave during a standard 45 year career. The finding means we spend almost a year-and-a-half of our working lives off work as there are on average 252 days in a working year. But a third of full-time workers - 36 per cent - would only receive Statutory Sick Pay of £86.70 a week as they have no company sick policy. The National Sickness Report surveyed 2,000 full-time workers to look at their current health and gauge their attitudes towards sickness. Stress and depression are now the most common causes of long-term absence in the workplace and require an average recovery time of 81 days. That means workers who are absent with either illness and are without a company sick policy could end up thousands of pounds out of pocket. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average UK wage is £26,664. It means workers at the mercy of Statutory Sick Pay could lose on average £4,671 if they collected just £86.70 a week over 81 days. Mark Jones, from LV= who carried out the survey, said: ‘Often when we talk about workplace absence we look at the cost to businesses. ‘However, we wanted to highlight the impact that being off sick can have on an individual’s finances and lifestyle. ‘The fact that one in three would only receive Statutory Sick Pay indicates that many would be out of pocket and struggling financially. ‘It could be worse if they were off work for a long period of time and our findings show many people are.’ According to latest figures, 131 million working days are lost annually in Britain due to sickness - the equivalent of eight days per worker. But almost half - 44 per cent - of workers who have been off sick have returned to work early due to financial concerns. Stress and depression are now the most common causes of long-term absence in the workplace and require an average recovery time of 81 days . In fact, the research revealed Britons are quite unprepared for a bout of sickness as more than half - 52 per cent - didn’t know what they would be entitled to. Mr Jones said: ‘Whilst no one wants to think about getting ill, unfortunately none of us are invincible. ‘The reality is that some people will need to be off work for a large chunk of time. ‘When we buy a car, a washing machine or even a phone we resign ourselves to the fact that at some point it might breakdown. ‘However, far too few of us have a back-up plan in place that would protect our income if we found ourselves unable to work. ‘Having a contingency plan, such as income protection, offers peace of mind so if we become ill we can focus on recovering.’","Workers take an average of 360 days sick leave during a 45 year career .

A teenager who stabbed to death his friend with a replica Lord of the Rings sword has been jailed. Father-of-one Danny Jones, 21, died after a fight in Oswestry, Shropshire, having spent the evening with 19-year-old Richard Reece before an argument broke out over the victim's parenting skills. The pair clashed in the street and Mr Jones knocked Reece to the floor as friends tried to pull them apart, a court was told. Reece then walked away but returned with an 11in blade. Stabbing: Father-of-one Danny Jones (left), 21, died after a fight in Oswestry, Shropshire, having spent the evening with 19-year-old Richard Reece (right) before an argument broke out over Mr Jones’s parenting skills . He used this to stab Mr Jones once in the stomach, Birmingham Crown Court heard. The weapon was an ornamental replica short sword carried by Frodo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings films. In the trilogy based on the books by JRR Tolkien, the hobbit - played by actor Elijah Wood - carries the blade called Sting with him, which glows blue whenever he is near an orc creature. Reece was cleared of murdering his friend after a two-week trial. But a jury found him guilty of manslaughter and he was jailed by Judge Melbourne Inman QC for 12 years on Wednesday. Sentencing, the judge said that the killing had had a 'devastating effect' on Mr Jones's mother Lisa, and told Reece: ‘You are a normal 19-year-old but there is still room for improvement in maturity.’ During the trial, Reece told the court he was ‘shocked and scared’ when he realised he had injured Mr Jones and claimed he only intended to frighten him. The court heard Mr Jones was rushed to . Royal Shrewsbury Hospital after he was stabbed on April 24 this year but . died while undergoing emergency surgery later that night. Killing: Reece used an 11in blade to stab Mr Jones once in the stomach. The weapon (pictured) was an ornamental replica short sword used by Frodo Baggins in the Lord of the Rings films .

Hobbit: Frodo Baggins - played by actor Elijah Wood - carries the blade called Sting with him, which glows blue whenever he is near an orc creature . ‘The bond I had with him was more than special as he was my only child. Our life was full of laughter and life and now it’s silent and empty. ‘The day he got the apprenticeship was the best day in his life. He had the world at his feet and a beautiful son who he will never see grow up. ‘However long Reece gets, one day he will walk back into his mother’s arms. Danny and I will never have that again.’ Rachel Brand, defending, said: ‘As soon as it had happened he was overwhelmed with an immense feeling of regret. He hopes that Danny Jones’s family will come to accept that that was a genuine feeling.’ After the hearing, Detective Inspector Steve Tonks, who led the investigation for West Mercia Police, described the tragedy as ‘another sad and pointless death’. He added: ‘This incident demonstrates, yet again, that the carrying of knives or other bladed weapons runs a huge risk of ending in tragic consequences. ‘What started as an argument and developed into a scuffle, resulted in a young man losing his life because a blade was produced. ‘Reece left the scene to arm himself and the moment he took the sword back to confront Danny, there was always the risk of a fatal outcome. This case sends out a clear message about violent crime and those prepared to arm themselves with weapons. ‘Anyone carrying a knife or similar bladed instrument as a weapon will be arrested, charged and put before the courts. They can expect a lengthy prison sentence.’","Danny Jones, 21, died after a fight with Richard Reece, 19, in Shropshire .

"By . Lydia Warren . PUBLISHED: . 10:22 EST, 8 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:52 EST, 8 November 2013 . Attorneys for the family of a Georgia teenager who was found dead in a rolled-up wrestling mat have claimed video footage of his final moments was doctored. Attorneys Benjamin Crump and Chevene King argued . that video released by authorities showing Kendrick Johnson's last . moments at Lowndes High School appears to skip and that key footage showing the wrestling mats . where his body was found was dark and blurry. Their accusations come as a report written by the initial coroner in the case has also emerged, blasting authorities for their handling of the scene. Coroner Bill Watson wrote that the body had been moved by the time he arrived and that evidence bags were later opened. Final moments: In footage released by authorities in Lowndes County, Kendrick Johnson is seen running into the gymnasium just moments before he died. He was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat . Bizarre: But in the next frame, Johnson is nowhere to be seen and other high school students are playing basketball, leading his family's attorneys to accuse authorities of doctoring the footage . The death of Johnson on January 11 . this year in Lowndes County was initially ruled accidental, but his . parents have been calling for justice ever since, claiming he was . killed. After they disputed . the coroner's conclusion, they requested an independent autopsy that . found Johnson died of blunt force trauma. Following the revelation, a judge ordered for the footage from the high school to be released but now the family's attorneys have accused authorities of doctoring the footage. 'We believe that the tape is proof that . there is some conspiracy to conceal the truth from this family and the . public as to who killed Kendrick Johnson,' Crump said. 'We believe that somebody . corrupted this video.' The surveillance video shows Kendrick walking along a school hallway at 12.59pm on January 10 wearing a white T-shirt, jeans and white sneakers. He is also carrying a yellow folder or book. The next clip is 10 minutes later at 1.09pm when Kendrick in the gym where he was later found dead. Missed: The death of Kendrick Johnson, 17, was ruled accidental but his parents believe he was killed . Tragic: He is pictured heading to the gym, left, where he was found dead, right, after he failed to return home . Another student is seen walking in ahead of him. It is less than two seconds long and shows Kendrick walk out of the shot before what appears to be a dissolve edit between that clip and another showing students playing basketball. It's unclear how much time has passed between the two clips. The attorney claims that time stamps were on freeze frames of the footage but not on the footage itself. Attorney Chevene King added that Lowndes . County Sheriff’s officials had violated the judge's ruling to provide . key evidence collected in the case and accused them of tampering with . the video, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. 'We feel that . when you look at what photographs have been given, you must come to the . conclusion that there were time codes that were part of the video that . were either deleted or in some way made impossible to get any . information from,' King said. They added that one camera, which is . pointed directly at where the wrestling mats are kept in the gym, only . shows footage that is blurry and dark. Questions: His family's attorneys, Chevene King (left) and Benjamin Crump (right), pictured on CNN last month, said that the footage has been doctored and that key parts are blurry and dark . Distraught: Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson have been calling for justice since their son died in January . 'Is it a coincidence that the one camera out of 36 cameras which we were given tape from … this is the only camera out of focus and does not give you a clear image?' King asked. CNN has also obtained a report in which the coroner slammed how the initial investigation was handled. He calls the investigative scene 'very poor'. 'The body had been noticably [sic] moved,' Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson wrote in a report dated January 22. 'The scene had been compromised and there was no cooperation from law enforcement at the scene. Furthermore the integrity of the evidence bag was compromised on January 13, 2013 by opening the sealed bag and exhibiting the dead body to his father.' He continued: 'I do not approve of the manner this case was handled.' The 17-year-old's body was found stuck in an upright mat that had been rolled up and propped upright behind bleachers in the school gym after his parents reported him missing the night before. Twist: When his body was exhumed for further investigations, it was found to be missing its organs and stuffed with newspaper instead. An independent autopsy found he died of blunt force trauma . The sheriff has said he suspects Johnson . became trapped trying to retrieve a shoe that fell into the center of . the large, rolled mat. A Georgia Bureau of Investigation medical examiner concluded that he died from positional asphyxia, meaning his body got stuck in a position in which he couldn't breathe. Despite Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluding the death was a freak accident, his parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn, insist that someone must have killed him. And in a further twist in the case, a . private pathologist opened his body earlier this year to find his organs . missing and replaced with newspaper. Dr. William R. Anderson issued a report in August saying he detected hemorrhaging on the right side of Johnson's neck. He concluded the teenager died from blunt force trauma near his carotid artery and that the fatal blow appeared to be non-accidental.","Kendrick Johnson, 17, was found dead in a rolled-up mat in January and it was initially ruled an accident - but his parents believe he was killed .

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:58 EST, 9 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:22 EST, 9 November 2013 . Miami Herald journalist Jim Wyss is being held captive by Venezuelan authorities . A Miami Herald journalist was being . held for a second night by Venezuelan authorities in Caracas after he . was detained by security forces while reporting on the country's . economic crisis. Jim Wyss, the newspaper's Andean bureau chief, was detained Thursday by the National Guard in San Cristobal, a western city near the border with Colombia that is the center of a vibrant black market by Venezuelans seeking to circumvent rigid currency controls. The Herald said in a story on its website that Venezuelan journalists reported seeing him in custody but were barred from approaching him. 'We are very concerned,' the Herald's Executive Editor Aminda Marques Gonzalez Marques said in a statement. 'There doesn't seem to be any basis for his detention and we're trying to figure out what's going on.' Authorities haven't provided any information about Wyss' detention, his whereabouts or whether he is facing charges. Nor did President Nicolas Maduro mention the case during a four-hour televised speech Friday night. The Inter American Press Association, in joining the Herald's call for the reporter's immediate release, said in a statement that he had been transferred Friday to Caracas and was being held in solitary confinement. A U.S. State Department spokesperson said in a statement Saturday, 'We are aware of reports on the arrest of a U.S. citizen. We are seeking further information on these reports from the Venezuelan government.' A jail near Caracas Venezuela which may be similar to the unknown location where Wyss is being held . San Cristobal, Venezuela a western city on the border of Columbia known for its vibrant black market and is where Wyss was detained . 'If these reports turn out to be true, we will immediately seek consular access, as we do in the every case of a detained U.S. citizen.' Wyss, who is based in Bogota and has made many trips to Venezuela, traveled to San Cristobal to report on next month's municipal elections, which are taking place amid an economic crisis marked by 54 per cent inflation and shortages of staples such as milk and toilet paper. Maduro blames hoarding and speculation by the private sector, and accuses right-wing agitators and the U.S. government of waging an 'economic war' to destabilize his government. However, economists say that only scrapping the decade-old controls imposed by the late Hugo Chavez can curb a sharp slide in the currency's value on the black market. Journalists have encountered harassment . before while reporting on the crisis. Last week, three reporters for . Caracas newspaper Diario 2001 were detained, and one allegedly beaten by . police, after witnessing a group of frenzied shoppers break through a . barricade to receive a government-provided Christmas food basket. The late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, reason for the Chavista Revolution . Current Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro failed to mentioned Wyss' whereabouts during his 4 hour televised speech on Friday night . Government officials also regularly vilify in public members of the international media as opponents of the Chavista revolution. Still, except for the six-week jailing of an American documentary filmmaker earlier this year, the detention of foreign journalists for more than a few hours is almost unknown. Wyss himself was nearly barred from entering Venezuela shortly before Chavez's death in March, according to the Herald report. Claudio Paolillo, chairman of a press freedom committee at the Inter American Press Association, said he was bewildered by Wyss' detention, calling it a 'new demonstration of intolerance by a regime that day after day shows its contempt for the work of journalists.'","Miami Herald journalist, Jim Wyss, was reporting on the Venezuelan economic crisis when he was detained in San Cristobal, a city notorious for its black market .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 21:02 EST, 27 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:02 EST, 27 November 2013 . The number of patients who access healthcare online will grow 'exponentially' in coming years in line with increases in internet shopping and banking, a leading medic has said. There will be a rapid rise in the number of patients who have online consultations with family doctors, the former chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners has predicted. Clare Gerada said electronic consultation systems could be a combination of email, telephone or video phone exchanges between patients and their clinicians or an online system of clicking through symptoms. She added that almost all appointment booking and ordering of repeat prescriptions will be done online. Change: Around 40% of medical care in Britain will be accessed online by 2020, an expert has predicted . The comments come as NHS leaders issued a stark warning that primary care across London is 'unsustainable'. Health officials have opened a debate about how the future of GP services across the capital should be transformed. NHS England’s London arm said that 'tweaking around the edges will not be an option' as it launched the debate. There is 'unprecedented strain' on GP practices across the capital as population growth and widening health inequalities drive up demand for services, officials said. Setting out the case for change in a new report, officials said a greater proportion of patient contacts are likely to be carried out through non-face-to-face digital channels. Some practices in London are pioneering 'remote consultation' through email, phone or video which allows people to be treated without taking time away from work, the report said. It added that the use of technology is key to the transformation of primary care. Dr Gerada, who has recently been appointed by NHS England (London) as clinical chairwoman of primary care transformation, said the number of patients who access care online will 'rapidly grow' in coming years. 'If we fast-forward 10 years there will be a much higher percentage of contacts with patients online through a different offering, just like our banking services and just like our non-grocery shopping - which I understand is going to be 80 per cent by 2020,' she said. 'I don’t think it will be as high as that but I wouldn’t be surprised if online access to some form of healthcare wouldn’t be about 40 per cent. Many people are already using online support. Many people Google their symptoms. On the increase: Electronic consultations, instead of the traditional face-to-face meetings with GPs, are also expected to become more popular . 'If you look at the exponential rise of how people use banking and online shopping, once we reach a tipping point where patients are comfortable to use it, doctors and nurses are comfortable with the technology and the platforms are robust, we probably will see an exponential rise in the number of people using online help through an accredited or systematic way.' She added: 'If we fast-forward to 2020, online booking to GP practices, repeat prescribing will be pretty much 100 per cent. The transactional stuff will be nearly 100 per cent but the stuff that requires the consultation may well be a good bit less but I think it will grow year-on-year.' Dr Gerada cautioned that any online health platform must be 'safe', adding: 'It has to be done safely otherwise you end up having a pregnant woman having a miscarriage and we say it’s a urine infection, so it has to be safe.' NHS officials said that the future of general practice in London could see 'federations' of GP surgeries. These groups of practices could improve access to GP services and could also mean that basic diagnostic elements, such as blood tests, are carried out at GP surgeries so patients do not have to go to another appointment in another building, officials said. It could mean that GP practices could consolidate back office tasks such as complaints procedures, they said. There are already a number of GP federations working in areas such as Derby, Suffolk and some areas of London. Anne Rainsberry, regional director for NHS England (London), said: 'General practice and primary care in London cannot carry on as it currently is. There is a growing consensus among clinicians across the capital that it is unsustainable. 'General practice has broadly followed the model that was established in 1948. There is a growing consensus that we need to look at how we deliver services. GPs are saying that they cannot provide the care that they want to provide to their patients and get the outcomes they would like.' She added: 'A population boom, more complex long-term conditions and longer life expectancy together with rising costs means that many doctors simply can’t meet the demands placed on them. 'That can often mean a long wait for an appointment, lack of choice over the doctor you see and opening hours that don’t work for working people. It also means less co-ordinated care for patients with long-term conditions which can result in fragmented care.' In January, NHS England will publish a set of proposals describing what GP services in London should look like.","Dr Clare Gerada predicts 40% of healthcare will be accessed online by 2020 .

The child was playing at the time with his five siblings and mother, who yelled at the driver of the Waste Management truck to stop, but it was too late. They stood 'horrified' as the truck backed over him. The boy was pronounced dead at the scene. A Waste Management recycling truck has backed over a two-year-old boy, who was playing out the front of his house in Cave Creek, in the north valley of Phoenix . Scene: This is street where the accident happened. The house is at the end of the road. Because of its narrowness, trucks back down because they cant turnaround . Neighbors in the remote area told azfamily.com that because there is no turnaround the trucks back down the narrow, dirt street, which leads onto desert. Devastated: Parents Sara and David Tarnanen are mourning the loss of their son, who has five siblings . Deputies investigating the devastating accident say they have been surprised by the way in which Waste Management have handled themselves. The driver, 41-year-old Bernardo Hernandez, has exercised his right not to submit to a field test, including sobriety test, or submit a statement. While authorities have no reason to believe the driver was impaired or speeding, and are likely to close the case as an accident, they have not been able to ask him whether he saw the boy in the rear-view camera. It means the accident will never be fully explained. Investigators said the recycling truck’s safety equipment was functioning properly, including beeping as it backed up. The company issued a release on Thursday that expressed condolences but also said, 'we are cooperating fully with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office and other local authorities on the investigation'. However Maricopa County Sheriff's spokesman Lt. Brandon Jones said that is only partly true. 'Waste Management has assisted and cooperated as far as equipment inspection and such, but has not allowed our detectives to ask any questions and would not submit to a field test,' Jones said. The boy has not been identified, however police have said his parents are Sara and David Tarnanen. The driver of the truck invoked his right not to have a sobriety test or submit a statement .

And building workers top the list of jobs where motorists most likely to have  a drink- or drug driving conviction . Across the UK it is drivers from the North of Scotland, Wales and Northern England who top the list of post-codes with the highest  rates of drink-driving.

The MoneySuperMarket report says: ‘Drivers in rural areas have a higher proportion of drink and drug driving convictions than those living in urban hubs. Motorists in north Scotland and mid Wales are the most likely to have a conviction (a rate of 1.51 and 1.4 convictions per 1000 quotes per year respectively), double that of those living in the Greater London region (0.77 convictions). Those in London are the least likely. Scotland . and Wales dominate the postcode breakdown – representing six of the . UK’s top ten postcodes for drivers with a drink or drug driving . conviction.

Failed tests: The statistics revealed building workers top the list of jobs where motorists most likely to have a drink- or drug driving conviction . Kevin Pratt, car insurance expert at MoneySuperMarket.com, said: ‘The manual occupations at the top of the table are typical ‘thirsty’ jobs, where many workers finish work relatively early and go to the pub. They’re also jobs that involve early starts, driving to the site and starting work first thing the morning, even after a night out. There’s a risk workers can take to the road before the alcohol has left their system, which means they would read positive if breathalysed. ‘ . Simon Best, chief executive of the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) said: ‘A hard day’s work may seem a good justification for a quick pint on the way home but responsibility for your and others safety comes with every driving licence.’ Drink-driving offences  can lead to fines of up to £5,000, a 12-month driving ban and in some circumstances a possible prison sentence.

Six former British soldiers are in an Indian jail after being arrested while providing anti-piracy protection to a US ship. The MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October and its crew, which includes Britons, Indians, Ukrainians and Estonians, have reportedly been held in Chennai since 18 October with Indian authorities claiming the vessel entered Indian waters with a huge cache of weapons on board. The ship is operated by AdvanFort, a private US firm specialising in maritime security, training and intelligence operations for shipping and had some 35 crew members on board. Detained: One of the men is former Parachute Regiment member Billing Irving, 33 and his girlfriend Yvonne MacHugh, (both pictured) 25, from Connel, northwest Scotland, is campaigning for his release . Concern: Mick Dunn, 27, who also served in The Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland has been detained since October . Six of the men are British and their families are petitioning Foreign Secretary William Hague to intervene. One of the men detained is former Parachute Regiment member Billy Irving, 33 and his girlfriend, Yvonne MacHugh, 25, from Connel, northwest Scotland, is campaigning for his release. She told the Scottish Daily Record: 'They are being held on suspicion of committing offences under the Passport Act, Essential Commodities Act and the Firearms Act but they haven’t been charged. 'They are trying to say they had illegal firearms but the company gave documentation to say that everything was above board. Obviously I worry every time he goes away, but nothing bad has ever happened before. Billy is just saying that he sends his love to us all and that he doesn’t know anything.' She said she had three letters from her boyfriend through the British consulate, but was unsure if her letters had got through. Held: The MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October and its crew, which includes Britons, Indians Ukrainians and Estonians, have reportedly been held in Chennai since 18 October . Another one of the men imprisoned is Mick Dunn, 27, who also served in The Parachute Regiment in Afghanistan, Iraq and Northern Ireland. His sister Lisa Dunn, 34, from Ashington, Northumberland, told The Times that her younger brother had phoned as he was being taken away. 'He said ""We're all being arrested and we have been transported to the police station. I love you. I do not know when I will speak to you next."" ' Last month the BBC reported that the chief engineer of the Sierre Leone registered ship had attempted to take his own life while in jail. Police said others present in the cell prevented the man from taking his life - his nationality is not known. There have been differing accounts of why and how the ship came to be stopped. The Indian authorities say they intercepted the American ship when it was reportedly sailing off the coast of Tamil Nadu. But last month AdvanFort released a statement thanking 'Indian officials for providing a safe harbour for its vessel.' It said India's coast guard and police had allowed the vessel to enter the port to refuel and shelter from a cyclone which had hit India's eastern coast. It added that all weaponry and equipment on board was properly registered. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman told Mail Online: 'We can confirm the detention of six British nationals from the ship, MV Seaman Guard Ohio, on 18 October in India. 'We are providing consular assistance and are in touch with the local authorities.' In June four Brits sailing a converted warship to Africa on what they describe as an 'anti-piracy' mission were arrested off Senegal. Armed marine commandos boarded their decommissioned fast attack gun ship Defender, which had two fearsome-looking cannons, and took them into custody in Dakar. The Senegalese authorities said the four - all ex-UK servicemen - were detained on suspicion of 'illegal activity'.","The MV Seaman Guard Ohio was detained on 12 October .

A stalker who bombarded Big Brother winner Kate Lawler with love letters, explicit pictures and even pairs of knickers was today has been jailed for eight months. Obsessed Mark Taylor also sent dozens of newspaper cuttings and crude pictures to the former reality TV star's workplace. In much of the correspondence, he declared his love for the 31-year-old Kerrang DJ, sending her topless tabloid snaps of herself, a dictionary and, bizarrely, a dinner plate. He even sent a magazine picture of two pairs of feet at the bottom of a bed with the male pair marked with his name and the female marked with 'Kate.' The 49-year-old set about his campaign of mailing in 2005, but after breaking three separate restraining orders, Judge Anthony King sent him to prison. Balding, jobless Taylor first broke his restraining order in January 2006 and was handed a community order instead. He continued sending letters to Ms Lawlor and was sent for a brief stint in jail. However, his stalking continued on his release and in November 2009 he was once again before the courts for sending items to Ms Lawler and also to Meg Ryan and Anne Robinson. He was given a strict restraining order banning him from sending any form of message to anybody in the public eye. However, in March this year, Taylor, of Salter Close, Oxford, peppered Ms Lawler with dozens of pairs of knickers, newspaper cuttings and other items to the Kerrang Radio offices. In the public eye: Ms Lawler pictured leaving the Big Brother house with presenter Davina McCall after winning the third series of the reality show in 2002. Prosecutor Cathy Olliver produced a . box full of thongs and an evidence bag stuffed with letters at the . hearing at Oxford Crown Court. Ms Olliver said: 'Ms Lawler was distressed and frightened by it. She doesn't know what his intentions are.' Clare Evans, mitigating, said: 'There's very little for me to say. Mr Taylor has repeatedly breached the restraining order. 'Mr Taylor thinks that he is being humorous. He thinks the communications are funny. 'His first psychologist said he was 'erotomania delusional' but that was dismissed by a second doctor who said he had Asperger syndrome. 'But a third doctor dismissed both of these and said he was a man with a bit of an odd personality. 'It is a menace, annoying and persistent but it has never got any worse.' Rise to stardom: Ms Lawler (front centre) with other Big Brother 3 contestants as they launch the book 'Inside Big Brother: Getting In and Staying In' in 2002. She went on to become a TV presenter, model and now a DJ for Kerrang . Taylor, who admitted breaching the restraining order, was jailed for eight months. Judge King said: 'I don't pretend to know the answer to why you keep on doing this but I certainly know what you are doing is wholly unwelcome and contrary to the restraining order. 'It is making life for the person concerned a misery. 'It was not one breach, but numerous. You have bombarded her with different communications all of which are upsetting and unwelcome. 'I have no other option but to jail you to keep you away from her for a very long time.'","Besotted Mark Taylor declared his love for former reality TV star .

Japan last night became the first major economy to abandon the greenhouse-gas promises made in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. In a setback for the UN talks on climate change this week in Warsaw, Tokyo announced it will let emissions rise 3 per cent above 1990 levels by 2020. Tokyo’s announcement came as David Cameron said there was growing evidence that climate change caused extreme weather such as the Philippines typhoon. He said politicians should listen to scientists who say man is to blame and take ‘preventative steps’. UN delegates have warned that plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions globally and reduce climate change could be threatened by Japan's decision to scale back its emissions target (file picture) Energy Secretary Ed Davey said . Japan’s decision was ‘deeply disappointing’ and a ‘major step . backwards’. However some Tory MPs called for the UK to follow Tokyo’s . lead. Japan, which hosted the Kyoto Protocol, had promised to cut . emissions by 25 per cent. But the fifth biggest producer of greenhouse . gases said the original targets could not be met following the decision . to mothball its nuclear plants after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The country’s chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said the 2020 target of a 25 per cent cut was ‘completely baseless’. The loss of a quarter of its power production leaves Japan more reliant on high-polluting coal and gas. It . insists the change to the target is temporary, while it resolves its . energy supply issues, and it still intends to halve emissions by 2050. Britain, . which derives about 20 per cent of its energy from nuclear, is on track . to cut carbon emissions by 34 per cent by 2020 compared with 1990 . levels. It has a legally binding target to cut them by 80 per cent by . 2050. Japan has shifted back to a reliance on coal, oil and gas for power after an earthquake wrecked the Fukushima nuclear plant in 2011, pictured . Mr Davey said: ‘It is deeply disappointing that the Japanese . government has taken this decision to significantly revise down its 2020 . emissions target. 'This is inconsistent with the unequivocal message . from the scientific evidence, which clearly underlines the urgency of . addressing emissions reductions.’ Britain has committed to build a . new generation of nuclear power stations, which will help cut emissions; . the first deal was signed for a reactor at Hinkley Point in Somerset . last month. But they will take years to produce power and Tory MPs are . concerned that meeting climate targets with green taxes on homes and . businesses, and building expensive wind farms, will harm economic . growth. Mr Cameron has already promised to ‘roll back’ green taxes on . household bills this year - although they are expected to be put into . general taxation instead. Peter Lilley, a Tory MP and former trade . minister who sits on the Commons energy and climate change committee, . said: ‘This is part of a pattern. We have seen Canada resile from its . climate targets, Australia abandoning green taxes, now Japan, and I . think we will see something similar in Germany which is clearly going to . be unable to reach its ambitions for the same reason as the Japanese. The climate talks are taking place in Warsaw, Poland, pictured. European Union delegates 'expressed disappointment' at the new figure, while UN climate chief Christiana Figueres said there was 'regret' over Japan's decision . 'You . cannot say it makes any sense for Britain... to continue trying to . set an example by crippling our industry with high costs and our . customers with unbearable bills. Unilateral energy disarmament can only . handicap us.' Mr Cameron’s comments, made on his trip to the . Commonwealth conference in Sri Lanka, will anger some Tory backbenchers, . a growing number of whom question the link between man’s actions and . global warming. Influential grandee Lord Lawson said this week that . it was ‘a scare’ to suggest that Typhoon Haiyan, which is thought to . have killed up to 10,000 people in the city of Tacloban alone, is linked . to climate change. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has also accused environmentalists of getting ‘emotional’ about global warming. Mr . Cameron said governments should act even if there was a 40 per cent . chance that climate change had nothing to do with extreme weather. He . added: ‘I’ll leave the scientists to speak for themselves about the . link between severe weather events and climate change. The evidence . seems to me to be growing.'","New target calls for reducing emissions by 3.8% from 2005 level .

Former Co-op bank chairman Paul Flowers has been arrested in connection with a drugs supply investigation, police said today. West Yorkshire Police said officers arrested the 63-year-old in the Merseyside area last night and detectives are questioning him at a police station in West Yorkshire. Mr Flowers, a Methodist minister, was suspended by both the church and the Labour party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs. Former Co-op bank chairman Paul Flowers has been arrested in connection with a drugs supply investigation . Mr Flowers stepped down from his role . as Co-op bank chairman in June and questions have since been asked about . his competence in the role. He . has also been engulfed in allegations of illegal drug use, gay sex, . questions over his expenses claims at a drug charity and drink-driving. It also emerged he had resigned as a Labour councillor after adult material was discovered on his computer. Co-op bank is seeking to recover contractual payments made to Mr Flowers, and he has been told to hand back £31,000. 'When Paul Flowers relinquished his . responsibilities in June, it was agreed, as per his contractual . obligations, that his fees for the rest of his period of office would be . paid,' the bank said in a statement. 'Following recent revelations, the board stopped all payments with immediate effect and no further payments will be made.' Mr Flowers, a Methodist minister, was suspended by both the church and the Labour party following allegations that he bought and used illegal drugs . An 'internal fact-finding review' - looking at emails and other evidence - is being carried out by the bank. The assistant secretary of the . Methodist Conference, the Rev Gareth Powell, acknowledged the risk that . allegations against Mr Flowers would 'tarnish' the church's reputation. Mr . Powell told the BBC: 'I think inevitably some of the speculation has . raised questions, as it always does for the church, about the . trustworthiness of ministers. 'Inevitably, . it's regrettable when the allegations made against one minister then . tarnishes the extremely good and honourable work undertaken by all of . our ministers. 'Certainly the actions that are now under public scrutiny inevitably raise a question about the role of the church.' It was reported today that Mr Flowers was the subject of an inquiry into 'lavish' expenses claims at the Co-op when he resigned from the mutual's group board in June. Reverend Flowers being questioned by the Treasury Select Committee earlier this month about his time as chairman at the Co-op bank . The BBC said he stepped down after being confronted with a dossier of his claims, compiled by the then-chairman Len Wardle. He . quit as chairman of the Co-op Bank at the same time after the group . brought in banking industry veteran Richard Pym to replace him. Mr . Powell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Methodist Church . dealt 'appropriately' with Mr Flowers' historic convictions for . indecency and drink-driving, but said the church was not informed of . other concerns now being raised by different organisations. 'I . don't think we were incurious,' said Mr Powell. 'The necessary . processes that dealt with the two convictions had reassured themselves . that here was a person who could continue with our ministry like any . other Methodist minister under the normal discipline of our ministry. 'I . don't think it was being incurious. There is a fine balance to strike . between curiosity on the basis of evidence presented and curiosity based . on speculation and gossip.' Corridors of power: Paul Flowers attends a Downing Street reception in 2010 under the last government . Mr Powell said that the church was given 'no formal indication' by Methodist ministers of concerns about inappropriate behaviour by Mr Flowers. He added: 'People make observations about those who are in the public eye, but we are not able to act on comments about a person's behaviour without any firm evidence. 'Clearly, it would have been immensely helpful to us if bodies had been rather clearer about some of the concerns in the past. Hitherto, we have dealt appropriately with what we have known about in a formal context.' A Conservative member of Bradford Council, John Pennington, said he and other councillors were told that Mr Flowers was leaving the authority due to work pressures, and not as a result of pornography being found on his computer. Mr Pennington told the programme: 'We were told he had resigned through pressure of other work commitments - ie, the Co-op Bank. 'He was a very believable, very plausible chap, always immaculately dressed. He speaks with confidence and even with an air of superiority. On the surface, a hail-fellow-well-met and seemingly well-connected. 'To be frank, I'm not surprised that he has worked his way up the greasy pole because he is very, very plausible. 'What does concern me is the seeming lack of any checks or any vetting procedure to stop him getting to the dizzy height that he got to.'

A 19-year-old who burnt a £17,000 replica Iron Age roundhouse to the ground in a drunken arson attack has been jailed for 16 months. Oliver Harrisyn set fire to the education centre, which was visited by 15,000 children every year, using a cigarette lighter after a night out. The thatched hut, which was also transformed into a Santa’s grotto during the festive season, was burned to the ground just weeks before Christmas on November 17 last year. Before: The roundhouse was used as an education centre and would be transformed into a Santa's grotto over Christmas . After: The thatched hut was destroyed when Oliver Harrisyn, 19, drunkenly started a blaze . The replica roundhouse was set in 56 acres of woodland in Ewhurst, Surrey and was designed to replicate the dwellings people lived in between 800 BC and the Roman invasion in 43 AD. David Quoroll, director of the Sayers Croft Trust, told Guildford Crown Court he was 'moved to tears' when he found the smoldering remains of the building after Harrisyn’s attack. Mr Quoroll also claimed he had trouble convincing schools and parents that the educational site was safe for children in the months after it had been gutted. Prosecutor Saul Herman said: 'The damage caused was extensive. The financial damage is put at around £17,000 pounds. Devastated: The gutted dwelling was built by volunteers who spent hundreds of hours of their own time constructing the home which showed how people lived between 800 BC and the Roman invasion in 43 AD . 'The building had been constructed by members of the community and had taken many hours of voluntary work. 'The insured value was nothing compared to the hours of work which people had put in to the project.' Harrisyn’s defence barrister Phillip Rule claimed his client’s mother was an alcoholic and that he had suffered with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a child. He said the19-year-old was 'extremely ashamed and remorseful' and added: 'These were the actions of a child behaving in a childish manner.' Mr Rule said his client had voluntarily gone to the police 11 days after the blaze to admit his crime. Popular: The Iron Age roundhouse was visited by 15,000 children on school trips every year . 'He is a polite and quiet young man but I would submit he is immature,' the barrister said. Judge Christopher Critchlow sentenced Harrisyn to 16 months in prison and said: 'There was an Iron Age roundhouse that many people had spent many hours building. 'In what can only be described as an act of wanton vandalism, because of your visit it was burned to the ground effectively. 'You went there having consumed beer and under intoxication. 'For some reason, you decided as a smoker to take out your lighter and lit some hessian fabric. 'The effects were the destruction of this replica fort and some 17,000 pounds of damage. 'Arson is always regarded as a serious offence. This was not in a built-up area but it was vulnerable and it was obvious to anybody that it was a building of some special significance. The court heard a new Iron Age roundhouse has been constructed on the Sayers Croft Centre site after dozens of volunteers pitched in to build a new one this year.","Oliver Harrisyn received a 16-month sentence for burning the hut in Surrey .

More than 43 million Americans are expected to head to a holiday destination, making it busiest travel day of the year, but the weather forecast could affect those plans. Almost 39 million or 90 percent are expected to travel 50 miles or more from home by motor vehicle, according to AAA projections. However, meteorologists are predicting rain and a sudden drop in temperatures that could lead to a possible nor'easter for next week. Forecast: An East Coast storm scheduled to arrive on Thanksgiving is threatening to create travel chaos for millions of Americans . Bearing the brunt: It appears as though the Eastcoast and Midwest are in for a shivery few days . Having already experienced November temperatures colder than most for the last few years, brace yourself - there are are several heavy doses ahead. The first Arctic blast will arrive this weekend with another by turkey day. Abnormally cold air will plunge into the Midwest and Northeast and there could well be a snowstorm on Turkey Day. The storm is expected to bring a lot of rain to the Northeastern United States. Monday: A nor'easter is swirling together and it could hit the east coast just in time for Thanksgiving . Tuesday: The storm looks like it will stretch from New England down to the Carolinas, bringing snow, wind, cold, and rain along with it . Wednesday: It's a particularly dreary picture for Cape Cod. The area could receive hurricane-like gusts of wind . Thursday - Turkey Day: Given the storm's current trajectory, the nor'easter is expected to strike sometime between Tuesday evening and Thursday, during the busiest travel days of the year . Chilly outlook: Arctic blasts and a developing storm are making for a frosty reception during Thanksgiving . The storm could bring strong winds and heavy rain to much of region, with snow possible, especially in higher-elevation areas in eastern Pennsylvania and northwest New Jersey. Those traveling for the holiday could face delays on the road and at airports and train stations. Forecasters say it's still too early to tell exactly how much precipitation, or what type, to expect in specific areas. At this point, forecasts say the Interstate 95 corridor in the mid-Atlantic is more likely to see a 'chilly rain,' instead of snow, according to AccuWeather. The storm system is on track for the Northeast, with some initial rain and low clouds moving up past Washington D.C., by late Tuesday. Although it will not be a crippling snowstorm for holiday travel, it has the possibility of making air and road trips more difficult. The storm will for the most part be gone come Thanksgiving Day in most areas, but an impending cold front should still leave snow on the roads. Predictions: Forecasters are warning Thanksgiving travelers to beware, as a sweeping winter storm system could bring icy roads, flight delays and more headaches to the holiday next week . Disruption: The Northeast will likely see¿massive flight delays on Wednesday in all major airports, because of rain, snow and low-lying clouds that wreak havoc with flight plans . On its way: The system has already brought freezing rain, sleet and heavy snow in parts of the southern Plains and desert Southwest . Predictions: Although it's still six days away, forecasters are predicting there will be travel disruption thanks to a winter storm . November 27 will be the 'busiest single day of travel' with 37 percent of travelers expected to leave for the holiday. Holiday travelers can be thankful for significantly lower gas prices which have retreated nearly $1 a gallon since the Memorial Day holiday period. AAA expects prices to remain favorable through the remainder of the ye . 'While the economy continues to improve, the sluggish pace of the recovery is creating uncertainty in the minds of some consumers and therefore AAA is projecting a slight decline in the number of Thanksgiving travelers this year,' said AAA Chief Operating Officer Marshall L. Doney. Good news for drivers this holiday season is gas prices are the lowest for the Thanksgiving holiday since 2010. 'The primary focus of Thanksgiving, more so than any other holiday, is to gather with friends, family and loved ones and celebrate with each other. Travelers attempting to carve out a travel budget will be happy to know that Thanksgiving will be the least expensive holiday of the year,' Doney said.","Abnormally cold weather to descend on the Midwest and Northeast this weekend and midweek .

A Wild Boar's head stuffed with fruit was usually the main dish at any feast when King Henry VIII entertained guests, especially during the festive period. And now centuries later it looks like the dish could make a Christmas comeback as a challenger to the traditional turkey as the price of the meat continues to soar. One of the champion's of the dish is Daniel Doherty, the head chef of the Duck & Waffle in London. Revival: Could pig's head take the place of turkey at this year's Christmas table? The economic delicacy costs £5 against £60 for a free-range turkey . His delicacy costs £5 against roughly £60 for a free-range turkey - the face provides the meat and the pork-infused wine can be served as savoury pre-dinner cocktail. 'Turkey can be a pain to cook,' Mr Doherty told the Guardian. 'You need two packs of butter and a litre of gravy to make sure it's not too dry. Plus you lose your morning to cooking when you could be getting tipsy on mulled swine.' Blast from the past: King Henry VIII often hosted elaorate dinner parties which would have featured a pig's head . 'People have realised that turkey isn't necessarily the most delicious thing to have at Christmas,' said Fearnley-Whittingstall, in a break from being mobbed for autographs and photos. 'Even if you are a tradition addict, if you are a keen cook you will want to surround the festivities with more up-to-the-minute and exciting food.' He is planning roast beef sirloin and oysters for his extended family. Although a pig's head with a glistening snout sitting in the middle of a family table is not for the sensitive, it may be welcomed by some watching their purse strings as a typical large frozen turkey, enough to feed more than ten people and . leave some over for sandwiches, will be around £3 more expensive at £20. However, . people buying fresh from a butcher will probably be paying at least £60 . – and potentially much more -  for a bird of that size. At . the same time other key essentials for the feast, such as potatoes, . carrots, peas and, of course, sprouts, are also more expensive. The . latest official figures from Smithfield market suggest the price of . turkey is up by some eight per cent in the past year. At the same time, . the British Turkey Federation claims a smaller increase of six per cent. However, . a snapshot survey conducted this weekend found a the price of a large . frozen turkey in supermarkets was up by some 17 per cent in a year. Research . by The Grocer magazine last year put the price of a frozen turkey . weighing 5-6kg at £17, however this year it is around £20, . Tesco is currently charging £20 and Sainsbury’s £22 for a bird weighing 5.3-6.9kg, while Asda is charging £20 for a 5.8kg bird. Changing times: Turkey has been the main dish of Christmas meals for decades, but could it now be replaced with turkey? The . other Christmas dinner essential, Brussel sprouts, are up by some 19per . cent this year -  a rise from £2.10 a kilo to some £2.50 . At . the same time a 2.5kg pack of white roasting potatoes is up by some . 15per cent to £2. The increases for carrots and peas are smaller. Smoked salmon and stilton are now as much . a part of Christmas as the turkey. The survey found that Blue Stilton . is up by around 5 per cent to £2.32 for just 100g, while smoked salmon . is up by some 28 per cent to £4 for a 100g pack. Paul Kelly, chairman of the British . Turkey Federation, said: ‘Massive fluctuations in the price of feed . affects the price of a turkey but people will still 'trade up' at . Christmas by getting the best they can afford.

Rinse well with cool water; pat dry. Remove any excess fat. Place head in a colander in the sink and pour a kettleful of boiling water over. Let cool. Combine the 5-spice powder, salt, bean sauce and bourbon. Slash the meat on underside of head and rub half of the spice mixture into the meat. Rub the remaining spice mixture onto the skin.

Lower heat to 325 degrees and continue cooking for an additional 2 hours, or until the meat is cooked through, basting the skin well every 30 minutes with the honey-water mixture. (Cooking time will depend on the size of the head.) If ears begin to brown too quickly during cooking period, wrap them with foil.

However, doctors became suspicious and the blood was sent off for DNA tests, which revealed it belonged to Muggleton. He has been handed a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, after pleading guilty to cruelty to a baby at Gloucester Crown Court. Sentence: Muggleton pleaded guilty to cruelty to a baby at Gloucester Crown Court, pictured. He was later handed a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, as well as an 18-month supervision order . Julian Kesner, prosecuting told the court: 'The . defendant and his girlfriend were barely beyond being children . themselves when their son was born. He was 18 and she was 16.

Up to 90 per cent of MBP perpetrators are mothers - with victims usually under five years old. 'By proxy' indicates that a parent or carer has fabricated or exaggerated symptoms in a child, as opposed to himself or herself. The disorder was named after Baron Karl Friedrich von Munchausen (1720-1797), who was known for telling exaggerated tales about his battles as a Russian soldier. 'DNA sample were taken from the baby's babygrow and the blood was found . to be that of the defendants.' He added that Muggleton's son had been discharged into foster care and is now up for adoption.

A thug has been jailed for nearly 13 years after he was caught on camera attacking a rival gang member with a meat cleaver. Andrew Redmond nearly severed the arm of Jonathan Gordon after hacking at him 15 times, only stopping the assault when he accidentally struck himself with the blade. The 24-year-old initially claimed he had got his injury from falling off a motorbike, but later pleaded guilty to causing grievous bodily harm. Yesterday he was sentenced to 12 years and nine months in prison at Liverpool Crown Court. The fight began at a newsagent in Bootle in October last year when two rival gangs began attacking each other. Redmond was not initially at the scene, but when friends called him for 'back-up' he arrived armed with a meat cleaver, and dragged Mr Gordon out of the shop. David Birrell, prosecuting, said: 'Redmond can be seen to approach the shop, he drags Gordon from the shop where he fell to the floor. At that point Mr Redmond rains blows down on him, about 15 times mostly to his head, back and neck. 'It was a ferocious attack, so ferocious that the defendant's arm went limp and he struck his own arm with the cleaver causing himself serious injury.' Mr Gordon, who was jailed for affray earlier this year, refused to make a complaint, but the paramedics who treated him called the police to arrest Redmond. Attack: Redmond hacked at Jonathan Gordon with a meat cleaver 15 times during the incident last year . CCTV: The brutal assault was caught on surveillance cameras outside a newsagent in Bootle, Merseyside . The victim suffered cuts to his head, ears, legs and neck, and his left arm had all of its tendons severed, leaving him with long-term mobility problems in his arm. The defendant claimed he was innocent, saying he was not at the scene, but later admitted his guilt. The court heard he had previous convictions for smashing someone in the face with a brick and knocking a man unconscious by hitting him on the head with a lump of wood studded with nails. Judge Clement Goldstone QC told Redmond: 'This offence marks a meteoric rise in seriousness. Injury: The attack only ended when Redmond struck himself in the arm with his own weapon . 'Despite your age and room for maturity in the future the sheer ferocity of the attack has to be seen on DVD to be believed. 'The fact that you took a lethal weapon to the scene allied to your previous offences, which I cannot ignore, drives me to the conclusion that you currently present a substantial risk of serious harm to those with whom you are in confrontation. You are a dangerous offender.' James Kinsell, 18, whose grandparents ran the newsagent which was the scene of the fight, was jailed for 20 months after pleading guilty to perverting the course of justice. He disposed of the meat cleaver used by Redmond by dropping it through a grate.","Andrew Redmond, 24, was involved in gang fight in Bootle newsagent .

"By . Paul Scott . PUBLISHED: . 19:14 EST, 8 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:14 EST, 8 November 2013 . This is a problem familiar to every professional party-giver. After a night of Bacchanalian revelries to rival the last days of Rome, the exact details of the previous evening’s events can seem a bit hazy in the cold light of day. This seems to have happened to multi-millionaire PR guru Matthew Freud. After throwing a lavish bash last weekend at his vast Cotswolds home to celebrate his 50th birthday, it appeared to slip his mind that one of the guests was Prime Minister David Cameron. Party host Matthew Freud, pictured with his wife Elisabeth Murdoch, is a formidable networker. He once threw a Martini in the face of an editor who criticised his wife, and smeared chocolate cake on Hugh Grant's shirt . Such a lapse of memory would suggest that even by the impressive standards of Freud’s previous extravagant soirees, this was quite some knees-up. But it is not every day that one’s champagne-drinking guests are entertained by rock stars Bono and Bob Geldof with a rendition of Sixties hit Dancing In The Street by Martha & The Vandellas. U2 frontman Bono also led the celebrity-packed throng in a rendition of Happy Birthday, while Tony Blair’s former henchman-in-chief Alastair Campbell apparently played the bagpipes. David and Samantha Cameron were at the bash - but it seems their host momentarily forgot . It goes without saying that Freud and his wife Elisabeth Murdoch (daughter of media mogul Rupert) have a wide circle of friends. A trio of chefs — Heston Blumenthal, Jamie Oliver and Nigella Lawson — were among the guests, alongside Amanda Holden, Jemima Khan and outdoor adventurer Bear Grylls. Also there were Tony and Cherie Blair, who are said to have ‘tripped the light fantastic’ on the dance floor all night, and the model Kate Moss. Mrs Blair, who likes a good sing-song, was reported to have performed a duet with Irish rocker Bono. One guest told me that the Freuds hired a professional tattoo artist for the night to give guests free body art. But the PM’s wife Samantha, who already has a dolphin tattoo on her ankle, did not take up the offer. It was, of course, a family celebration — as any 50th birthday party should be. One of Freud’s teenage children sang a Paul Simon song, while her siblings showed a fun-poking film of their father. According to one guest, Freud gave an ‘unusually humble speech in which he thanked everyone for putting up with him’. The Noah’s Ark-themed bash took place at Burford Priory, a 22-bedroom, Grade-I-listed Jacobean pile, set in 20 acres of Oxfordshire countryside, which Freud and Miss Murdoch bought for £6 million in 2008 and have spent a fortune doing up. The rambling nature of the house may be the reason why Freud momentarily forgot that Mr Cameron — who, like his hosts, is a member of the so-called Chipping Norton set and has a house nearby — was at the party. When one broadsheet diary columnist asked Freud if the PM had attended, the PR man reportedly replied: ‘No. Please let me know if you would like more explicit clarification.’ Cherie Blair, right, wife of former PM Tony, was said to have performed a duet with U2 frontman Bono, left. The Irish rocker also sang Happy Birthday while Mr Blair's former spin doctor Alistair Campbell played the bagpipes . However, the following day an associate clarified not only that Mr Cameron had, in fact, been there, but that Chancellor George Osborne was, too. The confusion led the veteran political commentator Andrew Neil to tweet mischievously: ‘Matthew Freud “forgets” David Cameron was at his 50th. As you do.’ So why all the intrigue? Part of the sensitivity is the fact that some people have questioned the judgment of the Prime Minister and Mr Osborne in attending the home of Rupert Murdoch’s daughter at a time when key executives of his newspaper empire are on trial at the Old Bailey for phone-hacking. A friend of Mr Cameron — himself a former TV PR man, of course — defended his decision to attend, insisting: ‘David is an old friend of Matthew. He’s known him for donkey’s years and David’s incredibly loyal. It was his friend’s party, so he naturally he felt he should go.’ And who could resist the lure of an invitation to one of the Freuds’ hot‑ticket events? The guests included a trio of celebrity chefs - from left, Jamie Oliver, Heston Blumenthal and Nigella Lawson . The couple’s joint fortune is in excess of £250 million, with Freud Communications representing global brands such as Google, Pepsi, Asda and Guinness. A previous party took place two years ago when guests included a Who’s Who of the political and celebrity worlds, including Labour politicians David Miliband and Peter Mandelson and broadcasters Jeremy Clarkson, Jon Snow and Piers Morgan. On that occasion, there was a room with a sommelier serving giant bottles of vintage claret. One guest told me: ‘Matthew Freud is like a Great Gatsby figure, collecting people and things.’ In these straitened, we’re-all-in-this-together times, politicians might think twice before accepting an invitation to such a grandiloquent event. But few can resist the temptation to gawp at the opulence of Freud’s rural retreat.' The plutocrat’s house contains a restored 17th-century chapel, alongside two pools — one with a horse’s head sculpture — a gym and a vast wine cellar. Writer and socialite Jemima Khan, who has dated Hugh Grant and Russell Brand, had one of the lucky invites . In the garage, Freud keeps a 1963 white Jaguar convertible that he encourages guests to drive around the grounds. Freud himself claims to have reached a top speed of 140mph. He is a voracious collector, and his office in the Oxfordshire house  is decorated with historical documents, including the Instrument of Abdication — the 1936 letter from King Edward VIII relinquishing the throne in order to marry Wallis Simpson. One visitor to the family’s London home says a painting by the Russian-French artist Marc Chagall hangs in the hallway. For his birthday last week, his wife is said to have bought him a present that might not be to everyone’s taste: a painting called P***ing At The Moon, by 17th-century Flemish artist Pieter Brueghel. It depicts a man in a coat urinating into a moonlit lake. Networker Mr Freud took the 'survival of the fittest' theory literally - by inviting TV adventurer Bear Grylls . Such quirky humour does not come cheap: the last time the picture was offered at auction, in 2010, it sold for more than £361,000. Freud’s taste in food is similarly extravagant. One recent lunch guest recalls their host, a keen cook, rustling up filet mignon, fettuccine with crab, leeks sautéed in crème fraîche, sautéed sausages in pastry, curried-chicken salad, roast potatoes and broccoli, all washed down with claret (a 1998 Pomerol). Such attention to detail has  helped Freud to become a formidable networker. The great-grandson of Sigmund Freud, Matthew’s father was the Liberal MP-turned-broadcaster Sir Clement Freud, his sister Emma is a broadcaster and wife of film director Richard Curtis, and his uncle was the renowned painter Lucian Freud. He and Miss Murdoch, who have six children from three marriages, met in 1997. Their marriage, in 2001, was a lavish affair at Blenheim Palace. They have since had two children together. The pugnacious Freud is a formidable figure in the business world. Once, he threw a Martini in the face of an editor who criticised his wife, and smeared chocolate cake on the shirt of the actor Hugh Grant (a former client) during a row at a London nightclub three years ago. Grant allegedly responded by punching him in the face. There may not have been any such unpleasantries last weekend at Freud’s 50th birthday party. Indeed, it seems to have been such a convivial night that there was confusion about whether the Prime Minister had dropped in and joined the festivities.","Star-studded 50th birthday bash held by 'Great Gatsby-like' Matthew Freud .

"By . Becky Barrow and Martin Robinson . PUBLISHED: . 19:37 EST, 5 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 06:00 EST, 6 November 2013 . The house price boom is predicted to last for another five years meaning the average cost of a home will jump by £43,000. Prices in some areas will rocket by a third by 2018, according to estate agents Savills, fuelling a growing gap between homeowners and those who cannot afford to buy. The property seller forecasts the average cost of a home would rise by 25 per cent in the next five years – from £171,000 to £214,000. It comes as house prices surged by 6.9 per cent annually in October, continuing their fastest rise in more than three years, Halifax has reported. What does the future hold for UK house prices? This map from Savills shows their predicted trends over the next five years. View the full version here. A 0.7 per cent month-on-month increase took prices to £171,991 on . average - marking the ninth monthly rise in a row as the new phase of . the Government's flagship Help to Buy scheme was launched. The annual increase was the strongest since May 2010 and follows a 6.2% year-on-year upswing the previous month. But the jump will be even greater in some regions, with average prices expected to rise by 32 per cent in the South East and 31 per cent in the East. A 24 per cent increase is forecast in London. Savills said that fuelled by an economic recovery, the upswing in prices is likely to be strongest in the South of England following 'a modest, but progressive improvement in mortgage lending'. Its report said that the 'ripple effect' from London is 'long overdue'. Lucian Cook, of Savills, insisted yesterday that widespread fears of a housing bubble are misplaced. Price explosion: Housing market experts have predicted property price increases of up to 31.9% in the next five years . He said: ‘We see no evidence of an imminent housing bubble and think it an unlikely prospect.’ Soaring house prices, and a predicted rise in the number of people buying property, will trigger a huge windfall for the Treasury through stamp duty. By 2018, the fee could be worth £9.4billion a year, according to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility. At its previous peak in 2007/8, the year the financial crisis struck, stamp duty was worth £6.7billion, but the value of the tax to the Treasury is set to balloon. Yesterday the Council of Mortgage Lenders said the amount of money paid by homebuyers ‘reinforces the need for reform’ of the ‘much-criticised’ tax. Stamp duty used to be charged at 1 per cent on all homes bought for more than £60,000. Today it is charged at five different rates – up to 7 per cent on homes bought for more than £2million. Around half of stamp duty is paid by people buying homes for more than £500,000. In a sign of Britain’s increasingly unaffordable housing market, the average cost of a one-bedroom home has surpassed £500,000 in areas of the capital including Chelsea, Kensington, Balham, Barnes and Battersea. A report from estate agents Marsh & Parsons revealed the average price of a one-bedroom property has jumped by 14 per cent in a year, an increase of £62,000. House prices have been rising every year since 1996, apart from a short pause during the recent recession, according to Halifax. The bank’s house price index, which began in 1983, an average rise of 5.6 per cent a year over the last 30 years. In a sign of the property crisis facing young people, the Government’s English Housing Survey, shows home ownership is collapsing. At its peak in 2003, 71 per cent of householders were ‘owner-occupiers’. Today the figure is just 65.3 per cent. And the majority of England’s 14.4million homeowners, 30 per cent, are aged 65 and over. Duncan Stott, of first-time buyers’ campaign group, Priced Out, said: ‘Such steep increases will be a disaster for first-time buyers who are already struggling to afford the high cost of a home of their own.’ The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors is calling for new rules which would cap house price rises at a maximum of 5 per cent  a year. Matthew Pointon, a property economist at Capital Economics, said that outside central London, the housing market is still “far from boom territory”. He said: 'With household finances still fragile after five years of falling real earnings, we are not convinced that a country-wide boom is around the corner.' He said recent speculation that the Government is considering a capital gains tax on overseas property buyers 'is perhaps an early signal that the authorities are becoming more aware of the risks of another house price bubble inflating'. Much of the recent sharp increase to property prices in prime central London has been put down to strong demand from overseas buyers looking for a safe haven to invest amid the troubles of the eurozone. Halifax pointed out that ultra-low interest rates, as the base rate remains at a historic 0.5 per cent low, have put mortgage payments for new borrowers at their most affordable for 14 years, which is helping to fuel demand. Mortgage payments typically take up 27 per cent of disposable earnings for a new mortgage borrower, the lowest proportion since 1999 and well below the average of 36 per cent over the past 30 years. The new phase of Help to Buy, which offers state-backed mortgages to people with deposits as low as 5 per cent, had been expected to get under way in January, but it was brought forward to last month in a surprise move by the Government. State-backed lenders Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), NatWest, Halifax and Bank of Scotland are offering products under the scheme and other major lenders including HSBC and Santander have confirmed their plans to join at a later date. Despite the strong price uplifts, Halifax said the quarterly measure of price rises has shown some signs of a slight cooling off. Prices in the three months to October were 1.6 per cent higher than in the previous three months. This rate is below the increases of 2 per cent or above recorded in each of the previous four months. Martin Ellis, Halifax housing economist, said: 'Low interest rates, and higher consumer confidence supported by the increasing evidence that a sustainable economic recovery may now be under way, are helping to increase housing demand. 'Schemes such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy also appear to have boosted demand.' He added: 'Sentiment towards selling has also improved in recent months in response to the pick-up in the market, which should help to increase the availability of properties on the market over the coming months.'","Estate agents Savills forecast average cost of a home would rise by 25 per cent in next five years - from £171,000 to £214,000 .

And now, thanks to the discovery of fur from a polar bear skin rug and hair from the artist, forensics expert Nicholas Petraco has authenticated her story. Proof: Abstract artist Jackson Pollock pictured with mistress Ruth Kligman before his death in 1956. For 57 years she said that the Red, Black & Silver painting was created for her. Now her claim has been verified with traces of fur from a polar bear skin rug . Final flourish: Pollock's mistress claims Red, Black & Silver, the painting featured on the cover of her memoir, was the artist's last work . According to Miss Kligman, who was 26 when she began her affair with Pollock, she watched as the artist famed for his drip paintings created the 2ft by 2ft abstract picture after she asked him 'to show me how you make a painting'. After her death in 2010, the trustees of her estate turned to retired detective Mr Petraco, who has used CSI techniques to uncover indisputable clues. Traces of fur from a polar bear skin rug in Pollock's East Hampton home, a hair from the artist and sand unique to his neighborhood have all been found in the painting. 'There’s a f***ing polar-bear hair . in the painting ... It’s Dick Tracy,' artist Jonathan Cramer, one . of the estate’s co-trustees, told the New York Post. 'The . world was flat. Now it is round. It’s Galileo. Science can now be used . to authenticate the art ... We are [tracing] the painting back to . where it was executed. It’s very CSI.' The discovery marks the first time crime scene analysis has been used to prove a painting's authenticity by looking for fragments found in it, rather than just on the paint. Art trail: Abstract artist Jackson Pollock and his wife Lee Krasner in 1950 . If Detective Petraco's findings are accepted by the trustees board, it would be a windfall for Miss Kligman's estate. A similar-size Pollock painting sold for $58.3 million at Sotheby’s in May last year. Art investigators use a variety of forensic techniques to determine if a work is genuine. Fingerprints on the canvas, analysis of brush strokes and signatures and even carbon dating on the canvas and pigments can all be used to prove if a work is the real deal. These small tell-tale signs can bring multi-million dollar windfalls to collectors. In one case, a trucker who bought a painting for $5 at a California thrift store in 1992 was offered $5 million for it after analysis matched a fingerprint on the canvas to prints on a can used by Pollock and another of his paintings. Despite the forensic analysis in that case, the work was not certified by the art world, but it was still deemed valuable by collectors. In the case of Red, Black & Silver, detective Petraco was able to find traces of Pollock's hair, sand from the East Hamptons and fur from a polar bear skin rug kept in the artist's home. Miss Kligman, described as having the looks of a silver screen siren, had tried to have the painting acknowledged as Pollock's last work since he presented it to her, saying: 'Here’s your painting, your very own Pollock.' The couple met in the Cedar Tavern in Greenwich when Miss Kligman was working for a gallery and Pollock, 44, was drinking heavily, according to Vanity Fair. In her 1974 memoir, Love Affair: A Memoir of Jackson Pollock, Miss Kligman recalled watching as Pollock created Red, Black & Silver on the lawn of his East Hampton home one July afternoon. 'I watched dazzled as you created it. How incredible, miraculous you were that afternoon in the sun,' she wrote. The result was: 'The final painting of your life, your legacy to me, silver shimmering substance of the cosmos, the red heart oval shape of love, and the black form grounds the field.' One month later Miss Kligman was the sole survivor of the car crash that killed Pollock and another woman after he drunkenly lost control of his car. With Pollock's widow, Lee Krasner, on the authenticating board however, the mistress had no chance of proving the painting given to her as a love letter was real. Muse: Artist Ruth Kligman says she watched Pollock create the painting for her in the garden of his East Hampton home . Dispute: Pollock with his wife Lee Krasner in 1949. She was on the authenticating board for his work after the artist died in a car crash . Kligman, an abstract painter and muse to many artists, died in 2010. As well as Red, Black & Silver, her estate included more than 700 artworks and letters from lovers and friends, including Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline and Andy Warhol. She had no beneficiaries so the future of the painting is unclear.","Retired detective used forensic methods to solve dispute over painting .

A three-year-old girl spent two days 'fending for herself' while her mother lay dead on the floor of their home, an inquest has heard. Avon saleswoman Sarah King, 40, collapsed after accidentally taking an overdose of prescription drugs. Her body was found by boyfriend Gary Eastell, 39, who went round to her home in Mount Pleasant, near Macclesfield on May 8, when she failed to respond to his text messages. The road in Mount Pleasant, near Macclesfield where the body of Sarah King was found. Her three-year-old daughter was found alone in the house with her dead mother . He found the little girl wandering around the property while her mother lay dead downstairs. An inquest in Macclesfield heard the toddler may have been in the house alone with her mother's body for up to two days before she was found. Mr Eastall told the inquest he discovered the door was unlocked and walked inside, where he spotted Ms King and called the emergency services. He said: 'The home was a mess. But that was because she [the little girl] was fending for herself. 'She had got food in the room. Sarah was normally spotless.' Ms King, who worked as an Avon saleswoman, had a long history of depression and had received psychiatric support for several bouts of the illness, dating back to the 1990s. Ms King, who was separated from her child’s father, last spoke to friends and family on May 6 this year, two days before she was discovered. Mr Eastell said: 'It was a Bank Holiday Monday. We had a nice day and walked by the canal. She seemed OK. 'That evening she sent me a text. She wanted me to tell her that I loved her.' He said he decided to reply the next day and fell asleep. When he didn’t hear back, he initially thought she was just 'in a bad mood'. Recording a verdict of misadventure, Cheshire's deputy coroner Jean Harkin said: 'I'm satisfied that she took the tablets. But I'm not satisfied she intended to end her life' Ms King’s sister Hilary Coles and father Peter Austin had also been repeatedly trying to reach her. Mr Austin, who was staying at Ms Coles’s house in Cornwall, called a friend to ask if they could check she was all right. Mr Austin, from Congleton in Cheshire, said: 'At about 10.50pm, my mobile phone rang. It was the police telling me what they had found.' A post-mortem examination revealed she had died from drugs toxicity linked to an anti-depressant. The inquest heard how Ms King had also been experiencing financial problems and was worried about becoming homeless. Detective Sergeant Jim Boulton, of Cheshire Police, said an investigation concluded there were no suspicious circumstances or third parties involved. Recording a verdict of misadventure, Cheshire’s deputy coroner Jean Harkin said: 'I’m satisfied that she took the tablets. But I’m not satisfied she intended to end her life. 'On the balance of probability, she took the tablets, perhaps after an argument, meaning to frighten rather than take her life.'","Avon saleswoman Sarah King collapsed after an accidental overdose .

France was rocked by a further downgrade to its credit rating yesterday as the country’s economic woes mounted. Credit agency Standard & Poor’s cut its rating on French debt from AA+ to AA in a humiliating setback for President Francois Hollande and his socialist administration. In a devastating analysis, the agency highlighted the risks posed by weak economic growth, high unemployment, the rising national debt and ‘elevated’ levels of tax and spending. The move, which made a mockery of Mr Hollande’s claim in August that ‘the recovery is here’, sparked a furious reaction in Paris. Finance minister Pierre Moscovici said: ‘I deplore certain judgments that, I think, are inexact criticisms. They underestimate the ability of France to transform itself, to right itself.’ Not so creditworthy: Standard & Poor poured humiliation on President Francois Hollande . But Michel Martinez, an economist at . French bank Societe Generale, said the ratings downgrade ‘is another . reminder of France’s challenges’. Julien Manceaux, an economist at Dutch banking group ING, said: ‘This comes as another wake-up call to the French government.’ The . downgrade – which could push up French borrowing costs as investors . worry about the  country’s credit-worthiness – came less than two years . after France was stripped of its AAA rating. It also sparked fears of fresh turmoil across the eurozone. In . a further blow to Mr Hollande, official figures showed industrial . output unexpectedly fell in September while the country’s trade deficit . with the rest of the world worsened. The . bleak data suggested that the French economy ground to a halt in the . third quarter of the year after a brief recovery in the second quarter. S&P says it expects unemployment in France to remain above 10 per cent until 2016 and to see net government debt to peak at 86 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 . Analysts . at Goldman Sachs estimate that the economy shrank by 0.1 per cent . between July and September, leaving France on the verge of another . recession. It made grim . reading for Mr Hollande who has failed to revive the eurozone’s second . largest economy and seen his approval ratings plummet since his election . in 2012. The European . Central Bank this week cut interest rates in the eurozone from 0.5 per . cent to a record low of 0.25 per cent as it stepped up its fight against . sluggish growth in the region and the threat of deflation. It . came just days after the European Commission predicted that Britain . will be the best performing major economy in Europe in 2013, 2014 and . 2015 – outstripping the eurozone big four of Germany, France, Italy and . Spain. S&P warned . that the modest reforms Mr Hollande has implemented ‘will not . substantially raise France’s medium-term growth prospects’. It . blamed ‘successive government’ moves to increase already-high tax . levels and ‘the government’s inability to significantly reduce total . government spending’. French . unemployment hit a record high of 11.1 per cent or 3.3million in . September and more than a quarter of under-25s cannot find work.","The move comes two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status .

A woman was found naked and raped in the back of a car after celebrating the first anniversary of her relationship with cocaine and champagne, a court has heard. The Welsh victim and her boyfriend had booked into a top hotel in London and visited a series of bars during the night out. They snorted cocaine and visited a champagne bar in Covent Garden - drinking three or four glasses each. Victim: The woman was found naked and raped in the back of a car after celebrating the first anniversary of her relationship with cocaine and champagne, Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) heard . However, they separated at midnight after a row, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard. The next thing the woman could remember was waking up at Limehouse police station in east London. She later discovered police had found her naked in the back of a car with Michael Wilson and Ahmed Qaras. Wilson, 31, had his trousers pulled down and his genitals exposed as he climbed out of the vehicle, the jury heard. Celebration: The Welsh victim and her boyfriend had visited a series of bars in London during the night out . Jennifer Knight, prosecuting, said: . ‘The victim and her boyfriend had come to London from Wales and . carefully planned their evening to celebrate their first anniversary. ‘They went to a champagne bar in Covent Garden where they had three or four glasses of champagne each. ‘They returned to their hotel room and shared Jack Daniels and Baileys, and did a couple of lines of cocaine each.' The couple then visited Shoreditch - where the woman is believed to have drank more Jack Daniels, a cocktail and shots of Sambuca - before separating after a 'disagreement', the court heard. Police recovered CCTV footage which showed the woman being followed by Wilson and Qaras, 26, on Leytonstone High Street at 1.13am. The two men were stopped after driving 'erractically' in Stepney at 1.55am - and were allegedly found trying to swap places in the car. Ms Knight said: 'When police got Wilson out of the car, his trousers were down and his genitals exposed. ‘In the back was the victim, completely naked and incoherent - she was unaware of where she was, who she was with and why she was naked.’ Wilson, from Plaistow, Newham, has denied rape, while Qaras, from Forest Gate, has pleaded not guilty to a single count of aiding or abetting the rape of a woman. In an interview with police, Wilson claimed he had sex with the woman, but she had consented and removed her own clothes. Qaras told officers he had parked the car and got out - unaware of what Wilson and the woman had done. Despite sobering up the next day, the victim still could not remember anything about the incident. Ms Knight added: ‘It must have been abundantly apparent to the defendants that they were taking advantage of a very drunk woman.’ The trial continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Welsh victim and boyfriend had been celebrating anniversary in London .

A convicted murderer who tortured a man to death in a row over a bag of chips has been sentenced to life in a woman's prison after arranging to have a sex change on the NHS. Paris Green - who was born Peter Laing - was one of three men who brutally attacked Robert Shankland - then munched on ham sandwiches as their victim lay dying. But Green will now serve her life sentence in Cornton Vale prison for women after Glasgow's High Court was told she is to receive what was described as 'gender realignment surgery' in England. Surgery: Paris Green - who was born Peter Laing - will serve a life sentence for murder at a women's prison after arranging to have a sex change operation at the taxpayer's expense . A jury heard how Green, 22, Kevin McDonagh, 23, and Dean Smith, 20, lured their victim to Green's flat in Glenrothes, Fife in March this year. Mr Shankland was tied up with torn bedding, battered, kicked and attacked with a rolling pin after a row over a bag of chips. A ligature was also tied around his neck and a plastic bag pulled over his head. Mr Shankland - who suffered from a heart disease - was killed either by suffocation or blunt force injuries. The killers then scoffed ham sandwiches which had been paid for after selling their victim's mobile phone. Victim: Robert Shankland, 45, was brutally tortured to death following a row which allegedly began over a bag of crisps . Judge John Morris QC locked each of them up at the High Court in Glasgow for a minimum 18 years. He told the trio: 'This was a particularly gruesome murder which effectively involved the torture of your victim over many hours. 'It beggars belief that you could act towards another human being in this way.' The judge added: 'Your conduct was utterly depraved. You left Mr Shankland - even in death - without any dignity whatsoever.' Green's friend Maggie Shields told the trial that she visited the flat and learned about the death - before recalling how the trio boasted about the beating. The 31 year-old explained: 'Dean jumped up quite excitedly and said: ""I will show you the body"". I still did not think that they had killed him.' Miss Shields went on to say the violence had erupted after a row about buying a bag of chips. But, the three killers concocted a story claiming Mr Shankland had made sexual advances to each of them in turn. The witness said she fled the flat terrified and contacted the police. McDonagh later told officers who arrested him: 'He tried to fight back. After that it was just disgusting.' The jury heard how McDonagh sent his mum a 'farewell' text that night. He also posted messages on Facebook to say he had 'f***** up his life' and had 'gone too far'. The court heard the victim had no record of any sexual convictions at all and his family were distraught at claims he was involved in such behaviour. Guilty: Kevin McDonagh, left, and Dean Smith, right,  helped lure Mr Shankland to Green's flat in Glenrothe's where they tortured him to death . Green's lawyer Ian Bryce said she had a 'troubled background' affected by issues with 'gender identity'. Mr Bryce added: 'This conviction might set back any gender realignment surgery as that has to be carried out in England.' Green's surgery is expected to cost several thousand of pounds and will include travel and accommodation expenses as well as guards. Inmates and staff at Cornton Vale are reportedly furious at having to deal with him. Scottish Tories chief whip John Lamont told the Daily Record: 'Upon killing this man, he should have lost all his rights to a sex change on the NHS. 'This sums up just how crazy our justice system has become.'","Paris Green will serve a life sentence in Cornton Vale prison for women .
