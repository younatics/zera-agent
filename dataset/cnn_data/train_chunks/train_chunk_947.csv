"By . Ruth Styles for MailOnline . She travels the world with her entourage, is loved by millions and is so recognisable that she's regularly stopped in the street: Welcome to the world of Grumpy Cat, the most famous feline on the planet. But while her famously cross looks might have made her name, her increasingly lucrative brand is all down to her agent, cat specialist Ben Lashes, 35. Currently in Canada where TV movie Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever is being filmed, Lashes is bubbling over with plans for the future, starting with a Channel 4 documentary starring the sad-faced feline that airs tonight. Man with a plan: Ben Lashes is the manager behind the internet phenomenon that is Grumpy Cat . But while the documentary has wrapped, the film has not and Lashes declares that he is thrilled with the way it's turning out. 'It's crazy,' he drawls gleefully down the phone from Toronto. 'Last night, we had race car that we crashed into a Santa village and thanks to Hollywood magic, Grumpy is in the car.' Grumpy, real name Tardar Sauce, was actually nowhere near the crashed car but that doesn't matter to her legions of fans who range in age from nine months to 90. Such inter-generational appeal means big bucks for Lashes and Grumpy's owners, siblings Tabatha and Bryan Bundesen, and a family-friendly brand of the sort to make advertisers salivate. Unsurprisingly, Grumpy has gone on to star in numerous ad campaigns, among them US cat food brand Friskies, as well as appearing on official merchandise that ranges from hoodies to 'Grumppuccino' coffee. Superstar: Grumpy Cat, real name Tardar Sauce, has feline dwarfism and a permanently sad face as a result . In demand: Grumpy Cat and her owner Tabitha Bundesen appear at the MTV Movie Awards . But she's not the only the only client of Lashes - real name Benjamin Clark - to be doing well from internet stardom. Also on his books are Nyan Cat, a cartoon feline with the body of a pop tart, and Keyboard Cat, which shot to posthumous fame thanks to a video which showed it playing the piano. Human clients include Scumbag Steve, the shifty looking star of a rap album cover that went viral, and Ridiculously Photogenic Guy aka Zeddie Little, a Charleston runner who shot to fame after a snap of him finishing a marathon proved popular online. This, he says, is a route to becoming a star that is becoming ever more routine and, he adds, isn't just for cats and runners. 'Look at [Justin] Bieber,' he explains. 'We know his name because he got famous on Youtube, as did Psy and Gangnam Style. 'On Youtube you see actors, . actresses and musians finding their audience through an online video. It probably . won't take over completely from the traditional route but it makes it easier for talent to rise to the top.' Grumpy Cat is a good example of how online fame can translate into big business but Lashes says he has no plans to take on any other cats - unless, of course, they have Grumpy's 'star quality'. 'I don't go after every cat that comes . out and I haven't picked up a new cat since Grumpy and perhaps I never will,' he confesses. 'My business is more than just cats but cats happen to run the internet. It feels like a . special moment where cats are overtaking the rest of the entertainment . industry.' And that couldn't be more true in Grumpy's case. 'It's been a bit of a whirlwind career,' admits Lashes, who is estimated to have made a 'low six-figure sum' from his involvement with the cat so far. 'She has two books, a movie, she's the . spokescat for Friskies, she has merchandise, although Grumpy herself has been really relaxed through it all.' Fame: Keyboard Cat, real name Fatso, achieved posthumous fame after this 1984 video went viral in 2007 . Not so grumpy: Grumpy's A Grumpy Book made the most of her mulish looks but she is actually very friendly . So what makes the perfect Hollywood cat other than a docile temperament. According to Lashes, it's all about a Monroe-esque magic. 'I've never been someone who's called up . every mildly famous cat on the internet,' he insists. 'I'm very picky. To be worth it, . they have to already be an icon. 'When I first saw Grumpy Cat, she was instantly, to me, something you . could never forget. So I think that the ones I care about and the ones . that have the potential to have a brand are the special ones. 'Not every . cat can do it and become a celebrity just like not every human can become a celebrity. A certain amount of it is magic - the . thing that makes the Beatles more than four guys playing in a basement. 'All the icons have that - there's a bit of that cosmic aura about them. That's the kind of thing Grumpy Cat has and she brings smiles to everyone.' And Lashes isn't exaggerating. Book signings attract huge crowds while appearances on shows such as Good Morning America send ratings soaring. No wonder Lashes is pleased. So what's next for the world's most famous cat? Lashes isn't telling. 'I'm planning to have this movie finished . up in the next few weeks, we'll take a break in the fall and then . unveil it to the world in late November as a Christmas gift for all of Grumpy Cat's . fans. 'For next year, people are going to just have stay tuned.'

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . I have just returned from Brazil but not before I witnessed the dejection of a nation almost in mourning after Neymar broke a bone in his back. I’ve heard some stupid things in my time, but for people to blame the referee for that injury is utter nonsense. It wasn’t an Under 11s game – these are grown men. And one professional footballer decided to stick his knee into the back of another pro at full force for no real reason. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots . Cynical: With the ball nowhere near Juan Zuniga smashes his knee into the lower part of Neymar's back . Man down: The Barcelona forward falls to the ground after the challenge that rules him out of the World Cup . Agony: Neymar lies in pain after being kneed in the back just three mintues from full time . Worry: Brazil's star man had to be carried off on a stretcher with three minutes of the game to play . VIDEO Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots . If the guilty man – Colombia’s Juan Zuniga - thinks that because his team-mates James Rodriguez was being fouled at other times in the game, he has licence to go in that hard with a reasonable chance he will cause injury (watch it again, it’s not a tactical foul, it’s not mistimed, it’s not a tap on the ankle it is a full force knee in the small of the Brazilian’s back), then he is wrong. I’ve heard ex-pros talk about the referee giving a team 'a free one.' This is where a bad foul is committed by a player from Team A on a player from Team B, but the referee doesn’t give a yellow card when perhaps he should. Not to blame: Referee Carlos Velasco Carballo did not have a great game but did not break Neymar's back . Team B then think they have ‘a free one.’ In other words they think they can commit virtually any foul they like and they will also get away with it. How old are these players? Ten? Playground logic. Any chance they could get on with playing football instead of trying to work out if they can get away with kicking and injuring their opponents? Fouls will happen, and sometimes it will be a tactic to commit fouls on certain players to stop their flow and that’s how Brazil decided to deal with the threat of Rodriguez. But none of the fouls on the Colombian were even close to causing him the kind of horrific injury that Neymar has suffered. Crying shame: Neymar sent an emotional message to the Brazilian public after his injury . Job to do: Luiz Felipe Scolari's side train ahead of their semi-final showdown with Germany . VIDEO Willian to shine in Neymar's absence - Silva . Blaming the referee is an easy way for professional footballers to wash their hands of the crimes of their colleagues. The referee for Brazil’s victory over Colombia, Spaniard Carlos Velasco Carballo, wasn’t particularly good (he was also the ref who failed to send off Uruguay’s Diego Godin against England), but he didn’t break Neymar’s back.","Referee Carlos Velasco Carballo did not have a great game but he did not injure Neymar .

"By . Kevin Keane For The Irish Daily Mail . A ‘pint of Plain’ is no longer your only man – as Guinness has just launched two new porters in a bid to get a taste of the action in the booming craft-beer market. The beer's production centre in Dublin, St James's Gate, will today start pumping out two new tipples, Dublin Porter and West Indies Porter, which will bear the name of the world-famous beer brand. Both are said to offer a modern twist on hallowed Guinness recipes. New contenders: Guinness has released the two new beers in an attempt to cash in on the craft beer trend . Irish craft breweries have expanded rapidly in recent years, with companies springing up in mostly rural locations across the country. Guinness’s head of innovation, Nick Curtis-Davis, said the two new bottled beers the company is releasing today are updated versions of historic recipes from the brewery dating back 145 years. He said the new beers are a reaction to the ‘broader repertoires’ of the Irish consumer but denied that Guinness was seeking to edge other smaller competitors out of the market. Authentic: The beers are said to be updated versions of historic recipes that are more than a century old . ‘I have to take my hat off to those guys because they are really invigorating the world of beer and we would love to co-exist with them, we are not looking to take them on. ‘What’s happening in craft beer is like manna from heaven. There’s never been a better time to be involved in beer – people are interested in beer again.’ The new venture into brewing comes as the company prepares to release a new blonde beer in a bid to tempt American drinkers. The paler brew will be brewed in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, but will use imported Irish yeast. U.S. invasion: Guinness is set to launch a blonde beer in the United States this month . The Irish Daily Mail sampled the new Guinness porters and here are our verdicts: . Dublin Porter: Will appeal to the fan of regular Guinness who seeks something with a bit more refreshment and a sweeter touch. West Indies Porter: Has the refreshing tang of hops many seek out in the multitude of Indian pale ales on offer in bars and off-licences. But as with many craft brews, will need to be approached with caution; at 6 per cent abv it packs a punch.","Brewer to start pumping out West Indies Porter and Dublin Porter flavours .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A British woman has been left shocked after finding a suspected illegal immigrant hiding on the back seat of her Fiat Panda after she drove from France to the UK. Sue Taber, who arrived home this morning after driving from Spain to France and back to Britain via the Eurotunnel, was astonished when she spotted a human leg behind the driver's seat after parking up outside her home in Shepherdswell, Kent. She made the unusual discovery as she let her two dogs out of the car and said the 5ft 8in man, aged between 18 and 20, emerged from her vehicle shouting: 'I'm an orphan, I'm an orphan'. Ms Taber, who believes the man got into her car while she left it briefly unattended and unlocked at Calais, France, admitted she had felt something nudging her back on her 53 mile cross-Channel journey, but assumed it was just one of her dogs fetching a ball. Scroll down for video . Sue Taber was shocked to discover the man hiding behind her driver's seat as she arrived back to her home in Shepherdswell, Kent, having driven from Spain via France and back to the UK via the Eurotunnel . She believes he had got into the back of her Fiat Panda (file picture) while she had stopped to check her dogs . She believes the stowaway climbed into her Fiat and hid behind the seat after she left it unattended while she checked her two dogs in. After making the discovery, she shouted at the stowaway 'in no uncertain terms' to 'get lost' before she went inside her home to dial 999 as he fled just before 9.30am. It comes just hours after a ferry bound for Britain was stormed by up to 250 illegal immigrants who tried to force their way on board the vessel at Calais. Security staff were forced to turn a fire hose on the immigrants as they attempted to overpower officials and machine-gun wielding police by climbing over fences and running up the main ramp into the P&O ferry's vehicle hold. Cross-Channel travellers are now being warned to stay alert when travelling through the French port, where more than 80 police officers and 40 riot police have been drafted in as part of heightened patrols. Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe said today that the company's site at Calais was extremely secure but added: ‘Everybody travelling through Calais should be vigilant whenever they leave their vehicle.’ Ironically, Ms Taber had been listening to a local radio station phone-in on migrants and the Calais incident as she drove home from the Eurotunnel terminal at Folkestone - but was completely unaware she was carrying one. She told BBC Radio Kent: 'I can't believe this happened, I just can't believe that this man got in my car. 'As I let the dogs out of the car a leg protruded from behind my seats and a chap got out  and said ""I'm an orphan, I'm an orphan"" at which point I told him to get lost. 'I just can't believe this man got in my car and I can only think that [it happened] when I took my dogs in to get their passports done at Calais - the only place where I would let my guard down and not had the car locked. MsTaber said the 5ft 8in tall man jumped out of her Fiat and started shouting 'I'm an orphan, I'm an orphan' after she pulled up outside her house in the quiet village of Shepherdswell, Kent (pictured) at about 9.30am today . 'I may be wrong, maybe I've done it somewhere else but it's the only place I can think of where I've got out of the car and maybe not locked it. 'I'm still shaking. You just can't believe it could happen to you. I've got a Fiat Panda for goodness sake, with two dogs in the back. 'And I've managed to get though passport control, everything else with a stowaway on board.' Ms Taber said she even felt her something nudging her back during the cross-Channel journey home but assumed it was her dog. She said: 'I thought my dog was nudging me in the back, she's a nutcase for balls and I'm thought she found one because I kept feeling something in the back of me. Now I know it probably wasn't [the dog], it was probably this chap wriggling. 'I feel outraged it happened to me, I wish it was someone else's problem, that sounds awful but I sound vulnerable now.' Ms Taber believes the man may have jumped into her car as she tended to her dogs before entering the Eurotunnel at Calais, France (pictured). The man has now been located by police after fleeing the scene . She said the incident was all the more unusual because she had taken 'security precautions' throughout her journey home from Spain. She said: 'I was paranoid driving back by myself so everywhere I stopped I clicked the door locked. 'If I stopped for a half hour break I'd stop where there was light outside the petrol station so I wasn't going to get hijacked. 'The only place that I think it could have happened was at Calais. 'It's the only place I might not have locked the car.' A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Kent Police was called at 9.27am today to reports of a suspected illegal immigrant in a car in Shepherdswell. 'Officers located the man and he has been transferred to the Home Office Immigration Enforcement (formally UKBA) for them to take any further action.'","Sue Taber spotted man's leg in car as she let out her dogs following journey .

"By . Adrian Durham . Follow @@talkSPORTDrive . I gave Wayne Rooney a standing ovation after he said the most sensible and productive thing any England player has said for decades. 'We are too honest,' our best player said. At long last someone gets it, someone who’s at the centre of England’s misery finally understands one of the basics of World Cups: you won’t get anywhere without a little bit of cheating. You can all get on your moral high horse and gallop off into the self-righteous distance if you like, but Rooney is unquestionably correct. I’ll give you two examples that could have – and should have – changed the course of English football history. Admission: Wayne Rooney said England were too honest during their World Cup disaster . Exit: England were eliminated eight days into the tournament and didn't win a game in Brazil . Firstly, Mexico 86. I notice this week Gary Lineker has been defending his record of no yellow cards in his career. That is a shameful boast. England were 2-1 down in the quarter final to Argentina in 1986, and late in the game John Barnes sends over a delicious cross to give Lineker a golden chance to equalise. But desperate to protect his no yellow cards boast, he bottled it, and Argentina cleared. Lineker should have cheated: by that stage of the game every England player knew Diego Maradona had scored with his hand, so Lineker should have cheated too. Elbow the defender out of the way, or put the ball in with your hand – just do whatever it takes to get that ball over the line and keep England in the World Cup. I’m not the only one who thinks that. I recently interviewed one of the England squad from 1986 who felt exactly the same way. But he wouldn’t go on record because 'you can’t crticise Gary, can you?' Yes I can. He should have been prepared to cheat for his country, and exact instant revenge on Maradona. Clean: Gary Lineker never received a yellow card during his career at the highest level . Hand of God: Diego Maradona's infamous goal against England at the Estadio Azteca in 1986 . The second example happened in this World Cup: Luis Suarez was clearly rushed back from injury to save Uruguay. So in Sao Paulo when he took to the field against England, did none of our players think it would be a good idea to get stuck into him? Don’t misunderstand what I’m saying here – I don’t mean break his legs deliberately or anything so crass. No, let’s be clear – I mean get physical with him, unsettle him, put him off his game. Rooney said that he was kicked 10 times during the Uruguay game and every time the opponent got away with it. So why didn’t we do the same to their best player, who wasn’t fully fit? Instead our players set up a five-yard exclusion zone around Suarez that no player in a white shirt could enter. The players might as well have sat in the crowd watching him. GET STUCK INTO HIM! Kick him off the park if you have to. Freedom: Luis Suarez ran England ragged during their 2-1 victory in Sao Paulo . Buried: Suarez scored twice to eliminate England from the tournament after their second loss . Diego Godin avoided a yellow card for planting his forearm into Daniel Sturridge’s throat. Where I used to play football if a ref did that it meant you had a free shot at one of their players. So where was the English elbow in the Uruguay throat? It never happened. I don’t want to win the FairPlay award thanks, I want to stay in the World Cup. Look at those who have done well: 2010 – both finalists disgraced the game with 120 minutes of kicking, fouling and diving. 2006 – Italy won the World Cup but cheated in the round of 16, Fabio Grosso admitted he dived for a penalty to beat Australia in the final moments of the game. In 2002 – Brazil were world champions, but who can forget Rivaldo clutching his face to get Hakan Unsal sent off when the Turk had clearly kicked the ball at Rivaldo’s leg? Rivaldo even confessed he’d cheated straight afterwards. Struck: Rivaldo falls to the floor holding his face in 2002, even though the ball hit his leg . Tumble: Fabio Grosso dived to win a penalty against Australia in 2006, and Italy went on to win the World Cup . The list goes on and so England face a choice: do we carry on giving every team we play against a head start? Or do we get down and dirty with the rest of them? England must start cheating. It’s what winners do. VIDEO 'Honest' Arjen has clear conscience .","England will not get anywhere without a little bit of cheating .

"By . Leon Watson for MailOnline . A father battered senseless by a man who taunted his daughter has angrily condemned British 'joke justice' after prosecutors let his attacker off with just a £400 fine. Supermarket worker David Tait, 42, was beaten up and suffered multiple injuries to his face when he confronted a young man for insulting his 16-year old daughter Faye. Father-of-three Mr Tait suffered a fractured cheek, broken nose and had to have a metal plate inserted under his right eye socket with doctors warning he might be left partially sighted. Scroll down for video . David Tait (left) has angrily condemned British 'joke justice' system after prosecutors agreed to drop a GBH charge against his attacker who had earlier taunted his 16-year old daughter Faye (with her father, right) Andrew Copland, who was fined £400 for 'insulting' David Tait, 42, after a new charge was agreed ahead of a planned trial at Bradford Crown . Police who watched CCTV of the attack and took photos of the victim's injuries later charged Andrew Copland, 20, with causing grievous bodily harm. If convicted, he could have faced five years in jail. But without Mr Tait's knowledge Copland was offered a new charge ahead of the trial at Bradford Crown Court, West Yorkshire. It was agreed he could admit a watered-down offence of 'using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour' towards the victim. Mr Tait then got a letter from a Crown Prosecution Service lawyer informing him of the result: 'The public order charge better reflects the evidence in the case. 'CCTV footage does not show who struck the first blow or how many blows were struck. I know that you may be disappointed with the decision - the courts have an even higher standard of proof than the test I have applied.' CCTV footage of the street brawl involving Copland and David Tait. Prosecutors said it wasn't clear enough for a GBH prosecution to proceed .

The letter also claimed an 'independent witness' gave a statement which supported Copland's account. But Mr Tait, from Baildon Green, in Shipley, said: 'If this is British justice then it is a joke. The horrific injuries I suffered left me looking unrecognisable and doctors told me I was very close to losing sight in one of my eyes.

Mr Tait said he saw Copland (pictured) after the conviction and 'he was laughing at me' 'The doctors said if I had taken two more punches I wouldn't be here today. How can anyone conclude that what happened to me is insulting behaviour?' The incident occurred last November after Faye had gone to the German markets in Leeds with friends. She bumped into Copland - a near-neighbour - and shortly afterwards she rang home in tears claiming he subjected her to a string of insults. Mr Tait said: 'My daughter was really really upset. She said Copland had come up to her and said things like 'you are a slag', 'your mum is a fat bitch' and all kinds of horrible things. 'I just told her to get herself to the train station and come on home and we will pick her up.' David Tait with his wife Marcia, older daughter Faye and younger daughter Pollyanna .

He later had an exchange of phone calls with Copland which led to a confrontation at a nearby ASDA car park. CCTV showed the two men facing each other before Mr Tait was knocked to the ground and beaten. The footage then showed Copland and a friend running off. Mr Tait, who still suffers from tingling numbness on the right side of his face and experiences double vision, said: 'I just remember he came for me and I went to block him in self defence. 'Then I remember him pummeling my face, punch after punch - it was unrelenting. The next thing I knew was waking up in hospital. 'We were ready to claim justice for what had happened. Not only was my daughter and wife traumatised after seeing me like that but I am still suffering. 'We just couldn't believe it when the letter arrived saying he got off. It came right out of the blue. Surely in a justice system the victims should be consulted first if they are going to let someone off who has been charged. 'I was told not to bother get my own solicitor because the CPS was there for us. Yet the CPS never rang us to tell us they had accepted this change of plea. I wish I had got my own lawyer now. 'It just seems the CPS just wanted a conviction and it does not matter what they get. It is just about ticking boxes. When I spoke to them they just said 'this is the decision we came to, we have a conviction and he has been charged'. 'But he wasn't charged for any assault whatsoever. I was just doing what any normal dad would do. I saw Copland after the conviction and he was laughing at me. 'I asked him if it was funny that I was two punches away from death and he got a £400 fine. He just replied, 'I am laughing aren't I?'' Mr Tait's wife Marcia, 41, said: 'When I first went to hospital the injured man lying in his bed didn't look like my husband at all. He was beaten to a pulp and initially I thought he was dead. He was unconscious and there was blood absolutely everywhere. ' She added: 'I remember there were police outside his hospital room and they said ""don't worry we are only here if things turn south"". 'Why would they say that if they didn't think it was serious. It seems you can go around beating up people and leaving them for dead and get fined £400. What lesson does that leave?' A CPS spokesman said: 'We have written to the victim to explain the reason behind the decision made in this case, and a Senior Crown Prosecutor has also spoken with Mr Tait. We are more than happy to discuss the matter further with Mr Tait if this would be of assistance.' The CPS also said a complaint procedure is available to Mr Tait and he should contact his Victim Liaison officer if he wanted to pursue it. Copland was unavailable for comment.","David Tait, 42, was beaten up and suffered multiple injuries to his face .

Scroll down for video . A world renowned forensic pathologist has recreated the last hours of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence's (pictured here with girlfriend Paula Yates) infamous death for a television series . With the help of NSW Coroner Derrick Hand, who presided over the original report into Hutchence's death, Dr Shepherd was able to create a detailed reconstruction inside the hotel room where the rocker was found. Dr Shepherd has previously looked at the high profile deaths of Michael Jackson, Anna Nicole Smith and Whitney Houston as part of his television series. 'Deciding at the end of a complex case like this which is the most important factor is very difficult. Here we’ve got drug use, drug abuse and also hanging – which one is the most important in determining the cause of death?' he said of Hutchence's death.

The events leading up to Hutchence's death are charted in the episode using toxicology reports not previously seen before. While there were no traces of heroin in his blood stream, Mr Hand said it didn't mean that Hutchence wasn't using heroin. The autopsy report showed Hutchence had a severe burn on two of his fingers, which was almost down to the bone. Dr Shepherd said this was common in heroin addicts who fall into a deep anaesthetised state and may not notice a cigarette burning through their skin. With the help of NSW Coroner Derrick Hand, who presided over the original report into Hutchence's death, Dr Shepherd was able to create a detailed reconstruction inside the hotel room where the rocker was found . His death was reported by the NSW Coroner to be the result of suicide. The moment he was found in his hotel door with a belt around his neck has been reenacted for the episode . The events leading up to Hutchence's death are charted in the episode using toxicology reports not previously seen before . Dr Shepherd said the toxicology report showed there was a mixture of cocaine, alcohol and the anti-depressant Prozac in his blood when he died. The episode revealed that Hutchence had started taking the prescription anti-depressant after suffering a blow to head in a fight with a taxi driver in 1993. The incident, which occurred while he was dating girlfriend at the time Helena Christensen, led him to lose all sense of smell and taste. Dr Shepherd said his use of Prozac was erratic and led to increased use of other drugs in the years prior to his death.

But his girlfriend Paula Yates publicly insisted Hutchence had died accidentally during a sex game gone wrong - a fact examined by Dr Shepherd in his episode.

"By . Marielle Simon for Daily Mail Australia . Ann Scognomillo, 56, was diagnosed with melanoma four years ago. Out of her six siblings, she is one in four who has developed the deadly skin cancer . It is a cancer that kills around 2,000 Australians each year, but prevention can be as simple as checking your skin and being aware of any significant changes. Now, a new study has revealed the risk of melanoma can quadruple if moles on your skin are present. Thankfully, Ann Scognomillo, a 56 year-old mother of two, was one of the lucky 11,000 Australians diagnosed with skin cancer each year, who has lived to tell her story. Originally misdiagnosed with psoriasis by her GP in the '80s, Ms Scognomillo's skin condition continued to worsen, with up to 16 dry-skin patches increasingly forming over her body. It was not until 20 years of incorrect treatment, that Ann sought a second opinion with Professor Rodney Sinclair, Director at Sinclair Dermatology, who told her she was actually suffering from Bowen's disease, an early form of skin cancer that appears as a continual, slow-growing, red and scaly skin patch. Aware of her risk to skin cancer, three out of her six siblings had developed melanoma, Ann was pedantic at checking for abnormalities, and four years ago she became the fourth sibling diagnosed with melanoma. 'I was worried because you don't know the degree of it but I am also pretty cluey with skin. 'I felt a lump on my fore-arm, it started off as a brown spot and after a couple of months it separated so I went straight to Rodney and he took a biopsy,' Ann told Daily Mail Australia. A few days later Ann received a call from Professor Rodney and was told to come straight back to the clinic to remove the melanoma. 'It made me panic but i felt it would be OK because the markings has only been on my skin for four months, so I got it early enough. 'If I had left it who knows where I'd be today,' Ann said. Around 11,000 Australians are diagnosed with skin cancer each year, with 2,000 of them being fatal . Ann discovered an unusual marking on her daughter Kate, 33 just after giving birth to her first child. Kate was diagnosed with melanoma in May 2010 and underwent surgery for removal . Ann describes her mother as being before her time, she said she diligently applying sunscreen to her and her siblings everyday, but unfortunately that did not prevent four out of six of them from developing skin cancer. She said the family are fair skinned, with quite a bit of moles covering their bodies. 'Out of the four of us who got melanoma, three of us have fair skin, two red heads but funnily-enough one brother has more of an olive pigment.' Ann's awareness of skin and the risks of cancer did not only save her life, but her daughter's Kate, aged 33. 'After my daughter had her first baby in 2010, I noticed a mark on her arm, which confirmed to be melanoma.' When asked how her interest in skin and checking for skin cancers came about, Ann said it was something she had always been aware of from a very early age. 'Even though I baked myself out in the sun with coconut oil, going brown as a berry, I was always interested in skin care and my sister is a beauty therapist, so it naturally followed from there. 'The awareness and knowledge about skin cancer is part of every day life and there is so much more out there these days.' Ann now goes for check-ups every 6 months and is incredibly grateful for Professor Sinclair and the studies that are being conducted. 'I think Rodney is doing a wonderful job. 'Before him I had skin cancer all over my body that I thought was psoriasis. I have confidence in him and we are very fortunate to have people like that in Melbourne.' Professor Sinclair (left), Director at Sinclair Dermatology, treats said results were shocking, as patients with moles were 4.6 times more likely to develop skin cancer . For Professor Sinclair, a world leader in skin cancer diagnosis and treatment, the results were shocking, as patients with moles were 4.6 times more likely to develop skin cancer, compared to the previous misconception that the risk only doubled if benign or unusual moles are present. The case-link study, conducted by the University of Melbourne, University of Oxord and the Epworth Healthcare, compared the medical records of two groups of people - 271,656 for who had moles checked during a hospital visit for any condition, and 10,130,417 who did not have moles recorded. 'Patients go in for a check-up and some are told everything is alright but the people who have self-identified as having moles and has been assessed, are the ones who need to be very mindful and make sure they are going for regular examinations,' Professor Sinclair told Daily Mail Australia. Despite these significant findings, Professor Sinclair believes vigilance is key and fatality can be prevented. 'Melanoma has improved - the success rate has jumped from 80 per cent to 90 per cent, that means 9 out of 10 people can expect to be cured at the time of removal. 'But for 10 per cent of people, the melanoma would end up spreading to other organs, called metastases spread.' He says patients who have metastases spread, considered as Stage 4, has a 25 per cent chance of surviving a year, and only 2 per cent chance of a two year survival. Superficial spreading of a patient of Professor Sinclair . Acral lentiginous melanoma is a fare melanoma usually found on the palms, soles, under the nails and in the oral mucosa . Although melanoma is the least common cancer, it is also the most serious type of skin cancers, with Australia having one of the highest rates in the world. Professor Sinclair puts this down to Australia being closer to the equator and a population of European settlers. 'The Indigenous Australians have a very low risk of melanoma because of the protection provided by their skin pigmentation, but the northern Europeans, people with blue eyes, fair skin and red hair are at an increased risk since moving to Australia. 'A very good study that was done years ago showed that people who moved to Australia before the age of 15 would see their risk increase dramatically.' He explains in Victoria, the base line risk of melanoma is 3 per cent, compared to a 10 per cent rise in Queensland, where people typically spend more time outdoors and see more sun. But despite somber figures, the new study reveals can be taken in a positive light that skin cancer can successfully be treated if people take responsibility and diligently check their skin. 'People who have a history of moles and have had check-ups need to look out for new moles. 'For children up to the age of 15 or 16 it is normal to develop new ones, but if you have a mole with undergoing change, shape or colour or even something on you skin that bothers you, that's an indication that you should get your skin checked.' Nodular melanoma . When melanoma develops in a pre-existing mole, there is usually: . *an area of colour change . *growth . *change in colour . *or even a new mole develops in an adult . He also describes the 'ugly duckling phenomenon': . *if there is something on your skin that bothers you or makes you feel uneasy . Professor Sinclair recommends seeing a doctor after 4-6 weeks if you notice the 'ugly duckling phenomenon' on your skin .","A new study reveals having moles on your skin can quadruple the risk of developing melanoma .

Danger man: Chile will challenge themselves to make it difficult for the seemingly unstoppage Brazil striker . Their two front players are the first line of defence: they work so hard to close down the opposition defenders. From front to back, every player has to defend and get forward, which makes them very dangerous. The credit for that system has to go manager Jorge Sampaoli. I genuinely believe they could smother Brazil in possession. Sampaoli will surely have a plan to stop Neymar, which is maybe why he stopped training earlier this week when a helicopter hired by Brazilian TV flew over their training ground. Mastermind: Sampaoli has built a brilliant team who even saw off world champions Spain to qualify .

A bus carrying more than 50 wedding guests was swept away by a flooded stream in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir and all but three of the passengers are missing, officials said. Police officer Rajesh Kumar said the three swam to safety and told rescuers that about 50 others were trapped in the bus. Rescuers were searching for the bus but have not been able to locate it in the gushing waters. New landslides and heavy rains blocked access to the area, Mr Kumar said. Locals in Srinagar in Indian controlled Kashmir battle to save the life of this woman who is at risk of being washed away in fast-moving flood water . Some people were forced to take refuge on the roof of their home as the flood waters continued to rise following the worst rains in the past 22 years . Within a matter of minutes, the flood waters rose up to chest height, forcing the evacuation of large areas of Srinagar with more than 5,000 people fleeing to safety . Officials earlier said the bus was carrying about 70 people. 'There is a lot of confusion,' Mr Kumar said. The Press Trust of India news agency said the bride and bridegroom were among the missing people who were returning home from a wedding ceremony in a village in the Rajouri region, about 110 miles south west of Srinagar, the main city in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir. The region's wedding season has been disrupted by heavy rains and the worst floods in 22 years, and many ceremonies have been postponed. At least 18 people have died in the past two days, and authorities have closed schools and stopped train services in the Kashmir valley. Meteorologists said the heavy rains were likely to continue for another two days. Police officer Imtiyaz Hussain said the 18 victims were swept away by floodwaters or buried by mud from mountain slopes - 14 in the Jammu region and four in the Kashmir valley. They included a paramilitary officer whose bunker collapsed on him. In one incident, a bus containing a wedding party was washed away by raging flood waters around 100 miles away from Srinagar in a remote region of Kashmir . More than 100 villages across Kashmir were flooded as these residents watch anxiously as the River Tawi in Jammu looks set to burst its banks . Scores of people trudge through the rising flood waters carrying whatever belongings they can manage as they attempt to make their way to higher ground . Soldiers and rescue workers used boats to move thousands of people to higher ground. At least 100 villages across the Kashmir valley were flooded by overflowing lakes and rivers, including the Jhelum river, which was up to four feet above its danger level, officials said. Landslides and floods are common in India during the monsoon season, which runs from June through September. Parts of Srinagar were also flooded. In Bemina, a large neighbourhood, thousands of residents waded through ankle-high water that entered their homes. Authorities evacuated 5,000 people from the neighbourhood and 100 others were believed to be stranded there. Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both. They have fought three wars, two of them over control of Kashmir, since winning independence from Britain in 1947.

"By . Victoria Woollaston for MailOnline . At first glance these images might look like the product of digital trickery, but these these delicate shots are very much real. French photographer Bertrand Kulik took the snapshots by photographing the plants through tiny raindrops in his garden from two inches (five centimetres) away using a micro-lens. Among the flowers captured are daisies, passion flowers, cosmos and nasturtiums viewed through water droplets on leaves or other plants. The photos were taken by French photographer Bertrand Kulik in his back garden in Paris. Flowers include daisies, (pictured) passion flowers, cosmos and nasturtiums viewed through water droplets. Mr Kulik spends hours looking for the perfect shaped droplets and positions. This image is called Flower Smile . Mr Kulik, 34, said: ‘A few years ago when I was taking some pictures in my parents' garden, I saw some great reflections of our home inside drops of water. ‘With my camera, I tried to take some pictures, and I liked how abstract they were. ‘After flowers I thought it could be funny and interesting to take some other things. That's why I tried with different subjects. After my view, I tried to show my world.’ Bertrand creates the images by inverting a refracted image, which is seen through the water droplet. He said that the drops themselves act like tiny lenses, that are placed within the background. Each of the delicate images were taken on a Canon MP-e 65mm lens from 2 inches (5cm) away. This image shows a poppy captured through a drop. Poppies are used as a symbol of peace and death. In Greek and Roman myths, poppies were used as offerings to the dead. In Classical mythology, their scarlet colour signifies a promise of resurrection after death . Mr Kulik creates the images by inverting a refracted image, which is seen through the water droplet. He said that the drops themselves act like tiny lenses, that are placed within the background. Two droplets in this photo are used to capture cosmos flowers . Mr Kulik said: ‘I try to look for water droplets on flowers and sometimes I use a water spray to make some drops.But often, after the rain, it's not difficult to find a blade of grass with drops. I then look around for a flower or something else to catch the perfect angle.’ A daisy is captured in a water droplet on a passion flower . ‘I try to look for water droplets on flowers and sometimes I use a water spray to make some drops.But often, after the rain, it's not difficult to find a blade of grass with drops. I then look around for a flower or something else to catch the perfect angle.’ The photographer and concert violinist uses a Canon MP-e 65mm lens, which allows him to get up close with his subject. He said: ‘It's very important to be very calm when using this lens because shaking is forbidden if you want a very good and clear focus. ‘It's like a sport because when we are very close to the subject, vibrations are stronger. Another cosmos flower is reflected in a water droplet on the petal of a Lysimaxhia arvensis. Mr Kulik said he spends hours finding a real round drop, and position, to help create the perfect pictures . In this image, two sunflowers are visible on water droplets clinging to the bottom of a blade of grass. Sunflowers are part of the Helianthus genus in the Asteraceae family. The common sunflower, known as Helianthus annuus, is the most recognisable species . This is one of a number of images in Mr Kulik's collection that shows a passiflora, or passion flower, in a water droplet. They are part of the genus of plant that produces the passion fruit. Many species of the flower blossom for a single day each year . ‘I have to be very zen! A good light is also very important, and for the picture to be pure and beautiful, it's very important to find a good flower.’ Mr Kulik spends hours finding a round drop to help create the perfect pictures. He said: ‘The shape of the drop is important because if it is really round the picture inside will be clear. I try to take a series of pictures and then I will use the best one.' 'I love nature, and even in a big city it's possible to take some nice pictures of nature!' In this image, a daisy is reflected through the water droplet on a veronique flower. The daisy's latin name is Bellis perennis, which means 'pretty' and 'everlasting'. The name is said to have derived from 'day's eye' and in Medieval times, Bellis perennis was more commonly known as Mary's Rose . A pair of cosmos flowers are captured through droplets on a blade of grass. ‘Photography is a means of expression as well as music,' said Mr Kulik. 'Whether it’s a violin or a camera in my hands, the important thing for me is in search of colours and materials, and especially the desire to communicate to others what touches me' This image shows a bunch of passion flowers reflected upside down in the droplet. One species of the passion flower, known as the maypop, has traditionally been used to make drinks that help relieve insomnia, hysteria, and epilepsy . ‘Photography is a means of expression as well as music. 'Whether it’s a violin or a camera in my hands, the important thing for me is in search of colours and materials, and especially the desire to communicate to others what touches me. If I don't have my camera with me, everything I see in front of my eyes, I have missed.’ Other photos in his collection include his border collie Vanilla, a hen named Cinammon and even the Eiffel Tower, which can seen from his Parisien home. Other photos in his collection include Mr Kulik's border collie Vanilla (pictured) a hen named Cinammon and even the Eiffel Tower, which can seen from his Parisien home . Nasturtiums, like the ones seen reflected in the droplets of this image, descend predominantly from two species native to Peru. One was brought to Europe by Spanish conquistadors in the late 15th to early 16th century. A second species was brought to Europe in the 17th century by a Dutch botanist. Many parts of this species of flower are edible, and they have been used in cooking for centuries . The common name for yellow rudbeckia (pictured) is black-eyed Susan. It is the state flower of Maryland and has traditionally been used to symbolise justice .","The photos were taken by French photographer Bertrand Kulik in his back garden in Paris .

"By . Taylor Lorenz . An Instagram account dedicated to men wearing J. Crew's most popular shirt has taken the social media platform by storm. That J. Crew Gingham Shirt, run by Jon San, a 27-year-old television writer in New York, dutifully documents ‘shirt sightings’ across New York City and in the media. San noticed that the shirt had become increasingly prominent in society throughout the past year, when he decided to create the account. Check marks the spot: The 'That J. Crew Gingham Shirt' Instagram account documents men in New York wearing J. Crew's most popular button-down. This young man pairs his with a coordinating navy backpack . Wearing it well: This man has no regrets about sporting his gingham shirt as he  gazes across a street . ‘It began when I went to a movie with a friend and I was wearing my J. Crew navy gingham button down. My friend showed up, and of course, he was also wearing the shirt. We sat down next to each other and were like, dude, everyone has this shirt!’ A few months later, San was watching The Internship, a movie starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, when he noticed the shirt again. ‘Owen Wilson is literally wearing that shirt for most of the movie,’ San remarked, ‘So I took a photo of it on my TV and I thought, there’s something to this.’ The next time he was confronted with a man wearing the shirt he took action. He set up the Instagram account, told a few of his friends, but still viewed it more as a small side project. ‘I wanted to see how often I could see this shirt, because I feel like I see it every day,’ he said. Seeing double: One man shields his face as he's confronted by 'That J. Crew Gingham Shirt' Twice as nice: Office workers tuck in and button up before sporting their gingham shirts on the job . The shirt itself is called the Secret Wash Shirt in Faded Gingham, and retails for $64.50 on the J. Crew website. J. Crew describes it as, ‘The shirt every guy needs in his arsenal, in a classic gingham pattern. It's exceptionally soft, thanks to our top-secret multistep wash process. (If we told you what it was, it wouldn't be a secret. Sorry.) Classic fit. Two-ply cotton. Button-down collar. Machine wash.’ San says while he doesn’t seek out men who are wearing the shirt, he has gone through lengths to track them down and document the sighting. He’s chased people down the block and will even run up next to pedestrians to confirm that they’re wearing the faded gingham shirt in question. ‘The shirt isn't hard to spot once you notice it, and once you do you’ll see it everywhere,’ he says, ‘I've become embarrassingly good at recognizing that shirt. Check it: Even J. Crew employees have joined in on the fun, playfully snapping this Instagram from within their corporate headquarters . Rumpled and ready: The shirt is machine washable and fine to throw in among colored laundry . Paging the style police: San says before he shoots his Instagram photos he notes whether the item has been washed and ironed . ‘I walk down the street, and I see the street as people who have this shirt and people who don’t.’ The shirt itself is only available in one color, navy. So softer colors and smaller checks are telltale signs of an imposter. San admits that after founding the account, he’s become increasingly interested in the origins of the shirt. ‘I want to know it’s an inside joke at J. Crew too. For such a wildly popular item I can’t even tell what season it’s part of. Most of his sightings take place on the way to work in Manhattan. ‘But surprisingly,’ he noted, ‘I was in Brooklyn a couple weeks ago, and- I wouldn't have expected it to be a Williamsburg shirt- but I saw three in one night!’ Worn everywhere and anywhere: Comedian Rob Delaney chose to wear his shirt to a children's book reading . Check mate: Timothy Simons from HBO’s Veep sports his J. Crew shirt in an interview with James Franco . Velvet rope-worthy? A man in his gingham button down negotiates entrance into a Manhattan nightclub . The Instagram account documents all types of people wearing the shirt, however it’s clear that styling is critical. The shirt is basic enough that it can be tucked in for a formal look, but versatile enough that it can be untucked and worn over shorts. ‘I don’t tuck it in’ San noted, ‘but it’s okay if you do.’ Before uploading the photo to Instagram he also takes note of how many buttons are undone, how many times it looks like the shirt has been washed and if it’s been ironed. He doesn't actively upload photos where he thinks people look bad and he tries to keep the comments on the Instagram photos fun and lighthearted. The button-down that began it all: The shirt itself is called the Secret Wash Shirt in Faded Gingham, and retails for $64.50 on the J. Crew website . Keep in check: The Instagram account that documents the craze launched only two weeks ago, but has been gaining popularity at lightning speed . Women have also begun wearing the shirt. ‘Just today someone tagged my handle in another photo, and the girl is clearly wearing the shirt. It’s the first time I’ve seen a women wearing it.’ San says he is dedicated to documenting the item no matter who is wearing it or where it’s worn. Jon still has his original J. Crew gingham shirt, though he tries not to wear it too much these days. ‘I see it everywhere already, and I know if I put it on I’ll run into someone else wearing it.’ ‘It’s just such a simple shirt. Any guy can put on this shirt and look good, to very good.","The 'That J. Crew Gingham Shirt' Instagram account documents men wearing J. Crew's most popular shirt .

A town was in shock last night after nine-year-old twins were killed by their brother in an appalling family tragedy. Tommy and Patrick O’Driscoll were stabbed to death by their  22-year-old brother Jonathan, who fled the scene at Charleville, County Cork, Ireland and later took his own life. Parents Thomas and Ellen O’Driscoll had been on a shopping trip – to a town just six miles away – and had left Jonathan in charge. Twin boys have been found dead at a home in Deerpark, Charleville, County Cork while the body of a third member of the same family, a man in his 20s, was found 10 miles away in a suspected double murder and suicide . The scene where nine-year-old twin boys were found dead in the Charleville area of north county Cork tonight . Sources . close to the investigation said: ‘This is the most horrific crime we’ve . ever had to deal with. It is hard to see what would spark something . like this.’ It emerged last . night that the bodies of the twin boys were discovered in separate . bedrooms by their younger brothers who are aged three and five. Neighbours . who came running to the house after hearing the children’s cries for . help saw a car being driving away at speed. Within an hour, the car was . found in Buttevant, also in Co. Cork. Jonathan’s body was found nearby; . foul play is not suspected in his death. There . was speculation last night that Jonathan had recently learned that he . was adopted, and that he killed his brothers in a fit of rage. Last night details about the tragedy were still emerging. Earlier, . the twins’ elder brother Jonathan had picked the boys up from school in . nearby Banogue, and he had been tasked with minding his younger . siblings. Parents Thomas and Ellen, who have six children, had driven six miles to nearby Kilmallock on a shopping trip. The two youngsters, aged nine, were found dead in their home just outside the town of Charleville in north county Cork in the Irish Republic shortly before 5pm today. About an hour later, a relative of the boys, believed to be aged in his early 20s, was found dead in a forested area . The . boys’ younger brothers – aged just three years and five years – . discovered the twins’ bodies in separate bedrooms when they returned to . their cottage home after playing outside. A number of children ran to neighbours’ homes for help. A . security source said that children who had been playing near the . O’Driscolls’ home raised the alarm. ‘Little kids found them and started . screaming, and the alarm was raised,’ a security source said last night. As neighbours ran to answer cries of panic, a car was seen driving away from the house at speed. It emerged last night that children, aged ten and 14, later found the body of Jonathan O’Driscoll while playing near Buttevant. A source said: ‘The body was found down at Buttevant Castle which lies on the edge of Buttevant, beside the Awbeg River.’ Last night, the twins’ bodies remained at the scene at Charleville, with the area sealed off for technical examination. The office of the State Pathologist had been notified and post mortems are expected to be carried out today. The schoolboys both received multiple stab wounds on the upper body, according to security sources last night. Sources . close to the investigation said that it was one of the most horrific . scenes that they had ever encountered. ‘The family and the community are . traumatised,’ the source said. Up . to 30 friends and relatives of the O’Driscoll family gathered outside . the family home last night, where an armed patrol unit of An Garda . Síochána was dispatched shortly after the devastating discoveries. Late last night, the main Limerick-Cork road remained closed. A . spokesman for Charleville GAA Club said ‘the whole town had come to at a . complete standstill’ and that it was ‘a tragedy for the town’. It is understood a house has been sealed off in the Deerpark area of the town and at O'Rourke's Cross, the main Cork to Limerick Road has been closed to traffic as preliminary investigations continue . Fianna Fáil TD Michael Moynihan told the Mail that he was ‘shocked and deeply saddened’. A . friend of the family said last night: ‘I haven’t spoken to them yet, . but this will kill them. Ellen was a devoted mother who worked hard to . bring her children up right. She loved children and I think even . fostered two and might have adopted a third. This is a terrible . tragedy.’ The friend added: ‘It will hit both of them badly, but poor Thomas has only recently come out of hospital.’ Another . friend told the Mail last night: ‘I don’t know all the details, but a . neighbour heard a commotion and screams in the house. He then saw the . older son running out of the house and then he called for help. ‘One . of Thomas and Ellen’s sons came round very quickly, and I understand . the two little lads were found in different rooms in the house.’ The . brothers were pupils at Banogue NS in Croom, Co. Limerick. When . contacted last night principal Sheila Cagney said she did not want to . comment, saying only, ‘We are all terribly upset.’ Charleville . priest Tom Naughton visited the grieving family last night. ‘I said . prayers and comforted them and assured them of the ongoing support of . everyone in Charleville,’ he said. ‘It’s just devastating.’ A well-informed source said: ‘Those poor little boys suffered a shocking death.’ Locals . were stunned into silence for much of the day. However, as evening drew . in, and the news began to filter through of the nature of the boys’ deaths, some in the town began to weep openly on the streets.

"By . Becky Barrow for the Daily Mail . The number of people buying annuities has fallen by as much as 50 per cent . Britain's pensions revolution has triggered a collapse in the number of savers buying an annuity. Financial adviser Hargreaves Lansdown revealed that its sales of annuities – an income for life paid by an insurer when you cash in your pension pot – have fallen by more than 40 per cent in just one year. Aviva and Legal & General said their annuity sales have plunged by 23 per cent and 49 per cent respectively. From next April, savers will no longer have to buy an annuity to access their cash. Instead, they will be able to take money out whenever they wish. Figures show the new rules have already caused a huge slowdown in people buying an annuity. The shake-up, described by the Chancellor as ‘the most radical changes to pensions in almost 100 years’, comes after annuities have been widely criticised for ripping off customers, with many unwittingly locking themselves into poor deals. Many signed deals without realising their loved ones would not see a penny of their savings if they died first. Alan Higham, retirement director of Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: ‘People are pausing and thinking: ""Should I still do that?"" ‘With a £20,000 pension pot, a lot of people are saying: ""I’d rather have the £20,000, than an annuity. ""I’ll take £10,000 next year and £10,000 the following year and not pay too much tax on it and do what I want with it.""' Others are simply deciding to postpone their retirement because their partner is not ready to stop work, they enjoy their job or they cannot afford to retire, he added. Legal & General recently warned it expects the market to remain ‘subdued with volumes down 50 per cent for 2014 and down a further 50 per cent in 2015.’ The shake-up comes after many savers signed deals which froze out their spouses if they died first. Posed by models . Hargreaves Lansdown said it sold just 3,319 annuities between January and June this year, compared to 5,650 during the same period last year, a fall of 41 per cent. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers said: ‘The Budget was a game changer for savers and this is a year of change for savers too.’ Annuity rates have also fallen sharply in recent years. In 1990, a 65-year-old with a £100,000 pension pot typically retired with an income of £15,640 a year; on today’s market they would get just £6,264.","Legal & General saw annuity sales drop by 49 per cent and expected worse .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . David Cameron is facing humiliation in Europe, as Brussels prepares to hand Britain a junior commissioner role. A leaked document reveals Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker plans to give Tory peer Lord Hill the Energy and Climate Change brief. Downing Street scrabbled to insist this would still be considered an economic brief, but is far from the heavyweight role Mr Cameron hoped for and would see Lord Hill serving under ex-Latvian PM Valdis Dombrovskis. David Cameron tried to block Jean-Claud Juncker's appointment as Commission President, and now faces the paying the price by Britain being given a low rank job . Mr Cameron caused a major political row this summer when he tried to block Mr Juncker’s appointment. The Prime Minister pushed the decision to a vote of all EU leaders, and lost after only attracting the support of Hungary. Mr Juncker then warned Mr Cameron to send a woman to Europe or risk Britain forfeiting a top role at the European Commission. But the PM instead chose Lord Hill, a former Tory education minister who was sitting in the Cabinet as Leader of the Lords. His role in Brussels could be key to Mr Cameron’s hopes of securing major reform of the EU, before Britain holds an in-out referendum in 2017. It now appeared that Britain could be punished for the decision, after it emerged the big economic roles look set to go to other countries. Each EU member state nominates a candidate to become a European Commissioner, but as President Mr Juncker decides which areas they will have responsibilities for. The last British commissioner, Baroness Ashton, held the prestigious foreign affairs brief. But according to a report on the Euroactiv website, Britain will be left with the Energy and Climate Change brief this time round. In contrast France is in line for the powerful Competition commissioner, a key area for Mr Cameron’s hopes of overhauling Brussels’ powers. Lord Hill had insisted three weeks ago that he did not want the EU Commissioner job, but weeks later Mr Cameron put his name forward . The list has not been finalised, and could yet be open to negotiation. In an attempt to put a brave face on the issue, Mr Cameron's official spokesman today insisted that some commentators had considered the energy role to be an economic brief. 'When the prime minister met the president of the commission Jean Claude Juncker he made the case for an economic portfolio for the incoming UK commissioner and that hasn’t changed,' the spokesman added. Lord Hill was a surprise choice for the role, after more high profile figures including ex-ministers Andrew Lansley and David Willetts were tipped for the job. Other countries appear to have responded to the plea for more women in key roles. Belgium has chosen Marianne Thyssen as its candidate. Belgium was the last of the EU's 28 EU members to put forward its choice for commissioner, a result of continuing uncertainty on a new coalition government. The European Parliament has warned that it might not confirm Juncker's 28-strong team if it contained fewer women than the outgoing Commission, which has nine. Lord Hill's nomination attracted ridicule coming days after he ruled himself out for the role. Asked if he wanted to go to Brussels, he told the Conservative Home website: 'Non, non, non. ‘First, I don't believe I'm going to be asked. Secondly, I like it here. I quite like it at home, in the British Isles.' In a separate interview with PoliticsHome, Lord Hill also confessed: ‘I am not very good at thinking long term.’ Yet his role in Brussels could be key to Mr Cameron’s hopes of securing major reform of the EU, before Britain holds an in-out referendum in 2017. It was not the first time the PM appears to have ignored the peer. In 2012, he secured a meeting with the PM to tender his resignation. But instead of accepting – or protesting – Lord Hill’s decision, Mr Cameron reportedly told him to carry on his good work, and strode out of the room after being told he was late for a photocall. As a result, Lord Hill remained in post. Lord Hill worked in the Conservative Research Unit and as special adviser to Kenneth Clarke in the 1980s and served in the Number 10 Policy Unit 1991-2 and as political secretary to Prime Minister John Major.","Leaked list says Lord Hill will be the new Commissioner for Energy .

"By . Ted Thornhill . A woman in Russia has sparked outrage after burying her dog in a human graveyard, with locals describing it as ‘sick’ and ‘an affront to the Christian faith’. She could now face jail on blasphemy charges after prosecutors were alerted. Ludmilla Yelsukova's burial ceremony for her pet Yorkshire Terrier happened three years ago in the village of Chesnokovka, in Bashkortostan, a federal subject in south-western Russia. Outrage: Locals in the Russian village of Chesnokovka were outraged to learn that a Yorkshire Terrier has been buried in a human graveyard (above) But it was only recently that other people whose relatives were buried there found out that the well-tended tomb was for a dog. They said it was blatant ‘paganism’ and an affront to religion, and demanded it be moved. ‘This is the revival of the ancient religions of animal worship and is not only sick but a massive insult to the Christian faith,’ said Maria Papova, one of the local residents. Grief: Ludmilla Yelsukova (above) said she hasn't had anyone in her life since losing her Yorkshire Terrier . Anger: Locals have called the grave 'sick' and 'an affront to the Christian faith' But the tearful 47-year-old woman has so far refused, saying the plot was paid for and she still needed a place to mourn.

"By . Ryan Gorman . and Associated Press Reporter . Atheist: Shannon Morgan is suing to have her custom atheism license plate made . A New Jersey woman claims she was denied a custom license plate proclaiming her an atheist is suing the state to have it made. Shannon Morgan, of Maurice Township, said in a federal lawsuit filed Thursday that the Motor Vehicle Commission violated her First Amendment rights when its website rejected the plate reading '8THEIST' because it was deemed potentially offensive. Morgan claims she then then filled out the online application using the phrase 'BAPTIST' as a test and the government-run website accepted it. The woman sent the agency a letter of complaint by registered mail and made several attempts to contact them by phone, all of which went unanswered, she claims in the suit. Americans United for Separation of Church and State is representing Morgan in the lawsuit. The Washignton, D.C.-based group's website says it is 'dedicated to preserving the constitutional principle of church-state separation as the only way to ensure religious freedom for all Americans.' Messages and emails left for the Motor Vehicle Commission on Friday were not returned. A recorded message said the offices were closed in observance of Good Friday. Denied: The New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission denied this anti-religion license plate . Approved: But the state approved this 'BAPTIST' license plate without reservation . New Jersey previously, after a brief flap, approved a request from an atheist group's president for a license plate that read 'ATH1EST,' with the number one in place of the letter 'i.' That dispute is mentioned in the suit, Gothamist reported. 'The commission thus has a practice of denying personalized license plates that identify vehicle owners as atheists, thereby discriminating against atheist viewpoints and expressing a preference for theism over non-theism. 'Although the commission eventually relented and granted Mr. Silverman his requested license plate, it refuses to allow Ms. Morgan’s requested plate.' Ayesha N. Khan, the legal director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, said the fact this has happened at least twice in New Jersey shows the problem has not been fixed. The Motor Vehicle Commission is 'disfavoring atheist plates and not fixing the system. Whatever Internet glitch there might be cannot be the explanation this time,' Khan said, adding that they were seeking the enactment of new agency regulations that include 'objective, viewpoint-neutral criteria for issuing a plate.'","Shannon Morgan claims her First Amendment rights are being violated .

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A Palestinian barber has not allowed the destruction of his shop during the conflict between Hamas and Israel to put him out of business. The shop in Absen, near the town of Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza strip was badly damaged as a result of the heavy shelling. The entire store front was destroyed and some internal ceilings collapsed, but amazingly, several large mirrors survived the heavy bombardment. This barber shop in Absen near Khan Yunis in southern Gaza was badly damaged in the conflict . Despite losing the store front and part of his ceiling, the barber returned to work earlier this week . In remarkable scenes, Palestinian children queue for a haircut while rubble from the conflict is strewn around . The return to normality comes as the United Nations prepares to discuss the future of the region, including plans to rebuild buildings and roads destroyed by artillery and air strikes. The supply of construction material - including concrete -  to the Gaza strip has been controversial as the Israelis have accused the Palestinian authority of allowing Hamas to use the supplies to construct cross-border tunnels and underground bunkers. However, the United States said it will open a new United Nations resolution on Gaza, but only if it will help build on the fragile Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire. Peace talks between both sides are expected to resume in Cairo, Egypt in the coming days. America's ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power said any resolution must 'do no harm' to the current cease-fire'. She said: 'Nothing underscores the urgency of securing ... a negotiated two-state solution like the crisis in Gaza and the heartbreak that so many people on both sides suffered throughout that crisis.' Ms Power said that the only way of securing the desired two-state solution was through negotiation. Absan, in southern Gaza, pictured, was heavily bombed during the conflict which lasted almost two months . As confidence in the ceasefire grows an increasing number of Palestinians are making their way home . Many Palestinians have returned only to discover that their homes have been badly bomb-damaged . She said: 'We don't think there are shortcuts or unilateral measures that can be taken at the United Nations or any place else that will bring about the outcome that the Palestinian people most seek,' she said. 'If you mean to secure a permanent peace, Israel has to be a part of that negotiation, just as a practical matter,' Power said. 'So to think that you can come to New York and secure what needs to be worked out on the ground is not realistic, and in fact, is likely to have very counterproductive effects.' A draft resolution circulated by the United States, Israel's closest ally, and obtained by The Associated Press calls for the re-establishment of full Palestinian Authority control over Gaza, which was ruled by Hamas militants who refuse to recognize the state of Israel. US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power said a two-state solution was only possible with negotiation . It includes a key Israeli demand, affirming that a lasting solution must ensure that Gaza is 'free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those under the full and legitimate control of the Palestinian Authority.' The Security Council is also considering 'elements' for a resolution proposed by European nations, and a Jordanian draft resolution backed by the Palestinians and their supporters which was written before the latest cease-fire . The European proposal goes further than the Americans, calling for the establishment of an international Monitoring and Verification Mission in Gaza to ensure that the cease-fire agreement is implemented and to investigate reported violations. The U.S. draft asks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to consult with both sides 'on options for the establishment of a mechanism' to assist in the transfer of construction materials to rebuild Gaza and 'to monitor and verify the end-use of dual-use material.' Hanan Ashrawi, a senior figure in the Palestine Liberation Organisation, told a news conference in New York that the Palestinians wanted an international commitment to the return to the pre-1967 borders and a complete Israeli withdrawal from the occupied territories within 'three years'.","Barber in southern Gaza reopens for business despite bomb damage .

"By . Richard Spillett for MailOnline . An airline passenger is lucky to be alive after he  suffered a mid-air heart attack during a long-haul flight and was saved by three fellow travellers. The man was midway through a flight from Canada to Hong Kong when he complained of chest pains and his heart suddenly stopped beating. Luckily, a doctor, a pharmacist and a policeman trained in first aid were all on board and, with the help of crew, kept him alive. A man suffered a heart attack while flying from Canada to Hong Kong last month, but his life was saved by a doctor, a pharmacist and a policeman who were on board . He has now made a full recovery in a case which is being used as an example of why portable defibrillators should be carried on all flights. The dramatic incident, which happened last month, came to light  after the doctor involved reported it to the British Medical Journal, which called the episode 'a remarkable story of survival against all the odds'. Dr Dave Monks, an anaesthesiologist who has worked at the Royal Free Hospital in London, said the man was taken ill  hundreds of miles from the nearest airport in some of the most remote airspace on earth. Dr Monks said the man  told him of striking pains moving from his chest to his head. The passenger then lost consciousness and had no pulse, causing Dr Monks to ask other passengers for help. Luckily, a pharmacist who had worked in an intensive care unit and a trained policeman came forward and, using a portable defibrillator, they gave the man an electric shock to get his heart pumping again. The doctor involved said the incident highlighted the importance of having defibrillators on flights and in training as many people as possible in how to use them . When the man's health again deteriorated, the brave trio kept him alive using adrenaline from the plane's medical kit. The pilot of the aircraft then landed in Beijing, China and the man was rushed to a nearby hospital. Remarkably, he was discharged 10 days later having made a complete recovery. Dr Monks told Live Science: 'This guy was extremely fortunate to have this team there. 'These guys just happened to be on the plane and even with the [basic medical skills] they had, they were able to perform a quite dramatic and sophisticated critical care resuscitation.' He said the episode shows the importance of keeping defibrillators on passenger planes and training people in first aid. He cited research that shows people are more likely to have heart attacks on flights due to stress, disturbed sleep patterns and lower levels of oxygen. One study suggests about 1,000 passengers per year experience sudden cardiac arrest while on flights.","Man on flight from Canada to Hong Kong complained of chest pains .

"The botched execution of an Oklahoma inmate that lasted almost 45 minutes was caused by the intravenous line in his groin that swelled to the size of golf ball, according to a state review released on Thursday. Agony: Clayton Lockett's execution was poorly managed according to an Oklahoma state official review . The line into Clayton Lockett was not properly monitored during his April 29 execution and caused him to writhe and groan in agony and led to Governor Mary Fallin halting all upcoming lethal injections in the state until the completion of the review. The review, released by the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety, cited the problems with Lockett's IV line and also recommended more training for prison officials and medical personnel involved in executions. Department of Corrections Director Robert Patton had previously said inmate Clayton Lockett died from a heart attack several minutes after he ordered the execution stopped. But the autopsy report performed for the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety said all three execution drugs were found throughout Lockett's system. A medical examiner declared that the cause of death was 'judicial execution by lethal injection.' The investigation concluded the viability of the IV access point was the single greatest factor that contributed to the difficulty in administering the execution drugs,' according to the DPS report. The agency's commissioner was appointed by Fallin. Oklahoma put executions on hold after Lockett gasped and writhed against his restraints for several minutes after his April execution began. Lockett was poked several times as medical technicians tried to find a vein before settling in using one at his groin. Gov. Mary Fallin had no immediate comment on the report, nor did a corrections department spokesman. Oklahoma used the sedative midazolam for the first time in Lockett's execution. That drug was also used in lengthy attempts to execute an Ohio inmate in January and an Arizona prisoner last month. Each time, witnesses said the inmates appeared to gasp after their executions began and continued to labor for air before being pronounced dead. Scroll down for video . The gurney in the execution chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary is pictured in McAlester, Oklahoma.  Oklahoma investigators are poised to release a report Thursday, September 4, 2014  into the flawed execution of Clayton Lockett . But Oklahoma's review didn't find fault with midazolam or other drugs, instead noting that the IV troubles made it difficult to determine the drugs' effectiveness. A paramedic and physician inserted the intravenous line in Lockett's groin after failing to find suitable veins in his arms, legs, neck and feet. The report says the IV site was covered with a sheet and not monitored until Lockett began moving unexpectedly after receiving two doses of drugs. 'The physician observed an area of swelling underneath the skin and described it as smaller than a tennis ball, but larger than a golf ball. The physician believed the swelling would have been noticeable if the access point had been viewed during the process,' the report said. State prisons director Robert Patton halted Lockett's execution, and Lockett died behind a shuttered curtain 43 minutes after his execution began. Patton said the cause was a heart attack, but autopsy results released last week said he died from the drugs: midazolam, vercuronium bromide and potassium chloride. The autopsy did not explain why the execution took so long or why Lockett writhed. Lockett's execution was to be the first of two executions held back-to-back on April 29, but the second execution was postponed that night. The DPS report recommended that the state hold executions at least seven days apart, noting that the prison warden believed that the planned double execution caused 'extra stress' for staff members. Lockett, 38, had been convicted of shooting Stephanie Nieman, 19, with a sawed-off shotgun and watching as two accomplices buried her alive in 1999. Three executions have been set in Oklahoma for November and December. One of the inmates is Charles Warner, who was supposed to die the same day as Lockett.","Clayton Lockett's disastrous execution blamed on poorly managed IV line .

"By . Sean Poulter . and Peter Campbell for the Daily Mail . Delays in restarting four key nuclear power stations after a safety shutdown could bring an electricity crisis this winter. The shutdowns have dangerously narrowed the gap between demand and the amount which National Grid can supply to homes and businesses. The squeeze is now likely to step up the regime where major energy users, such as factories, are paid millions to shut down in peak evening periods. Showdown: Fears over winter supplies were prompted by the temporary shutdown of four nuclear reactors at Heysham (pictured) and Hartlepool, which are owned by EDF Energy. A crack was found in a boiler . This strict measure is vital to protect homes and families by ensuring there is enough electricity on the grid to keep the lights and heating on. Separately, National Grid has asked power firms to boost supplies this winter to cover the threatened shortfall. The problems will be seen as further evidence that Britain’s dilapidated energy supply system cannot meet the nation’s needs. Critics will also point to the decision to spend billions on green energy. Fears over winter supplies were prompted by the temporary shutdown of four nuclear reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool owned by EDF Energy. A crack was found in a boiler at one of them in August and the closure was initially expected to be short term. But now the French power giant is warning there will be only be a ‘phased return’ between the end of October and the end of December. Analyst Peter Atherton, of Liberum Capital, said: ‘These are old reactors and when you go to solve one problem, you often find another you didn’t know about. ‘That could put them out of action for months. Losing these power stations also means we have lost the very small amount of fat in the system. Supply lines: There were also doubts after a fire at the Ferrybridge coal-fired power station in West Yorkshire . ‘If the weather’s unusually bad or there isn’t enough wind or something else goes wrong, then we will be cutting it to the bone.’ Regulator Ofgem and National Grid, which runs the power distribution network, will pay major energy users £75million in the next two years to turn off lights and machines on weekday winter afternoons. The cost will go on to the bills of homes and businesses. Jeremy Nicholson, director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, said this sort of drastic action might be expected in a Third World nation. ‘This can’t be a sustainable way of managing the energy system,’ he added. ‘Industry has to have access to secure power supplies.’ Dr Adam Marshall, of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ‘For too long, the UK has failed to plan adequately to guarantee the energy supplies required for our economy, businesses and consumers.’ On Tuesday, National Grid said it was tendering for extra electricity supplies for winter ‘owing to uncertainty over plant availability’. Ministers are relying on nuclear power to provide low carbon energy, alongside wind farms, as a replacement for coal-fired plants that are closing to meet EU targets on cutting greenhouse gases. On top of the loss of the four EDF plants, other supplies have been put in doubt by fires at power stations in Ferrybridge, West Yorkshire, and Ironbridge, Shropshire.","Four reactors at Heysham and Hartlepool owned by EDF were shut down .

Tina Cougill had carried her son Simon on her lap as she used the drive-through at the restaurant in Keighley, West Yorkshire, because she was too unwell to walk into the outlet. But she has been left 'disgusted' after staff banned her from using the take-away pick-up facility in the same way again - despite claiming she had done so on 'several occasions' in the past. Banned: Tina Cougill, pictured, has been barred from using her mobility scooter to carry her five-year-old son into a McDonald's drive-through . McDonald's have confirmed that mobility scooters designed for road use, like Mrs Cougill's, are allowed to use their drive-through lanes. The only reason a person would not be allowed is if they were carrying another passenger. But the 48-year-old mother, who lives in Keighley, has been left outraged. 'I am absolutely disgusted by this whole situation,' she said. 'I only went there because Simon wanted McDonald's and now we are unable to go. I now feel I am being discriminated against because I'm disabled.' Mrs Cougill, who only has one lung, confirmed that Simon, pictured, had been with her on the scooter while going through the drive-through in Keighley, West Yorkshire . Mrs Cougill, who only has one lung, confirmed that Simon had been with her on the scooter while going through the drive-through. She said: 'I used to park up and take Simon inside, because I am sometimes able to walk with a walking stick, depending on my health, but this particular restaurant is not accessible for my mobility scooter. 'I have also used the drive-through with Simon on several occasions without any member of staff saying a word. 'They have even joked with me about being the first to use the lane on a mobility scooter. 'There are no signs or anything to tell you this is an actually rule.' Mrs Cougill was told that carrying a passenger broke the restaurant's 'health and safety' guidelines but she is now challenging the fast food chain's stance on the matter. She added: 'My son is five-years-old and they are telling me that it is unsafe for him to sit on my knee in the drive-through. 'I am not going to just leave him at the front of the restaurant on his own or have him walk around the drive-through as there are cars around. 'These sorts of situations make it difficult for disabled people with children. We are not going to put our kids in danger by leaving them or having them walk in a lane designed for cars. 'It is far more dangerous than having him on my knee. 'If other drivers use the lane properly, which they have done in the past, me and Simon are safe on the mobility scooter.' A spokesman for McDonald's said safety was a 'top priority' for the company and that mobility scooters designed for road use are allowed to use the drive-through . A spokesperson for McDonald's said: 'Our Drive-thru lanes are suitable for safe use by cars, vans, motorbikes, mopeds, and mobility scooters designed for road use. 'On this occasion, while the mobility scooter in question was designed for road use, we understand that the driver of the mobility scooter also had a child on her lap. 'Safety is a top priority and for this reason the restaurant team advised that we would be unable to serve this customer again in the Drive-thru, if they were carrying an extra passenger.'","Tina Cougill took son, 5, into McDonald's drive-through on mobility scooter .

"By . Daniel Martin for the Daily Mail . Benefits for well-off pensioners should be axed to pay for radical reform of England’s broken care system, a major report concludes today. They should be stripped of free prescriptions, free TV licences and the winter fuel allowance to free up billions of pounds to fund long-term care for an ageing population. The report, commissioned by the King’s Fund think-tank, said tax rises to pay for the type of care that a ‘decent society’ should be providing must be targeted at the middle aged and middle class – even those who have saved all their lives to fund their retirement. Scroll down for video . Benefits for well-off pensioners should be axed to pay for radical reform of England's broken care system, a major report concludes today . Everyone over 40 and those on more than £42,000 should pay extra National Insurance – while pensioners who continue to work should be charged NI for the first time. The report also called for a ‘review of wealth taxation, including inheritance tax, which is too frequently avoided’. Written by a panel headed by eminent economist Dame Kate Barker, it concluded England’s current care system is in ‘crisis’ and is leading to ‘injustice, unfairness and sheer distress’ for millions. Some are being pushed into ‘bankruptcy’ by the catastrophic costs they are being forced to pay. Dame Kate warned that the ageing population means spending on social care as a proportion of GDP will almost double by 2025. ‘People say we cannot afford this,’ she said. ‘We have to afford this: we are not going to let people with dementia wander the streets. ‘If we are going to provide a decent society and decent care, we’re going to have to find the money.’ The think-tank last night called on the three main parties to be open and honest about the impact of this demographic time bomb – and to put forward detailed plans by the next election. At present, people face having to pay full care costs if they have assets of more than £23,500. This means that tens of thousands have to sell houses each year to pay for care. The Coalition is bringing in a new system imposing a cap of £72,000 on the amount people have to pay, with the state stepping in thereafter. Dame Kate said: ‘Under our proposals, some of the extra public funding will be raised from the better-off older population, so the costs will be shared more fairly between those who develop high social care needs and those fortunate to have few or none.’ She said those deemed by their council to have ‘critical’ needs should receive free social care. To raise the £5billion a year needed to cover the cost, she outlined a range of tax rises and spending cuts. She suggested that, alongside a cut in the cost of a prescription from £8.05 to £2.50, exemption from charges should be limited to the poor, meaning pensioners would lose the automatic right to free medicine. NI would go up by 1 per cent for everyone once they turn 40, while those earning £42,000 or more would face a similar hike. Working pensioners would also pay the tax; although at a reduced rate. Dame Kate also called for a ‘comprehensive review of wealth and property taxation’. Last night Ros Altmann, the government’s Business Champion for Older Workers, warned: ‘It would be dangerous in my view to extend the means-testing of pensioners because it penalises those who have saved.’ Professor Chris Ham, of The King’s Fund, said: ‘The proposals may not appeal to politicians … but these issues cannot simply be ignored.’ A government spokesman said there were no plans to change NI contributions or any entitlements to benefits.","Report said tax rises must be targeted at the middle aged and middle class .

"By . Matt Chorley, MailOnline Political Editor . The number of people in work in Britain has increased by more than the rest of the EU put together. Since 2010, an extra 1.6million people have found a job, while across the rest of Europe total employment has fallen by 1.08million. David Cameron revealed the extraordinary statistic during a meeting with Tory MPs as he set out how the economic revival will be central to his hopes of winning next year’s election. Between March 2010 and March 2014, the number of people in work in the UK has risen by 1.6million, but in the other 27 EU countries the figure has fallen by 1.07million, according to Eurostat figures . David Cameron, pictured at the Nato summit in Wales, has boasted that the figures show his economic plan is working. Today he held talks with (left to right) France's President Francois Hollande, Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko, US President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi . Growth in the UK jobs market has surged in the last year, in marked contrast with other EU countries. The economy is now bigger than before the 2008 financial crash, after securing growth of 3.2 per cent in the year to June. There are now more than 30million people in work, the highest since records began. Between March 2010 and March 2014, the number of people in work in the UK rose from 28.66million to 30.26million, a rise of 1.6million or six per cent, according to figures from Eurostat. Over the same four year period, the numbers in work in all 28 EU member states rose by 540,000 to 215billion, an increase of just 0.3 per cent. When Britain is excluded, employment in the remaining 27 countries fell by 1.067million or 0.6 per cent. Only Germany saw a bigger rise in the numbers in work, up by 1.996million. By contrast, there have been dramatic falls in employment in Spain (down 1.7million), Greece (942,000) and Italy (586,000) – countries hardest hit by the eurozone crisis. Employment Minister Esther McVey told MailOnline: 'The huge drop in unemployment is a sign of how the hard work of our Jobcentre Plus advisers who are supporting people off benefits and into a wide variety of jobs and careers is paying off. “British businesses are vibrant, confident and leading the way in taking a chance on jobseekers - we see this day in, day out with the local employers we work with. 'Through our welfare reforms, we’re providing more tailored support so that all of those who can work do, and they can get the opportunity to develop the skills and work experience they need to make the most of the 650,000 vacancies available in the economy at any one time.' Employment minister Esther McVey said the sharp fall in unemployment was a sign British businesses were 'taking a chance on jobseekers' Mr Cameron boasted of the trend as he addressed a meeting of Tory MPs on Tuesday evening. He delivered an upbeat message that the economy is booming but the job is not yet done, stressing that the Conservatives can win 'if we stick to our long term economic plan'. Yesterday it emerged Britain’s economy has grown more quickly than previously thought since the Coalition took power. In the four years since 2010 the economy has grown by 8.1 per cent – 1.1 per cent more than the original estimate, according to the Office for National Statistics. It means the economy is now 2.7 per cent bigger than it was before the economic crash in 2007. Overall, Britain has enjoyed the third best economic growth in the G7 since 2010 – more than France and Germany, but still behind the US and Canada. Speaking at Prime Minister Questions, Mr Cameron said: ‘ ‘There should not be any complacency, because the job is not yet done, but our long-term economic plan is working and it is the way to secure a better future for our country.’","Since 2010, an extra 1.6million people have found a job in the UK .

"By . Emma Glanfield for MailOnline . A jilted boyfriend who murdered his long-term partner by slitting her throat after she dumped him has been jailed for life. Clarke Dean, 47, stabbed Michelle Giles, 43, to death at their flat in Solihull, West Midlands, while their 16-year-old daughter was away on a camping trip. Just weeks before her murder, Ms Giles had told Dean - who drank up to 25 cans of lager a day – that she wanted to end their relationship of over 20 years because of his alcoholism. Unemployed Clarke Dean, 47, (right) stabbed his partner of 20 years Michelle Giles, 43, (left) to death at their flat in Solihull, West Midlands,  after she tried to end their relationship due to him drinking 20 cans of lager a day . However, Warwickshire Justice Centre heard how unemployed Dean refused to accept the relationship had ended and started to loiter at the Starbucks in Solihull town centre where she worked. Then, on August 8 last year, paramedics were called to reports of a stabbing at their home shortly after 2am. Neighbours described hearing 'spine chilling' screams from a woman which caused them to 'wake in terror'. When they went into the hallway they found Dean pleading for help telling them he'd 'stabbed her'. Despite the efforts of ambulance staff, nothing could be done to save Ms Giles and she was pronounced dead at the scene. The large blood stained knife which was used to kill her was found in the kitchen sink. A post mortem examination found that she died from multiple stab wounds and a cut throat. When interviewed, Dean refused to answer police questions but denied killing his partner when he was charged with her murder. Neighbours of Dean and Ms Giles, who lived together in Anchor Lane, Solihull, West Midlands (pictured), described hearing 'spine chilling' screams from a woman on the night of the murder in August last year . During his trial, the court heard how he said he could not remember killing Ms Giles, and admitted to regularly drinking more than 25 cans of lager a day. He was found guilty of her murder yesterday and jailed for life, meaning he will serve a minimum of 15 years before being eligible for parole. Detective Sergeant Michael Griffiths, of West Midlands Police, said: 'During the trial Dean accepted that he had killed Michelle, but could not recall doing it. 'He claimed that his judgement was impaired as he suffered from Alcohol Dependency Syndrome and asked the jury to accept a defence of diminished responsibility. 'However they rejected these claims and found him guilty of murder. Dean was jailed for life at Warwickshire Justice Centre (pictured) and will serve a minimum of 15 years . 'This tragic crime has robbed a woman of her life, a child of her mother and parents of a loving daughter. 'Dean claimed to love Michelle but had he truly felt for her he would not and could not have harmed her let alone kill her.' In a statement read to the court, Ms Giles' teenage daughter told of her loss and said: 'My wonderful mother was caring and loving, young and bubbly only to have her life cut short. 'For the rest of my life I am going to have to live in a world without my mum.'","Clarke Dean killed his partner  after she tried to end their 20-year relationship .

Having caught the airborne chicken, the great predator lands with a satisfied splash, . These stunning photographs were taken by Singapore photographer Manoj Kumar Tuteja, 26, at the Singapore Zoo during evening feeding time. The powerful beast pounces out of the water to catch an airborne chicken during feeding time at Singapore zoo . With two  tigers vying for food, the animal launches itself into the water to find the best position to find its meal . 'I had the privilege of standing at the right spot when it was time for feeding,' says Manoj. 'It's the strength of the white tiger which is attractive, and seeing just how high it can jump is spectacular. 'The way he opens his jaws so aggressively to catch the meat is amazing to watch.' With two adult tigers being fed at the same time, this hungry big cat made his way from land to the water to find the best position to catch his dinner. Standing only around 30 feet away from the animals, Manoj patiently watched the tigers for twenty minutes before feeding time began. The hungry tiger keeps a careful eye firmly on its meal - the animals are fed by keepers  every evening . The tiger opens his powerful jaws to catch the food before plunging back into the water with an almighty splash . The photographer was stunned at how high the great predators could leap to catch their dinner . Manoj says: 'All these shots have been taken instantly, as there is no scope for trial and error when it comes to feeding time in the tiger enclosure. 'The keepers throw the meat into the open enclosure and, since they are only fed once a day, this is your only chance to catch the action.' Singapore Zoo spans 69 acres and features 315 species of animal, including the white tiger. The tigers' eye-catching pale colouration is due to the lack of the red and yellow pigments that normally produce the orange colour . The photographer stood just 30 feet from the animals to catch the best of the action . The white tiger is a rare variant of the Bengal tiger and is found in grasslands and forests of South Asia and some parts of India. Its eye-catching pale colouration is due to the lack of the red and yellow pigments that normally produce the orange colour. However, they still produce the pigment, and so are not considered to be albino.

"By . Nelson Groom For Daily Mail Australia . Passengers on the budget airline Jetstar are trying to save more money by eluding extra baggage fees. This excess carry-on is causing many passengers to lose their allocated cabin space, as well as prolonging the boarding process. In order to address the mounting concern, Jetstar will implement ‘cabin baggage officers’ in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast on a trial basis. Nip in the bud: Jetstar will soon introduce 'cabin baggage officers' at airport gates in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns and the Gold Coast . Any passengers who attempt to sneak extra luggage on board will be placed in 'hold in line', where baggage officers will weigh their luggage . The officers will be located at airport gates, where they will weigh and measure customer’s bags as well as arranging to have luggage checked if it looks oversized or over the assigned weight. At present, passengers who have checked in online can avoid having their bags checked by Jetstar staff until reaching the gate lounge, which is allowing those with excess carry-on to board the flight without the extra-baggage charges, reports Business Traveller. Now, passengers who attempt this will have their bags placed in the aircraft hold in line, along with the checked baggage allowance that they have purchased. Those who purchased ‘carry only fares’ will be penalised by paying the prevailing airport rates, which are higher than what is charged online. Caught red handed: Passengers found sneaking on excess luggage will pay a higher rate than what they would have if they had declared the baggage . The excess baggage being snuck on-board is causing passengers to lose their cabin-space and prolonging boarding process .

"By . Andrew Levy For Daily Mail . A search for the remains of King Harold is due to be carried out at a church in Waltham Abbey in Essex . Tradition has it his body was cut to bits after he was killed by an arrow in the eye at the Battle of Hastings. But nearly 1,000 years on, a search is being carried out for the remains of King Harold at a church in Waltham Abbey, Essex. The project will be charted by Oval Films, which also helped to find Richard III’s remains in a car park in Leicester. It will follow amateur historian Peter Burke, who has written two historical novels on the times of Harold, and claims the king was wounded but survived. He believes he died 30 years later and was buried near the east wall of the former abbey that dates to the late 11th century. A stone monument to the king stands in the grounds, although not where the search is taking place. Mr Burke, a stonemason who has spent years researching his theory at the British Museum and British Library, is sponsoring a £2,000 search of the site using ground penetrating radar. A film crew are recording the work. He said: ‘I am convinced Harold survived the Battle of Hastings. ‘If we find the complete remains of an old man in his late 70s with scarring to his temple from a battle wound then we need to do a DNA test.’ David Hatton, of Oval Films, added: ‘We are very excited by the whole concept that there is another, even more plausible, story to the life and times of King Harold. ‘If we find what we are hoping then this could change history.’ Anglo-Saxon rule over England ended in 1066 when the Norman invaders arrived, led by William the Conqueror. But some believe Harold fled England or lived out his life as a hermit at Chester or Canterbury. There have also been a variety of claims about his resting place, including at Bosham Church in West Sussex. The search in Essex was due to begin on Tuesday but has been delayed for a fortnight while the team wait for a licence to be issued by English Heritage. Historians remains sceptical about the chances of finding Harold’s remains, however, with one describing them as ‘extremely minute’. Scroll down for video . The search at Waltham Abbey Church in Essex was due to begin on Tuesday but has been delayed a fortnight . Chris Sumner, chairman of Waltham Abbey Historical Society, said: ‘The site that they will searching for the remains has been disturbed so many times by building works that it will prove very unlikely that the remains will be located.’ The remains of Richard III were discovered under a car park in Leicester last year. Earlier this year archaeologists excavating from the grounds of Hyde Abbey in Winchester found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to Alfred the Great or his son, Edward the Elder.

"By . Dan Bloom . One of the most popular houses ever featured on Channel 4's Grand Designs is on sale for £5,000 less than it cost to build 10 years ago. Tony and Jo Moffat spent £380,000 on their loch-side home in the village of Kilcreggan, near Glasgow, overrunning their budget by £150,000. But despite a decade passing which included a property bubble, a crash and another boom, The Longhouse is now on sale for just £375,000 - despite its striking original design and uninterrupted views over the Firth of Clyde. Spectacular: Designed to look like a modern-day Nordic longhouse, this home in Kilcreggan, Argyll, has uninterrupted views of Loch Long and the Firth of Clyde. But its owners Tony and Jo Moffat, who featured on the Channel 4 show Grand Designs, overran their budget for building it by £150,000 and it is now on sale for less than it cost . Novel: The couple bought their plot of land on a steep slope for just £35,000, but the costs of their build soon spiralled beyond the original budget of £230,000 . Bedroom: Timber features heavily throughout the three-bedroom home, which housed the couple and their young daughter for almost a decade before they sold up . The couple's mission to build the house from scratch in 2003 featured in the fourth series of the Channel 4 property show. The classical musicians, who had a young daughter when they started their build, found their plot on a steep slope overlooking Loch Long and the Firth of Clyde for just £35,000. Using an oak frame, they imitated the look of a Nordic longhouse and set the home in several terrace 'steps' so it would look as though it was bursting out of the hill. But like many of the avant-garde designs on the show, the three-bedroom house soon ran into difficulties. Work took longer than expected and the costs spiralled out of control, having to slow down over the chilly northern winter of 2003. Mr Moffat told the programme at the time: 'You get bills through the post all the time and just sit there and go, ""I can't pay this"". 'At one point we did actually put it on the market just because things got so tough. It was a balance as to what would make us happier, not having the debt or having the house. But we hung in and tightened the belt and got through that patch.' His wife added: 'It's that rollercoaster feeling where you just want to get off.' A longhouse with a view: Despite its rural location, the house is an hour's commute from Glasgow on a route which involves taking the traditional Kilcreggan ferry . Idyll: The living room is under a vaulted ceiling with eight roof lights - but despite the avant-garde design, the home still costs less than a London flat . Property agent Andrew Perratt said: 'The market in Scotland is definitely in recovery mode now but it's far from overheating compared to other parts of the UK' Despite the setbacks, the couple completed their home and it attracted high praise from hard-to-please presenter Kevin McCloud, who listed it in his 20 favourite Grand Designs homes of all time. He described the longhouse as 'a beautiful, . romantic building, like a ship or an ark even, and it’s a well-crafted . piece of architecture'. An hour from Glasgow on a route which includes a traditional ferry, the family house has an L-shaped living room, breathtaking sea views, a vaulted ceiling with six roof lights, a study and a separate 'intimate' living area with a wood-burning stove. It first featured on the property show in March 2004 and the couple were revisited in 2007 - and suffered a fairly major setback when its roof blew off during severe gales which battered Scotland in December 2012. Now it has failed to attract a higher price than it cost to build. Property agent Andrew Perratt, of . Savills, told MailOnline he expected it to sell for around £375,000, which is the . 'offers over' price as is common in Scotland, or up to five per cent . more. However, the low cost . has tempted several buyers from England - as the spectacular home is . less pricy than an average flat in London, according to the house prices . website Zoopla. Lochs of love: Kevin McCloud described the longhouse as 'a beautiful, romantic building, like a ship or an ark even, and it's a well-crafted piece of architecture' Beloved: The property show fronted by Kevin McCloud (pictured), which has featured more than 100 homes, focused on the house in 2004 and again in 2007 . Tony Moffat (centre with Kevin McCloud and Jo) said at the time: 'You get bills through the post all the time and just sit there and go, ""I can't pay this""...At one point we did actually put it on the market just because things got so tough.

'We've had a lot . of interest and most of it has been from south of the border.' He added: 'The price we're asking was set at the market rate, so it didn't take into account the cost to build.' Other houses from the Channel 4 show have had a mixed fate, with some soaring in value while other fall victim to the so-called 'curse of Grand Designs'. A . four-bedroom house in Bristol dubbed the 'Modernist Sugar Cube' featured on the show in 2008 and cost £775,000, but has since sold for . £1.5million. And a two-bed 'low-carbon' home in Clapham Park, south London, featured in 2012 and . was put on the market the next year at almost £1million more than it cost to . build. But not all have been so lucky. Last summer it was reported a nine-storey water tower in Kennington, south London, had £2million knocked off its asking price after initially being offered for £6.5million.

"By . John Stevens for the Daily Mail . Charities should stay away from politics and ‘stick to their knitting’, a Tory minister has claimed. Brooks Newmark, the minister for civil society, criticised charities that ‘stray’ from their remit of ‘helping others’. In his first major speech since his appointment this summer, Mr Newmark said: ‘We really want to try and keep charities and voluntary groups out of the realms of politics. ‘Some 99.9 per cent do exactly that. When they stray into the realm of politics that is not what they are about and that is not why people give them money. Stitch-up: Mr Newmark wants charities to concentrate on knitting instead of 'party political' campaigning . The important thing charities should be doing is sticking to their knitting and doing the best they can to promote their agenda, which should be about helping others.’ The comments come after several Tory backbenchers attacked Oxfam earlier this year for opposing benefit cuts and zero-hour contracts, claiming that the organisation’s campaign was too political. Yesterday Lisa Nandy, Labour’s spokesman for civil society, attacked Mr Newmark’s comments. She also warned that the new Lobbying Act could limit the ability of charities to campaign on the issues of the day. 'It’s his first speech as charities minister, and I think it’s not just patronising but actually deeply offensive – at a time when charities are picking up the pieces from this government’s awful, unfair policies – that their ministers would talk about them in such a dismissive way,’ she said. Concern: Brooks Newmark insisted he did not want to prevent charities from campaigning generally . ‘This comes from a government that hasn’t just introduced the Lobbying Act but has also restricted charities using judicial review, cut legal aid, ramped up employment tribunal fees and clamped down on immigration appeals. ‘What you’re looking at is a government that doesn’t like challenge. That is quite a frightening place for a government to have got itself into.’ Last night Mr Newmark said his comments at a charity conference were intended as a reference to ‘party politics’, adding he did not want to prevent charities from campaigning in general. He said: ‘Charities, with all their expertise, have an important role to play in helping to shape government policy. While they have the right to campaign they should stay out of the realm of party politics.’ Conservatives have claimed Labour supporters are using charities to run campaigns criticising the Government to help Ed Miliband win the next general election. Nearly half of Gordon Brown’s Downing Street aides are now working for charities and think-tanks – positions from which they have been accused of mounting a guerrilla war on the Tories. Eleven out of the 25 special advisers who worked for Mr Brown when he was prime minister in 2009 have taken roles at various organisations, which critics claim are being used as vehicles for a pro-Labour agenda. Charities are banned by law from giving support or funding to political parties, but in 2008 Mr Brown tweaked the rules so they could join political campaigns. The list of Mr Brown’s former colleagues now working in the charity sector includes Justin Forsyth, the chief executive of Save the Children UK. The charity was heavily criticised two years ago after it launched an appeal to help children in Britain for the first time in its history. Tory MPs claimed it was a political move against the Coalition government.","Minister for civil society Brooks Newmark's claim came at charity conference .

"By . Associated Press . Secretary of State John Kerry was joined by five of his predecessors Wednesday at the groundbreaking of the U.S. Diplomacy Center in Washington, DC. Speaking at the groundbreaking of the new museum celebrating the achievements of American diplomacy, Kerry gave a speech, warning against creeping American isolationism, making the case that U.S. global leadership is needed more than ever. Kerry was joined at the State Department ceremony by his predecessors Henry Kissinger, James A. Baker III, Madeleine Albright, Colin Powell and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

Good job: In his speech, Kerry praised the various work his predecessors did in representing American interests around the world during their time as secretary of state . 'American leadership and engagement should not be up for debate in the first place,' Kerry said, listing Iraq, Syria, Ukraine, Gaza, South Sudan, Libya and North Korea as among the trouble spots that Washington must address. 'I'm not saying that we can or should do any of it alone; that's not the proposition, but the world — and I think most people here understand — will not do it without us.' 'I can tell you for certain, most of the world does not lie awake at night worrying about America's presence,' he said. 'They tell me that they worry about what would happen in our absence... We have to remember, engagement and leadership, not retrenchment and isolationism, are the American DNA.' Kerry hailed each of the previous secretaries who attended the event.

He praised Clinton for breathing new life into old partnerships and giving meaning to 'personal diplomacy' and Powell for uniting the world against al-Qaeda after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Albright 'epitomizes moral leadership and continues to inspire American diplomats wherever they serve' for her work in ending the conflicts in Kosovo and Bosnia, Kerry said. Baker, he said, created 'the gold standard by which modern coalition-building is judged' in the run-up to the 1991 Gulf War. Kerry said he would use it as a guide as he embarks on a mission to forge a united front against Islamic militants operating in Iraq and Syria. This way!

"By . Tara Brady . A couple has moved into Britain’s cheapest home which set them back just £1 but could now fetch up to £70,000. Lawrence Poxton, 48, and his wife Teresa, 46, moved into the terraced property in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after the council put 33 properties on the market for a pound in a desperate attempt to clean up the area. The bus driver and his wife were picked from thousands of applicants to be the first couple to move into the homes - which they now estimate could be sold for up to £70,000. Quids in! Lawrence Poxton, 48, and his wife Teresa, 46 outside their house which they bought for a pound . The couple first applied to get the keys to one of only 33 houses available for £1 in March 2013. After being selected from thousands of applicants, the lucky couple blindly picked their new home out of a model in November. While other houses in the street are still boarded up, the pair have transformed their two-bed mid terrace into a modern home - with a spacious bathroom, roomy kitchen and plush carpets - as well as a feature staircase. As the final licks of paint dry the ecstatic pair can finally move in to the first home they actually own. Mr Poxton said: 'It’s like a dream come true for us.

Every lucky person to grab keys to a house was given a £30,000 low interest loan to completely renovate the derelict dumps. Lawrence and Teresa, who have been together for ten years and married for five, were given the choice of doors, flooring and cupboards as the face-lift was completed. Only a small handful of houses in the town have been renovated as part of this scheme so far. On Denbigh Street only eight out of 90 houses have been renovated . New beginnings: The couple first applied to get the keys to one of only 33 houses available for £1 in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffs, in March 2013 . On the up: A lot of the houses around Denbigh Street are owned by private landlords and haven't been looked after by the tenants who live in them . Mr Poxton said: 'When we picked it, the house was just a shell. 'We’ve had a new roof, windows and doors put in and they’ve re-wired all the electrics and put in new central heating and insulation. 'It’s like a completely different building to the one we picked nine months ago - it’s fantastic.' Previously the pair rented a similar house in the town centre, but even though they have to pay back the council loan in the next ten years, they are saving money. The 48-year-old said: 'Typically we were paying £425 per month in rent with bills on top. Home sweet home: Lawrence Poxton, 48, and his wife Teresa, 46, sit on a bed in their new home in Stoke which they designed themselves . Lawrence and Teresa were given the choice of doors, flooring and cupboards as the face-lift was completed . Through the keyhole: Previously the pair rented a similar house in the town centre, but even though they have to pay back the council loan in the next ten years, they are saving money . Stoke-on-Trent City Council has spent £3million renovating properties across the town including this house which belongs to Lawrence and Teresa Poxton . 'Here, we are paying almost half of that in paying back the loan and we have got a house that we own, instead of just throwing money at someone else. 'In our last place we had a window smashed in in January and it wasn’t fixed until March - we were freezing. 'It just feels amazing being able to make this house our own home - we can’t wait to spend the rest of our lives here.' Only a small handful of houses in the town have been renovated as part of this scheme so far. Inside the kitchen: This property was sold to Lawrence and Teresa Poxton for just a £1 thanks to a scheme by Stoke-on-Trent City Council . Lawrence Poxton, 48, and his wife Teresa, 46, have moved into the terraced property in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after the council put 33 properties on the market . Despite the couple paying just £1 for the two bedroom terraced house the property could now be sold for up to £70,000 . After being selected from thousands of applicants, the lucky couple blindly picked their new terrace house out of a model in November . On Denbigh Street - the road the Poxtons live on - only eight out of 90 houses have been made up, and Mr Poxton admits they 'stick out like a sore thumb' in between all the other dilapidated buildings. As a result, security guards patrol the road 24 hours a day to ensure none of the houses are vandalised or any copper is stolen. A lot of the houses around Denbigh Street are owned by private landlords and haven’t been looked after by the tenants who live in them. As part of the council’s scheme though, landlords are being offered the same £30,000 loan to modernise their houses. Mr Poxton said: 'We’re not worried about being a target here. 'We knew that when we moved in that it would take a while for everything to improve. 'It was never going to happen overnight, but we’re confident that the council know what they’re doing and this will be a really nice place to spend the rest of our lives. 'We’ve bought Britain’s cheapest house - what more can we ask for?'","Lawrence Poxton, 48, and his wife Teresa, 46, have moved into the terrace property in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire .

"By . Joel Christie for MailOnline . Officials at a Reno museum say a minor explosion at the facility Wednesday afternoon was caused by a live 'tornado storm' experiment that malfunctioned, burning over a dozen people with chemicals and starting a fire. At least 13 people- seven of them children - were affected by the demonstration mishap at the Terry Lee Wells Nevada Discovery Museum about 4.10pm. Terrifying video purportedly showing the moment the chemicals - methyl alcohol and boric acid - ignited has since emerged, with numerous children sitting in front of the experiment fleeing in fear, according to KRNV News 4. Nine of those affected were taken to hospital while the four others were treated at the scene. Scroll down for video . Terrifying: This video - obtained by KRNV News 4 - purportedly shows the moment the experiment went awry, causing what fire officials described as a 'chemical flash' The video appears the show part of the apparatus used in the experiment fall to the floor, where numerous children are sitting . Horrific: The footage shows children fleeing in fear from the flaming apparatus on the floor in front of them . The explosion is believed to have been caused by the incorrectly mixed chemicals. The live exhibition was supposed to produce a whirling tornado effect, according to NBC. However it instead caused what authorities described as a 'chemical flash'. The video shows one lone female instructor conducting the experiment. The footage was uploaded to Facebook by KRNV News 4 after a woman named Diane Thomas - who said she was in the room at the museum at the time - sent it into the station. Police have not said what degree of burns were suffered by those injured. Reno Police officer Tim Broadway said the burns seemed to be isolated to the arms, hands and faces of the victims. The museum was evacuated and Hazmat officers arrived at the scene to ensure the chemicals had not contaminated the air. A statement released by the museum Wednesday night did not elaborate on what caused the explosion. 'The Discovery would like to thank our staff for their quick response during today's incident at the museum,' the statement said, according to ABC News. 'Their actions allowed first responders to attend to museum visitors in a timely manner.

"By . Becky Barrow . It can take up to three months longer to sell your home in some parts of Britain than others, with certain areas taking ‘more than a year’ to find a buyer, a report has revealed. The research, by the property website Rightmove, highlights the enormous regional variations in the country’s housing market which leave many homeowners frozen out of the boom. The winner – for once – is not London, but Cambridge. Property disparity: The research, by the property website Rightmove, highlights the enormous regional variations in the country's housing market . Properties sell quicker in the famous university town than they do anywhere else in the country, typically taking just 27 days to find a buyer - compared to a national average of 65 days. And the speed at which homes in Cambridge are snapped up has increased significantly over the last year. It typically took 39 days last year, a fall of 30 per cent. By comparison, the loser is Powys in Wales where it typically takes 113 days to find a buyer, or more than four times longer than it takes in Cambridge. In fact, Wales and the North West dominate Rightmove’s list of the most difficult places to sell a home. Properties sell quicker in Cambridge than they do anywhere else in the country, typically taking just 27 days to find a buyer . Of the bottom ten, three are in Wales – Powys, Gwynedd and Conwy – and four are in the North West – Sefton, Fylde, Rochdale and Allerdale, a district of Cumbria around Workington. Andrew Bradshaw, from the estate agency Bradshaws Residential in Cambridge, said: ‘We have one interested buyer looking to move from Wales to Cambridge. ‘But they’ve had their property on the market in Wales for over a year with no sign of selling it.’ He added: ‘In the current market, we are finding a number of buyers for many properties within two weeks or even a week in some cases.’ Many clients are selling their home elsewhere and have to rent in Cambridge until a property finally becomes available to buy in the sought-after city. Of the 50 or so homes in Cambridge sold by Savills, the upmarket estate agency, last year, just three were sold for less than the guide price. In Powys, Wales, it typically takes 113 days to find a buyer . The average price that they were sold for was £850,000, according to Ed Meyer, head of residential sales at Savills in Cambridge. On average, they went for between five and ten per cent above the guide price, but the winner was sold for an extra 23 per cent. In Wales, the experience is fundamentally different for many homeowners who need to sell. Melfyn Williams, from Williams & Goodwin The Property People [corr], an estate agency in Gwynedd, said: ‘The ripple effect from London and talk of a widespread ‘over-heated’ market has not reached Gwynedd. ‘The average time is three to four months to secure a sale. There are many properties that have now been for sale for over 12 months.’ Miles Shipside, director of Rightmove and a housing market analyst, said the research shows ‘just how different the pace of the housing market is at a very local level.’ The report comes as the Office for National Statistics said the average price of a home in London has jumped to nearly £500,000. In just 12 months, a typical home in the capital has jumped by 20.1 per cent, the sharpest rise in a single year since the ONS’s comparable records began in 2002. Overall, the ONS said the average price of a home in the UK is £262,000, a rise of 10.5 per cent over the last year, the biggest annual rise for four years. Rightmove’s research was based on what had happened to 150,000 properties advertised for sale between April and June this year on its website, compared to 125,000 during the same period last year. The property was deemed to have been ‘sold’ if the buyer and seller had agreed a deal, known as being ‘sold subject to contract’. They had not exchanged or completed.","Research highlights massive regional gaps in housing market .

The match itself saw Manchester United new boy Angel di Maria inspire Argentina to a victory over their World Cup final conquerors. Only four members of the Germany team which started the biggest match in world football on July 13 were selected, and the transformation from the Rio de Janeiro showpiece was dramatic. Di Maria set up the first three goals for Sergio Aguero, Erik Lamela and Federico Fernandez before adding the fourth in a game filled with chances at both ends. Argentina led 4-0 early in the second half but Andre Schurrle pulled a goal back for Germany before Fernandez turned a Mario Gotze effort into his own goal, on a night when only players from the English Premier League found the back of the net.

Wealthy financial executives are using an 'elite' Gumtree service to buy and sell luxury items, including Rolex watches, private jets and even a £10million oceanfront mansion in Miami. The £11,500-per-year computer network, run by financial information company Bloomberg, is so exclusive that it can only be accessed using a fingerprint scan.

The listings - which are featured under sections called travel, cars, property, boats, services and merchandise - include items for sale such as Porsches, Ferraris and designer watches, from the likes of Patek Philippe, Rolex and Breitling. The platform operates in the same manner as the more well-known Gumtree, allowing users to upload listings of their items for sale with a price tag and enabling buyers to scroll through and filter results. However, the items listed are of much more exclusivity than the average Gumtree adverts, with items up for sale also including diamond rings, sports cars and even multi-million pound homes.

While claiming to be just 'six minutes from the town, close to the beach and near the best night life in the Hamptons', the property is available to rent for either £10,000-per-week or £5,000-per-weekend. Those with a bit more cash to splash can rent the mansion for the whole of July for £35,000 or for August at a cost of £40,000.

"By . Julian Robinson for MailOnline . A mother-of-one died after enduring six years of cosmetic surgery to correct facial disfigurement she suffered following a savage beating. Nicola Davenport, 44, had been punched, kicked, battered with metal sticks and had a plate broken over her head after being caught up in a row at a house party in 2007. She died a day after being found collapsed at her home in Bolton, Greater Manchester on New Year's Eve last year having suffered a suspected blood clot to the brain. Nicola Davenport, pictured, died after enduring six years of cosmetic surgery to correct facial disfigurement she suffered following a savage beating . Due to the injuries she sustained during the attack, Miss Davenport contracted a flesh eating bug which destroyed the skin around her scalp and round her eyes. It left her scarred for life and she had to wear sunglasses to hide her painful scars. Over the years Miss Davenport underwent several skin grafts including many to her eyelids but was still having problems with her scalp and she told her family she 'did not want to go on.' On New Years Eve  she was discovered collapsed at her home by a friend and rushed to hospital in a 'profoundly comatose state' and died the following day. Police who investigated the beating discovered Miss Davenport's attackers were friends of convicted terrorist leader Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair who fled to the British mainland after being expelled by the Ulster Defence Association in his native Belfast. Miss Davenport subsequently testified in court over the attack and another woman later went to jail for six months after being convicted of assault. Charges were dropped against two other people. Today, following an inquest, the dead woman's family blamed Miss Davenport's death on the savage beating she received at one of Adair's hideouts in Troon, Scotland. Her sister Jay, 33, said: 'She lost her self confidence because of the attack and quite literally never recovered from it. The bug she contracted as a result made it all the much worse. 'She had to have all the skin removed from her face, her nose all the way around to the back of her head and you could nearly see through to the temples. Nicola Davenport, pictured with her son Nathan, was found collapsed at her home in Bolton, Greater Manchester by a friend and rushed to hospital in a 'profoundly comatose state' 'She was always in and out of hospital, she said she had had enough and didn't want to go on. It has just been horrendous.' Her father James, 69, said: 'What happened to Nicola was sickening and she was always blown away by the fact one of her attackers only got six months. 'It seems her attackers were drugged up and battered her with a steel bar. They then kept her in a bedroom until she was brought back to England. One of these yobs even urinated on her. This attack was so life-changing it must have some connection with her death. 'My daughter was a beautiful clever girl but her condition stopped her from doing things. The operations got too much for her and in some ways it was like she had given up. I don't think she could take it any more even though she was a really strong girl.' The beating occurred after Miss Davenport travelled to Ayrshire to attend a party with one of Adair's closest friends. At the party, a bust up occurred between Miss Davenport and the friend and later she was set upon by another guest, Jacqueline Irvine, then 44. Adair himself, who now lives in Scotland, attended the court case to watch Miss Davenport tell how she was punched and kicked by three people until she lost consciousness. The family of Miss Davenport, pictured left and right with her son Nathan, blamed her death on the savage beating she received in 2007 . She was brought back to England but she developed an infection of the scalp and after being admitted to Royal Bolton Hospital she was diagnosed as having the flesh eating bug necrotising fascitis. Her GP Dr Peter Saul told the inquest: 'It causes the bacteria to destroy the skin and in her case the whole of her scalp, the skin was destroyed and to some extent the skin on her upper eye lids.' He said Miss Davenport suffered life changing facial injuries and would wear sunglasses to disguise her painful scars. Over the years she was to undergo a series of operations and had several skin grafts including many her eyelids and was still having problems with her scalp. Dr Saul said that the procedures had been 'very painful.' The inquest heard that for her daily pain she was prescribed strong painkillers, anti-depressants and was also prescribed Warfarin after developing a Deep Vein Thrombosis, reducing her blood's ability to clot. Shortly before her death she was said to have complained of headaches, hallucinations and confusion. Police who investigated the beating discovered Miss Davenport's attackers were friends of convicted terrorist leader Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair, pictured in Bolton in 2005, who fled to the British mainland after being expelled by the Ulster Defence Association in his native Belfast . When Miss Davenport was later found dying at home, it was first believed that she had been the victim of a serious assault and an investigation was carried out - but any third party involvement was ruled out. Pathologist Dr Philip Lumb said that her injuries had 'mimicked' a physical trauma but had in fact been as a result of a naturally occurring source like an aneurysm or infection. He said her death was caused by intercranal haemorrhage and Warfarin treatment for Deep Vein Thrombosis. He said: 'Death was caused by bleeding to the brain. I have carefully considered the bleeding to the injuries in 2007 and couldn't find a link between these two events. 'This is a naturally occurring bleed although I can't be sure what the original source was. The blood was not clotting as it ought to be.' Assistant coroner Simon Jones returned a conclusion of natural causes. He added: 'The police were originally concerned when admitted that injuries may have been caused by some form of criminal activity. 'Her death may have been in some way related to the clearly horrific injuries sustained in 2007 that required her to have very painful operations over many years. 'The conclusion of Dr Lumb is that neither of these are correct although very badly injured in 2007, that incident has not caused her death nor has she been the subject of any trauma or assault. 'It was a death at a very young age, a bleed on the brain, that has occurred spontaneously. 'Warfarin therapy was a contributory factor, when the blood starts it is difficult to stop. She died from natural causes although her death was contributed to by appropriate Warfarin therapy which was required to treat her DVT.'","Nicola Davenport went through years of surgery after savage beating .

Magnotta was flown to Montreal's Mirabel Airport on Monday, where he arrived under a heavy security presence. A convoy of police vehicles with flashing lights rolled out to meet Magnotta as half a dozen men escorted him down the stairs of the plane and into a minivan. Armed guards stood by, while handcuffed Magnotta, who has also had his hair cut short, said nothing. Canadian Public Safety Minister Vic Toews noted that Magnotta himself sped up the process by declining to contest his extradition. Martin Steltner, a spokesman for Berlin prosecutors, said Germany's federal government gave formal approval for the extradition a few days ago.

"By . Simon Walters . Updated: . 06:51 EST, 11 December 2011 . Standing firm: Prime Minister David Cameron walks purposefully to a news conference following his decision to veto the amendments . David Cameron has received overwhelming support from British voters over his historic decision to veto changes to the EU Treaty. The first poll conducted since the acrimonious Brussels summit shows that a total of  62 per cent of people agreed with the Prime Minister’s defiant stance, with just 19 per cent against. Furthermore, most people believe the euro is doomed to fail and almost half think the EU will break up. They also fear the summit has given too much power to Germany. If there was a referendum today on whether the UK should quit the EU, is would be likely to produce a resounding Yes. Nearly 50 per cent say we should go our own way, with 33 per cent in favour of staying in. These figures come as: . Amid the frenetic recriminations following the summit, the poll shows Mr Cameron’s dramatic move to set Britain on a separate course from the other 26 nations in the EU is wholeheartedly endorsed by voters. The summit triumph has also wiped out Labour’s lead in the opinion polls. Both . Labour and the Conservatives are now on 35 per cent, with the Lib Dems . on 14. According to the exclusive poll for The Mail on Sunday, nearly . two-thirds of voters believe the new EU initiative, designed to save the . euro by imposing tough economic controls on bankrupt European countries, is probably a waste of time. A total of 65 per cent say the euro . currency is doomed, with fewer than one in five convinced it will . survive. And there is a clear consensus that the rot is likely to spread . to the EU institution itself. Almost half of voters say it will . shatter, with just 29 per cent confident it will stay intact. The survey also suggests that Mr . Cameron’s bold stance – hailed as a great triumph by Tory MPs – has . served to whet the appetite of voters who want him to go further. Two in three want a referendum on Britain’s future in Europe with just 22 per cent against. Calls for Mr Cameron to press home his advantage and demand that Brussels hands back more powers to London produce an almost identical level of support. The public are in no doubt that . despite all the grandstanding by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Mr . Cameron came off best in Brussels. When asked if the Prime Minister had . done well from the negotiations, more than half agreed. In comparison, . German Chancellor Angela Merkel scored 44 per cent with Mr Sarkozy . languishing in third place on 35. Interestingly, as Britain steps back . from Europe, there is growing nervousness at the advance of German . influence in the new-look EU. Seven out of ten say the summit has given . too much power to Germany – with a mere 13 per cent disagreeing. Nor is the jittery feeling restricted . to Britain. Warning of a backlash, an article in leading German . newspaper Der Spiegel said: ‘We are going to have to put up with a bit . of Germanophobia.’ Charles Grant, director of the London . based Centre for European Reform think tank, said: ‘For the first time . in the history of the EU, the Germans are now in charge.’ Survation interviewed 1,020 people online on Friday evening and Saturday. By SIMON WALTERS . David Cameron and Nicolas Sarkozy slugged it out in a bitter war of words as the Prime Minister made it clear he was determined to veto changes in the EU treaty. As Mr Cameron stood his ground in a confrontation with the French President and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, angry Mr Sarkozy said: ‘These are unacceptable conditions. We cannot grant you that.’ Mr Cameron protested: ‘But I couldn’t get it through my Parliament even if I signed the treaty.’ With Mrs Merkel nodding in agreement behind him, Mr Sarkozy told the Prime  Minister he had no right to try to block the new treaty, designed to deal with the euro currency crisis, because Britain had kept the pound. Tension: David Cameron keeps an eye on Nicolas Sarkozy as EU leaders in Brussels pose for the cameras after the talks . ‘It has nothing to do with you – you aren’t even in the eurozone,’ said Mr Sarkozy. Mr Cameron replied: ‘I am sticking to  my guns.’ The clash came at a tense meeting between the three most powerful EU leaders at 7pm on Thursday. When Mr Cameron came out of the meeting, he told aides he knew he had an uphill struggle to win concessions to protect the City of London. But he remained confident that he would be able to win round the rest of the EU leaders when they met for dinner, and later when the talks went into the early hours. ‘Frankly, we were all surprised at how intransigent the French and the Germans were,’ said one source. ‘We had genuinely believed that we would win the concessions for the City of London that we needed. ‘When the last round of talks started, the PM said, “Don’t worry, we can still turn it round.” But Sarkozy was set against it from the start.’ Mr Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel hurled the same allegation at Mr Cameron. Mr Sarkozy reportedly observed: ‘The problem with Britain is that it always wants one foot in, one foot out.’ Mrs Merkel said: ‘I don’t believe David Cameron was ever with us at the table.’ Mr Cameron had to wait until 2.30am on Friday to make his final pitch to the other  26 EU leaders. He told them: ‘We are being incredibly reasonable. Intransigent: Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel (right) and France's President Nicolas Sarkozy (left) were determined to reject Mr Cameron's request . ‘We have not brought a list of ten “asks” on the working time directive and other matters. All we want is protection for the City.’ But his words fell on deaf ears. For the final tense session, all officials were ordered to leave the room. However, the leaders were allowed to seek advice from aides in the corridors via email on secure BlackBerry smartphones. Mr Cameron sent a series of BlackBerry messages to his chief of staff, Ed Llewellyn, and his chief Downing Street adviser on Europe, Sir Jon Cunliffe, when complex EU legal issues were raised. One said that things were looking ‘tough’. By the time the talks ended at 3.30am, it was clear that Mr Cameron had no choice but to do what  he had desperately hoped to avoid: to use Britain’s EU veto for the first time in history. As he emerged, he told his staff: ‘We cannot sign up to this. They just won’t give in. We always knew it might come to this. So be it.’ With that, the Prime Minister  confirmed to other leaders that he would veto the treaty. He gave a press conference and headed to the British Embassy, where he slept  for little more than an hour before rising at 8.15am on Friday. After his 90-minute sleep, he amazed onlookers by appearing remarkably alert, healthy and good humoured when he returned to the European Council building to pose in the ‘family photo’ of EU leaders. Cold shoulder: German Chancellor Angela Merkel studiously . ignores the Prime Minister as leaders get ready for their group picture . He breezily laughed off questions about the remark – attributed to an anonymous French diplomat in President Sarkozy’s delegation – that he had behaved ‘like a man at a wife-swapping party who refuses to bring his own wife’. He said: ‘I have not, and have no plans to, attend any wife-swapping parties.’ The level of tension between the three European leaders was later revealingly demonstrated by a Downing Street aide who cited – as evidence that discussions had remained civil – that the Prime  Minister had been able to ‘share a lift’ with the German Chancellor after the talks. Another aide joked that during the ‘interminable’ dinner the French and German leaders had been forced to eat ‘hard cheese’. A British diplomat said: ‘It was not about Cameron showing he had cojones. He never ever wanted to use the veto: he genuinely believed they would see sense. But he had always made it clear that he would use it if he had to. ‘It wasn’t about doing a Maggie Thatcher and wielding the handbag. It was not about caving in to some  of the fringe elements on the Tory Eurosceptic Right. He did it because it was right. He doesn’t make idle threats.’ Before Mr Cameron left Brussels, he found time to reflect further on the strain of the epoch-making events of his longest night since winning power in 2010. ‘It was huge pressure in there. Everyone in that room was against me. I had to stand firm,’ he said. While Mr Cameron received rave reviews from Tory MPs, Mr Sarkozy’s supporters in France went on the attack. Le Parisien newspaper, which has close links to Mr Sarkozy, said the ‘British position did not surprise many people’, least of all the French President. ‘The script was almost written in advance. Cameron had not even written a speech to defend his point of view. Privately, Nicolas Sarkozy considers unthinkable the possibility of letting the UK prosper without any rule or control.’ Mr Cameron arrived back in the UK at 4pm on Friday – exactly  24 hours after he had left. On Thursday, before heading for Brussels, Mr Cameron and his wife Samantha watched their son Elwen perform as a mouse in the nativity play at his Kensington primary school, and went for coffee at a French cafe nearby. Samantha then waved her husband goodbye with a simple: ‘Good luck, darling’.","Decisive action boosts Coalition support, wipes out Labour's lead .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . It's barely 150 years since New York was a bustling city of immigrants from across the world. But it seems that the skyline that once greeted visitors is virtually unrecognisable from the same scene in 1876. All that remains is the iconic Brooklyn Bridge which was just being built to connect two districts of the Big Apple. The changes are shown in a startling composite picture of the skyline over the decades, starting with 1876, going into 1932 and 1988 and finishing in 2013. The New York skyline before Brooklyn Bridge was completed and the other side of Manhattan Island can be seen in the distance (picture from UrbanPeek.com) In 56 years high-rise buildings have already made a significant change on the skyline and the opposite side of Manhattan Island can no longer be seen (picture from UrbanPeek.com) The first grainy black and white image, published online by Urban Peek, shows the bustling city with ships lining the dock yards in Downtown Manhattan. Construction of Brooklyn Bridge - then the world's biggest suspension bridge - had only just begun and only the towers on the Manhattan side of New York were in place. The tallest building in the city appears to be a church spire close to Tribeca. But with the industrial revolution bringing great wealth to the city it was soon to be transformed. Over the next 60 years dozens of imposing building shot up across New York - including the Empire State Building which was the tallest in the world when it was built on Fifth Avenue in 1931. Just behind the Empire State Building is The Chrysler Building, which was built on the East Side of Manhattan in 1930. By now the Brooklyn Bridge had been completed and a second crossing, the Manhattan Bridge, had been finished a short distance away. Despite the Great Depression ravaging many of the city's residents throughout the 1930s, New York soon recovered. The scene in the next image taken in 1988 shows how the city had been transformed from a hub of industry to the financial capital of the U.S. The boom of the 80s shows a New York skyline that is much more recognisable to today's residents and visitors (picture from UrbanPeek.com) The future: From next year this is how we can expect to see the New York skyline with the Freedom Tower in place of the Twin Towers (picture from UrbanPeek.com) Gone are the ship yards once full of dockers and trawlers and in their place are are clean-cut avenues lined with restaurants and cafes. More skyscrapers have been built, and the buildings in the financial district and down to Battery Park now tower along the bay like fortresses. Most noticeable though are the twin towers of the World Trade Centre now dwarfing the other buildings in the city. A brief look at the latest picture from 2013 shows a gap where they once stood. In its place is Freedom Tower, commemorating the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Despite a quarter of a century passing between 1988 and 2013, the structural changes to the city's skylines are not as dramatic as in earlier years. A handful of new towers have been built and more buildings have appeared to in the right hand corner of the latest image, stretching further north in Manhattan.","Dockyards from the early 1900s are gone as financial district gives rise to skyscrapers .

"By . Nick Enoch . Updated: . 14:15 EST, 3 October 2011 . Ralph Steinman, 68, who won the Nobel prize for medicine today for work on fighting cancer, died of the disease himself just three days before he could be told of his award . A New York scientist working on a cure for cancer . today won the Nobel prize for medicine - only for the committee to discover he had tragically died of the disease just three days ago. Ralph Steinman, 68, had been . treating himself with a groundbreaking therapy based on his own research into . the body's immune system but died on Friday after a four-year battle with . pancreatic cancer. The Nobel committee at Sweden's Karolinska . Institute said it was aware of . Steinman's death - but it appeared that it had not known before making its . announcement. His colleagues at Rockefeller University in New York called . it a 'bittersweet' honour. It is likely that Steinman died without being aware he had won . science's ultimate accolade, along with American Bruce Beutler and Jules . Hoffmann of France. The Nobel committee does not give its awards posthumously, but has decided to make an exception because of what secretary general Goran Hansson called a 'unique situation'. His family will certainly benefit from the unusual ruling by gaining a share of the $1.5m prize. Steinman, originally from Montreal, Canada, whose discovery of . dendritic cells in the 1970s is key to understanding the body's next line of . defence against disease. 'The Nobel Foundation has recognised . Ralph Steinman for his seminal discoveries concerning the body's immune . responses,' said Rockefeller University president Marc Tessier-Lavigne. The TV screen announcing the winners at the Nobel Assembly at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm today . Steinman shared the win with American Bruce Beutler (left) and Jules . Hoffmann (right) of France . 'But the news is bittersweet, as we . also learned this morning from Ralph's family that he passed a few days ago . after a long battle with cancer,' he . added. The institution said in a statement: 'Steinman passed away on September 30. He was 68. Beutler and Hoffmann discovered in the . 1990s that receptor proteins act as a first line of defence (innate immunity) by recognising bacteria and other micro-organisms. Steinman's work explained . how, if required, dendritic cells in the next phase (adaptive immunity) kill . off any infections that break through. Understanding dendritic cells led to the . launch of the first therapeutic cancer vaccine last year, Dendreon's Provenge, . which treats men with advanced prostate cancer. 'We live in a dangerous world. Pathogenic micro-organisms threaten us continuously,' the Nobel panel said, . describing the work over the decades in understanding our . defences. Medicine, or physiology, is usually the . first of the Nobel prizes awarded each year. Prizes for achievements in . science, literature and peace were first awarded in 1901 in accordance with the . will of dynamite inventor and businessman Alfred Nobel. The award citation noted that the world's . scientists had long been searching for the 'gatekeepers' of immune . response. Hoffmann's pioneering research was . conducted on fruit flies. It highlighted how key elements of modern human biology . have been conserved via evolution. The immune system exists primarily to . protect against infections but it can also protect against some cancers by . targeting rogue cells before they proliferate. Sometimes, however, the immune system goes . into overdrive and attacks healthy tissue, leading to autoimmune inflammatory . diseases, such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis, as well as rheumatoid . arthritis. The effect is often compared to 'friendly fire', when . troops hit their own comrades in combat. 'He was diagnosed with . pancreatic cancer four years ago, and his life was extended using a . dendritic-cell based immunotherapy of his own . design.' Alexis Steinman, indicating that her . father had not known on his deathbed of the impending decision in Stockholm, . said: 'We are all so touched that our father's many years of hard work are . being recognised with a Nobel Prize. 'He devoted his life to his work and his . family and he would be truly . honoured.' The Nobel award panel said in a statement in . Stockholm: 'This year's Nobel laureates have . revolutionised our understanding of the immune system by discovering key . principles for its activation.' Before hearing the news of Steinman's death, Lars Klareskog, who chairs the . prize-giving panel, said: 'I . am very excited about what these discoveries mean. 'I think that we will have . new, better vaccines against microbes and that is very much needed now with the . increased resistance against . antibiotics.' Beutler, 53, is based at the Scripps . Research Institute in La Jolla, California. Luxembourg-born Hoffmann, 70, . conducted much of his work in Strasbourg. They were supposed to share half the . 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.46million) of prize-money. The rest should have . gone to Steinman, though the unusual circumstances leave its fate now in some . doubt. Beutler said he had learned of his . prize by e-mail and had to search online to make sure it was true: 'I . finally found it on Google News. My name was all over the . place.' Of his work, he said, it 'might lead . to new treatments for inflammatory and auto-immune disease and possibly new . treatments for other kinds of diseases as well'. The work of all three scientists has been . pivotal to the development of improved types of vaccines against infectious . diseases and novel approaches to fighting cancer. The research has helped lay . the foundations for a new wave of 'therapeutic vaccines' that . stimulate the immune system to attack tumours. Better understanding of the complexities . of the immune system has also given clues for treating inflammatory diseases, . such as rheumatoid arthritis, where the components of the self-defence system . end up attacking the body's own tissues.

The first couple were also joined by Pacific Fleet Commander Admiral Robert Willard and his wife Donna. The President swapped his relaxed vacation outfit of t-shirt and chinos for a dark suit as he and the First Lady visited the site - the first time since he came here in late 2008 as president-elect. The Obamas laid a wreath adorned with a ribbon reading 'In Loving Memory' and dropped the petals into the water beneath the memorial, where the sunken battleship still rests.

One of only 15 Marines to survive the 1941 attack on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor has died at a Texas hospice. Lamar Crawford Sr, who was 91, died last week. His funeral was held on Wednesday. Crawford, from Arkansas, was assigned to the USS Arizona in 1940. On December 7, 1941, he was on the ship's rear tower when it exploded and began sinking. Crawford's recollections are among stories of survivors at the Pearl Harbor Visitors Center. 'I heard the sound of airplane motors, several of them,' he wrote. 'Looking up I saw a Japanese dive bomber coming directly toward the Arizona. 'Explosions and fires were raging uncontrolled throughout the ship. I dived into the water... a motor whaleboat, manned by two Navymen, pulled alongside me, helped me into the boat, and then the three of us continued through the area pulling other men from the water until we couldn't take on any more.' Crawford was discharged in 1946 and he worked as a postal inspector after the war, retiring in 1976. He is survived by Mildred Crawford, his wife of 69 years.

"By . Meghan Keneally . A man was fired from his job at a Wells Fargo bank because of a teenage stunt he pulled nearly a half-century ago. Richard Eggers was fired because, when he was 19-years-old, he used a cardboard nickel to try and fleece a laundromat of ten cents. Now, the 68-year-old is looking for a new job and is ready to take Wells Fargo to court over his dismissal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Out because of a stunt: Richard Eggers, 68, was fired from his bank job of seven years because of a failed prank when he was 19 years old and tried to get a free load of laundry . The reason why the bank had grounds to fire Mr Eggers is because the sheriff caught him back in 1963 when he was trying to use the fake coin to get a free load of laundry and charged the teen with fraud. In compliance with a new federal law that forbids insured depository institutions, like Wells Fargo, from hiring people with criminal histories, the Des Moines branch of the company ran all of their employees fingerprints and background checks. It was then that Mr Eggers' dirty past came back to haunt him. 'I figured my record was squeaky clean,' he told the local ABC affiliate. Letter of the law: In compliance of a federal law that prevents insured banks from hiring people with theft or fraud arrests, Wells Fargo is issuing background checks that have resulted in thousands of firings . 'It was a stupid stunt, I'm not proud of it, but I don't think that it warrants a termination almost a half a century later.' Another story: The same thing happened in May to Yolanda Quesada, 58, from Milwaukee who shoplifted clothes from a department store as a teenager. Mr Eggers, who worked at the bank for seven years before his dismissal, is just one of thousands who have been fired from the company under the implementation of this law. The same thing happened in May to Yolanda Quesada, 58, from Milwaukee who shoplifted clothes from a department store as a teenager. At the time of the conviction she paid her required $50 fine, but when her Wells Fargo Home Mortgage branch did a background check, she was fired over the incident. 'I think there's more important things in life than something that I did 40 years ago,' she told local ABC affiliate KLTV. 'I changed my life. I went to school. I went to college. I didn't graduate but I did go and try to be a good person,' she told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. In reference to her case, a Wells Fargo representative would only say that she was not fired for her performance. When it comes back to Mr Eggers, the company spokesman said that they have to comply with federal regulations, which were put into place in an effort to protect customers from possible fraud or identity theft. 'We don't have discretion to grant exceptions in situations like this,' Angela Kaipust told ABC. 'Once we find out someone has a criminal history of dishonesty or breach of trust we can no longer employ them.' WATCH THE VIDEO HERE .

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . Wrapped up in a dark coat, balaclava and sunglasses, Irene Williams cuts an unusual figure as she visits her local supermarket to do her weekly shop. But her strange choice of attire is not meant to hide her face, masking her identity. Rather it is designed to protect the 58-year-old, who must live in the dark for a month, while she trials a new drug to treat her cancer. Mrs Williams is the first patient to take part in the international trial of the drug Amphinex, which, it is hoped, will be used to treat patients with inoperable bile duct cancer. Irene Williams, 38, may look like a robber but  actually her balaclava and sunglasses are because she is taking part in a trial of new drug Amphinex. Amphinex is reactive to light, and could be used to treat patients with inoperable bile duct cancer . She was given the drug by doctors at Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool, which is the first in the world to trial Amphinex. The drug, which enters into the cancerous cells themselves, is taken alongside chemotherapy. It reacts to light so doctors warned she had to stay in hospital for two weeks before going home. They said she had to cover her body completely when going outdoors. It prompted the 58-year-old to opt for sunglasses and a balaclava, as well as a pair of gloves, when she steps outside. Ms Williams said the outfit made shopping quite difficult initially. She said: ‘I got some funny looks when I went to the supermarket. 'I had someone go with me at first because with the dark glasses on I couldn’t tell the difference between a tomato and a beetroot. 'And when I went to the hairdressers, one lady ran out screaming – she must have thought I was going to blow the place up.' Ms Williams, a care assistant living in Llandudno, north Wales, found out she had bile duct cancer after she had a serious bout of vomiting last December. She noticed her skin was turning yellow and so sought help. Bile duct cancer is a rare but aggressive type of cancer. Cholangiocarcinoma is the medical term sometimes used for bile duct cancer. In most cases, there are no signs of bile duct cancer until it reaches the later stages, when symptoms can include: . See your GP if you have signs of jaundice or are worried about other symptoms. While it is unlikely you will have bile duct cancer, it is best to get it checked. Source: NHS Choices . ‘I went to my local hospital in Wales for a scan and they initially told me it was a gall bladder stone’ she said. However, at a follow-up appointment, she was told that the situation was more serious. She was referred to a hospital in Liverpool and was diagnosed with bile duct cancer after two weeks of tests. Following her diagnosis, Ms Williams met with Dr Richard Sturgess, clinical director of digestive diseases at Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool, who told her about the Amphinex trial. She felt the drug might help and wanted to take part. She said: ‘I wanted to get involved straight away. I had nothing to lose and so much to gain. 'I have four sisters and a brother in Liverpool and they were all supportive.’ Before beginning her chemotherapy treatment, which she receives three times a month at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Wirral, she had had Amphinex injected into her system and ‘activated’ at Aintree University Hospital in Liverpool. Amphinex works by entering cancerous cells within tumours. It is then ‘activated’ by inserting a laser into the bile duct, which illuminates the area where the bile duct cancer occurs. Doctors hope this will enhance the effects of traditional chemotherapy by targeting individual tumours rather than treating the patient’s whole body. Amphinex, which is produced by Norwegian company PCI Biotech, is already used in the treatment of some other cancers but has never been used to treat bile duct cancer before. Care assistant Ms Williams, who lives in Llandudno in north Wales, was diagnosed with bile duct cancer in November after she noticed she was turning yellow and was suffering a bout of vomitting . The study involves hospitals across Europe but Aintree University Hospital is the lead site. Dr Sturgess, who referred Ms Williams for the Amphinex trial said: ‘I’m delighted that our patients have had the opportunity to benefit from this research study. As a hospital, we are committed to cutting-edge research. ‘Bile duct cancer is a devastating disease with a very clear need of better, alternative treatments. 'It has a remarkable resistance to conventional treatment and this trial represents an innovative concept that could potentially improve the length and quality of life for patients.’","Irene Williams, 58, was diagnosed with bile duct cancer last November .

"By . Rob Cooper . Updated: . 06:08 EST, 19 January 2012 . A baronet has won a legal battle with his own son over the sale of their £2.5million 13th century ancestral home. Philip Howard, 50, had claimed he was entitled to £1.5million from the sale of Corby Castle,  which had been in the family since 1611. Mr Howard's father Sir John Howard-Lawson sold the Cumbrian castle in 1994 for £2.5million, along with its contents and a thousand acres of land. Victory: Sir John Howard-Lawson, 77, left has defeated his son Philip Howard, 50, in a legal fight over the sale of the 13th century ancestral home in Cumbria . Mr Howard claimed his father had no right to sell the property, originally built as a peel tower in the 13th century, as he had failed to comply with the terms of a will made in 1934. Philip Canning Howard, his great-great-grandfather, had dictated that in order to inherit Corby Castle, his heirs must change their surname to Howard and take up the family coat of arms within 12 months. Mr Howard claimed Sir John had failed to do this, so never validly inherited Corby Castle and should not have benefited from its sale. Ancestral property: Corby Castle had been in the Howard family since 1611 when it was sold off to an Irish businessman for £2.5million in 1994 with one thousand acres of land . A Howard family coat of arms. The inscription is Latin for 'Virtue Alone is Invincible' Lady Justice Proudman ruled in the High Court last year that Sir John had validly inherited the property. Yesterday . her decision was upheld by Lady Justice Arden, Lord Justice Richards . and Lord Justice Patten sitting in the Court of Appeal, who awarded Sir John £22,000 costs. Mr . Howard, a business consultant, claimed his father, 77, whose original . surname was Lawson, had 'forfeited' his right to inherit the castle in . 1961 by neglecting the terms of the will. But Sir John, who represented himself, insisted he had begun to use the name before the end of January 1962. The . baronet also claimed the family was forced to sell Corby Castle when . Philip Howard got into financial difficulties after taking on a major . part of the estate. However, the case is not over as Mr Howard has applied to take it to the Supreme Court. Corby Castle is reputed to be haunted . by a ghost known as The Radiant Boy, an apparition of a boy wearing . white with shining golden hair. Legend has it that any member of the . Howard family who sees the ghost will rise to a position of great power, . but will suffer a terrible death. The castle, six miles from Carlisle . on the east bank of the River Eden, dates from the 13th century and was . built as a tower house by the Salkeld Family. It was sold in 1611 to Lord William . Howard, the third son of Thomas Howard, the 4th Duke of Norfolk, who . added a two-storey L-shaped house to the original peel tower. The present façade was built for Henry Howard between 1812 and 1817. In 1981 the castle appeared in a BBC dramatisation of Wilkie Collins' The Woman . in White, starring Diana Quick. Lady Justice Arden said as she handed down her judgment that it was a 'very sad case' as the father and son had fallen out in a 'very bitter dispute'. The three judges agreed Mr Howard was trying to recover what he thought was his 'rightful inheritance' but that Sir John had 'sufficiently complied' with the terms of the will. They awarded £22,858 costs against Mr Howard. The Howard family have previously been embroiled in a royal scandal, when, in 1572, Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, was beheaded for treason after scheming to marry Mary Queen of Scots. His third son, William, bought Corby Castle in Cumbria, in 1611, and for nearly four centuries it passed down through ten generations, reaching Sir John in 1961. The Howard and Lawson families were combined when Corby Castle passed to Philip Canning Howard's sole heir, his daughter Ursula. She married Sir John's grandfather, Sir Henry, the third baronet in 1899. It was bought in 1994 by Northern Irish businessman, Edward Haughey, Lord Ballyedmond, who uses it for corporate events and shooting parties.","Philip Howard, 50, claimed he was entitled to £1.5million after his father sold the property .

"By . Peter Allen . Violent killings: Aerospace engineer Saad al-Hilli, from Surrey, and his family may have been the victims of a 'lone psychopath' The British girl who survived a quadruple murder in the French Alps owes her life to her mother who pleaded with her to 'hide', it emerged today. The revelation came as police confirmed that both Zeena Al-Hilli, four, and her older sister, Zainab, seven, were both 'gradually speaking' about the massacre. They were orphaned on September 5th when a lone gunman opened fire at an isolated layby close to the village of Chevaline, near Lake Annecy. Their father Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was shot dead, alongside their mother, Iqbal, 47, grandmother Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45. Details of police notes about the killings leaked to Le Monde newspaper suggest that Zeena was sitting upright with the two women in the back of the family BMW. All were wearing seatbelts, but when the firing started, Mrs Al-Hilli had vital seconds in which she was able to unbuckle Zeena's and shout: 'hide!' As bullets sprayed into the back of the estate car, Zeena would have been able to lie on the floor, and even hide underneath her mother's skirt. She was so well hidden, that police who arrived at the scene after the murders did not at first notice her. Instead she lay silently for as long as eight hours, until detectives opened the locked doors of the car and found the traumatised child still shaking with fear. Commenting on Le Monde's report, an investigating source said: 'Zeena recalls her mother's instructions to hide. She has spoken about her ordeal, and so has her sister. They are both gradually speaking.' Zeena was found unscathed, while Zainab suffered life-threatening injuries, and had to be placed in an artificially induced coma. Police believe she was pistol-whipped by the gunman, suffering severe head injuries, and a bullet wound in a shoulder. Murder scene: Saad al-Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and his mother-in-law were all killed in an isolated lay-by near Lake Annecy in Eastern France . Scene of a deadly crime: Officers are seen inspecting the forested region near Chevaline in south-west France . Despite the girls' horrific ordeal, . detectives on both sides of the Channel are still confident they may be . able to provide vital clues to finding the killer. They are currently at a secret . location close to the family home in Claygate, Surrey, and are being . held in conditions of utmost security. Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor . who is leading the investigation into the killings, said their safety . was 'paramount' and confirmed that they had offered 'important . information'. Key lines of enquiry include the . possibility that their father was involved in a serious financial . dispute with his brother, Zaid, over a family will. There were even claims in Le Monde . that former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein had paid 840,000 pounds into a . Swiss Bank account set up in the name of their father - however these were later denied by the French police. The family are originally from Baghdad, having moved to Britain in 1971. Other lines of enquiry include the . possibility that killer was a 'lone psychopath', or that Mr Mollier was . in fact the main target. Annecy chief prosecutor Eric Maillaud said: 'The hypothesis of a lone and psychologically disturbed killer is gaining ground.' Evidence . the gunman had used an obsolete 7.65mm Luger pistol dating back to the . 1930s also suggested he was not a professional assassin, police said. Prayers: Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, was laid to rest in the same grave last week . Mr Maillaud confirmed that the French . cyclist had at more bullets in his body than any other victim. There . have also been reports that he was shot first. A source told Le Monde: 'The theory of a . family feud is being pushed aside by investigators, who are now looking . at the possibility of a lone and psychologically disturbed killer. 'They . have carried out checks at all psychiatric hospitals in the region and . are tracking down all patients who may have been recently released or . were on day release. 'They are especially focusing those with previous convictions for gun violence or who were known to be attracted to firearms. 'Investigators . are on this basis also contacting gun clubs and hunting clubs in the . region. But so far they have had no satisfactory results to their . inquiries.' Annecy chief prosecutor Eric Millaud also admitted recently that there was 'no immediate prospect' of solving the crime. He added: 'It's a long task and there's nothing that gives hope of a result in the near future. 'We're investigating everything but it all takes a lot of time, trying to piece together the lives of all the people who have died, trying to understand a real motive for these killings. 'Perhaps if we can understand why they were killed we can work out who killed them but at the moment there are many questions. 'I think the investigation will take a very, very long time, unless we discover something that will suddenly enable us to understand everything. 'There are lines of inquiry but each raises so many questions and nothing suggests there will be a quick solution.' The two Frenchmen leading the hunt for the Alps killer have denied claims that German secret agents handed over documents proving links between the Al Hilli family and Saddam Hussein. Eric Maillaud, prosecutor in Annecy close to Chevaline where the massacre took place in September categorically ruled out the claim by Le Monde newspaper which appeared at the weekend. The article led to speculation that £800,000 in an acccount held by Saad Al Hilli in Switzerland had been given to his father by Saddam. ‘We are having to cope with questions from the victims’ families as to why they were not informed of this’, said Mr Maillaud in an interview with Agence France Presse. Asked about the Saddam-Al Hilli connection Benoît Vinneman, a senior Gendarme heading the investigation said: ‘It’s not true. No secret agent from any country has given us this kind of information’. M. Vinneman added that speculation as to the order in which the four victims were killed was also false, saying that investigators were still not sure who was killed first. Latest French reports suggest the massacre was committed by a mentally deranged killer riding a black motorcyle with saddlebags armed with a Luger pistol of a type which was issued to soldiers in the Swiss army eighty years ago. Mr Al-Hilli's father Kadhim was once . close to Saddam's Ba'ath Party, but fell foul of the tyrant in the . Seventies, and fled Iraq for Britain. Cash deposit: It was rumoured that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, left, deposited £840,000 into the bank account of murdered Saad Al-Hilli's (pictured right) father Kadhim - a claim later denied by French police . Shortly . before the dictator was executed in 2006, it was revealed that he . withdraw around £620 million from the Iraqi central bank in 2003, which . he had begun to hide around the world. The assets would have been added . to millions already deposited in accounts in other countries – mainly . through Iraqis who had moved abroad. Saddam is known to have . concentrated large amounts in Switzerland and France, where he had at . least two homes and moored a £17 million yacht.","Saad Al-Hilli, 50, killed .

"By . Beth Stebner . The Donald has been busy waging a Twitter battle – in the past 24 hours, he called President Obama’s re-election to office a ‘disgusting injustice’ and labelled NBC News anchor Brian William’s newscast as ‘boring.’ And a day after the election, The Donald is still going strong. The real estate mogul took to the social media site Wednesday to continue injecting his opinions into the Twitterverse. He lamented that people unfairly criticized him for his unforgiving tweets on Obama, saying that other celebrities were ‘far harsher than me with political statements’ and that he was singled out. Scroll down for videos . Fighting words: Donald Trump again took to Twitter Wednesday to voice his feelings over how his tweets about President Obama were perceived . Spat: NBC's Brian Williams, left, criticised billionaire Donald Trump, right, after he went on a Twitter rant demanding a revolution after Obama's re-election. Trump has now hit back at Williams . Angry: On Wednesday, Trump predicted that Chrysler would set up shop in China, and that the country was happier about Obama's re-election than Chicagoans . He also singled out the U.S.’s . relationship with China, predicting that American car companies would . immediately leap at the opportunity move their factories abroad. ‘Now that the election is over,’ Trump wrote,’ watch Chrysler ship Jeep production to China – my prediction.’ He also said earlier Wednesday: . ‘Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night. The Chinese . are happier with the election than we are.’ Following his Election Night rant, . Trump backtracked over the series of scathing tweets he wrote about . Obama as he secured a second term Tuesday night - hastily deleting . messages calling for a 'revolution'. And when Williams . lambasted Trump's Twitter tantrum on his show, the outspoken business . mogul turned his anger on the host and his 'boring' newscasts. Trump took to the social networking site after the president's victory was projected by several news outlets on Tuesday night, and claimed the re-election was a 'great and disgusting injustice'. After a barrage of outraged messages, Trump added: 'He lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a revolution in this country!' Minutes later, he deleted the tweet - . perhaps aware of the potential legal ramifications of a remark seeking . to incite a revolution against the president. Litany: Trump later deleted parts of his rant, but has kept the majority of it, blasting the Electoral College and the direction of the nation . Williams read some of . Trump's tweets on the air, while claiming he did so . reluctantly, as he declared that the TV personality - whose show, . Celebrity Apprentice, airs on NBC - had 'driven well past the last exit . to relevance.' 'This is, as they say, out there and . getting an airing tonight, so you might as well know about it,' Williams . groaned. 'Donald Trump, who has driven well past the last exit to . relevance and veered into something closer to irresponsible here, is . tweeting tonight. Here's a sampling...' Williams read several of Trump's tweets, which called the election a 'total sham and a travesty.' However, as it became apparent that former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney would not win the election, the Donald’s tweets became more enraged, and more hyperbolic. Trump began with: 'Well, back to the drawing board!' He . quickly followed up with a call to revolution. The Trump wrote: 'He . lost the popular vote by a lot and won the election. We should have a . revolution in this country!' - before deleting the tweet. But he was far from over. 'This . election is a total sham and a travesty,' he wrote. 'We are not a . democracy! He added America is in 'serious and unprecedented trouble like never before'. Priorities: Trump endorsed Romney last February in Las Vegas and has outspokenly objected many of Obama's policies . Bowed: Romney delivered his concession speech early Wednesday morning in Boston after he lost to Obama . The 66-year-old later went onto . attack the Electoral College, but offered a kernel of hope for the . still-Republican House of Representatives. ‘Hopefully the House can hold our country together for four more years,’ Trump tweeted. ‘House . shouldn’t give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.’ He . did not tweet anything after Romney's gracious concession speech. But he didn't keep his anger quiet for long, unleashing yet more scathing remarks on Wednesday morning - this time against Brian Williams, who uses the Twitter handle @bwilliams. He wrote: '@bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night.' Second rant: on Wednesday, Trump turned on Brian Williams who had criticised his previous messages . 'The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings - a disaster!' he added, before asking him: 'Wouldn't you love to have my ratings?' He went on: 'If I'm ""well past the last exit to relevance"" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night?' Trump’s attacks on Obama have been more frequent in the weeks preceding the election. Only . last week, he lashed out at the commander-in-chief for using Superstorm . Sandy to garner more votes and essentially buy the election. The billionaire’s grudge hasn’t gone unnoticed by the president. During . a recent appearance on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno, Obama quipped . that their rivalry began when the two were growing up in Kenya. ‘We had constant run-ins on the soccer field, he wasn’t that good,’ Obama told the NBC late-night host. Offer he could refuse: Ahead of the election, Trump offered to pay $5million to the charity of President Obama's choice if he released his college and passport records . Victory: President Obama waves as he walks on stage with first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha at his election night party . Cheers: Obama and the family were met with cheering at McCormick Place in Chicago . Obama said on Leno that the two have never actually met. During a campaign stop in swing state New Hampshire last month, Obama again joked about his birth certificate. He joked that Mitt Romney had made it too expensive for him to get a birth certificate.'He raised fees to get a birth certificate which would have been expensive for me,' the president said. The . joke was met with laughter and cheers, and was a veiled reference to . so-called 'birthers' who doubt he was born in America and question the . authenticity of his Hawaiian birth certificate.","Trump ranted on Twitter when it became clear Obama would win election .

"By . Matt Blake . and Beth Stebner . He has just become the most powerful military leader-elect to the most populous country in the world, and yet there are details that remain unknown about China’s new president, Xi Jinpig. While it is known is that he is married to the honey-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music, Peng Liyuan, and they have only one child together, details of their daughter’s life are few and far between. Their 20-year-old daughter, Xi Mingze, is currently attending Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, though little is known about China’s new First Daughter. Scroll down for video . Power couple: China's new president Xi Jinping is married to Peng Liyuan, the syrup-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music . Ms Xi reportedly transferred to Harvard two years ago and is surrounded by Chinese security at all times . New home: Kappa Alpha Theta sorority's house is seen on the Harvard campus where she is said to often study . It is believed that Ms Xi has been studying at the Ivy League school since transferring in two years ago after going to school in China. She studies under a pseudonym so as not to attract undue attention. It is rumored that she is surrounded by a staff of Chinese bodyguards 24 hours a day. The Washington Post reported last May that she joined Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and is described by peers at the school as 'studious and discreet.' She often studies at the sorority house and speaks with unaccented English. Her name, Mingze, denotes innocence . and ‘moral probity,’ Asia Time noted in 2007, speaking of how Xi’s . ascent into China’s highest office could see a sort of parallel to the . White House in terms of a father showing affection for his wife and . children. She isn’t the only progeny of China’s . political leaders to attend the American institution. Bo Guagua, the . only son of embattled politician Bo Xilai, also attended the institution . and had a playboy ‘princeling’ reputation while at the school. Ms Peng has become China's first high-profile political spouse since Jiang Qing, the late wife of Chairman Mao Zedong. Her huge success in the entertainment industry has run alongside her staunch loyalty to the Communist Party. She joined the People's Liberation Army aged 18 and rose to the rank of major-general, a post she still holds. But . when her superiors discovered her talent for singing, she began touring . army bases serenading troops in a program designed to boost morale. The Peony Fairy: Ms Peng had graced television screens in the world's most populous country for more than a decade, her honeyed tones punctuating state-run TV shows and Communist Party rallies . The new team: He and the six other men who will form China's new collective leadership, all dressed in dark suits, walked in line onto the red-carpeted stage. (L-R) Liu Yunshan, Zhang Dejiang, Xi Jinping, Li Keqiang, Yu Zhengsheng and Wang Qishan. Get used to this face: Xi's inaugural address as the country's new leader was broadcast on giant screens across China. Here, above a McDonald's in Beijing . From . there her rise to fame was meteoric. She is best known for performing . at CCTV's New Year's Gala - a show watched by hundreds of millions of . people throughout China - almost every year since its inception in 1982. Almost all of her songs are in praise . of the Communist Party and frequently appears on state television to . sing propagandist ballads with names including Plains of Hope and People From Our Village. In June 2011, she was even appointed World Health Organisation Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/Aids and tuberculosis. She has also shied away from . appearing in public with her husband or talking about their relationship . until recently, fuelling speculation that she may take a more active . role in his presidency than any of her predecessors.

In . a rare interview in 2007, she told a state-run magazine: 'When he comes . home, I’ve never thought of it as though there’s some leader in the . house. Very little is known about Xi Jinping's upbringing - or his rise to power. He is married to a popstar called Peng Liyuan who, for most of Xi's career, has been more famous than him. Chinese often tell a well-known joke: 'Who is Xi Jinping? Why, he is the husband of Peng Liyuan.' He is the son of Communist revolutionary general Xi Zhongxun, a comrade of Chairman Mao. But when he was in his teens, his father fell out with the Chairman and was sent to prison. Xi . was exiled to a far-flung, rural community of Liangjiahe, in Shaanxi . province, where he lived in cave-dwellings and was forced to labour in . the fields. Little more than 100 miles from Beijing, it is one of China's poorest regions. The family lived like peasants in a cave-like house carved out of the yellow rock formations that surrounded the village. He is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man. After leaving Liangjiahe, Xi headed to the busy coastal provinces that form China's industrial heartland. He quickly climbed the ranks to become the most senior party official first in Fujian, before Zhejiang and finally Shanghai. There he developed the mind for business and economics that he is known for today. Now . with exports and the economy slowing, China hopes his skills can help . get the nation back on track to overtaking America and becoming the . biggest economy in the world. 'In my eyes, he’s just my husband. When I get home, he doesn’t think of me as some famous star. In his . eyes, I’m simply his wife.' But while hers is still one of the most . famous faces in the country, comparatively little is known of her . husband, a man who spent most of his teens living in a cave, labouring . in the fields of one of China's poorest regions.

"By . Emily Andrews . They are too young to walk and talk but tiny twins William and Ellenita Trykush can swim a length of a 25-metre pool at just nine months old. The water babies love gliding up and down on their backs, kicking their legs to propel themselves along. And as this delightful underwater picture shows, they even smile while they’re swimming. Scroll down for video . Like ducks to water: William, left, and Ellenita, right, in their local pool . Splashing around: William, right, copies his sister Ellenita in the water . Their achievements are even more astonishing given that they were born by emergency caesarean six weeks early. The twins’ extraordinary talent emerged during a family holiday to Cyprus in October when they began to swim underwater, unaided and without armbands. On their return to Cirencester, Gloucestershire, their mother Charlotte, 35, took them to local baby pool at the Cotsworld Leisure Centre where they both suddenly set off on their backs. ‘It was astonishing. First they did five metres, then a width at seven metres, and then a length of 12 metres,’ said French-born Mrs Trykush, a former swimming coach. ‘There was hardly anyone in the adult pool, so I suggested to their teacher that we try the big pool. ‘They were loving it so much, they set off and did an entire length with . me swimming underneath them on my back to make sure they were alright . and to steer if they went off in the wrong direction. ‘Ellie was first - she always is - and William seemed to be copying his big sister. Under water fun: The pair first swam five metres before progressing to the full length of the pool . Natural: The twins now visit their local pool twice a week because they enjoy splashing around so much . Encouragement: Former swimming coach Charlotte swims underneath her babies to check they are alright . Tired out: The babies take a well earned nap after their swimming exploits . ‘We were so excited - all the receptionists and swimming coaches came to watch and were amazed. ‘One of the coaches has been teaching for 20 years and she said she’d never seen anything like it. ‘I think it comes naturally to them, as they are too young to actually learn the strokes.’ Mr and Mrs Trykush, who are both youth workers, married in September 2008 and discovered they were expecting in July last year. It was only at their 12 week scan that they discovered they were having not one, but two. Mr Trykush, 49, said: ‘When I saw the two little dots on the screen it was just amazing. ‘I sank to my knees and shouted “Yes!” as if Chelsea had won the cup. ‘Twins do run in both families, but it was still a bit of a shock.’ There were more surprises in store for the family. While . visiting her mother in Normandy, France, Mrs Trykush was rushed to . hospital with a placental abruption - each twin had their own placenta . but William’s had ruptured. In the family: The confidence in the water of mother Charlotte, a former swimming coach, and father Victor, helps William, centre left, and Ellenita, centre right . They were born by emergency Caesarean on 7 February, Ellenita first at five pounds (2.24kg) and then William at four-and-half pounds (2.07kg). William had swallowed a large amount of blood, which had to be sucked out his stomach, and was severely jaundiced. ‘It was a very traumatic birth and William nearly died,’ said Mrs Trykush. ‘They were in incubators for three weeks but I was just so relieved they were going to be OK. ‘They were so premature and small that although I’d intended to take them swimming as soon as possible, I was worried they would get too cold in the water. ‘So we waited until they’d had their inoculations and until they were big enough to regulate their temperature better.’ Now aged ten months, the twins go swimming twice a week - to their Duckling lesson with teacher Amy Stanley, and a practice session on the weekend. Miss Stanley, 27, said: ‘They are the youngest children I’ve ever seen swim. ‘Normally children can swim at age three or four at the earliest. ‘A lot of babies can hang in the water, but Ellie and William can swim on top of the water and breathe independently. ‘It’s remarkable how they can do it, but they haven’t learnt, it just comes naturally. ‘They are so relaxed because Vic and Charly are so relaxed in the water and love swimming. It rubs off on them.’ Mr Trykush now has half an eye on the Olympics, having taken the twins to London this summer. ‘We won’t push them but it would be amazing to see them at the 2028 Games. ‘If they continue like this, who knows.' On dry land: Father Victor hopes Ellenita, left, and William, right, compete at the Olympics in 2028 .","Tiny twins William and Ellenita Trykush surprised everyone at the pool by swimming so far .

Preddie served just four years of an eight-year sentence imposed in 2006 after he and his brother Danny stabbed Damilola in the leg with a broken bottle as the schoolboy walked home from a library in Peckham, south London, in November 2000. Back in Jail: Ricky Preddie (left), who killed schoolboy Damilola Taylor by stabbing him in the neck with a broken bottle, has been recalled to prison after being charged with handling stolen goods . Habitual offender: Preddie has already breached his parole terms twice having only served half his 8-year jail term for the manslaughter of Damilola . Last night Damilola’s father Richard, 64, called the justice system an ‘embarrassment’. He said: ‘Preddie has proved he cannot be rehabilitated. He should now stay in prison. ‘If he had been jailed for life for killing my son in the first place,  we wouldn’t have this prison merry-go-round. ‘What will it take before the . Probation Service realises he is hooked on a life of crime? I hope they . act before it is too late.’ Preddie was first released in . September 2010, but recalled to custody in March 2011 after returning to . Peckham from his west London bail hostel in breach of his licence . conditions. Then in October 2011 he beat up . another prisoner, but a Parole Board hearing on December 23 decided he . should be released on January 25, 2012. He lasted just 16 days before being . taken back to prison for again violating his parole by going to areas he . was banned from and visiting friends from his old gang. He was let out in July 2012, which . means he has lasted just five months on early release before being . hauled before the authorities again. South Western Magistrates’ Court, . south London, heard on Monday that police found him in possession of a . red Suzuki motorbike worth £800 that had been stolen in a burglary. Anger: Damilola's father Richard, 24, says that Preddie should never have been released from prison after what he did to his son . Preddie – who was sporting a bandage . over his left ear, which had been hacked off in a prison fight – pleaded . not guilty to handling stolen goods. He was remanded in custody and will stand trial on February 6. Police said he was charged with the latest offence in December. The Ministry of Justice said: ‘The re-release of serious offenders is directed by the Parole Board. ‘They will be subject to controls and if they fail to comply they can be returned to prison.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Ricky Preddie has appeared in court on suspicion of handling stolen goods and has been sent back to jail .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . MEPs in Brussels cost three times more than MPs in Westminster, shocking new figures reveal. The annual bill for a member of the European Parliament is almost £1.8million, compared to £590,000 for politicians in the House of Commons. Critics condemned the ‘eye watering’ sum, and blamed the insistence of the European Parliament on having three different homes. Eurocrats said it was like ‘like comparing apples and oranges’. The average cost of an MEP is almost £1.8million, almost three times the £590,000 bill for MPs in the Commons . David Cameron has repeatedly demanded cuts in the running costs of the entire European project. Late last year the Prime Minister was dumbfounded to discover that during a summit at which member states refused to impose reductions on EU spending, leaders were quaffing £120 bottles of wine. New figures released by Treasury minister Lord Sassoon give a breakdown of how the cost of politicians varies wildly. Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris, a former MEP for the East Midlands, said there were lots of ways the European Parliament could 'save a bob or two' The House of Commons costs £385million-a-year to run with 650 MPs, leaving a per head cost of £590,000. By contrast the European Parliament had an annual bill of £1.33trillion in 2011, the equivalent of £1.79million for each of the 736 MEPs. Tory MP Chris Heaton-Harris said: ‘The European Parliament has the most ridiculous system of having three homes, sitting in Strasbourg one a month, Brussels for three weeks and having a library and translation services based in Luxembourg.' Mr Heaton Harris, a former MEP who not sits on the Commons EU scrutiny committee, added: 'It could save an unbelievable quantity of cash by only going to one place to meet. ‘There are lots of ways it could save a few bob which would contribute to the feeling we are all in this together.’ The figures were obtained by Lord . Stoddart, who said: These are eye watering figures that make Westminster . look like very good value for money.’ Mr . Cameron is due to give a major speech on Europe next week, setting out demands for money and powers to be returned to . Britain. The revelation that . the cost of running the European Parliament which produces reams of . deeply unpopular diktats is so high will increase pressure for major . reform. A spokesman for the European Parliament said comparing it with the House of Commons was like 'comparing apples and oranges' Matthew Sinclair, . chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be . angry that the European Parliament is being so extravagant with their . cash when it comes to organising its own affairs. ‘Those . responsible for running the Parliament should be looking at finding . savings in the same way as everyone else is having to do. ‘They . should start by scrapping the nonsense of moving all the MEPs, staff . and documentation from Brussels to Strasbourg for a few days each month, . which currently costs in the region of £150 million a year.’ UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom added: 'The vast cost of the European Parliament, replete with trips to Strasbourg and translation into a smorgasbord of languages, ramps up the costs. 'Of course one might say that these differentials are right and proper. Given that three quarters of our laws are now made in Brussels, perhaps it is apt that MEPs get three times as much as our Westminster friends. 'UKIP MEPs are campaigning to make all British Euro-MPs a zero cost to the taxpayer by removing ourselves from the EU.' MPs in Westminster cost the equivalent of £590,000 each, compared to £130,000 for a member of the House of Lords . A spokesman for the European Parliament said: ‘Comparing the cost of running the European Parliament to running the Houses of Parliament is like comparing apples and oranges. ‘The European Parliament is an international organisation operating in 23 official languages, leading to translation and interpretation costs not applicable to the Houses of Parliament. ‘Unlike the Palace of Westminster, most of the European Parliament's office space is rented or leased. And because of a decision made by Member States, including the UK, and enshrined in the Treaties, the EP has two working seats, resulting in extra costs linked to travel, staffing, the upkeep of the buildings, and so on.’ On the same measure members of the House of Lords work out as the best value, costing £130,000 each.","New figures reveal the European Parliament costs £1.8million for each politician compared to £590,000 per MP .

"By . Martin Robinson . Scandal: A four-year-old girl lived with a foster parent who was a suspected paedophile for two weeks after the council was warned, it emerged today (file picture) Child protection campaigners have slammed social workers who allowed a four-year-old girl to stay with a foster parent for two weeks after they suspected he might be a paedophile. Bristol City Council failed to act instantly after police warned them the vulnerable child lived with an alleged sex offender, which the NSPCC believe could have put her at 'serious risk of harm'. The local authority has spent two months fighting a High Court battle to prevent details of the case being reported. But Mr Justice Baker found the council was 'unjustified' in trying to keep criticism of its staff secret, and has overturned the gagging order. 'It is in the public interest that these allegations are published,' he said, according to The Sun, who fought the injunction. Jon Brown, NSPCC head of sexual abuse programmes told MailOnline: 'As soon as there are fears for the safety of a child they should be given the protection they need. 'Any delay could leave them at serious risk of harm. And anyone who works with vulnerable children should be properly vetted to ensure they are going to provide the right level of care and attention.' A Family Proceedings Court hearing was told how the four-year-old child lived with the unnamed man for three months and then Bristol City Council were approached by police on May 14 2012 to say he was suspected of viewing child pornography. The same day the girl, called Child A in court papers, told her biological father and her social worker that another child living with the suspected paedophile had tried to throttle her. Her real father called the police about the strangling, officers then told social services, who failed to act for a day, did not get her seen by a doctor and then the young girl was still sent back to the foster home. Rebuttal: Bristol City Council (pictured) say they acted to remove the child as soon as it was confirmed the man was a suspected paedophile . It took Bristol City Council another six days to decide what to do with the girl and then another seven days to remove her from the alleged sex offender's home . The foster father then committed suicide a day later, and it was found he had downloaded explicit pictures of children in 2010 but these offences were only revealed in 2012. The child was originally sent into foster care because of violence at home. Her biological father told The Sun: 'I am livid. They said she wasn't safe at home but they put her whee someone had been downloading child abuse images.' Bristol City Council told MailOnline it takes its child protection duties seriously. 'This has been a very sad case for all involved. 'We have only ever sought the judgment of the court on this case to . protect the interests of children, which the judge has very properly . done through his ruling, and which we welcome. 'As soon as it was confirmed the foster father was the prime suspect around the download of indecent images, we took immediate action, with the removal of children from the foster carers’ home. 'We are always determined to learn from experience and are undertaking a thorough evaluation of practice, which will be reviewed independently. 'This will consider if there are any wider issues or learning to be taken from this case.'","Police warned Bristol City Council that her foster father was suspected of viewing child porn .

"By . Daniel Martin . 'Too slow': Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, has admitted the civil service lacks business acumen . Britain's most senior mandarin has admitted the civil service is far too slow and lacks business acumen – only days after it was lambasted by Tony Blair as ‘not fit for purpose’. Sir Jeremy Heywood, the Cabinet Secretary, said he still believed the civil service was the ‘best in the world’ but said it had not always been ‘rigorous’ enough. He said Whitehall needed to adapt to an age in which ‘everything is quickening up’ if it is not going to be ‘fleeced by the private sector’. His comments come amid increasing calls to reform antiquated ministries. Earlier this week, Mr Blair said the service was ‘hopelessly bureaucratic’ and needed ‘radical change’ if it were to adapt to the modern world. At the weekend, both David Cameron and Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary, said they would not publish estimates on how many Romanians and Bulgarians might come to Britain once EU restrictions are lifted – because they were not confident the civil service had done its sums correctly. Downing Street is said to believe that the criticism from across the political spectrum, including Mr Blair, could lead to cross-party agreement on reform. Sir Jeremy said that, while there were delays, this was due to the need for excessive consultations before any changes could be agreed rather than failings in civil servants themselves. Whitehall: Britain's civil service needs to adapt to an age in which 'everything is quickening up' if it is not to be 'fleeced' by the private sector, Sir Jeremy said . He added: ‘There are too many . processes that slow decision-making. The civil service feels just as . annoyed about that as ministers do. ‘We . are trying to get the economy moving, the private sector moving and . it’s frustrating that you have to go through a period of consultation . before you deregulate.’ 'There are too many processes that slow decision-making' Sir Jeremy Heywood . Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude, in charge of civil service reform, said it had to ‘be flatter and do things faster’. ‘The . world has changed. We need to save money and do things better. The . civil service performing to the max is a key part of the country being . successful,’ he added. Yesterday, . the union representing senior civil servants warned ministers against . any moves towards a politically-appointed civil service. Dave . Penman, general secretary of the First Division Association, said it . would harm the Government if ministers were surrounded only with . ‘believers’.

"By . Steve Nolan . The son of former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi has appeared in court today charged with attempting to escape jail, harming state security and insulting the new regime's flag. Saif-al Islam, who had been considered the most natural successor to his father before the fall of his regime in 2011, appeared in court in the western town of Zintan where he is being held by militiamen, according to the official Libyan news agency LANA. The trial is said to be linked with his meeting in June with an International Criminal Court delegation accused of smuggling documents to him. His ICC appointed lawyer, Australian Melinda Taylor, was herself arrested and held for three weeks on suspicion of handing her client documents that could endanger national security. Trial: Saif-al Islam Gaddafi, left, son of former Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi appeared in court in Libya today . A colleague of Ms Taylor's was also arrested. Neither were present in court today. Gadaffi is wanted for war crimes by the ICC who wish to extradite him to The Hague but Libyan officials want to try him at home where he could face the death penalty. Taha Baara, spokesman for the prosecutor,said: 'He is charged with involvement with the ICC delegation which is accused of carrying papers and other things related to the security of the Libyan state. 'Investigations for trying him for war crimes are over and he will be put on trial for that at a later time.' The trial was adjourned until May as there was no lawyer to represent him. Protests against his father Colonel Muammar Gaddafi began in Libya in February 2011. His heavy handed response to the protests sparked widespread uprising. Seif al-Islam Gaddafi is pictured shortly after his capture in November 2011 in the custody of revolutionary fighters in Zintan, Libya . Amid bloody civil war, several major cities declared themselves free of Gaddafi rule and the ICC issued arrest warrants for Colonel Gaddafi and Saif-al Islam. Colonel Gaddafi was eventually captured and killed in October 2011. Former playboy Saif-al Islam faces trial for killing, torturing and persecuting civilians in the early days of the uprising. He was arrested in November 2011 in Libya’s southern desert while trying to flee to Niger. Since then, he has been held at a secret location in Zintan, western Libya. He had to have part of the forefinger and thumb on his right hand removed once captured after he was injured in a Nato airstrike while on the run. Uprising: Colonel Gaddafi's regime fell after a bloody civil war in Libya. rebel forces are pictured on the lookout during the war . Thousands of Libyans celebrated in the streets after hearing that the fugitive, who remained loyal to his father’s murderous rule to the end, had been captured without a struggle. Tony Blair's Government had tried to get Saif-al Islam a place at Oxford University in 2002, but the institution rejected him because of concerns that he wasn't bright enough. He later received a PhD from the London School of Economics. He reportedly once threw wild parties in the south of France and owned a £10million mansion in Hampstead, London.","Saif-al Islam Gaddafi went on trial in the western town of Zintan .

"By . Emily Davies . Professor Tanya Byron says paranoia culture means children are raised in 'captivity' Children today are no longer “free range” but are being raised in captivity due to “paranoia” about health and safety, according to a former government adviser. Leading child psychologist Professor Tanya Byron warned that youngsters no longer know how to fall over, are still being driven to school at age 12 and are banned from throwing snowballs due to fears about grit. She said that a risk-averse culture has resulted in levels of paranoia that are “insane”. Speaking at the North of England Education Conference (NEEC) in Sheffield Professor Byron raised concerns that children are now being raised in captivity. 'We live in a risk-averse culture, the levels of paranoia about health and safety and wellbeing are insane,' she said. 'Most children spend most of their childhoods being raised in captivity.' Today’s children are “hugely, hugely restricted”, she told delegates. 'There are no more predators on the streets, no more paedophiles, then when I was growing up in the 1970s.' There are better systems now for tracking those people who have “wholly inappropriate relationships around children', Professor Byron suggested. Children today are “rarely seen out”, she said, when youngsters used to play outside all the time. Rising numbers of children are attending A&E and minor injuries units because “kids don’t know how to fall any more,” she said. 'They tense themselves up when they fall, so they sprain.' Children can no longer be seen playing outside, and missing out on play makes them more vulnerable according to Professor Byron. Picture posed by model. Children used to fall all the time and scabs were seen as a “badge of honour”, she said. Professor Byron claimed she had also heard of directives in schools which said children cannot play with conkers without goggles, or throw snowballs because they may have grit in them, and that youngsters are being driven to school when they are 11 and 12. She told the conference: 'Children are being raised in captivity, children are not free range any more. 'They are taking risks we are not preparing them for. They are having a blast in this fantastic global space. I would argue they are more vulnerable there than if they were hanging out on the street.' Professor Byron raised concerns that too much emphasis is being put on a child’s IQ, suggesting that emotional intelligence also needs to be considered. 'IQ is something that the government is very interested in and see IQ as determined by exam results.' She said anyone who has spent time researching the subject knows that “exam results are the least reliable indicator of intelligence”. Prof Byron also told delegates: 'If we do believe that the only way to get the education system back on track is to take it back to the 1970s, we’re completely delusional. It’s letting children down.' Children need to be allowed to develop their emotional intelligence, she said. She also suggested that children learn in different ways, and this needs to be taken into account in the classroom. Her comments came the day after ministers announced that in future primary schools will be encouraged to teach pupils to work out sums using traditional methods like long division and multiplication, or setting out figures in columns for addition and subtraction. The move is a bit to stop schools using techniques such as “gridding” and “chunking” which have become increasingly popular in recent years. Ministers insist that these newer methods are “clumsy, confusing and time-consuming”. Under the plans, pupils who use traditional methods for working out sums will be rewarded in tests, even if they get the answer wrong.","More children end up in A&E because they don't know how to fall over safely having missed out on outdoor play .

"By . Sara Malm . A tiny monkey is walking on stilts, clad in a red tracksuit and a ghostly doll mask, as cars and motorcycles drive past on a busy road in Surakarta, Indonesia. Neneng, a long-tailed macaque, is only nine months old but can already put on a show as he plays a toy-guitar, walk on stilts and does a handstand in a red cowboy hat. With a yank of the chain around his neck, his master Iyayi changes the act to entice those driving past to throw a coin or two at the performing primate, one of thousands on the streets of Indonesia. Scroll down for video . Chained: The monkey holds on to his stilts on the side of the road in Surakarta, Indonesia which is his 'stage' The practice of training macaques to become street performers has been a part of the country’s culture for decades. It has been growing in popularity since the 1980s when it changed from being part of ‘monkey circuses’ entertaining children in the poor neighbourhoods, to move to markets and road-sides. The practice has become an industry in Indonesia, its centre in a district in East Jakarta known as as Kampung Monyet - Monkey Village - where a majority of the residents are ‘monkey masters’. Here monkey masters train their carefully selected macaque for months to push trolleys, fetch money and roly-poly in the street for pennies. The monkeys are often clothed and wear masks made out of the face of a dolls head. Prime performance: Neneng, a nine-month-old macaque, is dancing and holding a guitar whilst wearing an unnerving mask made from a dolls head . Dance monkey: Neneng sits down with his toy-guitar by the side of the road where he performs with his 'monkey master' Nothing sensational: Performing monkeys on the side of the road or in markets have become a common sight in the country in the the past few decades . Their cruel training methods include ‘the hanging monkey’ which is designed to wean the monkey off walking on all fours. The monkey master chains the monkey to the ceiling and ties the monkey’s arms around its back, forcing it to stand on two legs. This goes on for as long as it takes the monkey to find its balance on its hind legs, only allowing a daily food break before it is strung up again. Neneng’s monkey master Iyayi bought him for 200,000 rupiah (£13) and spent then trained for three months to perform a variety of tricks. Neneng is expected to make 50,000 rupiah (£3.20) to 70,000 rupiah (£4.50) per day for his master. Cruel methods: Training a macaque takes months and often involves punishments and beatings to curb the will of the animal . Tight leash: When Iyayi wants his monkey to switch to a new trick, he yanks the chain around his neck . Popular job: Lack of jobs, poverty and poor conditions in the slums have been blamed for the increasing number of 'monkey masters' on the streets of Indonesia . Livelihood: Neneng cost his owner Iyayi £13 and is expected to make him between £3 and £4.50 a day through his roadside performance . The Jakarta Animal Aid Network (JAAN), a charity that feeds rescued performing monkeys, explains that the conditions in the slums is what keeps this practice going. ‘Poverty drives the handlers to exploit the monkeys in the hope of earning small change,’ the charity writes on its website. 'From the forest they are captured and taken to 'monkey village', where the animals are trained to take part in street performances.’","Cruel practice of performing monkeys on the streets of Indonesia .

"By . Rachel Quigley . and Michael Zennie . General John Allen, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, has been cleared of military  misconduct allegations for exchanging 'racy' emails with Tampa socialite Jill Kelley, a key figure in the scandal that led to the resignation of former CIA Director David Petraeus. A Pentagon investigation examined 20,000 to 30,000 pages of emails he exchanged with Kelley and announced on Tuesday that Allen violated no military regulations regarding the conduct of officers. Allen's name surfaced in the Petraeus scandal after the FBI revealed that it had seized the emails as part of its investigation into whether Kelley was being harassed by Paula Broadwell - the married mother of two who was later confirmed to be Petraeus' mistress. Cleared: General John Allen (right) has been cleared by a Pentagon investigation of any wrongdoing in the scandal that brought down his former boss, CIA Director David Petraeus . Breaks silence: Jill Kelley said her life has turned into a nightmare since the scandal erupted more than three months ago . Kelley, the wife of a prominent Tampa, Florida, surgeon, acted as a volunteer civilian liaison for officers at nearby MacDill Air Force Base. Allen and Petraeus met Kelley when they were stationed at the base while serving as the commanders of U.S. Central Command between 2008 and 2011. Allen said both he and his wife Kathy became close friends with Kelley. He denied ever having an inappropriate relationship with her. Allen, a four star U.S. Marine general, has been in professional purgatory, pending the outcome of the investigation. President Barack Obama nominated him to become Supreme Allied Commander of NATO forces in Europe, but that nomination has been on hold until the results of the review came out. Sources told the Washington Post that Allen exchanged only a few hundred emails with Kelley over the course of four years. 'Some of the messages are not the sort of things you would print in a . family newspaper,' an official said. 'But that doesn’t mean he violated . military regulations by sending and receiving them.' Also on Tuesday, Kelley finally broke her silence over the Petraeus affair - the first time since the scandal erupted three months ago. 'Close friends': Allen says he and his wife Kathy (right) were friends with Kelley and that the relationship was never inappropriate . She said that though she never met Paula Broadwell, Petreaus' former mistress tried to blackmail, extort and threaten her'. Kelley - who has been described as the 'other other woman' - has been accused of many things since the scandal erupted - that she too was having an affair with Petraeus, that they exchanged more than 30,000 emails, that she had an affair with Gen John Allen and that she used cancer charity funds for entertainment purposes. She said from the moment the blackmailing email was sent to an account she shared with her husband Scott, her life was turned upside down as she went from wealthy Tampa socialite to a maligned, scamming mistress. Kelley said she was terrified by the . anonymous email and admitted in the barrage that followed there was . 'blackmail, extortion, threats'. She would later learn they were from . biographer Paula Broadwell, whose affair with Petraeus triggered . his resignation as CIA director. Close connections: Kelley (second from right) and her surgeon husband Scott (second from left) threw parties attended by David Petraeus (left) and his wife Holly (right) Speaking to The Daily Beast's Howard . Kurtz, she said she had no idea who Paula was or of her relationship . with Petraeus. When the 37-year-old complained to a friend in the FBI, she had no idea of . the chain of events she was about to set in motion - including finding . herself accused of having an affair with  Gen John Allen, the U.S. commander in . Afghanistan, which both flatly deny. 'I knew I was . being stalked. I . did what anybody else would have done when they were feeling threatened, . to go seek protection from somebody I could trust,' she said. In the interview, Kelley mainly dwells . on the impact the scandal has had on her husband and children, . recounting a party she threw soon after for her daughter's seventh . birthday. 'It was devastating. To have your privacy invaded is . truly...there are no words to describe it,' she said. 'Instead of enjoying a family . birthday party, I had paparazzi storming my front lawn, pushing down the . door. There are no words to describe the panic and fear at that . moment. 'As much as I appreciate that [the media] want to be the first one to come out . with a headline, regardless of whether they did any fact-checking, they . have to consider the impact they have on our life and our children’s . lives,' she says. 'Just because it’s repeated doesn’t make it true. It . was living a nightmare.' Kelley was known for holding lavish parties on the manicured lawns of her colonial style home overlooking Tampa Bay . Scandal: The revelation that CIA Director Petraeus was having an affair with his biographer Paula Broadwell shocked the nation last year . Afghanistan General John Allen: Kelley said the pair were just good friends and nothing more . The Lebanese-born socialite said a lot . of reports in the media were not true, or greatly exaggerated, including that she had exchanged as many as 30,000 emails with Gen Allen. While she did not provide an estimate, she said it was . probably somewhere in the hundreds. When asked about her relationship with Allen, whom she met when she hosted a birthday party for Petraeus' wife Holly, . 'We’re friends, good friends,' she . said of the relationship with the former CIA director. 'His wife and me . are good friends. Our children are friends.' 'It was pretty straightforward,' Kelley says. That friendship continued by email when Allen was sent to Kabul.

"By . Martin Robinson . and Lucy Osborne . and Mark Duell . Stuart Hall has been charged with more historic sex attacks including the rape of a young woman and 14 counts of indecent assault on children as young as a nine. The veteran broadcaster, 83, was arrested yesterday when he attended a Lancashire police station by appointment over allegations stretching  over a 19-year period. The rape is alleged to have been in 1976 on a 22-year-old and the indecent assault offences are reported to have been committed between 1967 and 1986. They concern ten girls aged between nine and 16. The 83-year-old BBC television and radio . presenter had appeared in court earlier this month to face accusations . of three other sex attacks. Further charges: Stuart Hall (pictured outside court on January 7) was arrested yesterday on suspicion of rape and several indecent assaults over a 19-year period . A Lancashire Police statement said: . ‘Following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service an . 83-year-old man has this evening been charged with one offence of rape . and 14 offences of indecent assault.’ Hall had already been charged in December with indecently assaulting three girls. These charges included an alleged . assault of an eight-year-old, an 11-year-old and a woman who was then . aged 16. The allegations cover the period between 1974 and 1984. Hall, who is known for his . distinctively highbrow approach to football commentary on Radio 5 Live, . was released from custody and bailed to appear before court this month . over the three charges. But now that case will go before magistrates in . Preston on April 16. He has already pleaded not guilty. And, in light of the new allegations . laid against him, he has been bailed to appear before magistrates, again . in Preston, on February 7. Heyday: Veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, is pictured in 1979 at home with his wife Hazel . In December, Hall’s employers at BBC . Radio 5 Live announced he would not be working for them while the police . investigation was continuing. Hall was first arrested in December . during a dawn swoop on his £1.5million detached home in Wilmslow, . Cheshire, where he lives with his wife of 44 years, Hazel, who is 74. The couple, who have two grown-up . children, Daniel, 50, and Francesca, 52, are popular among the local . community where they carry out charity work. Hall won legions of fans in the 1970s . and 1980s for his inimitable style and habit of breaking down in fits of . infectious laughter during It’s a Knockout. He became an OBE in the 2012 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and charity. Hall’s solicitor, Louise Straw, said . last night: ‘A number of historic allegations have been made, all of . which are denied. 'None of these allegations have been raised with the . authorities in the last three to four decades which raises concerns and . issues.’ A police spokesman said: ‘We take all allegations of sexual abuse extremely seriously.’ Scrum: There was huge interest as the broadcaster British broadcaster walked to court a fortnight ago . Appearance: Stuart Hall faces prosecutor Jo Ann Cunnife as judge Peter Ward looks on at Preston Magistrates' Court earlier this month . Mr Hall appeared before magistrates a fortnight ago to deny the first three allegations of sexually abusing young girls he was accused of in December. The veteran broadcaster, who has not been seen in public since, looked drawn and grey – a shadow of his normal ebullient self – as he entered court to face three counts of indecent assault. Hall was asked if he understood that he faced three separate charges of indecent assault and if he wanted to enter a plea. He replied: ‘Yes I do. Not guilty to all three charges.’ Hall, who gave his full name, James Stuart Hall, was then allowed to sit down in the witness box while further details of the charges were given at Preston Magistrates’ Court. Following his arrest Hall condemned the police decision to carry out a dawn raid at his home. At the time his solicitor, Miss Straw, expressed anger saying her client should not have had to suffer the humiliation of being arrested at his family home in the early hours of the morning.

"By . Peter Allen . French troops today launched their first ground operation against Islamist rebels in Mali in a crucial action to dislodge al Qaeda-linked fighters who have resisted six days of air strikes. France called for international support against Islamist insurgents it says are a threat to Africa and the West and acknowledged it faced a long fight against well-equipped and determined militant fighters who seized Mali's vast desert north last year. After Islamist threats to exact revenge for France's dramatic intervention, an al Qaeda-linked group claimed responsibility for a raid on a gas field in Algeria in which seven foreigners were kidnapped and a French national killed. Earlier, Edouard Guillaud, the French chief of . military staff, said up to 2,500 of his troops would soon have been . deployed, together with tanks and artillery pieces.

'We will be in direct combat within hours.' They will be leaving the relative . safety of the Malian capital of Bamako and heading towards rebel . strongholds in the north of the country.

"By . Suzannah Hills . Three young sisters from a small Indian village have been raped and murdered before their bodies were thrown into a well, it has emerged. The three girls - aged 11, nine and six - went missing on Valentine's Day from their impoverished home village of Murmadi in Lakhni tehsil after finishing school. Their bodies were found four days later in a well near their hometown in the Bhandara district - which is located just 65kms from the city of Nagpur. Horrific: Three sisters - aged 11, nine and six - were raped and murdered before their bodies were thrown into a well near their village of Murmadi . Locator: The sisters disappeared on Valentine's Day and were found in a well a few kilometres from their home in Murmadi in the Bhandara district near the city of Nagpur . It is alleged that the three sisters - who lived in abject poverty - were lured away by a stranger with the promise of food. The horrific murders come after a 23-year-old student was brutally raped on a bus in New Delhi and died 13 days later from her horrific injuries. The violent assault sparked protests and demonstrations across the country as civilians demanded better protection for women. Theory: Police have launched an investigation to find the culprit as the girls' grandfather says he believed the sisters - who were living in abject poverty - were lured away by a stranger promising them food . Outrage: Residents of the village in the Bhandara district are in uproar over the murders and have accused police of trying to pass off the crime as an accident . These latest 'deplorable' murders are likely to reignite the campaign to clamp down on violent sexual attacks across the region. The local community is already in uproar over the attack. Mass protests and demonstrations were sparked around India when it emerged that a 23-year-old student was brutally gang raped on a bus as she made her way home from the cinema. The student had spent the evening with a male friend watching the hit film Life Of Pi on December 16. But as the pair made their way home in New Delhi they were forced on to a bus where she was repeatedly raped while her friend was beaten with an iron bar. She was rushed to hospital after the horrific ordeal and underwent three major surgeries - including one to remove her intestines. The victim was then flown to a specialist hospital in Singapore but died from cardiac arrest on December 29 - 13 days after the brutal attack. The case has caused uproar in India, with mass demonstrations for women's rights, tougher rape laws and calls for the suspects in the case to be hanged. Six suspects have been arrested over the attack and are due to be tried later this year. Chief . Minister Prithviraj Chavan said: 'The incident is extremely deplorable . and painful. I appeal to the people to maintain calm and cooperate with . the law-enforcers.' The girls' grandfather - who cannot be . named because rape victims can never be identified under Indian law - . believes the sisters were lured away by a stranger with promises of . food, NDTV reports. The sisters' father died four years ago and the family struggles to get by on the lowly wage earned by their mother as a labourer. Villagers have already criticised the police handling of the case - claiming they tried to pass off the deaths as an accident. Union Minister Praful Patel, who represents Maharashtra in parliament, visited the mother of the three girls at her home. He told NDTV: 'As a father of three daughters, I am appalled at the atrocity committed on these girls. I have raised the matter with the chief minister to ensure financial assistance to the widow, speedy investigation and a fast track trial of the accused.' Mr Patel had urged chief minister Prithviraj Chavan to provide special financial aid to the widow, the Times Of India reports. Five large investigation teams have been formed to find the culprit and a reward has been offered for any information leading to an arrest of 50,000 rupees - the equivalent of just under £600. Some workers on the minimum wage in India earn as little as £35 a month. But many don't any receive that. The brutal rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in New Delhi sparked protests across India where thousands of people marched in homage to the victim and called for better protection for women .","The three girls - aged 11, nine and six - went missing on Valentine's Day .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The Dominican prostitute who apparently claimed that Senator Robert Menendez attended sex parties and liked 'the youngest and newest' prostitutes now says that she fabricated the whole story. Nexis de los Santos, 23, now admits that she 'never went to bed with' Menendez and never even met him, lawyer Vincio Castillo Seman told reporters in the Dominican Republic on Monday. He released an affidavit from her regarding the email published yesterday by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Under fire: Menendez issued a denial yesterday against allegations that he slept with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic . The Washington Post identified Santos as the prostitute who made the original allegations in November - but the website that first broke the story insisted that this was a case of mistaken identity. The Daily Caller said that a video of two unidentified prostitutes it posted at the time could not have shown Santos, as she is younger than the two women and neither of them went by her name. Additionally, Santos said she had been covertly taped, whereas the women in the Daily Caller video were wearing earpieces and appeared to know they were on camera. Santos told the Washington Post: 'I am the person in the . video, that is me, and those are my words, but this statement is not . true. I never agreed to be recorded.' Senator Menendez, who has maintained all . along that he never paid prostitutes for sex, said he is looking . forward to whatever evidence emerges from courts in the Dominican . Republic to vindicate him. The Daily Caller said in a statement: 'The Washington Post falsely reported a story yesterday claiming our source had recanted her statement, without contacting The Daily Caller for comment before posting. 'In reality, the prostitute in the Post’s story does not appear to be one of the women we interviewed in 2012. Details provided by the prostitute identified as Ms Santana in the Post story conflict with the taped interviews The Daily Caller posted on November 1, including the mention of a person whose name would not come to light for months afterward. 'In addition, Melanio Figueroa, the attorney for TheDC’s sources, has said the Post's allegations are fabricated and that the affidavit is false. The Post would not provide TheDC with a copy of the affidavit, despite our request. We stand by our reporting.' Accusations: This woman claims to have slept with Menendez for money in an interview with the Daily Caller . Scandalous: This is the second woman who says she had sex with Menendez while he was in the Dominican Republic . The . Democratic politician has been hit with a series of allegations since . November that he and a prominent donor frequently traveled by private . plane to the Dominican Republic where they paid multiple prostitutes to . attend their sex parties. Last month the FBI raided the offices of wealthy Florida eye doctor, and Democrat donor, Salomon Melgen, . who along with Menendez also denies the claims. The . email is part of a chain of whistle-blowing exchanges between CREW and a . concerned American citizen who claims to have knowledge of Senator . Menendez and his attendance of sex parties in the Dominican Republic. Included in the exchange is an email . from one of the girls who claims to have participated in these orgies . and was paid by the senator for sex. 'In . the beginning he seemed so serious, because he never spoke to anyone, . but he is just like the others and has just about the same tastes as the . doctor, very refined. I think they were taking us more often to get us . checked [medically] because of him,' wrote the girl. Her name is being withheld by MailOnline because she may have been a minor when her alleged encounters with Menendez occurred. In her email, the young lady expresses fear at coming forward. 'I . do not want to have problems with those people,” she wrote, adding that . she believed 'I can trust you, that you will help us, and that nothing . bad will happen to the other young girls, to me, or to my family.' 'The thing that worries me the most is that if they know that I spoke with someone they will find me,' she added. A screen grab of the Dolls Palace in the Dominican Republic where the woman who sent the email allegedly works . Investigation: The FBI removes boxes from the West Palm Beach, Fla. office of Dr Melgen . The alleged prostitute says that she . was working with a Dominican escort service called The Doll Palace and . that a code word, 'chocolate' was used to summon her and other girls to . Melgen's alleged sex parties. To prove herself she gave detailed descriptions of Melgen's pimp and the houses where she slept with house guests. The . account is the most detailed since allegations emerged in November that . Senator Menendez had attended sex parties in the Dominican Republic. She is said to have told the whistle-blower who did not include her email with a cache of documents he sent to CREW on January 24th. The DC was first to report on that dossier about Senator Menendez, which included an interview transcript in which a different woman claimed she was 16 when she began sleeping with him. That young prostitute said she had sex with Menendez 'three times at least' in 2009. 'The first one in February, and then in May and June. I recall his visit in June so well because that month was my 17th birthday.' Friend with a benefit? Dr Melgen gave trips on his private plane to Sen Menendez . Yesterday, New Jersey Senator Robert Menendez today denied allegations of sleeping with prostitutes in the Dominican Republic. The Democratic politician was forced to issue the statement after the FBI raided the home of one of his big shot political donors, a prominent Florida eye doctor. Dr Salomon Melgen, a contributor to Menendez and other politicians, has been suspected of providing free trips on his private plane to the Dominican Republic. Menendez was first accused of . sleeping with prostitutes on the island shortly before last November's election when . the website the Daily Caller said he used Dr Melgen's plane to travel to . the Dominican Republic to meet with the call girls. He initially refused to address the report, calling it a bunch of 'fallacious allegations.' Prostitution is legal in the Dominican Republic. Menendez, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, did say he traveled on Dr  Melgen's plane on three occasions and trips were 'paid for and reported appropriately.' Menendez's office did not say whether the three trips were to the Dominican Republic or elsewhere. They also did not say whether the trips were paid by Menendez personally or by his senatorial or his campaign accounts, nor did it specify how they were reported. If Menendez did not pay for the trips, he would have to report them on annual financial disclosure forms as gifts. If he paid for the trips from his Senate office account, he would have to report them on Senate office forms. And if he used campaign funds, he would have had to report the expense on Federal Election Commission forms. The Associated Press searched six years of office and travel-related . expenses for Menendez's U.S. Senate office and found no reports . reflecting payments to Melgen or trips aboard Melgen's plane. Luxurious: Casa de Campo, the 7,000-acre exclusive resort in the Dominican Republic, where the Senator is said to have paid $100 for sex acts . The AP also found no apparent . reimbursement to Melgen in more than six years' worth of campaign . expenses on file with the Federal Election Commission. Records filed in Palm Beach County . show an Internal Revenue Service lien against Dr Melgen of more than . $11.1million for unpaid taxes from 2006 through 2009. Prior liens for taxes from 1998 to 2002 were subsequently withdrawn, records show. Despite Dr Melgen's financial problems, he and his family have contributed at least $357,000 to candidates and committees since 1998, according to Florida and federal campaign records. Of that, the Melgens have contributed about 9 percent to Menendez’s federal campaigns, the Miami Herald reported. Dr Melgen has become regarded as a top ophthalmologist, speaking at conferences and even operating on then Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles in 1997. Calls to Melgen's offices were forwarded to an answering service where receptionists told callers to try back Thursday. Calls to Melgen's home in North Palm Beach, which is appraised at $2.1million, went unanswered. In a statement to The New York Times on Wednesday, Dr Melgen's lawyer said: 'The government has not informed Dr Melgen what its concerns are. However, we are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times.","Robert Menendez possibly set up in Dominican Republic prostitute scandal .

"By . John Stevens . An airport has apologised after it posted on its Facebook page a light-hearted comment with a photo of a plane crash in which a child died. Luton Airport published the image of the plane crash with a joke boasting about its own safety record. ‘Because we are such a super airport....this is what we prevent you from when it snows......Weeeee :),’ the Facebook status accompanying the photo read. The picture showed a crash that killed a . six-year-old boy in Chicago after a Boeing 737 slid off the end of the . runway in heavy snow and hit the car he was travelling in. Upset: Luton Airport has said sorry over this post on its Facebook page of a 2005 crash in Chicago that claimed the life of a six-year-old boy, Joshua Woods . Shocking: The Boeing 737 crash eight years ago was huge news but the 'over-enthusiastic' worker at Luton had little idea of its significance . Incident The plane slid off the runway and collided with cars, killing Joshua and injuring nine others . Joshua Woods died and nine others were injured as their vehicles were also smashed into. Three passengers . from the plane were taken to hospital with minor injuries. Tragedy: Six-year-old Joshua Woods was killed when the Boeing 737 slipped off the runway and hit the car he was travelling in . The photo and comment were immediately criticised by sickened Facebook users before the image was removed over an hour later. Yesterday the airport apologised ‘unreservedly’ as it blamed the stunt on an ‘over-enthusiastic’ member of staff. It was posted at 9:15am on Wednesday and removed at 10:30am after an outcry from Facebook users. Kelly Garrett posted: ‘I am pretty appalled that this is your official page and that this is the image and wording that you use. ‘This is so inappropriate and should be removed immediately, it is certainly not something that should be taken so lightly and made fun of.' Another Facebook user, James Clarke, added: ‘Poor form really, as a child died in this incident.’ The image was posted after much of the UK was hit with snow and is thought to have been intended to illustrate how good the airport is at clearing snow from the runway. The picture showed the incident when a Southwest Airlines slid off the runway. The flight from Washington was landing in Chicago in a snowstorm on December 8 2005 when it crashed and hit several cars. The snowstorm had reduced visibility to less than one mile and there was eight inches of snow on the ground in the area. Messages: Dozens took to the page to criticise the message blamed on a over-enthusiastic member of staff . Statement: Airport bosses then took to the site last night to apologise to anyone offended by what happened . A spokesman for Luton Airport yesterday said: ‘London Luton Airport apologises unreservedly for the post on Facebook, which was wholly unacceptable and insensitive. ‘We have Social Media guidelines that clearly outline what is acceptable, however in this instance a new, over-enthusiastic member of our support team made an honest but misguided mistake and clearly stepped over the line. ‘We apologise for any offence caused.

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . This arresting image of a Saudi woman, her bruised eye visible through her burka, is the first ever anti-domestic violence advert in the oppressive kingdom. In what could be a sign of long-awaited progress for the female population of Saudi Arabia - where all women must have a male guardian - the No More Abuse campaign is intended to encourage victims to report domestic violence. The advert shows the female victim, who is clad in a burka that masks all but her eyes, gazing into the camera above the message: 'Some things can't be covered'. Progress: The first ever anti-domestic violence campaign in Saudi Arabia features a picture of a Saudi woman, her black eye clearly visible through her burka . Beneath the caption are the words: 'Fighting women's abuse together'. Women in the conservative Islamic kingdom are prohibited from voting and from driving, and are kept largely segregated from men in public places. Oppressive: All woman in Saudi Arabia must have a male guardian, typically their father or husband . The advert is the work of the King Khalid Foundation, a charity established by the family of the late monarch, who ruled from 1975 until his death in 1982. A translation of a statement on the foundation's website reads: 'The phenomenon of battered women in Saudi Arabia is much greater than is apparent on the surface... is a phenomenon found in the dark.' It described a 'comprehensive system to deal with violence and abuse of family in order to provide legal protection for women and children from abuse in Saudi Arabia.' Domestic violence is believed to be endemic in parts of Saudi Arabia, where women - regardless of age - live under the control of a male relative who acts as their guardian. They require the permission of their guardian for everything from opening a bank account to accepting a marriage proposal. The patriarchal system means many instances of abuse go unreported. Earlier this month a report in a Saudi newspaper said the kingdom's religious police had lifted a ban preventing women from riding bikes and motorcycles in public places. It said women would be allowed to ride bicycles and motorbikes in parks and recreational areas, provided they were accompanied by a male relative and dressed in the full Islamic head-to-toe abaya. Saudi Arabia’s strict interpretation of Islam means women must cover their entire body with a black cloak known as an abaya and headcovering, or hijab, leaving just the eyes and the hands exposed.Conventions for dress and behaviour are all fiercely enforced by the notorious religious police, or mutaween, whose official title is the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice. In 2009, the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap report ranked Saudi Arabia 130th out of 134 countries for gender parity.","Striking image of Saudi abuse victim is first of its kind in Islamic kingdom .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Busted: Lewis Ward was arrested for burglary after leaving his footprints in the fresh snow . A bungling burglar led police from the crime scene all the way to his front door with a trail of footprints in the snow. Officers spent an hour and a half following the mile-long trail of Lewis Ward, who had stolen an iPad from a house on the other side of town. The 28-year-old thief sneaked along a string of back alleys and roads to get home – not realising he was leaving clues every step of the way. When police were called to the burgled house in Darlington, County Durham, they noticed the distinctive prints of his trainers leading away from the property. And when they eventually arrived at Ward’s house, they discovered his trainers, still wet, with identical patterns on the soles. Darlington magistrates heard that two police officers arrived at the burgled house in Vine Street at 11.30pm and arrested Ward at his house in Raby Street at 1am. They found the iPad hidden in the bedroom. John Garside, prosecuting, said: ‘He must have realised what he had done as he put the iPad behind the wardrobe and charger under the washing machine.’ Ward pleaded guilty to burglary and was told he could face prison. Jonathan Harley, mitigating, said: ‘This is a completely and utterly baffling offence. Mr Ward is unable to offer any reason as to why he decided to enter the  property and remove an iPad.’ He added: ‘He had been drinking at home alone from around 7pm to 8pm, he had two bottles of wine and had gone out for some air. ‘Mr Ward fully accepts he is in serious trouble.’ Sentencing was adjourned until February 19. Target: Ward burgled a house in Vine Street, pictured, and stole an iPad from it . Home: The thief then walked through the snow back to his own house in Raby Street, pictured . Sergeant Daryl Edmunds of Darlington . police, one of the two officers who tracked Ward down, said: 'It was . good old-fashioned policing. 'It was very difficult at times trying to follow the footprints as sometimes they were mixed in with other people’s prints.' A . spokesman for the force said: 'It was an outstanding police effort.

His son Matt confirmed the death and said his father was 'very loving and will be missed.' Ramone, who lived in Wilton, .

Phil Ramone was a huge figure in the music industry. Pictured with Paul Anka and Anna Yeager . Few producers had a more spectacular and diverse career. With 14 Grammy Awards, he worked with Frank Sinatra and Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney, Elton John and Tony Bennett. Long term colleague and friend Billy Joel said: 'I always thought of Phil Ramone as the most talented guy in my band. He was the guy that no one ever ever saw onstage. 'He was with me as long as any of the musicians I ever played with – longer than most. So much of my music was shaped by him and brought to fruition by him. I have lost a dear friend – and my greatest mentor. The music world lost a giant today.' Ramone joined Joel for what became one of his biggest successes, 'The Stranger,' released in 1977. Ramone (left) collaborated with the biggest stars of the last 50 years; Billy Joel (right) described him as a long time friend and collaborator . As Joel . explained at the time, Ramone fit right in with the musicians and . encouraged everyone to relax. 'We did songs in five takes instead . of 15 or 20,' Joel said. 'He was one of the guys. We'd throw around . ideas, kick the songs around, try them different ways and get them . right. Sometimes we'd throw pizza at each other.' Ramone produced three records that went on to win Grammys for album of the year with Paul Simon's 'Still Crazy After All These Years,"" Joel's '52nd Street' and ray Charles' 'Genius Loves Company.' He was a pioneer of digital recording who produced what is regarded as the first major commercial release on compact disc, '52nd Street,' which came out on CD in 1982. He thrived producing music for . television, film and the stage. He won an Emmy for a TV special about . Duke Ellington, a Grammy for the soundtrack to the Broadway musical . 'Promises, Promises' and a Grammy for the soundtrack to 'Flashdance.' Ramone . made an art out of the 'Duets' concept, pairing Sinatra with Bono, . Luther Vandross and other younger artists, Bennett with McCartney and . Barbra Streisand, and Charles with Bonnie Raitt and Van Morrison. In . Ramone's memoir, 'Making Records,' he recalled persuading a hesitant . Sinatra to re-record some of his signature songs. Mr Ramone had a hugely successful career, pictured here with musicians Joan Jett and Desmond Child in 2008 . Tony Bennett: albums in 2005 'The Art of Romance,' in 2006 ""Duets: An American Classic,' in 2011 'Duets II' Ray Charles: his final album, 2004's 'Genius Loves Company' Chicago: the 1978 album 'Hot Streets' Bob Dylan: the 1975 album ""Blood on the Tracks"" Stan Getz and Joao Gilberto: the 1964 album 'Getz/Gilberto' Billy Joel: his 1977 breakthrough album 'The Stranger' and six later albums, including 'Just the Way You Are' Quincy Jones: on the 1969 album 'Smackwater Jack' Paul Simon: the 1975 album 'Still Crazy After All These Years' Frank Sinatra: the 1993 album 'Duets' Barbra Streisand: the 1967 live album 'A Happening in Central Park,' and the 1976 song 'Evergreen' (Love Theme from 'A Star Is Born') He was also responsible for recording . Marilyn Monroe's now infamous performance of Happy Birthday Mr President . to John F. Kennedy in 1962. Ramone told Sound on Sound magazine . in 2005: 'I served a long time as an engineer and watched many famous . producers work, and I decided on the personality that came most easily . to me, which is the more relaxed; to give artists encouragement when . needed. 'Players are like prodigies, thoroughbreds,"" he added. ""You have to handle them with care.' Ramone wrote: 'I reminded Frank that while Laurence Olivier had performed Shakespeare in his 20s, the readings he did when he was in his 60s gave them new meaning,'I spoke with conviction. ""Don't my children - and your grandchildren - deserve to hear the way you're interpreting your classic songs now?""' A native of South Africa, he seemed born to make music. He had learned violin by age 3 and was trained at The Julliard School in New York. Before age 20, he had opened his own recording studio. At the age of 10 he performed violin in front of Queen Elizabeth II. The father-of-three is survived by wife Karen and sons Matt, BJ and Simon. Ramone's many industry honors were returned in kind. He was chairman emeritus of the board of trustees of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS). He was an advocate for music education and a trustee for the National Recording Preservation Board of the Library of Congress. His recent recordings included albums with Bennett, Simon, George Michael and Dionne Warwick. 'I still make records on the basis that three or four players and a singer, and the song, come together right there,"" he said recently for an interview on CBS.com. 'It's a really strong way to work. I'm ready to work, musicians are ready to play. There's a feeling.'

"By . Martin Robinson . Murdered soldier Lee Rigby will 'burn in hellfire' and those who killed him should be considered martyrs, hate preacher Anjem Choudary has said in another poisonous rant on film. The extremist maintains that despite being executed in barbaric circumstances the 25-year-old father of one deserves no sympathy because he is a 'non-Muslim' and called one suspect a 'nice man'. It is yet another vile outburst by Choudary, who insists on using Drummer Rigby's murder to stir up hatred, but police will still not arrest him. He has persistently refused to condemn the murder in Woolwich almost a fortnight ago and blames 'war monger' David Cameron for radicalising young British Muslims to the extent they carry out acts of terror. Rally: Michael Adebolajo (circled) pictured at a demonstration in Paddington Green, London, in 2007 with Anjem Choudary . Message: The Hate Preacher said that suspect Michael Adebolajo (left) was a 'nice man'. Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale (right) have been charged with Lee Rigby's murder . Tragic: Drummer Lee Rigby died in the street as he walked back to his barracks in Woolwich, but Choudary says the Koran teaches that there should be no sympathy for non-Muslims . A video uncovered by The Sun, shows the preacher, who claims £25,000 a year in benefits, saying that the people who murdered Drummer Rigby will go to 'Paradise'. Two men have been charged with the murder and Choudary knew at least one of them, and today called one of the suspects, Michael Adebolajo, 28, a 'nice man'. Message: 'I think you need to blame the people who are inciting and who are radicalising these youths, which is really the British government,' Anjem Choudary said . Filmed in an office near his mosque in north-east London, he would not denounce the soldier's death. 'So as an adult non-Muslim, whether he is part of the Army or not part of the Army, if he dies in a state of disbelief then he is going to go to the hellfire. That’s what I believe so I’m not going to feel sorry for non-Muslims.' Choudary went on that the British Government is to blame for Drummer Rigby's death, which is a 'drop in the ocean'. 'I think you need to blame the people who are inciting and who are radicalising these youths, which is really the British government. 'You need to take into account the hundreds of thousands of incidents of people slaughtered, of weddings bombed, of Muslims tortured, of innocent people kept in prison for over ten years.' He also attacked the charity Help for . Heroes, which helps care for injured British soldiers, saying they . cannot be heroes because they 'shoot children in Afghanistan'. Later extremist Choudary insisted he had not 'said anything incendiary' and claims he does not fear being arrested. 'It was an hour long interview, and a couple of clips have been taken out of context,' he said. 'All I was saying is I don't believe he (Lee) will go to paradise. It is not a hate crime. I was not inciting anyone, or doing anything illegal. 'Most religions around the world are based on the same thing, if you do not believe you will go to hell. 'What is a hate crime, anyway? I don't think there is such a law. You cannot arrest someone for what they think.' Yesterday the two men accused of killing Drummer Rigby made separate appearances in court charged with his murder and other offences. Michael Adebolajo, 28, of Romford, Essex, appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court, and raised his arm into a Usain Bolt pose, and kissed a copy of the Koran with his eyes closed. In an animated hearing he also stooped in the dock with a large bandage on his left arm, refused to stand and the 28-year-old also demanded to be called ‘Abu Hamza’. Meanwhile Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, south-east London, appeared at the Old Bailey via video link.

"Leslie Ammah shot his victim when he was stopped from chatting girls up . A bookmaker who shot a teenager in the stomach when he stopped him flirting with a group of young women was jailed for 12 years today. Leslie Ammah, 23, flew into a rage when Ashley Toppin-Hector, 19, thwarted his efforts of chatting up fellow clubbers at a south London bar. During the confrontation he pulled out a handgun and fired a single round at his victim's stomach. Mr Toppin-Hector escaped serious injury after the weapon misfired and the bullet barely penetrated the skin and did not cause any internal injury. Ammah, who was working as a William Hill cashier, was later identified thanks to his distinctive gold tooth and blue stripey top. After an Old Bailey retrial he was cleared of attempted murder but convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. Jailing him for 12 years, Judge Christopher Moss QC said: 'You have been found guilty of the sort of gangster-like criminal conduct that blights the streets of so many of our cities. 'It is people like you who make those streets so dangerous for law-abiding young people, often late at night. 'Young men like you should understand that if they carry a gun they are going to receive lengthy sentences. 'If they actually use that gun, the punishment is going to be more severe.' Ammah had tried to befriend the group, who spurned his advances, and he became angry. Mr Toppin-Hector and his group, who were leaving the South Beach bar in Brixton Hill at around 3.30am on September 3, 2011,  did their best to steer them away after two girls approached him and asked for a lift. The judge at the Old Bailey court said 'gangster-like criminal conduct blights the streets of so many of our cities' A group of up to eight men then approached the car and started a fight. Prosecutor Paul Raudnitz said: 'They were accusing Mr Toppin-Hector and his friends of ""c***-blocking"", meaning preventing these boys from getting at the girls. 'A member of this larger group tried to grab Mr Toppin-Hector by the shoulder as the girls were getting into the car. 'Another male tried to hit Mr Toppin-Hector. There was an exchange of blows. 'One of the males had a small revolver in his hand and pointed that at Mr Toppin-Hector.' The gunman fired the weapon and his group then ran off and fled in Ammah's Audi TT. Mr Toppin-Hector was taken to hospital to have the .32 calibre bullet extracted from under the skin of his abdomen. He was discharged the following day. Witnesses described the gunman as a 'dark-skinned black male, medium build, medium height, wearing a blue striped top'. Mr Raudnitz said: 'He also had a gold tooth in the front of his mouth. It is the case for the Crown that this description fits the description of Leslie Ammah.' Jonathan Akinsanya, defending, said that prior to his arrest Ammah had been working as a football coach for the Sports Fusion charity. The gunman, of Stockwell, south London, denied grievous bodily harm but was convicted on these charges. He was cleared of a more serious charge of attempted murder.","Leslie Ammah, 23, shot Ashley Toppin-Hector, 19, when the teenager stopped him from chatting up a group of women .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Controversial security firm G4S has enjoyed a 20 per cent surge in government contracts despite a string of blunders, new figures show. The company - which failed to recruit enough guards for the London Olympics - earned £394million from the taxpayer in 2012-13, up from £328.5million a year earlier. The revelation sparked claims it was becoming the 'private army' of the state. Security: The controversial firm G4S has seen a 20 per cent increase in its income from the UK government, raising fears of an over-reliance on a 'private army' With just weeks before the London . Olympics opened in July last year, G4S admitted it would not be able to . provide the thousands of guards it had promised. Its reputation was severely damaged when 3,500 troops were called in to provide security at the biggest events. In the wake of the debacle MPs called on the government to think again before awarding more lucrative contracts to the firm. But it seems to have done little to dent its reputation in Whitehall, and next week it will provide security guarding . the world’s most powerful men and women at the G8 summit at . Lough Erne. Labour MP Barry Sheerman, who obtained the figures on government spending with G4S, said he was worried about an increasing over-reliance on a small number of companies. He warned: ‘The trouble is a lot of contractors are in a monopoly. They do seem to be swelling up and getting bigger and bigger and we are getting to the stage where the over-reliance on one company troubles you. ‘I am becoming increasingly worried about the monopoly position that G4S have in security services. ‘They are becoming the private army of Her Majesty's Government. There is something going on that I think we need to shine a spotlight on.’ Blunder: The army had to be called in for the London Olympics after G4S failed to recruit enough guards last summer . Nick Buckles, who last month quit as G4S chief executive, admitted the Olympic security contract had been a 'humiliating shambles' for the company but Labour MP Barry Sheerman (right), who obtained the figures, warned of a few firms having a monopoly on state contracts . Most of the hike in Government . spending on G4S contracts was down to an extra £51 million spent by the . Ministry of Justice on contracts with the company. A . spokesman for the department said the increase was down to G4S being . given contracts to run prisons at Birmingham and Oakwood, as well as . managing the facilities of a large part of Her Majesty's Courts and . Tribunal Service. The . Department for Work and Pensions more than doubled its spend on G4S . contracts - up from nearly £13.8 million to more than £32.1 million. The UK-based security firm traces its roots back to a guarding company founded in Denmark in 1901. G4S was formed when Group 4 merged with Securicor in 2004. The company has a long record of blunders including: . In 1993 Group 4 became the first private company to run prisoner escort services,m and lost seven inmates in three weeks . A year later a hunger striker escaped from Campsfield House detention centre, guarded by Group 4 . In 1997 it emerged the firm had transferred a prisoner between two vans on a petrol station forecourt . Three prisoners escaped from Peterborough Crown Court in 2001 . In . 2011, G4S staff lost a set of cell keys just days after taking over . Birmingham Prison Workers put an electronic tag on criminal Christopher . Lowcock's artificial limb . In 2012 the firm failed to train enough guards for the London Games which meant 3,500 soldiers had to be recalled from leave . In March this year a G4S guard at Heathrow ordered Royal Navy engineer Nicky Howse to change out . of her uniform before flying to the US because it was 'offensive' A contract awarded to G4S for the Government's Work Programme accounted for the increase, Employment Minister Mark Hoban said in his answer to Mr Sheerman's question. The figures do not include spending by the Department for Communities and Local Government which has not yet answered the MP's question. Mr Sheerman said it was ‘amazing’ that so much was being spent on G4S when it was failing to pay Olympic subcontractors that were ‘not complicit in the debacle’ of the company's handling of security at London 2012. ‘I thought it was amazing that such an amount is being spent on one major contractor, also at a time when we still know that G4S have failed to pay subcontractors who have worked for them on the Olympic site,’ Mr Sheerman said. He said some small and medium-sized businesses who worked on the Olympic site were made to subcontract to G4S by Locog, but now have not been paid. ‘I don't know why they haven't paid them, it is just bad principles,’ he said. ‘They were told at one stage in the development they were running the logistics and security of the athlete's village. ‘Once that was finished they became subcontractors and told to be subcontractors to G4S. ‘One would have thought Locog would have leaned on G4S to do the honourable thing to the subcontractors. ‘They were not complicit in the debacle that occurred when the army came in.’ Kim Challis, G4S CEO of government and outsourcing solutions, said: 'We have been working with the UK government for more than two decades, delivering the highest levels of service and under a high degree of monitoring and oversight. 'We have won every contract we have been awarded by bidding in a highly competitive environment, based on delivering an effective service for the best deal for the taxpayer, with a number of providers challenging for the work. 'We have a strong track record of delivering for our UK Government customers and are proud of the service our 11,000 employees provide to them, and the general public, every single day.' Former G4S company boss Nick Buckles, who admitted the London . 2012 contract had been a ‘humiliating shambles, last month quit his £1.2million-a-year role as chief executive. He . clung on to his job in the immediate aftermath of the Olympics debacle . but the firm’s reputation suffered badly and in recent weeks poor . trading caused shares to slump by more than 13 per cent in one day. This . month, G4S's AGM was interrupted by protesters making reference to . Jimmy Mubenga - an Angolan man who died while being deported from the UK . by G4S guards. In July last year, prosecutors said they would be taking no action against the three G4S staff over the death.","Controversial firm saw income from UK taxpayer rise by 20% last year .

"By . Ryan Gorman . A plague-infected squirrel has forced the closure of numerous Los Angeles campgrounds. Routine testing of a squirrel trapped July 16 revealed this week that it had fleas carrying the bubonic plague, forcing the closure of a handful of campgrounds in Los Angeles, according to officials. Known as the Black Death, the disease killed millions across Europe during the Middle Ages. This is the third such case in the past six years. Of the four reported cases in Los Angeles since 1984, none have been fatal after being treated with antibiotics. Scroll down for video . Lethal: A squirrel in Angeles National Forest has tested positive for the plague . Officials have closed Broken Blade, Twisted Arrow, and Pima Loops of the Table Mountain Campgrounds in the Angeles National Forest for at least seven days while flea control measures are enacted, according to a public notice. Further testing of squirrels will be done before the campgrounds are reopened. ‘We found [a squirrel] that had plague, the blood showed exposure to plague and it had something like 12 fleas on it,’ Dr. Jonathan Fielding, Los Angeles County Director of Public Health and Health Officer, told NBC Los Angeles. DANGER: Signs have been posted warning campers of the threat of plague infection . Plague is somewhat common among the ground squirrel population in the surrounding San Gabriel Mountains, according to health officials, with previous positive tests having happened in 2010 and 2007, as well as 1996 and 1995. ‘We want to advise everybody to make sure they don’t bring their pets, and, if possible – I know it’s important for the kids to be able to go camping – but to be sure to bring the proper insect repellent,’ Joe Kelso told the station. Bubonic plague is transferred to humans through bites from infected fleas, with symtoms including enlarged lymph glands near the flea bites accompanied almost immediately by fever and chills. Untreated, the plague can infect the blood and even the lungs, sometimes resulting in pneumonic plague. This is usually remedied with a round of antibiotic treatment, officials said. Take precaution: Campers have been advised to leave the affected areas and to use bug repellant containing DEET in order park areas . If it gets through the blood stream and winds up [in] your respiratory tract… that’s the kind we had in the fifteenth century,’ Fielding told the station. Officials also recommend using insect repellents to ward off fleas, especially repellents containing DEET – which are not safe for pets. The bubonic plague has been blamed for the deaths of as many as 100 million people during the 1300s. Though plague outbreaks aren't as common in recent times, a Chinese man from Sichuan Province died in 2012 from the disease after eating a dead marmot. Cases of the once-deadly infection number in the single digits annually in the US and are confined to the western half of the country.","This is the third positive test in the area since 2007 .

"By . Ian Drury . Britain is the first choice for young Romanians who want to work abroad – sparking concerns that hundreds of thousands could flock here when border controls  are scrapped. Research has revealed a quarter of the population aged between 18 and 35 would choose a job in the UK when work restrictions for Romanians and Bulgarians are removed on January 1. The study found that Britain had overtaken Germany as the most  popular destination for young Romanians wanting to emigrate. Britain is the first choice for young Romanians, pictured at a camp in Marble Arch, who want to work abroad and it has sparked concerns that hundreds of thousands could flock here when border controls are scrapped . A Romanian think-tank suggests that 720,000 people could head to the UK when restrictions are lifted . The findings challenge a bid by . ministers to play down the prospect of another influx from Eastern . Europe when the immigrants are given free access to the UK jobs market. The Government has made no attempt to estimate the number of Romanians . and Bulgarians who will arrive here, but David Cameron insists there . will be ‘nothing like’ the huge numbers seen when Poland joined the EU . in 2004 – put at 1.1million. However, a poll by the Romanian think-tank Ires suggests that as many as . 720,000 people could head to the UK when restrictions on employment are . lifted. Some 26 per cent of those who said they would be ‘very interested’ in working abroad named Britain as their first choice. In total, the study found that 11 per cent of adults expressed an . interest in finding a job here. The figure rose to 24 per cent for those . aged 18 to 35. The report was handed to MPs on the Commons home affairs select . committee while they visited the Romanian capital Bucharest. David Cameron, left, insists there will not be huge numbers seen when Poland joined the EU.  But Tory MPJames Clappison, right, said it will 'add to pressure on housing and infrastructure', especially in South East . Swiss voters have overwhelmingly backed plans to restrict the number of people coming to live in the country. Almost 80 per cent of voters approved the proposals, which gives the government greater control over housing immigrants. It also stops asylum requests at Swiss embassies around the world and scraps providing sanctuary to conscientious objectors who are facing military service. Celine Amandruz, of the Right-wing Swiss People’s Party, said the result proved there was ‘a need to change this system’. Last month, Switzerland also placed a limit on the number of EU citizens – including Britons – who can work in the country. James . Clappison, a Tory MP on the committee, said: ‘There is no doubt that if . they came, the young Romanians will be hard-working, talented and, in . the main, self-sufficient – but they would add to pressure on housing . and infrastructure, especially in the South-East. ‘It is impossible to predict with certainty but you have to plan on the . basis of what might happen and there is evidence that this migration . could happen.’ Sir Andrew Green, chairman of immigration think-tank MigrationWatch UK, . said: ‘This is part of growing evidence of quite large numbers of . Romanians and Bulgarians considering migrating to Britain to work. ‘The Government must impose a delay before granting access to our . welfare system so they don’t have that extra incentive to come here.’ MigrationWatch UK estimated up to 75,000 migrants a year could arrive.","Britain has overtaken Germany as most popular destination to emigrate to .

"By . Rachel Quigley . and Helen Pow . Updated: . 21:14 EST, 10 April 2013 . A Phoenix, Arizona baby who contracted cancer from her mother while still in the womb has stunned doctors as she prepares to celebrate her second birthday. Doctors said Addison Cox, who caught her mother Briana's deadly melanoma, would live little more than a year after they found tumors had spread throughout her small body when she was just two months old. But she has defied the prognosis and while her mother won't be around to sing her happy birthday, Addison's doting father James will ensure the little girl is adequately spoiled. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Survivor: Doctors said Addison Cox, pictured, who caught her mother Briana's deadly melanoma, would live little more than a year after they found tumors had spread throughout her small body when she was just two months old . Ms Cox died in February 2012 at just 33 of a melanoma that developed while she was pregnant with Addison. Somehow, in a rare medical occurrence, the woman's cancer cells crossed the placenta to her unborn child during the pregnancy and in June 2011 her baby was diagnosed with the same stage four cancer that would soon take her life. '(Addison's) original diagnosis was 12 to 18 months,' Mr Cox, told ABCNews.com. 'She's basically doubled her life expectancy already.' He added: 'She turns two in May. It'll be a big party.' The cancer has affected Addison's brain, shoulder, lungs, kidney, liver, leg, and even the back of her tongue, according to ABC. Daddy's girl: Addison, left, has defied her prognosis and while her mother won't be around to sing her happy birthday, Addison's doting father, James Cox, right, will ensure the little girl is adequately spoiled . Rare: Ms Cox died in February 2012 of a melanoma that she passed on to Addison during her pregnancy . She has undergone chemotherapy, . radiation and two brain surgeries at Phoenix Children's Hospital, which . is hosting a telethon to benefit the family and others like them. A fundraiser by the police department where Ms Cox worked has also helped the family deal with their financial needs. 'Most has been covered by medical insurance, but it's the cost of day-to-day life that really hammers us,' said Mr Cox. Mr Cox, 37, who has three other children, said his mother has been living with the family to help out for the past two years. He said he was thrilled his little girl was still fighting. 'We sure are pleased. Basically our family has gotten so much support from each other and friends. ... The local church took us under their wing and my co-workers have been so kind to all of us,' he said. Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. Shock diagnosis: Briana Cox had no idea she - or her baby Addison - had cancer until two months after the birth when she had a seizure and was diagnosed, as was her daughter . Strong: Ms Cox, a police officer, was diagnosed with cancer in 2006 and thought it was gone after routine checkups which did not detect it had returned . Addison is able to understanding speech and can say a few words, her father told ABC. 'That gives you a lot to look forward to and know she's still doing this well, it just kind of keeps you going,' he said. Doctors had initially assured the Cox family that two-month-old Addison was healthy after Ms Cox was diagnosed with advanced cancer following a seizure in June 2011. Although they suspected it for years, up until  October 2009, scientists did not know for sure whether or not cancer could be passed from mother to baby during pregnancy. It was previously thought that if the cells did cross the placental barrier, the child's immune system should have recognized them as foreign invaders and destroyed them. But a team at the Institute of Cancer Research, a college of the University of London, working with colleagues in Japan, found that cancer cells had defied accepted theories of biology and were able to pass undetected through the placenta because they became invisible to the immune system. It usually happens when the mother carries a mutated cancer gene, which is a rare occurrence. Addison's case is only the ninth published and before 2009 there were only been 17 suspected cases. Professor Mel Greaves, who led the study, said: 'It appears that in this and, we presume, other cases of mother-to-offspring cancer, the maternal cancer cells did cross the placenta into the developing fetus and succeeded in implanting because they were invisible to the immune system. 'But we stress … the chances of any pregnant woman with cancer passing it on to her child are remote.' But . the mother - whose own body was riddled with cancer - insisted on . having Addison tested, and an examination revealed the baby had the same . cancer as her mother. It had also spread throughout the baby's body. Addison was born with stage four . melanoma, passed from her mother while in utero. It is such a . rare medical occurrence, scientists only discovered it was even possible . in 2009. Ms Cox did not know she had cancer . when she was pregnant with her fourth child. First diagnosed with . melanoma in 2006, she had surgery to remove the tumor and was given the . all clear. She then went for routine checkups every three months, then every six and finally once a year. Doctors assured her there were no cancerous cells in her body. But in June 2011, only two months after giving birth to baby Addison, she was told the cancer was back. Her husband James told azfamily.com: 'They found she had metastasized . malignant melanoma and it spread pretty much through her whole body, . shoulder, lungs and brain - the worst of it being in her brain. 'We . asked, ""Why didn't anyone catch this?""' He said, though doctors assured Briana her daughter was fine, she demanded they test her baby and she too was diagnosed. Mr Cox said: 'It's very similar to her mother's - in . the brain, one in her shoulder, in her lungs, kidney, liver, leg, even . the back of her tongue. 'Bri went through the emotions of ""my baby, my fault"", but everyone told her it's not her fault.  No one took . better care of themselves than her.' Ms Cox lost her battle with cancer on February 12, 2012. While Addison is still fighting, her prognosis remains dicey. Doctors say there is no cure. According to Phoenix Children's . Hospital, this is the first case they've ever seen of its kind and . Addison is only the ninth case ever published. It was previously thought that if a . mother did pass cancer through the placenta, the child's immune system . would have detected and destroyed it. Mother's instinct: Though doctors assured Briana Cox, pictured, her baby was fine, she insisted on having her tested and it was discovered she too had stage four melanoma all over her body as well . Family: Ms Cox lost her battle with cancer in February 2012 and left behind her husband and other children . Brave baby: Though she has only been given about two years to live, Addison Cox, pictured after her mother's death, is a happy child and her father said she is a 'fighter, just like her mom' But in 2009, scientists found a mutated gene in both cancers that makes them effectively invisible to the body’s defenses. Professor Mel Greaves, from the . University of London, who led the study, said: 'It appears that in this . and, we presume, other cases of mother-to-offspring cancer, the maternal . cancer cells did cross the placenta into the developing fetus and . succeeded in implanting because they were invisible. ' Mr Cox said of his daughter: 'You would think this is one of the happiest babies on . the face of the earth. She's a fighter . like her mom. She's showed no signs of pain.'","Addison Cox contracted her mother Briana's deadly melanoma in the womb .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Tory election supremo Lynton Crosby today broke his silence of the lobbying scandal which has dogged Number 10 to insist he did not tell David Cameron to ditch high profile health policies. Mr Crosby denied . that he has had 'any conversation or discussion' with the Prime Minister . on the issue of plain packaging of cigarettes. Mr Crosby, whose lobbying firm is reported to have worked . for tobacco giant Philip Morris, said that any suggestion that he had used his . position as an adviser improperly was 'simply false'. Row: The role of lobbyist Lynton Crosby in shaping government policy has led to accusations of a conflict of interest in David Cameron's government . Labour leader Ed Miliband has accused Mr Cameron . of 'bringing big tobacco to the heart of Downing Street' by hiring . the Australian polls guru as an adviser shortly before ditching plans for . standardised cigarette packages. But in a statement issued today by his company CTF . Partners, Mr Crosby said: 'The Prime Minister has repeatedly and clearly . said that I have never lobbied him on anything, including on the issue of . tobacco or plain packaging of cigarettes.' In recent days Mr Cameron has been careful in the wording of his responses to questions about Mr Crosby's influence since becoming a part-time stratgist for the Tory party. At the weekend the PM refused to say whether he had spoken to his election strategist about the issue – simply that Mr Crosby ‘has not intervened... that’s the answer you’re getting’. Vote: European Parliament will vote tomorrow on legislation that could see larger health warnings placed on cigarette packets, similar to standardised packaging in Australia, pictured . Delay: Laws passed in Australia mean cigarette . packets like these show no branding and the shocking effects of smoking, . but the UK government will not follow suit . But in his statement Mr Crosby went further. He said: 'What the PM said should be enough for any ordinary . person but to avoid any doubt or speculation let me be clear. 'At no time have I . had any conversation or discussion with or lobbied the Prime Minister, or . indeed the Health Secretary or the health minister, on plain packaging or . tobacco issues. 'Indeed, any claim that I have sought to improperly . use my position as part-time campaign adviser to the Conservative Party is . simply false.' Cancer charities and MPs today condemned the government for shelving plans to firms to sell cigarettes in plain packets. Ministers were accused of putting jobs in the tobacco industry ahead of saving lives. Dr Sarah Wollaston, a Tory MP and former GP, condemned the decision as a 'tragic waste of an opportunity'. She claimed there would be 'more lives ruined for political expediency'. Writing on Twitter, Dr Wollaston added: 'R.I.P public health.

The U.S. Secret Service played a key role in the investigation of free-information activist and Reddit founder Aaron Swartz and watched his case closely until he committed suicide, according to newly-released government documents. Swartz, 26, hanged himself in his Brooklyn apartment in January as he faced trial on charges he hacked into a Massachusetts Institute of Technology archive of scholarly articles with the aim of making the information freely available.

Swartz was present for at least one search of his Cambridge home, according to a February 2011 document that reads: 'While the search was conducted, Swartz made statements to the effect of, what took you so long, and why didn't you do this earlier?' Agents also joined local police who interviewed Swartz's associates, including a San Francisco woman who told them that he called her and asked her to call his lawyer to arrange bail. The Secret Service documents were obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Wired. Only the first 104 pages of the agency's 14,500-page file on Swartz have been released. The Secret Service plans to release the rest of the documents on a rolling basis after being ordered by a U.S. District Court judge last month to fulfill Wired's information request.

In Sonic's home state, the company has done deals with both Oklahoma University and Oklahoma State University. Both universities share a cheeseburger called the ‘Sooner and Cowboy Burger’ which is topped with hardwood smoked brisket, hickory barbecue sauce and American cheese.

The college football stamps will add upwards of a dime to the price of each burger because Sonic has to pay both licensing and royalty fees to the universities. The burgers will retail between $3.99 - $4.99 at Sonics local to the teams featured. Consumers who don't like food coloring can request the burgers without the logos - but will still have to pay the same price. The concept was tested just in Louisiana last year and proved a hit with customers.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Europe's biggest engineering firm is to slash 15,000 jobs in a £5billion cost-cutting drive. Germany-based Siemens will shed the jobs over the next year, a third of them in Germany and the rest abroad, in a move that will save about 6billion euros. The cull represents about 4 per cent of its 370,000-strong workforce but it says it is aiming to avoid compulsory redundancies, according to a spokesman. The company employs 13,000 in Britain. Cost-cutters: German firm Siemens is slashing 15,000 jobs as it looks to save 6billion euros and move closer to US rivals . The announcement comes two months after the ousting of Chief Executive Peter Loescher, who drew up the savings plan late last year. Europe’s biggest engineering firm, whose products range from hearing aids to gas turbines, is anxious to close the gap with more profitable rivals such as U.S.-based General Electric Co and Switzerland’s ABB. Re-elected Angela Merkel visited the firm's headquarters last year . Siemens and its unions have reached an agreement over about half of the job cuts and a deal on the other half will follow, the spokesman said. He added that Siemens wanted to end speculation in the market about the number of jobs that are about to be cut. No workers have been laid off so far and Siemens has said it does not intend to make enforced redundancies, relying in stead on attrition and voluntary severance deals. In Germany, about 2,000 jobs will be cut at the company’s industrial unit and another 1,400 at its energy and infrastructure business, the spokesman said. Siemens expects to close the current fiscal year on Monday with around 370,000 workers, the same as last year. The announcement comes just days after warnings the eurozone economy will not grow this year and that the region remains ‘a considerable source of risk’ to the rest of the world. Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, told a conference in Lisbon that growth will not return until 2014. He also warned that it will take years to tackle record high unemployment across the region. German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said there would be no change in tack in Berlin’s handling of the crisis following the re-election of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Alikely ‘grand coalition’ with her centre-left rivals raised hopes in some European capitals that Germany will be less focused on austerity to overcome the single currency bloc’s debt crisis. But Schaeuble said: ‘We have held our ground in our euro policies. Countries with solid financial figures have the better and more sustainable economic development.’",Company says the move will allow it compete with US and European rivals .
"By . Ryan Gorman . Walter White is using someone else’s recipe for methamphetamine. ‘Breaking Bad,’ the show about a high school chemistry teacher who cooks meth to support his family after learning he has cancer, owes University of Oklahoma chemistry professor Donna Nelson’s formula to its success. As the show’s science advisor, Ms Nelson keeps a stern eye over the show’s drug and bomb making.Ms Nelson jumped at the opportunity to join the show because she saw it as a platform for putting accurate, interesting science in front of a young audience, she told KOCO. Recipe for success: Donna Nelson, chemistry professor at the University of Oklahoma, is the show's science adviser . ‘We scientists knew this was a problem because enrollment (in science classes) had been dropping and so I thought this is a wonderful opportunity,’ she told the station. She also cleared the air regarding how much drugs she has cooked, for posterity’s sake, of course.‘I have to say I have never made methamphetamine,’ said Nelson. The professor first contacted show creator Vince Gilligan after reading a profile of him in Chemical & Engineering News, she told Vulture. Calling it an opportunity to build a bridge, she told the site she ‘knew how much the chemistry community wanted to see correct science in movies and television, and that they also wanted to see scientists presented appropriately.’ Mr Gilligan immediately took her up on the offer. In addition to seeing that Mr White cooks great meth, Ms Nelson also makes sure the protagonist walks the walk and talks the talk. Mr White needs to also talk like a PhD, he does because of her.His lectures in class, his rants to partner Jessie Pinkman and his chats with his son, they’re authentic because Ms Nelson supervises their scripting, she told the station. Not his recipe: Walter White (left) and Jessie Pinkman (right) use Ms Nelson's expertise when it comes to their organic chemistry . Noting a lecture Mr White gave to a class, Ms Nelson said she had to rewrite the entire thing. The memo she sent them was then made the script, they even used her diagrams. As for Mr White’s meth? The process is real, she told Vulture, but with one caveat. ‘It’s a valid synthesis, the way they’re using methylamine,’ she said, adding that the Drug Enforcement Agency actually has a hand in overseeing the cooking. ‘What they are doing is leaving out steps. Or sometimes they show some steps from one synthesis and subsequent steps from another synthesis, which prevents Breaking Bad from becoming an illegal meth cookbook,’ she added. Too blue: Ms Nelson says the meth is too blue to be real, but that artistic license took over so Mr White could have a trademark . She has had to allow for a bit of creative license when it comes to the show’s main product, blue meth. Ms Nelson initially told producer Gilligan that the ‘blue was a little too blue,’ but he ‘wanted Walt to have a trademark,’ she said to Vulture. ‘So, it’s a little exaggerated. That’s OK. It’s not supposed to be 100 per cent factual.’","University of Oklahoma chemistry professor Donna Nelson is an adviser to the hit show .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . Discovery: A study of letters written by Charles Darwin reveal the theorist's attitudes towards women changed over his lifetime . He once wrote that a future wife would be an 'object to be loved and played with - better than a dog anyhow.' But researchers studying letters written by  evolutionary theorist Charles Darwin have discovered that his attitudes towards women later changed. Philippa Hardman, a research associate at Cambridge University, found that Darwin went out of his way to back women's scientific work and often wrote to campaigners for women's rights. Dr Hardman told The Times: 'Darwin was no feminist. 'But our research has shown that his views on gender were a lot more complex than has been acknowledged. 'As a published scientist, Darwin usually reflected and reinforced middle-class, Victorian gender ideology, which saw women as domestic creatures who should look after children and the home. 'In his letters, though, we encounter a world of private thoughts and actions, which defied those ideals.' Early letters written by Darwin would certainly raise eyebrows in modern day society. When contemplating whether to marry in 1838, Darwin noted that one advantage to doing so was that a wife would be an 'object to be loved & played with — better than a dog anyhow'. Later in his famous work The Descent of Man, published in 1871, the scientist attacked John Stuart Mill's discourse in The Subjection of Women by writing: 'Woman seems to differ from man in her mental disposition, chiefly in her greater tenderness and less selfishness.' However, only one year later, he wrote to naturalist Mary Treat urging her to make sure her work on butterflies was taken seriously in the science world. In one letter, he advised her to get the work published 'in some well known scientific Journal'. Dr Hardman's, whose work is called the Darwin Correspondence Project, also told the newspaper that Darwin's archive includes supportive letters to women who campaigned for gender equality. Change of attitude: Darwin's wife Emma, portrait above left, who he compared to a dog, and equal rights campaigner Florence Dixie, right, who received letters from the scientist . Darwin held correspondence with women who went beyond traditional gender roles, writing warmly to Florence Dixie, a traveller, writer and hunter who called for votes for women. She also published a  novel - categorised as 'fantasy' at the time, in which men and women lived as equals. Another of Darwin's exchanges is a letter to Lydia Becker, secretary of the National Society of Women's Suffrage. In the correspondence, Darwin makes clear that he did not endorse her views. However, he did send her scientific papers that were discussed at the Manchester Ladies' Literary Society - a forum to discuss science for women. Dr Hardman said that Darwin may have kept his real views on gender quiet because he felt his work was controversial enough.","In 1838, Darwin said a future wife would be an 'object to be loved & played .

"By . Ryan Gorman . Al-Qaeda is now on Twitter. Under the guise of its Shamukh al-Islam website, the official website of the terror organization, the terror group has now fired up its own Twitter feed, possibly in response to the effectiveness of terrorists live-tweeting the Kenya mall attack. Having already issued 29 tweets ranging in topics from death tallies to religious proclamations, @shomokhalislam has almost 1,800 followers as of early Saturday morning. The account’s opening signals a shift in the terror organization’s outreach, propaganda and basic communications efforts, according to experts. Terrifying: al-Qaeda has started its own Twitter account . ‘We’ve seen terrorist groups make increasingly effective use of social media, particularly Twitter and Facebook, in recent years,’ Patrick Poole, a counterterrorism expert, told the Washington Times. ‘Not only is this important for propaganda purposes but also recruitment.’ The Twitter account is not locked or kept private, and its followers appear mostly to be journalists and curious gawkers. The website is closed to the public. Some of the postings, translated to English, are accounts of operations. Others are religious decrees and links to statements on the Shamukh al-Islam website and YouTube videos. 'Dear Brothers, the Mujahideen today are going through a period of great scrutiny and trial Be them good Nassara, and certain after God,’ read one tweet. Potential recruiting tool: New recruits belonging to Somalia's al-Qaeda-linked al Shabaab rebel group march during a passing out parade . 'Peshawar from New burn under the feet of the servants of worshipers of the cross, the explosive device was detonated now targeting Bus least the staff of the Ministry of Interior of Pakistan in Peshawar,' read another, before giving a death toll of 17, with 35 injured in the attack. 'The attack killed more than 17 people dead and inflicted 35 wounded in the initial toll expected to rise .. Source Brother Fadil Abu Maaz Kouhati,' said the most recent tweet sent from the account. Though likely subject to intense intelligence community scrutiny, the account may seek to spread a more general message. Despite well-known power struggles among different al-Qaeda factions, the Twitter account's administrator has pledged to remain neutral and focus on spreading the terror group's message, according to the Times. Spreading the word: An Al Qaeda Fighter shows his AK-47 machine gun with Arabic language professing allegiance to 'al-Qaeda' organization . 'We’ve also seen divisions within these groups played out in social media, the most obvious example being the criticism on Twitter and YouTube directed at Al Shabaab leaders by former member American jihadi Omar Hammami, who had helped them develop their social media presence,' said Mr Poole . Twitter has yet to suspend the account as it did multiple al-Shabaab accounts during the Kenya mall attack. By allowing the feed to remain up, argues another expert, Twitter is allowing al-Qaeda to further decentralize its powerbase and further streamline its communications. 'If the dissemination of official releases is no longer to be done centrally, it has the potential to make the forums obsolete and usher in a new era whereby jihadi activists primarily rely on social media platforms to interact with one another,' Aaron Zelin, a counterterrorism analyst, told the Times.","The launch comes only days after the Kenyan mall attack was live tweeted by al-Qaeda affiliate al-Shabaab .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Kate and Gerry McCann's pain over the disappearance of their daughter was 'multiplied 100 times' by a book by a former Portuguese police chief, a court has heard. Gerry McCann's sister Trish Cameron said he and wife Kate had been left in 'purgatory' by the disappearance of Madeleine and claims that they were somehow involved. Speaking at the libel trial of former police chief Goncalo Amaral, Mrs Cameron said the publication of his book in 2008 and a TV documentary based on it the following year caused the family to be 'vilified' and 'demonised'. Hearing: Gerry McCann has also expressed a wish to testify against police chief Goncaro Amaral . Lawsuit: Mr McCann and his family are seeking £1million over claims they were responsible for Madeleine's disappearance . And she said Madeleine's twin siblings . Sean and Amelie, now eight, told their parents that comments were made . by fellow pupils at their school. She told the court: 'My brother and sister-in-law live in purgatory because they have no end and they are looking for the truth. 'They would like an end but there is no end because they don't know what's happened.' The . McCanns say the former detective's claims in the book The Truth Of The . Lie, including suggestions that they hid their daughter's body after she . died in an accident and faked an abduction, damaged the hunt for . Madeleine and exacerbated her family's anguish. If . successful in the legal action, brought against him, his publisher, and . the makers of the documentary, the family stands to gain around £1 . million in damages. Mrs . Cameron, whose voice cracked as she described the effect on her family . by the publication of the book, said: 'They were vilified in this book . so their distress was multiplied 100 times. 'This pain was felt by all of their family because we still have a missing child and we knew that what is in there is not true.' Proceedings: Mr McCann in the court building, where the case against Mr Amaral is being heard . Anger: Mr McCann claims the allegations made it harder to search for his daughter, who vanished in 2007 . Earlier, Gerry McCann had arrived at the court in . a bid to give evidence against the disgraced police chief, but later . expressed his disappointment that he was not able to take part in the . proceedings. 'Disappointed,' McCann told reporters as he left the courthouse, 'but you know, we'll keep going.' It is not clear why he was not able to give evidence. Mr McCann . and his wife Kate are seeking £1million in damages from the former . detective, claiming his allegations caused them extreme anguish and . hindered the search for Madeleine, who vanished from a hotel room in the . Algarve in May 2007. In his book The . Truth of the Lie, published in July 2008, Mr Amaral suggested that the . couple hid their daughter's body after she died in an accident, then . pretended she had been taken. Mr . McCann was left frustrated after flying to Portugal last week, when . proceedings were adjourned because one of the defendant's lawyers could . not be present. Arriving at the Palace of Justice in Lisbon this morning, Mr McCann said he was not sure what would happen 'after last week'. 'We are here to listen to the judge and hopefully be heard,' he told reporters. Battle: Mr McCann and his family are still looking for Madeleine, who was aged three when she disappeared . He travelled to the Portuguese capital with his sister Trish Cameron and his wife Kate McCann's mother Susan Healy, who are both expected to appear as witnesses in the case. Mrs McCann attended the court last month on the first day of the case, telling reporters she was in Portugal to 'stop the damage' she believes is being caused to the search for her daughter. The court has heard how she had suicidal thoughts after Mr Amaral claimed she had covered up her daughter's death. Psychologist Alan Pike said that after the publication of the former police chief's book, Mrs McCann 'thought about not being around any more'. Victim: Madeleine's disappearance sparked a worldwide police search, but she has not yet been found . Couple: Gerry and Kate McCann say they were extremely distressed by Mr Amaral's book, published in 2008 . Madeleine, who was nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. Mr Amaral, who initially led the inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance, was removed from the case in October 2007 after criticising UK police. British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the child's disappearance in July this year and believe she could still be alive. The Portuguese investigation into Madeleine's disappearance is officially closed. The case, in which Mr Amaral denies defamation, is expected to finish hearing evidence in November.","Gerry's sister says parents in 'purgatory' over claims they were involved .

"By . Meghan Keneally . and John Stevens . and Alex Greig . Mitt Romney and his wife Ann have received the go-ahead to raze their La Jolla beachfront house and build an 11,000-square-foot mansion. The California Coastal Commission voted today to allow the couple to demolish the 3,000-square-foot beach house for which they paid $12 million in 2008 in order to build the much larger home. It is the second time the couple has won permission to build the mansion after a neighbor challenged the original permit for the Romneys' plan for a two-storey home with a 4,500-square-foot basement. Future construction site: Mitt Romney's beachfront mansion in La Jolla, California, abuts a public beach . More than double: The construction will include a complete destruction of the current home (which has red tiling on the roof) so that it can be rebuilt at nearly triple the size . According to the LA Times, Anthony Ciani claimed the Romneys lied about the size of their land in order to increase the allowable size of their house. According . to Ciani, the Romneys included the beach-front area west of their . seawall, adding 6,000-square feet to their lot size and allowing them to . build a house 1,000-square-feet bigger than would have been allowed by . San Diego city guidelines. Coastal Commission documents state that Ciani also claimed that public beach use was not protected; that the scale of the development would be out of character with its surrounds; and that the home would be threatened by geologic risks, block public access and impact water quality. The panel voted seven-four in favor of the Romneys. The LA Times reports that two commissioners, Dayna Bochco and Jana Zimmer, who voted against the project agreed with Ciani, saying the sandy beach shouldn't have been included in the calculation of the home's size. Zimmer said she was 'flummoxed' and called it a 'huge red flag, and an unacceptable premise.' San Diego’s planning regulations, she said, 'clearly prohibit counting other kinds of unbuildable areas such as canyons and gullies.' New project: The Romneys plan to build a beachfront mansion in San Diego big enough to accommodate their children and grandchildren . Bochco said the description of the lower level of the house as a basement was misleading. 'If you’re standing on the beach… you are going to see French doors or sliding glass doors of a first floor that they call a ""basement."" We have to define what we really mean as a ""basement"" on a hillside lot,' she said. The 65-year-old former governor is looking to make the home into an 11,000-square-foot house that is more comfortable for the large brood of Romney children and grandchildren . Attorney Matthew Peterson who represents the couple, said the Romneys will begin work on the house in about six months time, and that the project is expected to take between 14 and 16 months. As a condition of the permit, the Romneys are required to dedicate their beachfront area to public use. Commissioner Greg Cox told ABC . the project would be 'very compatible with the development that's in that . neighborhood.' 'It's not going to be intrusive or blocking the . views that people have right now,' he said. 'These people have played by . the rules.' The 75-year-old house, which has two bedrooms, will be replaced with a two-storey dwelling. Low-key: Mitt Romney has made very few public appearances since his failed election bid but did make a day trip to Disneyland (pictured) ‘They will keep the appearance of the home from the street as a single-story residence. It won't look tall and bulky like some of their immediate neighbor's homes,’ the Romney’s lawyer Matt Peterson told the Union-Times. The plans reveal that as well as altering the house, the driveway will be relocated. The existing lap pool and spa at the home, which has a lawn running down the white sand beach, will be retained. The most outlandish feature of the home will be in the garage, as Mr Romney ordered a $55,000 car elevator so that vehicles can be stored below ground. During Mitt Romney's 2012 election campaign, the revelation that the plans for the home included such a contraption - which stars such as Britney Spears and Harrison Ford also have - came as a point of ridicule. 'Well, doesn’t everyone need an elevator for their cars? Even if you have to hire a lobbyist to secure it?' quipped Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. Unassuming entrance: Romney came under fire during the campaign as it was revealed that he wants to commission a $55,000 car elevator in the garage . The La Jolla home, which sits on 0.41 acres, is one of the family’s three homes. The Romneys' official primary residence is a townhouse outside of Boston. They also own a $10 million vacation home on the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. The couple sold the 6,400-square-foot home in Belmont, Massachusetts where they raised their children, in 2009 for $3.5 million. In addition, their 9,500-square-foot ski lodge in Deer Valley, Utah, fetched $5.25 million last year. Changes: The construction plans promise that the exterior of the house will not change dramatically . Mitt and Ann Romney are believed to be worth between $190 million and $264 million. He made much of his fortune as the co-founder of private equity firm Bain Capital. At a book signing last year, Romney told reporters why he bought his California beachfront house. 'I wanted to be where I could hear the waves,' he said. 'As a boy, we spent summers on Lake Huron and I could hear the crashing waves at night. 'It was one of my favorite things in the world. Being near the water and the waves was something I badly wanted to experience again.'","Mitt and Ann Romney have won approval for plans to build an 11,000-square-foot mansion .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Murdered: Sultan Ahmed, 20, was stabbed to death by a friend's neighbour following an argument over a drain . A young man who stepped in to mediate in a fight between two neighbouring families was stabbed to death with a carving knife. Sultan Ahmed, a 20-year-old aspiring lawyer, stepped in to act as a 'peacemaker' in a violent machete brawl which had followed a row over a leaking drain. Shofique Uddin, 51, stabbed Mr Ahmed to death after a neighbourhood spat on the Isle of Dogs. Uddin's wife Gulbahar Begum, 51, was accused of handing her husband a carving knife, allegedly telling him ‘kill those sons of b******’. The Uddin/Begums and the family next door had not had much contact until a blockage caused dirty water to seep into the Uddin/Begums' garden. The Uddin/Begums confronted their . neighbour Doyarun Nessa over the fence when she was in the garden . cleaning carpets and she was branded ‘****ing lowlife’ in Bengali by one . of Uddin’s sons. Mrs Nessa was in tears and told her son Zishan Ahmed, 27, what had happened when he returned home later that day. ‘What . should have amounted to no more than a trivial neighbourly dispute . turned quite unnecessarily into a dreadful display of violence that left . one young man dead and three further people injured,' said prosecutor . Ed Brown. ‘The facts of this . case demonstrate in very stark terms how quickly and seriously an . incident can escalate with terrible results once a decision is taken to . use a knife. ‘The tragedy is that Sultan Ahmed was something of a peacemaker during these events.’ Despite . sharing their last name, Mr Ahmed was not in a member of the insulted . family, but was part of the group who went to speak to the . Uddin/Begums on their doorstep. A bystander caught what happened on his mobile phone as the two groups clashed. Escalated row: Shofique Uddin, right, was found guilty of murder, while his wife Gulbahar Begum, left, was cleared of both charges she faced . Begum kicked Mr Ahmed in the leg and the rivals began pushing and shoving each other. ‘Within a very short time Begum appeared with a large and very dangerous knife in both hands,’ Mr Brown said. ‘She had plainly collected it from her kitchen at the back of the house and come to use it against those she saw who had come to her front door. One witness said Begum was ‘really going for it’ and the video clip shows her bringing down the machete from over her head. Although two men were injured, Begum was cleared of wounding with intent. Killer: Shofique Uddin, 51, stabbed Mr Ahmed in the back with a carving knife . Uddin was held in a headlock as he brandished the blade, but he managed to struggle free and knifed Mr Ahmed in the back. ‘He can be seen to hold the knife up in the air, then lunge towards the group with is striking down towards the back of the deceased,’ said Mr Brown. Joynal Khan needed six stitches to a cut to his head, and Rahim Ahmed was badly cut on the right shoulder by the machete. Mr Ahmed was lying in a pool of blood when paramedics arrived, but died at the scene. His sister Jannatul Ferdous said the family continue to be ‘heartbroken’ by the loss of Sultan. ‘She speaks about the heartbreak the family have suffered since his death, and how it continues to have devastating effect upon them and their lives’, said prosecutor Ed Brown. ‘She described him as an inspiration to the family, full of life and a popular member of all of those groups he was a member of.’ Sultan, a charity fundraiser who came third in a contest to be the young mayor of his borough at the age of 16, aspired to become a lawyer and ‘had a great future ahead of him’. Mr Brown added: ‘She ultimately describes her brother, how his funeral filled the mosque, and he was a charismatic, deeply loved, and caring human being.’ Uddin . admitted stabbing Mr Ahmed but told the court he only wanted to ‘injure . him a little’ because he would not let the family go back into their . own house. Begum said: ‘I tried to scare them, to drive them away. I picked up the instrument used for cooking to frighten the attackers.’ Uddin denied murder and Gulbahar Begum . denied two charges of wounding with intent. Their daughter Rahela Begum was cleared of . causing actual bodily harm. Begum was cleared of both charges she faced and Uddin was found guilty by a majority of 10-2. He is due to be sentenced tomorrow.","Shofique Uddin, 51, stabbed Sultan Ahmed to death with a carving knife .

"By . Amie Keeley . and Rebecca Camber . and Hugo Gye . Freed: Tracey Connelly will get a new name and her appearance will be changed when she is released . The grandfather of Baby P has criticised the ‘crazy decision’ to release his daughter from prison. Tracey Connelly was jailed indefinitely in 2009, with a minimum five-year tariff, for causing or allowing the toddler’s death. But she was let out this week following a second Parole Board review of her case last month. Her father Richard Johnson, 56, believes his daughter should stay in prison for life. He said: ‘Who in their right mind would allow her out? It’s a crazy, stupid decision. She hasn’t served nearly enough time. She allowed her own son, my beautiful baby grandson, to be tortured to death. She’s evil and should never ever be freed.’ Baby Peter, who was 17 months old, died in August 2007 at his home in north London having sustained more than 50 injuries after months of abuse. Connelly admitted her role in the death and was jailed along with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted of the same offence. Having left Low Newton women’s prison near Durham, the 32-year-old will be given a new surname and officials will help her disguise her appearance. Tortured to death: Baby Peter, who was just 17 months when he died . Jail: Connelly's boyfriend Steven Barker, left, and his brother Jason Owen, right, were also found liable for Peter's death in August 2007 . Speaking from his home in New Parks, . Leicestershire, Mr Johnson added: ‘I’ve got no idea what she looks like . now and don’t care.’ The . Parole Board says it took into account the nature of the offence, her . previous offences and progress made in prison. Connelly will remain on . licence for life. She . is thought to have been released on Tuesday – the day it was reported . former Haringey child protection boss Sharon Shoesmith is to receive . around £700,000 compensation for her dismissal over the tragedy. It . was reported that Connelly will be given a new name and hairstyle in an . attempt to live her life anonymously – but not a full new identity. The Ministry of Justice has refused to confirm the reports of Connelly's release. The . news comes days after it emerged that sacked child protection boss . Sharon Shoesmith, whose council department failed to protect the child, . is to receive almost £700,000 for unfair dismissal. A Probation Service source said Connelly could be ‘smuggled’ out of jail to avoid her being attacked. Barker . and Owen are both currently in prison - Barker was given a life . sentence after being convicted of rape in a separate case, while Owen . was returned to jail earlier this year after apparently breaching his . bail conditions. Sharon Shoesmith, the former director of children's services at Haringey Council, was sacked over the Baby P scandal . Peter's death caused widespread outrage, not only because of the horrific . nature of his injuries but because he was repeatedly let down by the . social services which were supposed to ensure his wellbeing. Connelly was first arrested in 2006 . after a GP noticed bruises and scratches on Baby Peter’s face and chest. He was consequently put in care, but returned home just a month later. The child was later hospitalised following further abuse, and police were told, but Haringey Council’s children and young people’s service concluded that the ‘threshold to initiate care proceedings’ had not been met. Connelly was arrested again in May 2007, just three months before her son's death, but was not charged despite his injuries. Baby Peter’s death came a day after he was taken to hospital, where a broken back and broken ribs are thought to have gone undetected by doctors. At the time of his death he was also found to have had his fingers mutilated, while he had swallowed a tooth after being punched. Following the tragedy, a full . investigation into child protection services at Haringey Council was . carried out and former child protection boss Sharon Shoesmith was sacked . from her £133,000-a-year job. Four other council workers, including Shoesmith's deputy, were also dismissed, while the Labour-run council's leader and the councillor responsible for children's services both resigned. But earlier this week it emerged that Shoesmith will receive up to £700,000 after winning a court ruled . she had been unfairly dismissed. The precise sum has not been made public due to a confidentiality clause signed by the council and its former employee. Yesterday it was revealed that taxpayers also paid £196,000 to fight her compensation claims. The legal fees were handed over to lawyers by Haringey Council as it tried to oppose her claims through tribunals and court hearings. It means the full price to the taxpayer of sacking Shoesmith over the death of Baby P and then paying her compensation for unfair dismissal has reached close to £1million. Ed Balls, who was Children's Secretary at the time of her dismissal, said that the payout left a 'bad taste in the mouth'.","32-year-old is also expected to have new hairstyle upon release .

"By . Ted Thornhill . Arrested: Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz has been charged with accepting paid travel, the services of prostitutes and Lady Gaga concert tickets in a devastating bribery case for the US Navy . A U.S. Navy commander has been accused of moving ships 'like chess pieces' to ports in Asia to financially benefit a defense contractor, in return for prostitutes and Lady Gaga tickets, according to naval court documents. Michael Vannak Khem Misiewicz also allegedly passed . confidential information on ship routes to the firm, Singapore-based . company, Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd, or GDMA. The accusations unfolding in a federal . court case signal serious national security breaches and corruption, . with the threat that more people, including those of higher ranks, could . be swept up as the investigation continues. A hearing on November 8 . could set a trial date. Glenn Defense Marine Asia Ltd is run by the gregarious Malaysian businessman nicknamed ‘Fat Leonard’, who is well known by U.S. Navy commanders in the Pacific. But prosecutors in court papers say Leonard Francis worked his connections to obtain military secrets by arranging prostitutes, Lady Gaga tickets and other bribes for a U.S. commander, in a scandal reverberating across the Navy. Misiewicz and Francis moved Navy vessels like chess pieces, diverting aircraft carriers, destroyers and other ships to Asian ports with lax oversight where Francis could inflate costs, according to the criminal complaint. The firm overcharged the Navy millions for fuel, food and other services it provided, and invented tariffs by using phony port authorities, the prosecution alleges. At the time, Misiewicz was deputy . operations officer for the U.S. commander of the Seventh Fleet, which . oversees operations over some 48 million square miles extending from . Japan to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and from Vladivostok, Russia, . to Australia. Prior to his assignment at the Seventh . Fleet, Misiewicz had been commanding officer of the USS Mustin, a . forward-deployed guided-missile destroyer. ‘It's pretty big when you have one person who can dictate where ships are going to go and being influenced by a contractor,’ said retired Rear Admiral Terry McKnight, who has no direct knowledge of the investigation. ‘A lot of people are saying, “How could this happen?’' So far, authorities have arrested Misiewicz; Francis; his company's general manager of global government contracts, Alex Wisidagama; and a senior Navy investigator, John Beliveau II. Beliveau is accused of keeping Francis updated on the investigation and advising him on how to respond in exchange for luxury trips, prostitution services, and more. Public Face: In this photo taken Dec. 3, 2010, U.S. navy officer Michael ""Vannak Khem"" Misiewicz smiles as he delivers his welcome speech on the deck of the U.S. Navy destroyer USS Mustin at Cambodian coastal international see port of Sihanoukville . All have pleaded not guilty. The . defendants face up to five years in prison if convicted of conspiracy to . commit bribery. Defense attorneys declined to comment. Senior . Navy officials said they believe that more people would likely be . implicated in the scheme, but it's too early to tell how many or how . high this will go in the naval ranks. Other unnamed Navy personnel are . mentioned in court documents as getting gifts from Francis. Francis . is legendary in military circles in that part of the world, said . McKnight, who does not know him personally. He is known for . extravagance. His bungalow in an upscale Singapore neighborhood drew . spectators since 2007 to its lavish, outdoor Christmas decorations, . which The Straits Times newspaper described as rivaling the island . city-state's main shopping street. ‘He's . a larger-than-life figure,’ McKnight said. ‘You talk to any captain on . any ship that has sailed in the Pacific and they will know exactly who . he is.’ CBS News reported that maintenance for one ship, the aircraft carrier Stennis, cost the Navy $2.7 million, which is about double the average price charged by other ports. Navy spokesman, . Rear Admiral John Kirby said Navy Criminal Investigative Service agents . initiated their probe in 2010, but declined to comment further, citing . the ongoing investigation. That . same year, Misiewicz caught the world's attention when he made an . emotional return as a U.S. Naval commander to his native Cambodia, where . he had been rescued as a child from the violence of the Khmer Rouge and . adopted by an American woman. His homecoming was widely covered by . international media. Lured to his arrest: Also taken into custody and charged in criminal complaints unsealed in U.S. district court in San Diego on Tuesday were Leonard Glenn Francis . Meanwhile, Francis was recruiting him for his scheme, according to court documents. Francis' company bilked the Navy out of $10 million in just one year in Thailand alone, U.S. Attorney Laura Duffy said. The federal government has suspended its contracts with Francis. Francis was arrested in San Diegoin September, while Misiewicz was taken into custody in Colorado and . Beliveau in Virginia - all in September. Francis was allegedly arrested in the United States after . being duped into coming to San Diego by Navy officials who arrested him . in a sting-operation. According to a 2010 U.S. Navy release, . Misiewicz grew up near Phnom Penh during the Vietnam war and was adopted . by an American woman shortly before the Khmer Rouge came to power in . 1975. He escaped the notorious 'Killing . Fields' and was heralded publicly for his successful rise to become the . skipper of the USS Mustin - and made an emotional returen to Cambodia in . 2010, which was given huge media attention. The . Navy said in the release that a visit by the USS Mustin to . Sihanoukville, Cambodia, in December 2010 marked his first return to . that country since his adoption 37 years earlier. Last month a senior Navy spokesman deflected inquires into the status of the still-unfolding investigation. 'We . don't comment on ongoing investigations, except to say that we are . committed to supporting the investigation,” the spokesman told Fox News. “We hold our leaders to -- and expect them to uphold -- high standards . of conduct and professionalism.'

Fairytale: A fixation with 'glitzy, celebrity' weddings fuelled by glossy magazines is overshadowing the true meaning of marriage, says Iain Duncan Smith . Mr Duncan Smith has led efforts to encourage couples to marry with proposals for tax breaks and changes to the benefits system. But . he told a conference organised by the Marriage Foundation that it had . become almost taboo to praise the virtues of marriage for the good of . society. The numbers of . young people choosing to marry has fallen steadily in recent decades, . but Mr Duncan Smith said polls sggested that at least three quarters of . them ranked marriage highly among their goals for life. Obsession: Iain Duncan Smith has led efforts to encourage couples to marry with proposals for tax breaks and changes to the benefits system . One of the reasons for the reluctance to tie the knot is the spiralling cost of a wedding, he claimed. The Telegraph quoted him as saying that young people have 'a kind of unrealistic expectation of what married life will be like, and in some cases almost an incredible fairytale view of what will happen.' He said: 'Reinforced by a glitzy celebrity culture and the glossy spreads of the various glossy magazines, the focus is too often on the ceremony itself, the celebration of that event. 'And now, I understand, by some estimates, it costs something in the order of about £20,000 to establish that.' He added: 'What seems to have been forgotten is that the point of marriage is, of course, love, commitment and that stable environment in which you can then bring up a family.' Mr Duncan Smith's comments came after he earlier this year proposed tax breaks to encourage what he called the 'most important man-made institution'. Under plans announced by the . Government in September a husband or wife would be able to transfer . £1,000 of their tax-free personal allowance to their spouse. It . would apply if couples are both basic rate taxpayers with one spouse . earning less than the allowance. Gay couples in civil partnerships would . also be eligible.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The forecast was sunny and warm, with the thermometer sitting around 57 degrees. But snow fell on the grounds of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta on Monday as part of a special surprise to 'add some magic' to the lives of the sick young patients. In a city that rarely sees snow, staff at the hospital planned a secret operation to simulate a winter wonderland on its three campuses, teaming up with a special effects company that works with Disney. Dozens of children - many tethered to I.V. poles and wearing masks - were lured outside as hidden snow machines blasted faux icicles from above, according to ABC News. The hospital said it was way to let patients 'become kids', if only for a moment. Scroll down for video .

'Its a tough time to be in the hospital during the holidays and we thought it would be great to add some excitement and magic to the kids day here,' said chief Pediatrician Dr Jim Fortenberry . 'What better way to do that than bring some snow?' Doctors say it is therapeutic for the patients to take their minds of the illnesses. For many, it was the first time they had seen snow, even if it were fake. Only a handful of employees knew about the surprise, the hospital said, making the moment special for staff as well. 'The facility people were a huge help and got us access to the roof,' a spokeswoman said. 'We pulled it off with a few volunteer coordinators.'

'It's such a special time of year and kids in the hospital don't get to celebrate.' The hospital hired Zigmont Magic F/X, a company that works with Disney on snow shows. It assembled more than 31 snow machines holding 31 gallons of snow fluid on the roofs of all three facilities. The white stuff looked real but felt a bit more like cotton. Each hospital campus -- in Egleston, Scottish Rite and Hughes Spalding -- had arranged a party so that children and their families would be gathered in a place where they could see the falling snowflakes. Children enjoyed arts and crafts and music with 'Frosty the Snowman' playing as the snow began to fall. A child at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta looks up as fake snow rains from the sky .

This one girl wanted to hand around and look at the Christmas tree though . 'It really did accumulate on the ground,' said the spokeswoman. 'The snow felt more like soap,' she said. 'Kids were outside dancing in it and playing. 'They were making snow angels and even had snowball fights.' 'But it was more like throwing soap bubbles' she said. 'It was so special.'","Children's Healthcare of Atlanta teamed up with a special effects company that works with Disney for a surprise snow storm on Monday .

"By . James Slack . Failure: A task force chaired by David Cameron said the policy of treating different cultures as ¿separate and distinct¿ had been a ¿mistake . Timid politicians with a ‘misplaced’ fear of offending Muslims have allowed Islamist extremism to take root in the institutions of Britain, the Prime Minister warned yesterday. A task force chaired by David Cameron said the policy of treating different cultures as ‘separate and distinct’ – known as multiculturalism – had been a ‘mistake’. The panel said it was far easier to combat the fanaticism that leads to terrorism when different communities ‘come together to challenge it’. Yesterday’s report – a response to the killing of soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich – was scathing about the ‘reticence’ of politicians to confront Islamists. It was published by Downing Street on behalf of Mr Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and a string of other senior Cabinet ministers. The report gives a stark warning of how – by being afraid to challenge hard-line views – politicians had allowed fanaticism to take root in a string of British institutions. It says: ‘The Government, as much as organisations and communities in the UK, must take responsibility. ‘We have been too reticent about challenging extreme Islamist ideologies in the past, in part because of a misplaced concern that attacking Islamist extremism equates to an attack on Islam itself. This reticence, and the failure to confront extremists, has led to an environment conducive to radicalisation in some mosques and Islamic centres, universities and prisons.’ For three decades, Whitehall promoted a strategy of multiculturalism that Mr Cameron has previously described as ‘encouraging different cultures to live separate lives, apart from each other and apart from the mainstream’. The task force, which the PM personally chaired, warns this was a ‘mistake’. It says: ‘Extremism is less likely to be tolerated by communities which come together to challenge it. ‘Britain is stronger because of its open, multi-faith and multi-racial communities, which can tackle extremists together and challenge the view that it is not possible to be a true Muslim and be integrated in British society. ‘Approaches in the past that, on occasion, sought to deal with different communities as separate and distinct, were mistaken.’ Mr Cameron called on the  Government and wider society to ‘take action to confront extremism in all its forms, whether in our communities, schools, prisons, Islamic centres or universities’. Danger: In 2004 Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality ¿ now the Equality and Human Rights Commission ¿ warned Britain was in danger of sleepwalking into segregation . He said yesterday: ‘I have been absolutely clear that this is not something we should be afraid to address for fear of cultural sensitivities.’ The task force is recommending new civil powers – dubbed ‘Tebos’, or terror and extremism behaviour orders – to target extremists. They could be used to bar people from preaching messages of terror and hate, associating with named individuals thought vulnerable to radicalisation, and from entering specific venues such as mosques or community halls. Ministers also want new internet filters to block extremist websites and extended powers for watchdogs to shut down charities suspected of being fronts for extremist groups. The Government is also introducing a new definition of extremism which specifically includes a ‘distorted interpretation of Islam’ which argues against ‘liberal values such as democracy, the rule of law and equality’. In 2004 Trevor Phillips, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality – now the Equality and Human Rights Commission – said multiculturalism was out of date because it ‘suggests separateness’. He warned that Britain was sleepwalking into segregation.","Task force said treating different cultures as 'separate' was an error .

"By . Associated Press . and Ashley Collman . A sinkhole that opened up early Thursday morning in Dunedin, Florida could have been prevented. Michael Dupre, whose home was one of two condemned yesterday, had known for two years that a sinkhole was was growing underneath his home but had been battling with his insurance company to get lasting repairs. Today, his home and one other will be demolished and covered with 600 dump truck loads of dirt to stabilize the hole. Scroll down for video . Growing: The sinkhole that opened up between two homes in Dunedin, Florida early Thursday morning has grown to 90-feet-wide and nearly 60-feet deep. Aerial footage shows the view from above the sinkhole this morning . Too late: Michael Dupre is the owner of 1112 Robmar Road, one of two homes set to be demolished into the pit today (right in first picture). He says he's been battling his insurance company for two years to get preventative repairs to avoid a sinkhole . About two years ago, Mr Dupre started noticing cracks on the outside of his home at 1112 Robmar Road. His insurance company, Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, sent engineers to look at the cracks and they assessed that they were evidence of 'sinkhole activity'. Their recommendation was to pump grout into the ground - a service that would cost $90,000 - $110,000. But Mr Dupre didn't think that would be enough, so he decided to file a suit with the company to get more comprehensive repairs. Mr Dupre continued to fight with the company up until last February, when a sinkhole opened up in nearby Seffner, Florida. The sinkhole opened up under one of the home's bedrooms, and swallowed up homeowner Jeff Bush while he was sleeping. Mr Bush's body was never recovered. Gulp: A picture taken Thursday afternoon shows the roof of a garage being swallowed by the sinkhole . Biggest: The city engineer estimates that the hole is probably three times bigger than any other sinkhole to emerge in Dunedin . Dangerous: Yesterday, crews worked to remove a 14-foot boat trapped in the sinkhole for fear it would leak gasoline into the local water supply. Above, the bow of the boat can be seen on the edge of the hole . Fearing that a similar case could happen to his home, Mr Dupre finally caved into the insurance company's plans. Three days ago, Champion Foundation Repair started pumping grout into the earth around Mr Dupre's home but it was too late. Two days after they started work, a sinkhole opened up and swallowed both Mr Dupre's home and neighbor Elvira Oakes' home. 'I'm upset,' Mr Dupre told the Tampa Bay Times. This could have been taken care of a long time ago.' 'It's gone,' he added. 'This is our house. This is what we bought five years ago and hoped to grow old in.' Mr Dupre's daughter Ivy was the first to notice the sinkhole opening Thursday morning around 5:15am. Break-in: Mr Dupre's daughter Ivy (middle) was the first to notice the sinkhole Thursday morning and thought the noise was someone trying to break into their house. Pictured above with parents Michael, right, and mother Janke, left . Condemned: The view from the front of the Dupre's home at 1112 Robmar Road. It is set to be demolished into the pit today and covered with 600 dump truck loads of dirt to fill in the sinkhole . 'It sounded like banging against the windows. I thought someone was trying to break-in,' Ivy told Fox 13. After the sinkhole opened up, the Dupre's called 911. Fire and rescue officials told them to grab whatever they could and get out of the home. 'We grabbed only the important stuff. Insurance information - stuff like that,' Mr Dupre said. 'You don't really think about this kind of stuff happening.' The Dupre's home and one neighboring home were condemned yesterday. They will be demolished sometime today and then covered with 600 dump truck loads of dirt to stabilize the pit. In addition to the two condemned homes, five other homes were evacuated. Two others were deemed uninhabitable but not condemned. There are no reported injuries. Sinkhole alley: Sinkholes are common in this area of Florida, nicknamed 'sinkhole alley' for the type of porous rocks that cause the earth to shift . Into the earth: In addition to the two homes condemned by the sinkhole, five others were evacuated. Their owners will most likely be able to return to their homes today after the hole is filled in . The hole started out as 12-feet-wide when fire and rescue crews arrived on the scene around 6am Thursday morning. The sinkhole stabilized overnight Thursday and was measured to be 90-feet-wide and 56-feet-deep this morning. That's more than three school buses deep. The only thing salvaged from the hole was a 14-foot boat, which authorities feared would leak gasoline into the water supply if swallowed. City Engineer Tom Burke estimates that it is the largest sinkhole that's ever opened up in Dunedin. 'It's a remarkably big sinkhole. It's the largest by probably three times,' he said. End of the nightmare: The sinkhole was stabilized overnight Thursday . Breakfast: The sinkhole gobbled up a boat, pool and one home's master bedroom. No one was injured from the sinkhole . Residents in the surrounding homes are set to return to their homes today after the hole in filled in. Sinkholes are common in Florida because the peninsula is made up of porous carbonate rocks such as limestone that store and help move water underground. Over time, the rocks can dissolve from an acid created from oxygen in water, creating a void under the limestone roof. When dirt, clay or sand gets too heavy for the limestone roof, it can collapse, creating a sinkhole. State officials say three counties in the Tampa region are known as 'sinkhole alley.' Two-thirds of the sinkhole damage claims reported to the state Office of Insurance Regulation between 2006 and 2010 came from Hernando, Hillsborough and Pasco counties. Dunedin is in neighboring Pinellas County.","A sinkhole opened up at 5:15am Thursday in Dunedin, Florida .

"By . David Williams . and Ian Drury . and Neil Sears . A senior civil servant was suspended yesterday amid allegations of gross misconduct as defence chiefs investigate his relationship with his pretty blonde chief of staff. Andrew Manley, a £200,000-a-year executive in the Ministry of Defence, is to be questioned over whether his relationship with Laura Clare was ‘inappropriate’ and about expenses claims picked up by taxpayers for nights he spent at a luxury hotel. The 57-year-old married, father-of-two – one of the ministry’s highest paid officials – is chief executive of the three-year-old Defence Infrastructure Organisation. It is responsible for the management and maintenance of £23billion of MoD land and property. Relationship: Andrew Manley (left) will be questioned over his relationship with Laura Clare (right) Miss Clare, 32, is likely to be questioned as part of the inquiry but is not under investigation and has not been suspended. Described as a high-flier, she has worked for Mr Manley since 2011 and was recently promoted to be his chief of staff. High-flier: Miss Clare is said to be 'highly regarded' at the MoD . It is understood that internal emails sent by Mr Manley will form part of the investigation being carried out by the MoD. Last . month it emerged that Mr Manley had claimed a £5,542 bill for 47 nights . at the New Hall Hotel and Spa in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, as . part of an expenses  claim of £13,743. The . 800-year-old four-star spa and country house hotel, which can cost £155 . a night, is less than two miles from DIO headquarters, which the MoD . said he visited from his London office. His . claim was part of £180million spent by the MoD on hotels and car hire . for top civil servants and officers at a time when the Armed Forces are . facing massive cuts. It even included a £3,000 Sky Sports subscription. There . was disbelief from taxpayer groups as reports revealed that officials . spent £110million on hotels between 2009 and 2013 – a bill which went up . by £3million in three years – and a further £69million on cars. A . Ministry of Defence spokesman said yesterday: ‘We can confirm that a . senior civil servant has been suspended on full pay. It would be . inappropriate to comment further pending the outcome of an . investigation.’ An interim . appointment will be made to ensure that the work of the DIO is . unaffected. Last night there was no reply at Mr Manley’s £1.5million . detached five-bedroom home in Chobham, Surrey, where he lives with his . wife Pauline, 56, daughter Olivia, 22, and son, Rory, 21. Three cars . stood on the drive. A . graduate of the University of Wales and London Business School, Mr . Manley took a job at the MoD after spending 30 years with Shell, where . he was a vice president in Latin America and oversaw the oil giant’s . move onto a common IT system. Luxury: Manley used taxpayers' money to stay at the £155-a-night New Hall Hotel and Spa in Sutton Coldfield . Extraordinary details have been uncovered about the lavish perks and bonuses enjoyed by civil servants at the Ministry of Defence. Senior mandarins have stayed in plush hotels, pocketed generous bonuses, enjoyed trans-Atlantic travel and been given official cars and drivers – all funded by the taxpayer. They have also been wined and dined by defence companies and given tickets to major sporting events. Last month it emerged that the MoD spent £180million on hotels and car hire for top civil servants and officers between 2009 and 2013 as it made billions of pounds in cuts, including axing warships, fighter jets tanks and 30,000 troops. One of the high spenders was Bernard Gray, who is paid £220,000 a year to bring the MoD’s equipment budget under control. He claimed more than £100,000 expenses in his first year in the job. Between January and October 2011 Mr Gray, who lives in Newbury, Berkshire, racked up a £23,000 bill for 106 overnight stays at hotels in London and Bristol. He also charged £65,531 for using an official car and driver, and £17,929 for air and rail travel. He joined the MoD as commercial director . in charge of procurement before being promoted to head the newly-formed . DIO. Its job is to develop, . maintain and service the MoD’s training ranges, barracks, bases, depots . and aircraft hangars. Mr Manley was in charge of spending £3.3billion a . year on work that includes feeding nearly a quarter of a million staff, . acting as the landlord for 50,000 homes, and looking after 600,000 . acres of land. Miss Clare . worked for Unilever, the multinational consumer goods company, before . joining the MoD in 2004 on the department’s commercial business graduate . scheme. Said to be ‘highly . regarded’ in the department, she held commercial posts in equipment and . was promoted to become private secretary to the director general . commercial. Miss Clare joined the DIO in 2011 as private secretary to Mr Manley. She . was then rapidly promoted to become his chief of staff – effectively . acting as a gatekeeper, liaising between the chief executive and other . staff – on a salary of up to £59,535 a year. Miss Clare enjoys horse . riding, playing tennis and walking. Last night there was no reply at her home in a modern development in Putney, South-West London.","Andrew Manley will be questioned over relationship with Laura Clare .

"By . James  Nye . Two student pilots are seated shoulder to shoulder before a bank of video monitors, maneuvering an unmanned aircraft by keyboard and mouse as the drone descends toward a virtual runway in a suburban landscape. Aaron Gabrielson and Andrew Regenhard, aviation students at the University of North Dakota and self-proclaimed video-game junkies, could just as well be sitting on a couch playing Xbox. But instead of tapping their fingers on a controller, they're learning to fly the plane and use onboard equipment that includes a camera with a zoom lens as they continue their studies on their $150,000 course. Learning: University of North Dakota aviation students Andrew Regenhard, left, and Aaron Gabrielson operate a Corsair simulator as part of their training to fly unmanned aircraft Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2013, in Grand Forks, North Dakota . 'Some people argue that nothing is going to be like flying an actual airplane. Granted, looking down and seeing you're 5,000 feet above the ground is pretty exciting, but I've always been addicted to video games, and this is awesome,' Regenhard said. Mastering the Corsair simulator is the first practice course for the two trainees, who are among hundreds of student pilots nationwide preparing for jobs that don't exist yet. They and their classmates are eager to cash in on the booming market for drone operators that's expected to develop after more unmanned aircraft become legal to fly in U.S. airspace, which could happen in the next few years. The university's unmanned aircraft degree program, the nation's first, exploded from five students in 2009 to 120 students last year. Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and Kansas State have since added similar programs. Dozens of other schools offer some courses in what's known as UAS — unmanned aircraft systems — which range from drones as big as small planes to 2-foot-wide mini-helicopters. The first UAS master's degree program, focused on engineering, was launched at Embry-Riddle's Daytona Beach, Fla., campus this fall. University of North Dakota aviation students Andrew Regenhard, left, and Aaron Gabrielson operate a Corsair simulator as part of their training . 'This pie is pretty big,' said Al Palmer, director of UND's unmanned aircraft program. 'Everyone can get their little slice of the pie, because we can't do all the training in North Dakota.' The skills needed to fly larger unmanned planes are not unlike those required to fly modern aircraft with computer-based flight controls, professors say. The toughest part of unmanned flying comes with doing it from the ground: You can't feel what's going on. 'You don't have feedback,' Regenhard said. 'When you push the yoke forward in the aircraft, you feel yourself and everything going down. With this, you just see it.' Drones are best known for their use by the U.S. military, but other markets beckon. Amazon made a splash earlier this month by unveiling an embryonic effort that might someday deliver packages by drone, though the company acknowledged practical use is years away. Most of the potential civilian drone market is in precision agriculture. Unmanned aircraft are already used for seeding and spraying in Japan. Drones may be used someday to detect disease in crops, depending on the development of sensors. The potential applications for other unmanned aircraft are endless, said Michael Toscano, president and CEO of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International. Non-military: University of North Dakota aviation student Logan Lass lifts a lightweight drone used in training at the Grand Forks, N.D. school's unmanned aircraft program . The Boeing ScanEagle, which can fly for 20 hours on a couple of gallons of fuel, was originally developed to help commercial fishermen find and track schools of tuna. The Navy has used the plane to watch pirates. In recent years, North Dakota law enforcement and the university have used the drone to monitor rivers during flood threats in the Red River Valley. For students, it all adds up to strong job prospects after graduation. 'Whether it's designing a vehicle to go into forest fires or catch poachers in the Galapagos, they're getting opportunities to be part of the next generation of aerospace like no one else is,' said Melanie Hanns, Embry-Riddle spokeswoman. Many students who grew up wanting to be commercial airline pilots are changing their major to unmanned systems. Among them are self-proclaimed computer geeks who don't mind staying in one place. 'Airplanes are cool and fun and all that stuff,' said Logan Lass, a student at North Dakota. 'But it's my particular personality that I don't really want to fly big jets. Growing up around computers and having a love for aviation, I figured the best option was to combine the two of them.' Inspiration: Workers prepare an MQ-1C Gray Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle for static display at Michael Army Airfield, Dugway Proving Ground in Utah in this September 15, 2011 US Army handout . Over the last decade, it's gotten much tougher to get a job as an airline pilot. Many pilots started out at smaller regional airlines, but pay there is poor, and airlines are shifting away from smaller planes. Meanwhile, growth has been minimal at major U.S. airlines, cutting the number of new jobs for pilots, and bankruptcies have reduced pay. Compare that to the outlook for drones. The Federal Aviation Administration projects some 7,500 commercial drones could be aloft within five years of getting widespread access to American airspace. An industry commissioned study last spring predicted more than 70,000 jobs would develop in the first three years after Congress loosens restrictions on U.S. skies. The same study projects an average salary range for a drone pilot between $85,000 and $115,000. A U.S. Air Force MQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicle assigned to the California Air National Guard's 163rd Reconnaissance Wing flies near the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California . Palmer, the UND instructor, said one of the first graduates in the school's UAS program took a job with a California aeronautics company for $50 an hour. 'That's probably not bad for a kid out of college,' Palmer said. The hopes for civilian drones might not be realized as quickly as many people in the business had hoped. Concerns about security, privacy and whether drones will be able to detect and avoid other aircraft could push the grand opening beyond a 2015 deadline set by Congress. In the meantime, North Dakota's unmanned aircraft students are looking to master the Corsair simulator. Then they advance in January to train for the larger MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper drones. 'That is what a lot of employers are looking for,' aviation student Spencer Wheeler said. 'That's why I came to school here. This is the Harvard of aviation.'","Four year course in North Dakota can set back students by up to $150,000 .

"By . Barbara Jones . Nicola de Menezes has described how her husband was shot dead and she let her daughter, Eva, hug him one last time . A British woman on holiday in South Africa has described how her husband was shot dead by intruders in the middle of the night – and how she let their seven-year-old daughter hug his still-warm body for the last time and say goodbye. Little Eva de Menezes kissed her father Clinton and told him: ‘Goodbye Daddy. Sleep tight.’Nicola de Menezes told The Mail on Sunday how she made the heartbreaking decision to let her daughter see and touch him, and how she is sure she will never regret it. ‘We are a family who lived for each other and loved each other, and we needed to be together even at that terrible moment,’ she said. Renowned artist Clinton, 43, was at . the height of his career with exhibitions in London and New York when he . was shot as he tried to help a friend fend off an armed gang. The . family, who until recently lived in Hanwell, West London,  were on . holiday to celebrate their wedding anniversary and the New Year. Nicola’s parents, Tony and Brenda Saward, had emigrated to South Africa . in 1967 and she grew up in the country. Clinton was her sweetheart at . secondary school. The couple were staying with their closest friends, Amanda and Simon Malpas, in a quiet suburb of Durban when two armed men – now believed to be part of a gang who had earlier carried out two other robberies in the city and shot another man – appeared on the raised deck outside the sitting-room and burst through the patio doors. Nicola, 45, said she had since relived that horrifying moment  ‘a hundred times’. She said the tragedy happened when their lives had seemed  at their absolute best. She had recently started a job as an oil company executive in Kenya and her husband and child came with her from England. Clinton had commissions for several major artworks. ‘We had been talking about how wonderful everything had turned out for us,’ she said. ‘Life could not have been better. Then it all ended in a flash. I feel robbed of everything. Only my family and friends are keeping me going now.’ She described how she had  taken Eva to bed earlier that night and dozed off herself, leaving Clinton and her friends talking and listening to music in the next room. She was then woken by a violent commotion. ‘It was about 1am,’ she recalled. ‘I heard the crashing of doors and shouting and screaming. Our friend Simon was yelling and I could hear strangers’ voices. ‘Clinton was in the bathroom and Amanda was pounding on the door for him to let her in. I picked up Eva and got to the bathroom as quickly as I could. ‘I put her into the laundry basket and told her to stay there, that everything would be all right. It was just instinctive – I didn’t want her to see or hear anything bad. The couple and their daughter were staying with their closest friends in a quiet suburb of Durban . ‘Clinton said he was going to help. There was no stopping him and I didn’t even try. His friend was being attacked and Clinton would never stand by and let that happen.’ Mr Malpas had been trying to close the patio doors against the two intruders but they forced their way in. As Clinton hurried into the sitting-room he came face-to-face with one of the burglars brandishing a gun. He was shot through the heart and died instantly. It all happened in a split-second, Nicola said. She knew her husband was dead before she even rushed out of the bathroom. ‘I had been shaking with fear, with Amanda and I clinging to each other, when we heard the shot. ‘We just prayed, “Please God, let our boys be OK,” but then I heard a sound, one loud groan that was also  a sigh, and I just knew it was Clinton’s last breath. ‘I got down beside him on the floor and held him. I talked to him and sobbed my heart out. I just talked to him quietly for about five minutes, waiting for the police to arrive. I thanked him for being a wonderful father and husband to us and told him that I loved him. ‘He was still warm, lying there, and I decided to let Eva see him – he meant everything to her. He looked peaceful and she came straight over and lay down next to him. She kept asking me why his eyes were open  so I closed them gently and then she kissed him and told him to sleep tight.’ Nicola also asked Amanda to get Clinton’s wedding ring for her before his body was removed from the scene. ‘I want to keep it with me always,’ she said. She made the same decision about her husband’s ashes after his cremation. ‘We are not scattering his ashes anywhere. I’ll keep them for the rest of my life.’ Nicola has no bitterness, she said, just deep pity for the victims of  violent crime in a country she once loved. ‘This is the loveliest place  in the world but people are now trapped, fearful in their own homes, and I feel sorry for them. ‘Clinton and I came here on holiday each year. It’s where his career started, he got his fine art degree at the city’s Institute of Technology. He always hoped after its cruel history it would become a better place.’ Renowned artist Clinton, 43, was at the height of his career with exhibitions in London and New York . South Africa suffers some of the highest crime statistics in the world, with an average of 46 murders every day. Nicola said she and her husband had been reluctant to leave the country in 2007, but he wanted to achieve a wider market for his art. Clinton quickly gained recognition, exhibiting works at the Bicha Gallery in London. He sent a huge piece of art on long-term loan to the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and his giant World Map is at the London headquarters of auditors PricewaterhouseCoopers. He also began to teach his daughter . painting and sculpting techniques. ‘Clinton adored her, and  they did . everything together,’ she said. ‘I would be at work and he did the . childcare during the day. ‘They played together, worked in the studio together, and he took her to school and fetched her home.’ Two . days after his death, Eva wanted to know when her father  would be . back. Nicola said: ‘We told her Daddy wasn’t coming back. We wanted her . to know the truth. ‘She was very upset and asked who would be taking her to school now he was gone. ‘I’m only managing to keep my belief in humanity through friends and family. Without them I would  be in despair. We knew about rising crime here but I didn’t know it could be so sinister and uncaring.’ She described how the intruders took two handbags belonging to her and Amanda. The property was later recovered by police, and four men have appeared at a magistrates court nearby. Two are accused of murder and burglary, another of being an accessory, and the fourth, a Congolese national, is accused of receiving stolen goods. ‘Nobody gained a thing from  this,’ Nicola said. ‘And our lives  are ruined.’","Clinton de Menezes, 43, was attacked at friend's house on New Year's Eve .

"By . James Slack . and David Williams . An Al Qaeda-trained bomb-maker was last night free to walk Britain’s streets under a cloak of state-sanctioned anonymity. The fanatic is one of seven men released from Government anti-terror control orders this month under rules meant to protect their human rights. He undertook terror training in Pakistan and was named as an alleged terrorist by an American supergrass whose evidence helped to foil a massive UK bomb plot. The 41-year-old was part of a London group of Islamist extremists that included one of those who plotted to blow up the Ministry of Sound nightclub and Bluewater shopping centre in 2004. Target: The 41-year-old was part of a London group of Islamist extremists that included one of those who plotted to blow up Bluewater shopping centre (pictured) in 2004 . Security officials say he also had contact with an Al Qaeda leader in Pakistan and helped two of his brothers go to fight in Pakistan, where they died in drone strikes. Yet despite the dossier of evidence against him, the terror suspect can be identified only as BM. On order of the courts, the Mail is banned from naming BM or his dead brothers, or from giving his address, until the end of his life. Ministers say identifying men who have been subject to Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (T-PIMS) would breach their human rights by compromising their privacy or safety. There is mounting alarm at extremists’ use of anti-terror legislation to hide their identities. Under Home Office legislation, the blanket of secrecy is granted as a matter of course following a simple application by the men’s lawyers. It is lifted only if they go on the run. MPs called for the ban on naming the suspects to end. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs select committee, said: ‘The lack of monitoring of those originally on T-PIMS should be a real worry to the British public.’ BM, who was born in Britain, was  first put on a control order in 2009 for allegedly being involved in terrorist activity. He was switched to a  T-PIM in 2012 when control orders were abolished. In 2011, the Court of Appeal heard he was suspected of having explosives training between 2001 and 2004 and being in contact with a senior Al Qaeda leader in Pakistan. BM was also accused of helping to transfer funds to Pakistan for terrorist purposes and was part of a group in London that was ‘involved in promoting terrorism’.  Also linked to the group was a member of the terror cell arrested under Operation Crevice in 2004 – which foiled a huge plot to use fertiliser bombs to target London’s Ministry of Sound nightclub and Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. The Ministry of Sound nightclub was also targeted . Five men were jailed in 2007, including Sussex-based Omar Khyam, who was later revealed to have links to Mohammad Sidique Khan, a ringleader in the 7/7 London bombings. A crucial witness in the Crevice trial was Mohammed Junaid Babar, an American who turned supergrass. Following his arrest in 2004, Babar conducted a series of FBI interviews in which he named other alleged extremists, including BM. In 2011, BM’s brother was killed in a drone strike in Pakistan. A  second brother reportedly died in the same way  a year earlier. In his review of BM’s T-PIM in 2012, Mr Justice Collins said he was ‘likely to pursue terror-related activity’. Until this month, eight fanatics were subject to T-PIM restrictions on their movements – which can include strict curfews. But under rules demanded by Nick Clegg, seven of the orders have either already lapsed or will do so by the end of the month. The newly-free men also include an extremist known as CD who attended a terror training camp in Cumbria with four of the attempted suicide bombers involved in the July 21 2005 attacks. Last week, Parliament’s joint committee on human rights said it believed T-PIMs – which replaced control orders in 2011 – may be ‘withering on the vine’. But security minister James Brokenshire said: ‘The police and security service believe T-PIMs have been effective in reducing the national security risk. However, they are just one weapon in the considerable armoury at their disposal.","The fanatic is one of seven men released from Government anti-terror control orders this month under rules meant to protect their human rights .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . At Oaksterdam University, you're guaranteed a potent dose of education where an A-grade will leave you with a very different high. That's because the California institution is the world's first cannabis university that devotes its time to the study and cultivation of the drug. More than 15,000 students have already passed through its doors and now bosses are on a roll after two states de-criminalised cannabis this month in a big boost to the industry. But you're mistaken if you think life at Oaksterdam - a play on the Dutch city of Amsterdam where cannabis has long been legalised - is just for dopes. High-end education: Students attend a lecture at the world's first cannabis university where they are taught how to succeed in the lucrative marijuana industry which is worth an estimated $2billion this year . Toking a leaf out of his book: Bosses are confident of booming student numbers after two U.S. states de-criminalised cannabis this month in a big boost to the industry . Bosses see its classes as a window onto a legal lucrative business that's set to be worth more than $2billion this year. Pupils are told 'we're farmers. Not drug dealers' and learn how to run a profitable cannabis empire selling to some of the drug's three million daily users. Classes include legal advice, electrical engineering and horticulture. One student, who did not want to be named, said: 'There's a lot more to cannabis cultivation than I ever thought. Not going to pot: Life at Oaksterdam is not about hippies smoking and getting high all day . Changing attitudes: Cannabis was legalised in Colorado and Washington for medical and recreational use on January 1 . Not suitable for dopes: Classes include legal advice, electrical engineering and horticulture to help students learn how to run a profitable cannabis empire . Raided: Authorities seized plants and equipment at Oaksterdam in 2012, but no charges were ever brought . 'People . think it's simple, but for indoor growing there's a lot of technical . aspects, how to get the best use of the lights and the amount of water . the plants need.' He added: 'Of course we should have laws governing cannabis production, but like any other crop, to make sure no harmful chemicals or pesticides are used.' Cannabis was legalised in Colorado and Washington for medical and recreational use on January 1. In California, possession for medical reasons is legal under state law but illegal in federal law. This discrepancy saw the authorities raid Oaksterdam in April 2012, seizing University Cannabis plants and equipment. Growth area: With 20 states now allowing some form of cannabis production, the future is looking bright for Oaksterdam . In demand: Classes are held daily and there is a waiting list for courses . No charges were ever brought, but student numbers dropped and the University was forced to move to a smaller location. Today however, enrollment numbers are booming, classes are held daily and there is a waiting list for courses. With 20 states now allowing some form of cannabis production, the future is looking bright for Oaksterdam. One student said: 'People have always smoked Cannabis and the country's laws have finally caught up. 'For those who get on the ground floor, they are going to make a lot of money. And what's more American than that?'","Oaksterdam teaches you how to cash in on $2billion-a-year industry .

"By . Emily Davies . Prisoners have been handed £41million in benefits they are not entitled to, it has emerged. For six years Jobseeker’s Allowance, Income Support, sickness benefits and other state hand outs have been incorrectly paid to criminals behind bars. And the taxpayer is still owed £21million because the Department for Work and Pensions has only managed to claw back £19.7million. Hapless: For six years Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, sickness benefits and other state handouts have been incorrectly paid to criminals behind bars . Labour MP Grahame Morris called for an investigation into the payment blunders. He told the Daily Mirror: ‘This is just wrong. How can prisoners be overpaid £41million in benefits they are not entitled to? Iain Duncan Smith's Department for Work and Pensions has only clawed back £19.7million of the incorrect benefit payments . ‘Benefits should be there for people who need them. ‘This money could have been used so much better, for example, to make good the shortage of midwives in the NHS or pay for 2,500 more nurses. 'It shouldn’t be given in overpayments to men and women in jail.’ The benefits payments, covering six years since 2007, were disclosed following freedom of information requests. In that first year prisoners were overpaid £8.8million in benefits. A further £8.7million was wrongly handed out in 2008-09, £7.7million a year later, £14million from 2010-2012 and £2million last year. A DWP spokesman said: ‘In law there is no entitlement to benefit when a person is in prison, therefore any benefit that is paid is recorded as an overpayment.’ 'It is not possible to say what percentage of payments made to prisoners in any particular year is recovered, as some of the amount recovered could relate to overpayments recorded in earlier years.' Some prisoners in certain circumstances are still entitled to Child Benefit and Housing Benefit.","Incorrect benefits payments totalling £41million were made over six years .

"By . Daniel Martin . The food industry lobby has been given unprecedented access to the heart of government, a Daily Mail investigation has found. Fast food companies, supermarkets, restaurant chains and chocolate and fizzy drinks firms have had dozens of meetings with ministers. Yet health campaigners say they have been shunned – at a time when the Coalition has been resisting calls for tough laws to restrict the amount of sugar in food. McLobbyists: Representatives of McDonald's met with former Public Health Minister Anna Soubry, as well as her predecessor Anne Milton . Access: Representatives of food giants such as Pepsi, left, and Marsa, right, were also given access to high-ranking ministers . McDonald’s, Mars, Pepsi, Nando’s and Tesco are among firms invited to ministerial meetings since the 2010 election. The Food and Drink Federation, the lobbyist for the food industry which has led opposition to calls for anti-obesity legislation, has had 16 meetings with ministers and 99 meetings with officials since the Coalition took over, official figures reveal. Last night public health experts said the extraordinary access showed that the Government was keener on listening to the food industry than to those with the interest of people’s health at heart. Tam Fry, of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘These meetings are an example of how the industry has a charmed route into the corridors of power that is denied to everyone else. 'The fear of people like us is that the Government secretly sews things up on the industry’s behalf. Perhaps if the Government weren’t so influenced by them, we would have a maximum sugar level in foods by now.’ Campaigners say that without tough action to tackle obesity, which can lead to diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer, the NHS could go bankrupt. The revelation comes weeks after it emerged that drinks industry representatives met dozens of ministers and officials before the Government’s decision to drop plans for a minimum alcohol pricing. Today a study published in the Bulletin of the World Health Organisation says there is a correlation between countries with few regulations on food production and those with consumption of unhealthy fast foods. Meetings: Former Health Secretary Andrew . Lansley, left, met with most major supermarkets, Subway and food giants . Unilever, while current Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, right, has attended a meeting with Asda . Researchers say that if governments take action, such as stopping the clustering of fast food outlets on high streets or taxing fizzy drinks, they can help turn the tide against obesity. Campaign group Action On Sugar, which wants laws to force manufacturers to cut the sugar content of their products by up to 30 per cent, will tonight have its first meeting with Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, but hopes of a breakthrough are not high. Its chairman Graham MacGregor, a professor of cardiovascular medicine who has also led anti-salt campaigns, said: ‘We rarely get access to ministers – they don’t want to see us. 'My impression is that if the food industry want to see them, they get in. The food industry is riding all over us. It’s a scandal. ‘I don’t know what Jeremy Hunt will say, but I don’t think it will be positive.’ Last month Action On Sugar unveiled research showing that zero-fat yoghurts can contain five teaspoons of sugar, while a can of Heinz tomato soup has four. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has called for a 20 per cent tax on food and drink which has high sugar levels. But ministers have so far rejected all calls for restrictions or taxes on sugar content. The Coalition instead wants companies to agree a voluntary cut sugar in levels. The Department of Health has published details of ministerial meetings between April 2011 and September 2013 on its website but for unknown reasons was unable to do so for the period from May 2010 to March 2011. The details show that big food firms met ministers on average once a month. Labour’s public health spokesman Luciana Berger said: ‘People will rightly ask why ministers have spent so much time meeting with the fast food and drink industry. Ministers caved in to vested interests. David Cameron has no plan to tackle the obesity epidemic.’ Public health campaigners also accuse the Coalition of hampering action to target obesity by its decision to strip responsibility for nutrition from the Food Standards Agency and place it under the political control of the Department of Health. Last night the Department of Health said the meetings with the food industry were about trying to persuade it to improve the healthiness of products. ‘Improving the public’s health is a priority,’ a spokesman said. ‘We are not giving business, big or small, power over public health policy but food businesses have a big role to play in helping people to lead a healthier life.’ Terry Jones, spokesman for the Food and Drink Federation, said: ‘The significant commitments developed at those meetings to eliminate artificial trans fats and reduce the saturated fat, salt and calorie content of a wide range of foods as well as providing clear nutrition labelling, have empowered consumers to make dietary choices appropriate to their lifestyle.’","Daily Mail investigation finds food industry let in to the heart of government .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . Councils are being investigated for an ‘illegal’ parking strategy in which wardens are given bonuses to hand out more fines. Documents have shown that at least three local authorities are setting targets or incentivising parking officers to ticket motorists despite this being banned under official rules. Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis has launched a probe into the contracts and said they will be stopped if proven illegal. Councils are being investigated for an 'illegal' parking strategy in which wardens are given bonuses to hand out more fines . The BBC Inside Out investigation looked into three councils in London - amid fears the same practices could be being used across the country. It found Bromley Council’s contract with parking firm Vinci sets a bonus of up to £20 for every ticket issued over an annual baseline of 72,000 penalty charge notices. Hackney Council allows contractor APCOA to band different wardens according to their hourly ticket issue rate, stating no more than 10 per cent can fall below ‘band two’. NSL, which runs parking enforcement for Lambeth Council, reveals in its contract that it ‘requires’ the issue of 218,000 penalty notices a year - a figure which was later downsized to 205,000. After reading the legal documents, Mr Lewis said: ‘These look like entirely the wrong kind of contract motivating and encouraging the staff to go out and penalise people and they only get paid well if they penalise somebody. That’s the wrong way to run the structure.’ He added that lawyers at the Department for Communities and Local Government would now scrutinise the documents to see if they can be challenged in court. ‘[If] it’s proven they are illegal this kind of behaviour has to stop’, he added. Statutory Guidance to Local Authorities prohibits councils or private companies from setting targets for either the number of tickets they issue or the revenue they raise. It states that performance and rewards or penalties should never be based on the number of parking tickets issued nor should authorities set targets. Brandon Lewis has launched a probe into the contracts and says they will be stopped if proven illegal . Commercial litigation lawyer Keith Oliver says the contracts appear to be ‘a serial breach of government guidance by a whole series of councils ostensibly acting independently but quite clearly cleverly drafted by lawyers to circumvent the government guidance on the subject’. He described them as ‘disgraceful, unacceptable - arguably unlawful’. It comes as figures show the councils have racked up significant profits from parking last year. Bromley council made a £5.7m profit from parking charges and fines - up £1m on the previous year. Hackney had a parking surplus of £7.9m - £2m - while Lambeth made a £12m profit, more than double the previous year’s profit. All three councils point out the number of tickets issued is falling. As for the contracts themselves, Lambeth Council says: ‘This is not a target - it’s a figure for guidance so NSL can plan the number of staff they will need.’ Its contractor NSL said: ‘NSL incurs no penalties for not issuing tickets and nor are there awards for issuing tickets.’ Bromley Council said they ‘never set targets for revenue from parking enforcement income’. It also pointed out its contract ‘commenced in 2006, predating the Statutory Guidance by two years’ but said ‘the council lawyers remain content with the integrity of the contract’. Hackney Council insisted that it ‘sets no targets for the issue of penalty charge notices nor gives the contractor any incentive for its officers to issue more than they feel necessary’. However, it conceded it has removed that section of the contract. The Mail revealed NSL, formerly NCP, Britain’s biggest parking enforcer, had issued thousands of wrongful tickets to unsuspecting motorists so wardens could hit targets in 2010. A whistleblower provided evidence that showed at one London local authority, managers wrote ‘only cancel if appealed’ on paperwork for dozens of tickets issued for no legitimate reason rather than simply cancel them.","Documents show that at least three local authorities are setting targets .

"By . Hugo Gye . A group of Romanian squatters have been discovered living in a disused public toilet for at least two weeks. As many as 15 men were found in the small brick building by a council official who went to examine the property before it goes up for auction. The squatters had transformed the toilets in Edgware, north-west London, into a home by installing a divan bed in the space where the urinals are - as well as a fridge, microwave and cooker. They managed to tap into the public electricity supply and install plug sockets, while they also carpeted over the floor tiles. Home: Around a dozen Romanian men were found living in this public toilet in Edgware, north-west London . The group of men were discovered by an officer from Harrow Council who was visiting the former toilet, which is about to go on sale with a reserve price of £300,000. When he arrived the squatters promptly left, but they returned a few days later and the building eventually had to be boarded up to keep them out for good. Pictures from inside the squat show filthy living conditions, with clothes and rubbish strewn everywhere. A makeshift shelf running along the length of the urinals boasts a mouldy laptop and a DVD boxset of Rich Man Poor Man, as well an Orthodox Christian icon and a small sewing machine. A television aerial and clothes can be seen hanging off washing lines and one of the cubicles appears to have been used as a storage cupboard, while they have kept the other as a toilet. Filth: The counters were covered in the men's possessions and they had crammed a bed into the urinal space . 'At one point we were getting reports that there were up to 15 people coming and going,' a council spokesman said. 'We didn't find any passports but found some papers with names suggesting they were Romanian. 'The situation came to light because one of our officers went to make the property ready for marketing, not because we had received any complaints from residents.' Local residents and businesses seemed largely unaware that the building had been converted into an impromptu home said. Pharmacy assistant Nilam Morjaria said: 'It's shocking to think that they are so desperate that they want to live in the toilets. But I didn't know anyone was squatting in the building. 'I haven't heard anything about them - nothing about them causing trouble or being a nuisance. 'It shouldn't have been left empty and boarded up so long. It should either have been torn down or sold sooner.' Enterprising: The men tapped into the electricity supply and installed a cooker, fridge and microwave . A local newsagent said she had seen people going in and out of the public toilet, but added: 'I didn't realise that they were actually living there.' Council leader Susan Hall said: 'This was a public convenience, but it was not meant to be quite that convenient for the squatters who have evidently turned it into a one-bedroom flat. 'What this shows is that the pressures of Eastern European migration are rippling out into suburbia. 'People may be desperate to resort to these measures, but this is a building the council needs to sell to put money into services. As it is, the taxpayer is going to be left spending more than a penny to repair the damage done at this site.' The building is set to be sold at auction later this month.","Council official discovered the men living in a toilet in north-west London .

"By . Glen Owen . The UKIP candidate who could push the Tories into third place in a by-election this week is being backed by a bizarre figure who calls himself ‘Lord Lust’ and once appeared in a pornographic film. John Bickley - who polls predict could come second to Labour in Thursday’s Wythenshawe and Sale East vote - has been nominated by the eccentric James Hadfield-Hyde, who starred in the adult movie Up At The Crack Of Dawn. Mr Bickley was further embarrassed last night as it emerged that despite his anti-EU beliefs, he accepted nearly £100,000 from Brussels to prop up one of his firms. Connection: UKIP hopeful John Bickley, left, whom some say could come second in an upcoming by-election, was nominated to stand by James Hadfield-Hyde, right, who once played a TV character named Lord Lust . The disclosures suggest that UKIP leader Nigel Farage is still struggling to fulfil his promise to weed out the ‘Walter Mitty’ characters among his ranks - such as councillor David Silvester, who blamed this winter’s flooding on the Government’s decision to legalise gay marriage. Mr Hadfield-Hyde, who has been described as ‘a cad, womaniser and bon vivant’, purchased the title of Lord of the Manor of Alderley in the 1990s. He went on to host a late-night adult programme called Lord Lust’s Lovelies, in which he was surrounded by barely clothed models, before appearing in Up At The Crack Of Dawn. Erotic links: Mr Bickley was involved in distributing the film version of Mandingo, pictured here in book form . Publicity material for the film said: ‘The country estate of Lord Lust is jam-packed with nude lovelies indulging in gentrified hanky panky, from Susan the poacher  to Vicky the portrait painter.’ Mr Bickley was himself managing director of a company, CIC Video, that distributed erotic titles such as Mandingo: A Story Of Forbidden Passion In The Deep South. He accepted EU money for another of his companies. In 2006, he took £95,000 from a special EU ‘seed fund’ for his software company Genemation, of which he was CEO. At the time he said: ‘The backing and support from the Liverpool seed fund was crucial and we are looking forward to working closely with the fund as we develop.’ The company went into liquidation in 2009, owing more than £450,000. UKIP’s central policy is that Britain should withdraw from the EU. Shortly after Mr Bickley was named as the party’s candidate he said: ‘Parliament has outsourced the running of this country to the EU. Labour and the Conservatives have subjugated - by stealth - control of this country to the EU and its quangos.’ The by-election, which follows the death of Labour MP Paul Goggins, is the first major electoral test of 2014 for UKIP. The party is hoping a strong showing - followed by a good result in May’s European elections - will act as a springboard for next year’s General Election. Strategy: Mr Bickley on the campaign trail in Wythenshawe, Manchester, with UKIP leader Nigel Farage, right . A poll last week showed Labour heading for first place in the by-election with 61 points, with UKIP second on 15 points - up 12 points since the 2010 Election. It means the party is set to leapfrog the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats. A UKIP spokesman said: ‘James presented a programme called Lord Lust’s Lovelies which was a Granada/Sky production on mainstream TV. No clothes were removed.’ Mr Bickley denies his stance on the EU grant is hypocritical because he was not a member of UKIP at the time he accepted the money.","John Bickley tipped for second place in Wythenshaw and Sale by-election .

"By . Stephen Wright . Sacked: Captain Bartle Frere, who was fired from his job as a BA pilot, has appeared in court charged with child sex offences . British Airways has sacked a long-haul pilot after he was arrested over a string of child sex offences. Captain Bartle Frere, 50, lost his £160,000 a year job after he was questioned about allegations dating back to 2001. He appeared in court last week accused of indecent assault, gross indecency and another serious sexual assault - on a boy under 16 - and child porn offences. Frere, a bachelor, is the second senior BA pilot to be charged with child sex offences in the last six months. First Officer Simon Wood, 54, killed himself last August days after he was charged with indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl in the UK and a series of child porn offences. Police believe Wood used his position to abuse hundreds of vulnerable children in African schools and orphanages, during stopovers overseas for BA. There is no suggestion that Frere, a keen amateur photographer and ‘movie maker’ - who is also skilled at aerobatics - knew Wood or committed any offences with him. But news of his prosecution will be a major embarrassment to BA, coming so soon after the controversy involving Wood. An official video made by Frere for a leading prep school in the South-East is accompanied by the BA theme tune - Sous le Dome Epais (Flower Duet). Frere, who was educated at £10,830 a term Westminster School, whose alumni include Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, was arrested at his modern but traditionally built stone three bedroom home in the sleepy Dorset village of Shipton Gorge, near Bridport, in November last year. A neighbour said: ‘I had been out for the day and when I returned there were a number of police vehicles here. They took away some equipment from the house and Mr Frere. ‘He cuts quite a solitary figure. I see him now and again to nod to and say hello just to be polite but I don’t think anyone in the village knows him particularly well. Frere was remanded in custody at Bournemouth Crown Court, pictured, yesterday and will appear back in court in May . ‘He will sometimes pop up the pub if there is anything like a quiz on and he comes to the village fete things like that but he is away for weeks on end with his job as a long haul BA pilot.’ Yesterday, there was no answer when a reporter knocked at the door of Frere’s home, where a metal model of a Spitfire has pride of place in the window of the downstairs sitting room. It is understood that following his arrest, a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution, which authorised criminal charges late last month. Dorset Police said Surrey-born Frere appeared at Bournemouth Magistrates Court on February 1, and at the local crown court on Friday. It said: ‘50-year-old Bartle Frere from Bridport has been charged with child sex offences... safeguarding measures have been put in place to protect victims.’ He was remanded in custody during his most recent court appearance and is due in court again on May 2. Frere - described by one acquaintance as ‘a perfectly mannered country gentleman’ - is charged with four indecent assaults, one attempted indecent assault, one offence of gross indecency, three offences of buggery - all on a boy under 16 between 2001 and 2003. He is further accused of possession of six indecent images of children and making four indecent images of children. British Airways pilot Simon Wood, pictured, killed himself last year after he was charged with child sex offences but there is no suggestion Wood and Frere knew each other . The Mail has learned that Frere was sacked by BA following his arrest late last year. But the airline refuses to say when he was dismissed - or why. A spokesman said: ‘He is no longer an employee of the company.’ He added: ‘We do not discuss confidential matters between the company and employees or ex-employees.’ Frere, whose unusual Christian name is a diminutive of Bartholomew, is from a family with an impressive pedigree and history which saw noticeable service in the empire in war and peace. He is directly related to Sir Henry Bartle Edward Frere (1815 - 1884) who was created a Baronet in 1876 after a long and distinguished career in the Indian Civil Service. In 1872 he had negotiated the abolition of the slave trade with the Sultan of Zanzibar. In 1877 he was appointed to be the Governor of the Cape Province, South Africa to implement the policy of confederation. However, his approach in refusing to speak to the native chiefs provoked a war with the Zulu tribes, the first battle of which in 1879 ended in a disastrous defeat for the British army. Despite eventually winning the trust of the Boer element of the proposed confederation he was recalled to London in 1880 and censured for reckless conduct. Another wealthy ancestor, George Frere (1774-1854), inherited Twyford House, a Queen Anne mansion in Thorley, near Bishop’s Stortford, in Herts, and was founder and president of the Law Society. Frere’s sister Sarah Frere, 51, refused to comment at her home in Sheringham, Norfolk. She said: ‘I am not saying anything. If anything has happened, it will cause immense distress and I am not saying any more.’ Last September the Mail revealed how during BA stopovers in Africa, paedophile pilot Simon Wood dressed in a bogus captain’s uniform and offered BA branded toys and colouring books to lure children out on day trips and to five-star hotels used by the airline, where he would abuse them. Days after appearing in a court in London last August, charged with child sex and porn offences, he threw himself under a train. Officials in Kenya have identified at least 15 children, all believed to be girls aged five to 11, that Wood abused - and say they fear there are hundreds more.

"By . Stephen Wright . Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation, is under pressure following fresh claims about the chaotic spending culture of the union . Fresh claims about the chaotic spending culture  at the Police Federation emerged last night. As MPs prepare to debate the structure and running of the police ‘union’ tomorrow, Federation officials faced disturbing new questions about how its money is spent. Analysis of its accounts revealed that officials ran up a £927,155  bill in 2012 during a high profile campaign on members’ pay and conditions at the time of a public sector pay squeeze. In 2010,  officials spent just £250,000 on a similar pay campaign. In addition insiders at the Federation, which represents more  than 120,000 rank and file officers, made a series of startling allegations that: . The latest allegations about the finances of the Federation – described by one source as just the tip of the iceberg – will concern the hard-working officers who fund it through subscriptions. It emerged recently that a Federation whistleblower, Fiona McElroy, has been sacked after challenging its seemingly out of control spending culture. And on Monday police widow PC Kate Parker accused Federation officials of using their corporate credit cards to turn the annual National Police Memorial Day event for fallen officers into a ‘drunken jolly’. The Federation rejected her allegations. Last night the Federation repeatedly refused to answer questions about the enormous cost of the 2012 pay campaign, its use of Chessington World of Adventures or Epsom Race Course for meetings of its Joint Branch Board, and the alleged trip to Italy. Questions about the offshore accounts were also blocked. Instead, it issued a prepared statement from under pressure chairman Steve Williams, whose organisation is still reeling from the aftermath of the Plebgate scandal. The latest allegations about the finances of the Federation - described by one source as just the tip of the iceberg (stock picture) A subsequent review by former Home Office permanent secretary Sir David Normington found a ‘worrying loss of confidence and competence’. Mr Williams said: ‘The leadership remains committed to driving the organisation forward and ensuring it is accountable. ‘Prior to the publication of the review, I acknowledged the need for the organisation to be open and transparent in how members’ money is spent. ‘Despite some justified criticism of the Federation, a great deal of excellent work has taken place.’ The last time public trust in the police was as low as it is today was following the police strikes of 1918, during the First World War, says David Davis MP . The last time public trust in the police was as low as it is today was following the police strikes of 1918, during the First World War. After that dispute the police were granted a pay rise, but were also forbidden membership of a trade union. In place of a union, the Police Federation was set up by the government to give voice to the concerns of police officers. The Federation worked to ensure that officers were protected and that respect for policing was maintained. In other words, it started  as a constructive force behind  British policing. Today, I fear the opposite is true. We saw the most recent example of the Federation’s failings in the fallout from Andrew Mitchell’s altercation with an officer in  Downing Street. Following that incident, three Federation representatives met with the former Chief Whip to discuss what had transpired. The officers brazenly misrepresented to the gathered press what had been discussed. Even after being censured in Parliament by the Home Affairs Committee, they outrageously still refused to apologise to Mr Mitchell personally. The public, quite naturally, came to the conclusion that if MPs could be treated in this way, so could anyone. An independent panel set up to examine the failures within the organisation delivered a damning report condemning the Federation’s ‘traditional tendency to attack’ and saying some members were ‘bringing the Federation  into disrepute’. Even the Federation’s members are disillusioned. Many feel that those in the upper echelons of  the organisation have lost touch with grassroots members, and grown too accustomed to the  trappings of power. Consider, for example, the Federation’s luxurious £26million headquarters in Leatherhead, Surrey. This HQ includes a 55-room hotel with a bar, indoor swimming pool and 11 two-bedroom grace-and-favour apartments. Membership fees had to be raised by 23 per cent in 2010 to cover a hole in the Federation’s finances caused by the purchase of the Leatherhead headquarters. The late Sir James Goldsmith once noted that the size of a company’s headquarters is directly proportional to its decadence. On this basis, any reasonable person wandering past this police palace would conclude that the Federation was beyond saving. How ironic that this organisation was specifically designed not to be a trade union – but has now acquired the worst characteristics of the sort of self-serving trades unions we thought we saw the end of in the Seventies. Yet despite all this criticism, the Federation refuses to change its ways. Last week Fiona McElroy, a former principal private secretary brought in to help it reform itself, was sacked after being told she had ‘alienated’ senior officials. Ms McElroy had raised ‘serious concerns’ about the management of the Federation’s accounts. There has been disquiet about some Federation officials’ extensive use of corporate credit cards to pay large bar bills. (The organisation is also currently facing an inquiry by HM Revenue & Customs into up to £2million claimed by some officials as business expenses.) The Federation's HQ includes a 55-room hotel with a bar, indoor swimming pool and 11 two-bedroom grace-and-favour apartments . Ms McElroy confirmed that she had been opposed by a ‘vocal minority’ who were resisting attempts to implement the changes recommended by the independent panel’s report. The problem is, this ‘vocal minority’ appears to be running the show. The Federation’s accounts reveal that an astonishing sum – almost £8million a year – is spent on litigation on behalf of members. Just yesterday Liberty, the civil liberties group, announced that, if the police officer Toby Rowland – who disputes Andrew Mitchell’s claims that he lied about the MP calling him a ‘pleb’ – launches a libel case against Mr Mitchell, it will seek to intervene in the legal battle in support of the former Chief Whip. Liberty believes that by holding the threat of legal action over those who disagree with the police’s version of events, it will become impossible to complain about the police’s actions. It is difficult to disagree. The rank and file of this country’s police force do a difficult job and, for the most part, they do it well. That’s why it’s a scandal that they are represented by this bullying, crony-filled organisation that raises members’ subscription fees to pay for swimming pools and grace-and-favour flats in Leatherhead, and lavish trips on which Federation officials run up huge bar bills. One police widow has accused Federation officials of treating what should have been a dignified memorial day for fallen officers like a ‘drunken jolly’. The Government must act quickly to return the Federation to its noble roots, and return effective representation to the police force.","New claims emerge about Police Federation's chaotic spending culture .

"By . Glen Owen . Arch-Blairite: Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke has revealed that he is 'pessimistic' about the Labour party¿s chances at the next General Election . Fears that Ed Miliband could be leading Labour to defeat against David Cameron were last night raised by one of the party’s most influential figures. Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke revealed that he was ‘pessimistic’ about the party’s chances at the next General Election. In an interview with Catholic newspaper The Tablet, Mr Clarke warned: ‘I don’t think the Opposition is doing very well at the moment.’ The blunt warning will chime with  the private fears of many Labour MPs who feel their party should be much further ahead of the Tories in the polls. Without mentioning the Labour leader by name, Mr Clarke – who backed Mr Miliband’s brother David in his leadership bid – laid bare his concerns Mr Cameron could cling on in No10. The former Norwich South MP said he did not think Labour was in a ‘very good state of affairs’ and hinted many colleagues were too optimistic about the outcome of the next Election. Mr Clarke said: ‘I’m pessimistic from a Labour point of view, more pessimistic than I think many in Labour are.’ Warning his party had to do more  to ‘earn respect’, the former Blairite heavyweight insisted the economy would determine the outcome of the 2015 contest. But he suggested the Coalition had wrongly succeeded in blaming the economic downturn entirely on Labour. He said: ‘I think the Government has succeeded with the – in my view, completely false – assertion that [the downturn] was all the fault of Labour. But I don’t think we contested it in the first few months, and I’m not even sure we’re really contesting it effectively now. 'Therefore the [Conservative] argument that says: “We’ve inherited this mess, we are certainly making progress .  .  . do you really want Labour to come back in?” – is going to be a very powerful argument.’ The remarks come two years after he raised doubts about the ‘coherence’ of Mr Miliband’s message to Labour’s 2011 party conference and warned Mr Miliband had a ‘long way to go’. He said then: ‘I didn’t think there was coherence, let’s put it politely, in what Ed Miliband was saying and the main job for the new team is to get a coherent set of policy propositions.’ Two Eds: Mr Clarke's comments follow polls . showing the public has more trust in David Cameron and George . Osborne to steer the country back to health than they do in the Labour . counterparts Ed Miliband and Ed Balls . Mr Clarke’s intervention comes amid mounting doubts among Labour MPs that Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls is the man to persuade voters to let Labour get their hands on the economy again. It also follows polling evidence the public has more trust in Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne to steer the country back to health than they do in Mr Miliband and Mr Balls. One Labour MP said: ‘Two years ago, Charles Clarke wasn’t convinced that Ed Miliband was the man to take us back into power. It looks as though he hasn’t really changed his mind.’","Former Home Secretary reveals he is 'pessimistic' about Labour's chances .

"By . Emily Davies . Attack: The words of Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, will be felt acutely by Ian Duncan Smith . Coalition austerity measures are a disgrace that have left people facing hunger and destitution, according to the country’s most senior Roman Catholic. Vincent Nichols said the Government had destroyed even the ‘basic safety net’ in welfare and the system had become ‘punitive’ toward those who did not understand it. ‘People do understand that we do need to tighten our belts and be much more responsible and careful in public expenditure,’ said the archbishop. ‘But I think what is happening is two things: one is that the basic safety net that was there to guarantee that people would not be left in hunger or in destitution has actually been torn apart. It no longer exists and that is a real, real dramatic crisis. 'And the second is that, in this context, the administration of social assistance, I am told, has become more and more punitive. ‘So if applicants don’t get it right then they have to wait for ten days, for two weeks with nothing – with nothing. For a country of our affluence, that quite frankly is a disgrace.’ His comments to the Daily Telegraph came as he prepared for a consistory in Rome at which he will receive a red cardinal’s hat. He is one of 19 clerics chosen by Pope Francis to be elevated to the highest rank of Roman Catholic clergy. It grants him a place in the conclave that will elect the next pope. As Archbishop of Westminster, he is the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales. His attack will be felt acutely by the Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who is a practising Roman Catholic. In December, the Tory minister accused Church of England bishops of unfairly criticising his reforms. The Church had launched a campaign of billboards bearing the slogan ‘Britain Isn’t Eating’. Hitting back: Work and Pensions Secretary Ian Duncan Smith has previously admonished members of the clergy for criticising his welfare reforms . But Mr Duncan Smith rejected the campaign in a letter, which was leaked to the media. He wrote: ‘I strongly refute this claim and would politely ask you to stop scaremongering in this way. ‘I understand that a feature of your business model must require you to continuously achieve publicity, but I’m concerned that you are now seeking to do this by making your political opposition to welfare reform overtly clear.’ Archbishop Nichols has spoken out in the past on issues such as lack of compassion in the Health Service and the negative impacts of social networking site Facebook. He attacked David Cameron’s Big Society push, which he said was failing, and last year condemned the Government for its ‘shameful’ response to the conflict in Syria. In 2012, he criticised the Prime Minister for supporting same-sex marriage and described the proposals as undemocratic as well as Orwellian.","Vincent Nichols, the Arhbishop of Westminster, attacked austerity .

"By . Annette Witheridge . The parents of Justina Pelletier - the teenager 'imprisoned' by Boston Children’s Hospital for the last year have today made a desperate plea for her return exactly a year after she was 'snatched' from them. When 15-year-old Justina was transferred to a residential psychiatric unit at the end of January her family hoped she would soon be on her way home. Instead, they say she is now desperately ill, in constant pain and barely able to move. They claim she is getting even less care than she was before. Desperate: Justina Pelletier, 15, has now spent a year in a psychiatric ward after she was taken from her parents against their will on doctor's orders . Happy: The family maintain that Justina was healthy and contented before she was taken. They said she was a keen ice-skater and loved hiking with her dog Roxie . Justina’s Kafkaesque nightmare began exactly one year ago when she was admitted to the world-renowned hospital suffering from flu. Doctors from nearby Tufts Medical Center diagnosed Justina with Mitochondrial Disease, a rare genetic muscle wasting illness, three years earlier. Her sister, Jessica, also suffers from it. She was put on medication with a treatment plan. But experts at Boston's Children’s Hospital said she had Somatoform Disorder, a stress-related mental illness where people 'imagine they are ill'. When Justina’s parents Lou and Linda tried to protest, hospital staff called welfare workers, who won custody claiming they were at risk of doing her harm by giving her the treatment prescribed by Tufts doctors. A report, written in April this year by one of the hospital's staff states how doctors took Justina off many of the medications she was taking at the time she was admitted. 'Due to concerns regarding Justina’s regressive behavior changes around her family, the multiple medical procedures and care episodes she has been through … and both parents’ resistance towards recommended treatment plans for Justina … a child protection team was convened,' it read. Justina was locked in a psychiatric ward, taken off the medication she had been taking and only allowed to see her family once a week. Since then, her parents have been battling the hospital and the Massachusetts Department of Children and Families to regain custody of their once vibrant daughter. 'Today is the anniversary of when she arrived at the prison,' Lou, a financial planner, told MailOnline. 'She is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly. Last month we were hopeful she could soon be on her way home but even that hope is fading. 'Justina is hanging on but she is desperately ill and getting worse. Fears: Lou and Linda say Justina 'is barely recognizable as her health has deteriorated so badly' We miss you: Sitting on Justina's bed at her Connecticut home are her sisters: From left, Julia, Jennifer and Jessica. Jessica, far right, has been diagnosed as having the same Mitochondrial Disease that Justina was being treated for before she was 'kidnapped' after a visit to Boston Children's Hospital with a bout of the flu. Doctors there diagnosed her with a mental condition called Somatoform Disorder instead . 'Her legs are paralyzed, she has no upper body strength and she is in constant pain because they have removed most of her medications. 'She suffered a stroke when she was seven and it affected her short-term memory. She is considered learning disabled, yet she has had no education in the last year. 'Justina did manage to sneak a few notes out of the hospital but she can’t do that anymore. She has forgotten how to write and spell. 'From what we can gather, she spends 24 hours a day lying in a room. It is a locked psychiatric unit full of children with major psychiatric problems. 'Justina doesn’t have psychiatric problems, she is ill and she needs proper medical care. Once a week she is taken on a three-hour round trip to see doctors but that is it. 'We are only allowed to see her for one hour a week at a Department of Children and Families office. Health aside, she is a mess. 'She’s in a wheelchair yet she is . getting no help with showering or grooming. When we saw her last it was . 20 degrees outside and her hair was wet.' Boston Children's Hospital have rarely commented on the case, but in a statement to MailOnline they said they were 'proud' of their work and the 'positive impact on the patient'. The hospital did not address the family's specific allegations. A gag order has been entered in a court case brought by the family. Justina . was diagnosed with Mitochondrial Disease three years ago. Her eldest . sister Jessica, 25, also suffers from it and both girls were being . treated by Dr Mark Korson at Tufts Medical Center. Ice-skating . fanatic Justina responded well to treatment after having two surgeries . to clear a blockage in her intestines and fit a port, so that her colon . could be flushed out daily with a saline solution. She was also put on a . cocktail of drugs. Proud: The hospital thanked its staff for a 'tremendous effort' and the 'positive impact on the patient' Fight: Justina was taken into the hospital's care against the wishes of her parents on February 14 last year. 'I am trying to save my daughter’s life,' Lou tells MailOnline. 'I don’t want her to be forgotten, lost in the system . Last February she went down with flu. Dr Korson was away and suggested she go to one of his colleagues at Boston Children’s. She was taken by ambulance from her home in West Hartford, Connecticut, to the hospital a two-hour drive away on February 10 last year. The next day her parents say they were confronted by a neurologist and psychiatrist who told them Mitochondrial Disease did not exist. 'They said she had Somatoform Disorder – effectively a mental problem. They were saying it was all in her head,' says Lou, 45. When Linda tried to take her back to . Tufts for a pre-arranged appointment on February 14, security guards . were called and child welfare workers stepped in. Since . then Justina’s parents have been in and out of court battling to get . her back. The next hearing is on Thursday but is closed to the . public. Dr Korson was . at their side during last month’s hearing and spoke to the court but he . is unable to comment publicly because the judge has placed a gag order . on all of the parties. 'I am trying to save my daughter’s life,' Lou tells MailOnline. 'I don’t want her to be forgotten, lost in the system. Suffering: Lous claimed that Justina is going through 'torture' - 'the sort of thing Kim Jong-un would be proud of in North Korea' 'She is desperately ill and we believe she isn't getting any help. Then there’s the stuff they are doing to her head, her mind. Justina was diagnosed with . mitochondrial disease several years ago, a genetic condition that . affects muscle coordination and mobility. The illness includes a group of neuromuscular diseases caused by damage to intracellular structures that produce energy. There is no cure for the condition that is progressive and can cause death. Symptoms can include weakness, intolerance for exercise, heart failure, dementia and rhythm disturbances. Every year 1,000 to 4,000 children in the United states are born with a mitochondrial disease. After . being admitted to Boston Children's Hospital in February however . doctors concluded the teenager was suffering from Somafotorm disorder, a . psychological condition that causes sufferers to feel pain, although . there is no physical cause for it. Sufferers do not feign the physical symptoms they feel, rather they present themselves as the result of mental strain. Doctors cannot identify the sources of patients' pain and instead prescribe anti-depressants.Patients can become increasingly frustrated with the diagnosis as there is seemingly no explanation for their symptoms. Experts . estimate that between 0.2 and 2 per cent of females and less than 0.2. per cent of men in the US suffer from the condition. 'Justina is getting no treatment at all. She just lies in a room unable to move. 'Last January she was in an ice skating competition. Now she is in a wheelchair. Her lower body is pretty much paralyzed and her upper body is very weak. She is in constant pain. 'The hospital . accused us of over medicating her yet everything we did was under her . regular doctor’s orders. Now she has been taken off the medications that . helped stabilize her and stop pain. 'What she is going through is torture – the sort of thing Kim Jong-Un would be proud of in North Korea. 'If I don’t fight for Justina she will disappear into the system. We’re hanging on and fighting for her but we are running out of gas. I am battling the very powerful medical world and the child welfare system.' Justina’s 11 months at Boston Children’s Hospital was spent in a single room on the locked psychiatric ward. She was rarely allowed to go outside for fresh air and her phone and computer were removed. Four friends were permitted to phone via the hospital occasionally but all of her calls were monitored. Lou says nothing has changed since she moved to the residential psychiatric unit. 'We get one 20-minute call a week,' he says. 'She can talk but the call is on speaker phone and is screened by staff. There is little we can even talk about.' One of the most heartbreaking aspects of Justina’s plight – first revealed by MailOnline in November – came when she confided to her sister Jennifer that Children’s Hospital staff had told her she was never going home. 'We try to stay strong for Justina but . it is getting harder and harder. And to see her health deteriorate so . quickly and to be helpless makes it worse,' says Lou. Fight: Lou and Linda say they try to stay strong for Justina 'but it is getting harder and harder. And to see her health deteriorate so quickly and to be helpless makes it worse' Boston Children’s Hospital said in a statement: 'Boston Children’s would like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of our staff in caring for this patient. We are proud of their work and positive impact on the patient. 'Boston Children’s and our clinicians are particularly distressed that the inaccuracies surrounding this case have caused undo concern for the many children and their families with Mitochondrial Disorders in our care.' The Massachusetts Department of Children and Families and the Wayside Youth residential unit in Framingham where Justina is now being held did not respond to calls for comment.","Justina Pelletier, 15, admitted to Boston Children's Hospital a year ago suffering from flu on suggestion of normal doctor who was away .

"By . James  Nye . Incredible footage reveals the moment a woman in Haiku City, China, was grabbed by her boyfriend and stuffed down a manhole - umbrella and all -  where she remained stuck for 60 hours until her cries for help alerted passers-by. Rescued wearing only her underwear, the woman was swollen and pale from her prolonged soaking and exhausted from spending nearly three days struggling to keep from drowning down the 10-foot hole. Plucked from the her watery tomb by pedestrians who heard her desperate screams for help, the woman had constructed a 'cloth ladder' to reach the manhole lid over the previous two days- only to find she was not strong enough to lift it up. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Set-up: The man is seen here positioning the cardboard over the open manhole ready for his assault on the woman (right) who was walking down the street in the rain . Violent: The man rushes the terrified woman over to the concealed manhole entrance and then proceeds to literally stuff her down it - umbrella and all . Shocking: The man takes only seconds to overpower the woman and make sure she falls down the 10-foot deep manhole . Entombed: The man calmly replaces the manhole lid- encasing the woman 3m down in the depths - covered in water, where she will stay for the next 60 hours . She had cried out for help on multiple occasions down the lonely street but on her rescue told police of her horrific ordeal. 'I did not sleep at all the first night I fell in the manhole. I could see the darkness around me. I thought that I would not be choked to death if I looked up,' she said. The woman, known only as Guo, revealed that she had been set upon during the night of December 12 by her boyfriend who owed her 100,000 yuan or around $16,500. The man, who also had the surname Guo, has been arrested by police for attempted murder. Almost three days later: The woman's cries for help are eventually heard and passers-by convene to help her to safety . Freedom: The woman is plucked from what she thought would be her watery grave - swollen from the water and pale from her ordeal . Recovery: The woman was taken to hospital where she was given treatment for her horrifying experience down the manhole . The woman, known only as Guo, said she tore her clothes into pieces and made a cloth ladder to get to the manhole lid. He was captured on surveillance camera at the scene previously lifting the manhole cover off and placing a piece of cardboard over the top. He then grabs the lady and in the rain and is runs her to the camouflaged hole and shoves her down it. The man told police he intended to kill the woman as he had an affair with her, but later confessed he tried to kill her because of the debt. Police said the suspect was a gambling addict.","Woman in Haiku City, China was rammed down a manhole by a man believed to be her boyfriend .

"By . David Williams . As snowboarder Jenny Jones rode to Winter Olympic glory yesterday, she knew she was being watched by millions. What she did not realise was that the crowd included two very important spectators – her parents. The 33-year-old, who won bronze in the slopestyle with spectacular jumps, leaps and grinds, had always banned her mother and father from coming to her competitions because it made her too nervous. But Peter and Helen Jones were not going to miss the chance to see their daughter win an Olympic medal – Britain’s first ever on snow – so they flew to Russia to surprise her. 'Hyperactive': The BBC has apologised after hundreds of viewers complained the broadcaster had spoiled Jenny Jones's Olympic bronze medal success and branded the commentators 'puerile and hyperactive' Shock: Jenny Jones realises her parents, who she believed were at home, were in the crowd as she competed, pictured left. She immediately rushed over to give them a hug, pictured right . Rad: Jones performs a stylish jump during her successful run. However, many viewers were less impressed with the BBC commentary .

Miss Jones burst into tears when she saw them at the finish point moments after realising she had taken bronze. After . their emotional embrace  Mrs Jones, from Bristol, said: ‘It’s . absolutely unbelievable, she has never  disappointed us. We have always . been proud of her but, blimey, this is the icing on the cake.’ Mr Jones added: ‘I need a whisky – I think we both need a drink and a long sleep. It’s been great coming out here.’ As well as her parents’ support, Miss Jones had the help of an unusual lucky charm – a tea bag tucked into her bra. The snowboarder, who was the oldest competitor by more than six years, said she felt ‘absolutely ecstatic’. ‘A . few said, “Is she past it?” but … I did the best run I could have . done … you sense the world is watching and you had to control that part . of things and not let it get to you too much. Apres-ski? British snowboarder Jenny Jones tweeted this, suggesting she might have gone out celebrating after her win. Viewers were repeatedly told viewers how sporting snowboarding rivals were .

I can’t . believe it’s our first on snow.’ She added: ‘It is still sinking in, the . history part … I absolutely had no idea of this when I was a chalet . maid cooking breakfast and cleaning toilets … it was just about . snowboarding.’ It was while . working on the ski slopes that Miss Jones developed her superstition. Missing British home comforts, she noticing some tea bags as she was . cleaning a room. ‘I put one . inside my bra so I could have a drink later,’ she revealed in an . interview in 2012. ‘I forgot all about it and went out snowboarding and . completed my first ever backflip. ‘It . was amazing. It was only later that I remembered the tea bag but it had . crumbled into a load of loose leaves. I couldn’t use them to make a . cuppa so I gathered them up and kept them for a couple of years until . they crumbled into nothing but they brought me more good luck.’ She has continued the ritual for competitions ever since.

I thought I did my best run . and landed it as best as I could, thankfully it was enough. That was a . long waiting game.’ Her triumph comes after a life  of hard work and . dedication to  snowboarding. Before working  as a chalet girl, she paid . her  way with jobs in a cardboard  factory and a doughnut shop. The . fearless sports star has also overcome horrendous injuries. Her most . recent accident was in December when she suffered bad concussion after . missing a jump and landing on her head, but she has also broken her . tailbone, two bones in her left arm and her foot.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Unexplained absence: Somerset County Council chief executive Sheila Wheeler has stepped down with a £40,000 pay-off after being off work for the last three months at the height of the flooding crisis . A £160,000-a-year council boss who has been off work throughout the entire flood crisis which has engulfed her county has stepped down with a £40,000 pay off. Somerset County Council chief executive Sheila Wheeler, 50, has been off on full pay for three months without a full public explanation during the area's biggest ever peace-time emergency. She left the council 'by mutual agreement' after a meeting behind closed doors on Wednesday night - but still offered no public reason for her departure. She will be paid three months' salary in lieu of notice amounting to £40,000 before tax. The authority - which is making £30 million of cuts - has continually refused to confirm the reasons behind her absence. Councillors said they had been threatened with legal action if they spoke about the matter. Speaking earlier this week, Justine Baker, the Lib Dem councillor for Bishop's Hull ward, said: 'We know part of the reason, but not the full reason. 'But we've been told we're not allowed to tell anyone for legal reasons to the extent we could be individually liable for legal action.' It was initially said Mrs Wheeler - who earned £18,000 per year more than the Prime Minister - was on sick leave. But in January a statement simply said she was 'not in the office'. It has been rumoured that her absence stems from a conflict with the Conservative leader of the council, John Osman. Drawn into the row: On a visit to the county this week, David Cameron was asked whether it made sense for Mrs Wheeler to be off work on full pay during the crisis, with taxpayers in the dark over the reasons . Leaving them to it: Mr Cameron said Mrs Wheeler's absence was a matter for the council to sort out . But Independent investigators who were called in to look into complaints against a number of staff found 'no wrong-doing'. A spokesman for the Conservative-led council said: 'We cannot go into further detail due to legal reasons. 'The reason the process has taken some time is because it was necessary to deal with a complaint that had been made against other individuals within the council. 'At the council’s request, the complaint was investigated by an independent QC who concluded that there was no wrong-doing by the individuals who were the subject of the complaint. 'We cannot go into details of that for legal reasons. The result though was an agreement that the CEO would leave the council by mutual agreement. 'We believe that this represents a sensible outcome for all concerned which will enable us to put the matter behind us and focus all our attention and energy on the important work of dealing with the ongoing floods.' Crisis: Mrs Wheeler has been away without an explanation during the county's biggest ever peace-time emergency after flooding devastated huge swathes of the area, including the village of Moorland (above) When David Cameron visited the flood-hit region on Wednesday, he was asked whether it made sense for Mrs Wheeler to be off work on full pay during the crisis, with taxpayers in the dark over the reasons. He said: 'This is for Somerset County Council to sort out. 'This is a matter for them but I don’t want people to be in any doubt in Somerset about who is in charge. 'The Gold Commander has been in charge. 'Gold and Silver have worked very well to bring together all the agencies, councils emergency services, Environment Agency, the military and volunteers. 'I have seen it for myself. I think the police have led this extremely well and will carry on leading.' The Liberal Democrat group walked out when the council went into private session to discuss Mrs Wheeler's future. Deluge: A road in Burrowbridge, Somerset, which has been flooded with several feet of water . Afterwards Sam Crabb, Lib Dem group leader confirmed the walk-out but said: 'Confidentiality prevents me from saying more.' It is understood that if agreement had not been reached disciplinary proceedings would have been ready to start. Mrs Wheeler started work at the council in February 2010, coinciding with the first austerity measures and major budget cuts. A spokesperson for the authority added: 'She led the council through a prolonged period where significant service and staffing reductions had to be made. 'Sheila has also brought major changes to the way the council operates and is run and we wish her well for the future.' They said until a replacement is found, deputy chief executive Patrick Flaherty will serve as the acting chief executive. Mrs Wheeler left the council 'by mutual agreement' after a meeting behind closed doors this week . He added: 'Pat has led the authority through the biggest crisis we have faced in decades with the current floods and has done so with considerable skill.' Mrs Wheeler joined Somerset County Council after working in local government for Adur District Council, Surrey County Council and the London Borough of Hounslow. Her time at Surrey also included a secondment to central government and she moved one of her authorities from a rating of 'weak' to 'excellent'. Mrs Wheeler’s remuneration for 2012-2013 is listed as £160,000 in salary with an employer pension contribution of £21,600. Mrs Wheeler declined to comment when approached at her £750,000 house near Creech St Michael, Somerset, today. Mr Osman was unavailable when contacted by MailOnline, but he had declined to comment earlier this week.","Chief executive Shelia Wheeler has not been at desk since mid-November .

"By . David Williams . and Emily Davies . and Jonathan McEvoy . and Kieran Corcoran . Olympic star Lizzy Yarnold was today enjoying the sweet taste of success - as she bit down on her gold medal after a presentation ceremony at the Winter Olympics. Basking in her victory in the skeleton competition, Miss Yarnold, 25, waved to the crowd and held her first-place medal - Britain's first in the 2014 games at Sochi - with evident pride. The former grammar school pupil had dominated the competition in Sochi yesterday, which saw her hurtle down an ice track at 80mph on a ‘tray’ nicknamed Mervyn. Scroll down for video .

With a time of 58.06, she beat American Noelle Pikus-Pace by just under a second . Victorious: Yarnold crosses the finish line 0.97 seconds ahead of her closest rival to claim the medal . Following her run Yarnold said the win was going to take a while to sink in . 'It's just me - Lizzy', she said in disbelief after the ceremony. 'I was crying before I even went out there. I had to look again and check that my medal was really this colour. 'It just made it worth every second of work - a whole lifetime of work - for this moment. I couldn't stop crying the whole way through. Royal mail is coming under pressure from MPs for refusing to mark Lizzy's win with a gold postbox at her home village of West Kingsdown in Kent . 'I cry a lot in private but when I've got a job to do I'm very set and serious. The ceremony was a lot more nerve-racking. I didn't know what to do out there.' After the last of her four runs yesterday she admitted she had been so confident of winning that she had even learned how to say ‘I’m champion’ in Russian. She had been cheered on at the track by the ‘Yarnie Army’ – her former PE teacher mother Judith, businessman dad Clive, and her sisters, Katie and Charlotte. Earlier today she was in tears on the podium as she held a Valentine’s Day card for her boyfriend James Roche, who works with the technical team for British Bobsleigh. Miss Yarnold, from Sevenoaks in Kent, said: ‘As an athlete you give up so much, but on a day like today, with a victory like today it’s so worth it. ‘I wanted to do myself justice and I can’t believe I won the race. It’s lovely that it’s Valentine’s Day today as well, there’s lots of romance in the air. ‘My mum and dad coming to watch me, my sisters, my best friends, everyone’s here that I can share it with; I couldn’t do it without them.’ Miss Yarnold had been determined to be a . successful sportswoman from the age of seven when she would beat her . farmer father Clive in races on the ski slope. Valentine: Yarnold was handed a valentine's card during the flower ceremony after her win . Young love: James Roach gives his golden girlfriend a kiss during the celebrations . Team Yarnold: As well as being her boyfriend, Roach is also Yarnold's coach . After prep school she had chosen to go to Maidstone Grammar School rather than accept an independent school scholarship so she could finish at 3.30pm to train as a county standard runner and swimmer. She had hoped to be selected for the modern pentathalon but after attending a Girls4Gold programme aimed at identifying future Olympic athletes she was told she was suited to the skeleton. After winning yesterday Miss Yarnold urged others to follow her example. She said: ‘Have a go, follow your dreams. Never limit yourself, never limit yourself to what you can achieve.’ Mr Yarnold said he had taught Lizzy to ski at the age of seven and soon she was beating him in races. Support: Yarnold's family were there to see her win, including sister Katie, father Clive and mother Judith . Yarmy army: Yarnold was watched over the line by her parents, friends and fans . Tearful moment: Fans, friends and family of Yarnold wept and she crossed the finish line in Sochi . He said: ‘She would get to the bottom and tell me to hurry up. ‘She was always a hard working, determined and dedicated girl, so strong mentally.’ To win gold Miss Yarnold had to negotiate a 1,500 metre course with 18 corners, a vertical drop of nearly 132m and an average gradient of 9.3 degrees. Her sled is nicknamed ‘Mervyn’ after Mervyn Sugden whom she met when she took a summer job at Hardy Underwriting – an insurance syndicate of Lloyd’s of London – to fund her training. Yarnold said the final run was a bit shaky, but that she had been relaxed and enjoyed it . Time lapse: A trick of photography captures a perfect turn by Yarnold which would have passed in milliseconds in real life . Making it look easy: With a commanding overnight lead, it would have taken a major error today to rob Britain of the title . Mr Sugden, a retired underwriter, was so impressed with her determination he brokered a deal with Lloyd & Partners to finance the British skeleton team to the tune of £100,000. Miss Yarnold, who relaxes by knitting and listening to the Archers, had been sent his good luck message before she competed. Before travelling to Sochi she had revealed the lengths she had gone to in order to achieve her Olympic dream. She had said: ‘Champions don’t happen by accident. ‘My whole life I have dreamt about becoming a British Olympian and for the last five years since I took up skeleton, Sochi 2014 has been my primary focus. ‘It helps if you are a little bit mad.  You have to totally embrace what you are doing and accept your fate.’ Miss Yarnold is such an accomplished all-round sportswoman that she also represented Britain last year in team bobsleigh, finishing seventh at the 2013 World Championships in Switzerland.

Extra practise: Other countries are worried that Russia has a secret training base in the mountains . On . Thursday, in warm conditions which saw a group of Canadians walk around . bare-chested, Yarnold was the coolest competitor about. She observed . her usual patterns of listening to music and napping between runs. Her first 80mph descent immediately put her in charge. Her second run kept her there. ‘I was relaxed as soon as I got to the track,’ said the 25-year-old. ‘As soon as I stepped on to the start . line my coach really settled me. Once I started, everything felt so . natural and I loved it. ‘I . don’t feel the pressure, I’ve not been thinking about other people’s . expectations because I’ve got such high expectations of myself anyway. On Sunday Jenny Jones won Britain's first medal of the Games, with a bronze in the snowboard slopestyle . Jones (right) claimed the win after an Austrian competitor Ann Gasser fell over on her final run . With Yarnold's gold added to Jones' bronze, Team GB is now just one medal off of its three medal target . ‘I’ve . tried lots of different things in training and brought that through . into competition. I didn’t get curve 14 on the first run right and it’s . an uphill section so that bled my time. But the first and second runs . are the fastest I’ve ever gone. It’s not a bad day.’ Pikus-Pace, highly fancied coming into the Olympics but suffering a bad back, said: ‘It is hers to lose, I guess.’ Not everyone was quite as gung-ho as that. Nigel Laughton, GB team leader, called the margin a ‘good lead but not insurmountable’. The atmospherics will be different on Friday — Riviera conditions giving way to black skies and floodlights and adding a further frisson of excitement to the drama unfolding on the icy, twisting descent. None will feel the tension more than the  travelling ‘Yarny Army’, comprising Yarnold’s friends and family. Yarnold was the day’s top British performer, eclipsing Shelley Rudman, the skeleton world champion, who struggled with the fast technical course and ended the day in 11th place. Creditable: James Woods finished in a respectable fifth place in the Skiing slopestyle final on Thurday . Another letdown for those of us watching was James Woods’ marginal failure to win a medal in the ski slopestyle. He seemed thrilled not only to have finished fifth, despite so painful a hip injury that it crossed his mind he might need to withdraw, but simply to be part of the jamboree. No British male skier has ever been placed as high as Woods at an  Olympic Games. Congratulations to all the British slopestylists. Five out of six have made it into the top 10 here. Jenny Jones, has won the country’s only medal of these Games, a bronze. Now over to Yarnold to add the bullion. ‘It’s as good as it gets,’ she said. Not quite. God willing, Russian skulduggery notwithstanding, that comes on Thursday night.","Lizzy Yarnold beat U.S. and Russian competitors yesterday to take gold .

"By . David Williams . and Will Stewart . EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton gave controversial Ukrainian opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko a warm embrace yesterday, as she promised the country help in fighting its financial crisis. The first senior foreign official to visit Ukraine’s capital Kiev since President Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown, Baroness Ashton urged Russia to allow its neighbour to move forward ‘in the way it chooses’. ‘We are here to say we want to support and help the country to stay strong and to go forward in the way it chooses to,’ she said. Embrace: Baroness Ashton hugged former president Yulia Tymoshenko after pledging to support Ukraine . ‘We also think it is very important to send a strong message about the territorial integrity, and the unity and the independence of Ukraine.’ Baroness Ashton said Ukraine needed ‘short-term help and long-term investment’, but any British involvement in a £19billion bailout has been described as ‘completely unacceptable’ by MPs. The meeting came on another day of dramatic developments which saw Yanukovych still on the run, his former chief of staff – and one of the few believed to know where he is – shot and wounded, and elite police officers suspected of shooting at protesters forced to beg for forgiveness from their colleagues. Amid extraordinary scenes in the city of Lviv, the officers were greeted with chants of ‘Shame!’ and ‘Tribunal!’ but claimed they had not killed or beaten people themselves. So far, only Yanukovych has been charged with crimes against humanity after the killing by security forces of 82 protesters in Kiev, but there were claims yesterday that secret documents linked a senior Moscow intelligence figure to an operation to wipe out protest leaders. If true, the papers could be hugely damaging to Russia, allegedly showing two secret operations to target protesters called ‘Boomerang’ and ‘Wave’. She said the country needs long-term investment and Russia 'must let it go forward in the way it chooses' Her words come as claims emerge that Moscow intelligence documents vow to wipe out protest leaders . Ukraine’s parliament yesterday called on the International Criminal Court to prosecute the deposed leader and his henchmen over the ‘mass murder’ of protesters. Interim president Oleksandr Turchinov also warned of ‘very dangerous signs of separatism’ in several regions, and was last night locked in meetings with his security services on how to prevent the country splitting in two – with half favouring ties with the EU, half with Russia. Significantly, an online petition calling on Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade eastern Ukraine was dramatically deleted last night after going viral on the Russian- language web. A map linked to the petition showed how Ukraine would look if Moscow annexed its eastern regions, creating a separate country or super-region called ‘New Russia’. In less than 24 hours, almost 100,000 had expressed support for dividing the country. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said authorities in Ukraine had taken power as a result of ‘armed mutiny’. Yesterday Russian military units denied reports that they had been involved in an operation to smuggle Yanukovych  to Moscow. The search for the Putin ally was further confused when chief of staff Andriy Klyuyev, one of the last men known to have been with him, was shot twice in the leg.","Baroness Aston pledged to support and help Ukraine to strengthen .

"By . Glen Owen . Theresa May has publicly rebuked her Cabinet colleague Vince Cable for claiming that last week’s figures about a steep increase in immigration were ‘good news’. The Home Secretary vented her anger at the Business Secretary and called on the Prime Minister to limit the movement of foreign labour. Lib Dem Mr Cable was responding to figures showing  that net migration to the UK jumped by 60,000 to 212,000 in the year to September 2013, powered by a 40 per cent rise  in the number of people taking advantage of European laws on free movement. Slapped down: Theresa May, the Home Secretary, left, has publicly rebuked her Cabinet colleague Vince Cable, right, for his claim that last week's figures showing a steep increase in immigration were 'good news' Mrs May, writing in today’s Mail on . Sunday, expresses her alarm at the figures, which come despite David . Cameron’s promise at the last Election to slash net migration to the . ‘tens of thousands’ by 2015. And she slapped down Mr Cable for claiming it was a sign of Britain’s booming economy. ‘Vince . Cable said this rise was “good news”. I do not agree,’ writes Mrs May, . before going on to complain: ‘At the moment we are bound by the treaties . that successive governments have signed. These mean we cannot impose . formal immigration controls on EU migrants.’ She . argues that Mr Cameron’s plans to claw back powers from Brussels prior . to a referendum on EU membership in 2017 should be used as an . opportunity to change European laws on migration. The Home Secretary . wants new member countries to reach a minimum level of wealth before . their workers are allowed to travel to the UK to find employment. Some . 24,000 citizens of Romania and Bulgaria arrived in the year to . September 2013 – nearly three times the 9,000 who arrived in the . previous year. Those numbers . are likely to rise, as the statistics pre-date the lifting of border . controls on Romanians and Bulgarians  on January 1. Mrs May stands near the border control gates at Heathrow Airport: She wants new EU member countries to reach a minimum level of wealth before their workers are allowed to travel to the UK to find work . Mr . Cable, who is to the left of most of the Lib Dems, and Mrs May, who is . on the right of the Tories, are both keen to establish their leadership . credentials ahead of any potential contest after the 2015 vote. In . his provocative remarks last week, Mr Cable said: ‘Actually, those . figures are good news because the reason net immigration is going up is . because fewer British people are emigrating and surely that’s a good . thing – people are getting jobs here.’ Mrs . May’s rebuke to Vince Cable came as former Tory Defence Secretary Liam . Fox warned Mr Cameron that he must ditch the ‘statistical nonsense’ of . his immigration policy and adopt a radical plan to reduce the number of . immigrants in Britain if the Prime Minister wants to win back voters . from UKIP. He added it would be ‘dangerous complacency’ if Mr Cameron were to ignore the electoral threat posed by UKIP.","Home Secretary calls on the Prime Minister to limit entry to foreign labour .

"By . Donna Sawyer . Troubled former swimming star Grant Hackett has been photographed half-naked and panicked in the foyer of Crown Casino in Melbourne. Pictures have emerged of Hackett, shirtless and barefoot as he desperately searches for his missing four-year-old son. A witness told the Herald Sun the former Olympic champion was in the foyer of the Casino, asking if anyone had seen his son Jagger. Panicked search: Grant Hackett searches for his four-year-old son Jagger in foyer of Crown Casino, Melbourne . Jagger had gone missing from the hotel room the family was staying in. He was later found safe and well by Crown Security within the casino complex, according to reports. It is unclear where exactly Jagger was found, but it is understood he was not on the gaming room floor or on any licensed premises. Hackett reportedly awoke in the early hours of Saturday morning when he realised his son had disappeared.

Marriage breakdown: Grant Hackett with ex-wife Candice Alley in November, 2010, at Melbourne Cup Day before splitting in April, 2012 . According to reports, Hackett was unable to locate the child in the room or the nearby corridors and ran into the foyer half-dressed asking for help. Hackett, who lives in Sydney, picked up Jagger and his twin sister Charlize and took them to Crown, where he regularly stays when in Melbourne. The former Olympic freestyle champion lives in Sydney following a nasty divorce with the twins’ mother, Candice Alley. The marriage ended in 2012, with Hackett later admiting in an interview he was rliant on Stillnox sleeping pills towards the end of his swimming career.

"By . Associated Press . North Korea fired two more suspected short-range missiles into the sea this morning in another apparent protest against ongoing U.S.-South Korean military exercises that Pyongyang calls a preparation for attack, South Korean officials said. The launches followed South Korea's announcement last week that North Korea fired four short-range Scud missiles with a range of more than 125 miles into the country's eastern waters. North Korea routinely test-fires short-range missiles but has recently pushed for improved ties with South Korea and taken conciliatory gestures, including rare reunions of families divided by the Korean War last month. Scroll down for video . Mystery: The North Korean projectiles were suspected to be Scud missiles but they could also be an upgraded version of its newly developed surface-to-ship KN-02 missiles or new types of artillery . The recent launches aren't expected to raise tensions in the region, as was the case last spring when the rival Koreas exchanged repeated threats of war following a third nuclear test by the North. The two projectiles blasted from the North's east coast today flew about 310 miles before landing in the sea, South Korean Defense Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok told reporters. He said the launches were made without a prior notice, and described them as a provocation posing a serious threat to international aviation and maritime navigation and civilian safety. 'North Korea is doing an act of double standard by taking a peace offensive ostensibly, but later launching reckless provocative acts,' he added. South Korea is trying to confirm what exactly North Korea fired based on the speed and trajectory of the projectiles, but an initial investigation showed they were suspected to be Scud-series missiles, a Defense Ministry official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with department rules. United: Experts believe the launches are part of North Korean military training aimed at coping with the ongoing South Korea-U.S. military drills (pictured) which the country has called preparation for an attack . Reckless: Kim Jong-un on a recent tour of an electronics factory in Pyongyang, North Korea. South Korea have accused him of 'taking a peace offensive ostensibly, but later launching reckless provocative acts' Chang Yong Seok of the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies at the Seoul National University said that the launches appeared to be part of North Korean military training aimed at coping with the South Korea-U.S. drills. He said that tensions could be heightened if North Korea tested a longer-range missile capable of hitting Japan or the U.S. territory of Guam. Analysts say the North's recent charm offensive toward South Korea is largely aimed at helping lure foreign investment and aid to help revive the country's troubled economy. The two Koreas are divided along the world's most heavily fortified border since the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 American troops are deployed in South Korea, apparently as a deterrent against potential aggression from North Korea. South Korea and the U.S. have said they have no intentions of invading North Korea and that their drills are defensive in nature.","Short-range Scud missiles fired into sea off North Korea's eastern coast .

"By . Glen Owen, Mail on Sunday Political Correspondent . Questioned: Ex-UKIP candidate John White, who was called into the police after a diatribe comparing Stephen Lawrence to an ape . A Tory MP called in the police after his UKIP opponent sent him a grotesque diatribe comparing  the family of murdered Stephen Lawrence to apes. Tory MP Peter Luff has revealed that John White, who stood for UKIP in Mid-Worcestershire at the 2010 General Election, emailed Mr Luff to ask if it was ‘a joke’ that Baroness Lawrence had received a peerage. Mr White attached a tirade by a racist internet commentator, who wrote that the peerage made him ‘ashamed to be British’. Shockingly, the commentator – who called himself ‘Pete Lucas’ – goes on to say: ‘Mrs Lawrence should be elevated higher than the indigenous Brit, which she would normally be, due to the preference of her species for dwelling in high places’ – seemingly a reference to monkeys. ‘Pete’ goes on to describe the peerage as ‘treason’ and says this ‘latest ludicrous elevation of an ethnic-minority woman to baroness on the grounds of her being black with the distinction of having had a son murdered (sic) by white-men, is a crass injustice’. Sic is a Latin term used to highlight an apparent mistake – indicating that ‘Pete’ does not believe that Stephen’s death counted as murder. After Mr Luff told Mr White that he was ‘truly appalled’ by the email, an unapologetic Mr White replied that his nephew had been murdered ‘by some foreigner’ and claimed that the case remained ‘unsolved’ because the victim’s mother was ‘a white British citizen’. Mr Luff referred the email exchange to the police – who concluded that although the content was ‘deeply unpleasant’ it did not constitute a crime. Last night Mr White, 71, confirmed he had been visited by West Mercia police a fortnight ago over the email. He said: ‘I told them that I had forwarded the email and still agreed with it. Murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence (left) and Doreen Lawrence (right) who were insulted in the racist e-mail by John White . 'As far as I’m concerned we have freedom of speech in this country and I will say what I think. ‘I’m not frightened to speak and say what other people are too frightened to say. I’m not racist. I have black and Polish friends but I think it’s wrong that people play the race card just to prove a point. ‘The police wanted to know who Pete Lucas was but I told them I had no idea and they said the case was closed as far as I was concerned. ‘I don’t understand why the Stephen Lawrence case is still going on. It’s been 21 years and it’s time everyone moved on. That’s why I sent it. I still agree with it.’ Mr White claimed he didn’t agree with the ‘monkey’ reference, but still did not regret sending the  email. He added that he had let his UKIP membership ‘lapse’ a couple of years ago. The row comes just days after a damning report revealed the full extent of corruption by officers investigating Stephen’s death, including a police cover-up and a ‘spying operation’ on the grieving family by an undercover unit. UKIP leader Nigel Farage has battled to contain a string of revelations about the views held by some of his candidates . Stephen, 18, was stabbed to death by a group of up to six white youths in an unprovoked racist attack at a bus stop in Eltham, South-East London, on April 22, 1993. Baroness Lawrence fought back tears in the House of Lords last week as she reacted to the report by barrister Mark Ellison QC. Last night, a UKIP spokesman said that Mr White was no longer a member of the party. He added: ‘UKIP abhors racism and takes all allegations of racism extremely seriously. 'John White left UKIP in 2012 after becoming unhappy about the direction of the party.’ Mr White, who won more than 3,000 votes at the last Election, was a member of the Labour Party for 33 years, switching to UKIP when Gordon Brown became  Labour leader. Last night Mr Luff told The Mail on Sunday: ‘One only has to see the dignity with which Lady Lawrence has reacted to this week’s revelations to realise how much she deserved her place in the Lords. ‘This exposes UKIP for the narrow-minded bigots they really are.’ UKIP leader Nigel Farage has battled to contain a string of revelations about the views held by some of his candidates. Last week he pledged to weed out ‘eccentric’ candidates who have ‘skeletons in their cupboards’, and said everyone who wanted to stand as an MP or an MEP would have to sign a charter to prove they are not extremists. As a result all new candidates now have to make a written declaration that they have ‘never engaged in, advocated or condoned racist, violent, criminal or anti- democratic activity’.

"By . Emily Kent Smith . He may be known for his dashing looks and command a worldwide fanbase but Harry Styles' home town is the least musically sophisticated place in Britain, a study has found. The odds could have been stacked against Mr Styles after research, which maps musical ability by area, revealed that Redditch tops the list for its lack of musical ear. The 20-year-old's birthplace was ranked number one for its failure to engage with music and lack of musical sophistication. Scroll down for video . The survey found that those living in certain areas of the country were more musically talented. Harry Styles' birth place, Redditch in Worcestershire came out as the least musical place in the UK . Mapped: The UK hotspots for having and not having musical talent according to researchers . But 185 miles away, talent is rife. Hastings was tipped to be the place with the highest level of musical ability. The East Sussex town is also the home of Andy Bell, from 90s pop band Erasure, who shot to fame for songs such as Chains of Love and Sometimes. In second and third place came West Somerset and North Dorset. North Dorset is also the home of  Madonna. Several spots behind, Bob Geldof's home town of Swale in Kent came out as number 10 in the musically talented list. And as well as mapping out where the musically talented live, the study found that wealth influences musical ability. The research into music psychology was published in science journal PLOS ONE. It's no Boomtown: The hometown of Bob Geldof, Swale in Kent, is not known for it's musical talent. The 62-year-old lives in the town featured in the top 10 worst places for musical ability in the UK. The research was completed by Goldsmiths University and BBC Lab UK . Erasure frontman Andy Bell's hometown Hastings, in East Sussex, was ranking the number one town in the UK for musical ability . Material Girl: Residents in North Dorset, Madonna's stomping ground are the most musical according to the research carried out by Goldsmiths University and BBC Lab UK . The results came after Goldsmiths, University of London and BBC Lab UK surveyed more than 94,000 people across the UK. Those surveyed answered questions on musical background and musical habits as well as listening tests. Researchers found that those with musical training . had a clear advantage on the listening tests where they were asked to . do things like remember distinctive tunes. Duffy may sing about Warwick Avenue in London but she is actually originally from Gwynedd in north west Wales. The area was ranked number 10 in the top 10 for musically talented areas in the UK . After analysing the answers, results concluded that musical skills and ability are not evenly distributed across the population and that ability can be linked to a person's profession, education level and income. Learning to play an instrument is . strongly linked to household income with those with the highest level of musical . training living in London, . Cambridge, York, Cherwell, and Oxford. An ability to hold a tune is also more common during 'flexible' periods of life- such as school, university or when a person is self-employed. But Wales and the West Country - not . economically wealthy areas - bucked the trend proving that high income . and musical aptitude are not always linked. Hear'Say . star Suzanne Shaw may not be pleased to hear that her hometown, . Christchurch in Dorset, features on the 'least musically sophisticated' list, alongside Anglesey in Wales and Boston in Lincolnshire. London boy Pete Doherty lives in one of the most musically talented areas in the UK, according to research by Goldsmiths University. The 34-year-old's place of residence, Hackney, came out at number nine in the musical talent ranking . Kinks singers Pete Quaife, Ray Davies, Mick Avory and Dave Davies hail from Haringey. The north London borough was voted the fifth most musically talented location in the UK . Redditch, in Worcestershire, hometown of Harry Styles, was ranked the least musical place in the UK, according to the research . Parts of Britain with the highest levels of musical sophistication include the London boroughs of Hackney, home to ex-Libertines frontman Pete Doherty, and Haringey, where The Kinks started out. Blaenau Gwent in South Wales and Gwynedd, the hometown of singer Duffy located in the the north-west of the country, ranked fourth and tenth for their talent. Dr Daniel Mullensiefen, lead researcher on the project from the Department of Psychology at Goldsmiths, said: 'It was fascinating to be involved in this study - the largest of its kind ever to be undertaken - and it was exciting to map out for the first time how musical expertise is spread across an entire nation. 'The most intriguing result for me is to be able to see on a map how musical skills are related to social conditions of our modern lives. 'Perhaps the most surprising result was the relationship between income and musicality. 'With a couple of exceptions, people who lived in postcode areas with a higher average income performed better in the music ability tests. The next question we're going to tackle is the cause behind this relationship.'

Dr Daniel Mullensiefen, one of the Goldsmiths University lecturers who carried out the study said results showed that men have a better sense of beat. The professor, from the Department of Psychology at the university said that a worldwide survey of 147,000 participants showed that men had a better sense of beat than women. 'Women achieved significantly lower beat perception scores than men,' Dr Mullensiefen said. Although men have a four per cent better beat perception, he said that they could be worse at dancing than women because: 'they have the skill but are unable to turn it in to movement'. The results came from a survey which mapped the places in the UK with the highest level of musical ability.

"By . Simon Walters, Mail on Sunday Political Editor . Labour junket king Barry Gardiner faced new flak last night over plans to defy Ed Miliband and go on another all-expenses-paid trip to Mexico, funded by a climate change lobby group. Mr Gardiner, Labour’s environment spokesman who is responsible for the party’s floods policy, issued a grovelling apology last week after The Mail on Sunday revealed how he left the deluged UK to spend a week in Mexico with his wife Caroline. But party insiders say he is threatening to refuse to scrap plans to visit the country again in June on another free trip. That could even lead to him being fired from Labour’s front bench. Exposed: The Mail on Sunday story last week about Barry Gardiner's trip to Mexico . Mr Gardiner relaxing in the pool at the Cancun resort and with his wife Caroline . Much of Mr Gardiner's travel has been funded by a lobbying group, Globe International . Mr Gardiner was carpeted by Labour Chief Whip Rosie Winterton on Monday after this newspaper revealed how flights and a week-long stay at a £325-a-night hotel for the MP and his wife were paid for by a pharmaceuticals firm run by a Labour donor. We also disclosed how Brent North MP Mr Gardiner, who is Labour’s ‘climate change envoy’, has spent 157 days on foreign jaunts at a cost of more than £100,000. Most of it was bankrolled by Globe International, a climate change organisation. In a severe dressing-down, Ms Winterton told Mr Gardiner he was banned from going on more junkets. He subsequently pulled out of a two-day Globe-funded trip to Washington DC scheduled for Thursday and Friday.

A place in the sun: Mr Gardiner was able to bring his wife on the trip to a luxury resort in Cancun . But he is said to have dug in his heels over his plan to return to Mexico for a meeting between June 6 and 8, with the estimated £1,500 cost met once again by Globe. The visit will take to 101 his total number of days of Globe-sponsored foreign travel, at a cost approaching £60,000. After The Mail on Sunday revealed the MP’s trip to the  Mayan Riviera last week, Mr Gardiner said he had made an ‘error of judgment’ and apologised for ‘any hurt’ his actions caused to victims of the floods. He said: ‘I honoured a commitment to speak to a pharmacy industry conference about waste. After three days attending the conference I remained on holiday for two further days with my wife before flying back to the UK. ‘At a time when parts of the UK were still recovering from the floods, I am conscious in retrospect that it would have been  better to have cancelled my participation in the conference, and I regret any hurt this has caused to those still coping with the aftermath of flood damage to their homes and property.’ Mr Gardiner refused to comment yesterday.","Barry Gardiner's trip to Mexico was taken when floods deluged the UK .

"By . Sophie Jane Evans . This carved four-poster bed could be where Henry VIII was conceived - and may be worth a staggering £20million. Featuring oak wood, intricate carvings and a bible inscription the ornate bed was sold at auction for just £2,200 after being dumped in a hotel car park in Chester. But it is now considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in England after being identified as the bed which belonged to Henry VII. Fit for a royal? This four-poster could be the bed in which Henry VIII was conceived - and may be worth £20m . Valuable: The bed (left) - featuring oak wood and intricate carvings (right) - was sold at auction for just £2,200 after being dumped in a hotel car park in Chester. But it is now considered one of the most valuable pieces of historical furniture in England after being identified as the bed of the royal's father, Henry VII, and his wife . The impressive item was created for the marriage of the first Tudor King and his wife, Elizabeth of York, on January 18, 1486, according to the Sunday Times. It is highly likely that the couple's son, Henry, was conceived in the bed - meaning the item may have a physical link to the beginning of the Tudor dynasty. Born at Greenwich Palace in 1491, Henry VIII was the third child and second son of Henry VII and his wife. Powerful: Henry VIII, the second son of Henry VII, turned England in favour of Protestantism . Only three of his six siblings survived infancy - and he succeeded his father as king following his death on 22 April, 1509. Under Henry VIII's reign, England turned in favour of Protestantism and split from Rome, the Royal Navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships and the country invaded France. Jonathan Foyle, chief executive of World Monuments Fund Britain, said: 'This bed belonged to Henry VIII. It has to be the most important piece of furniture [in England' - and arguably, royal artefact.' He added: 'Even the Westminster coronation chair has less to say than this.' Experts believe Henry VII may have taken the bed north while on a royal tour following the birth of his son. More than five centuries later, it was discovered dismantled and dumped in the car park of Chester's Redland Hotel, which was being turned into flats. It was later bought at auction by Ian Coulson, a restorer of four-poster beds, where it was described as being 'Victorian'. In 2010, Mr Coulson approached Mr Foyle with a suspicion that the bed was, in fact, the only surviving Tudor bed - and Mr Foyle agreed. Since then, Mr Foyle has been trying to prove the artefact's historical roots. He has traced it back to 1495, when Henry VII went to Lathom in Lanchashire to see the Stanley family, who had helped him to victory in the Battle of Bosworth in 1485. King: The bed was created for the marriage of the first Tudor King, Henry VII (pictured left and right) and his wife, Elizabeth of York, on January 18, 1486. It is highly likely the couple's son, Henry, was conceived in the bed . He has also discovered the bed features . an inscription from the Matthew Bible of 1537 - reading: 'The stinge of . death is sinne. The strength of sinne is the lawe' - which was added . after 1547, when England had a Protestant monarch. Meanwhile, a Victorian furniture restorer's diary has suggested that the bed was at Lathom when it was damaged during a siege in 1644. Mr Foyle said he had proved that the item was not the work of Victorian revivalists by reflecting on the Tudors' belief that they had been chosen by God to save England from civil war. Proof? Jonathan Foyle, chief executive of World Monuments Fund Britain, has been trying to prove the artefact's historical roots since 2010. He said it was not made by Victorian revivalists because the headboard showed  Adam (Henry VII) and Eve (his wife) transmuted into Christ . Important rediscovery: Mr Foyle's views are backed by other experts, such as Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University, who deems the rediscovery 'exceptionally important' He said the headboard showed Henry VII . and his bride as Adam and Eve transmuted into Christ - adding: 'It's . arguably the cradle of the English Reformation. 'Look how the king and queen represent themselves as manifestations of Christ and Mary; it's Henry VIII's God complex in a nutshell.' And Mr Foyle is backed by other experts, such as Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University, who deems the rediscovery 'exceptionally important'. Portrayal: Under Henry VIII's reign, England split from Rome and the Royal Navy built up a fleet of about 50 ships. Above Henry VIII (Daniel Flynn) and Anne Boleyn (Tara Breathnach) in The Last Days of Anne Boleyn . Mighty: Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and Catherine Parr/Lady Latimer (Joley Richardson) in The Tudors . The bed is not the only historical royal artefact to have been discovered abandoned or hidden in England. Last year, the battle-scarred skeleton of Richard III was discovered by archaeologists in a car park in Leicester. And earlier this year, explorers found a piece of a pelvis that could belong to Alfred the Great in the grounds of Hyde Abbey in Winchester.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Care home nurse Osironke Olugbile, 53, has been struck off after she was caught dragging a screaming resident to bed by the hair . A care home nurse has been struck off after she was caught dragging a screaming resident to bed by the hair. Osironke Olugbile, 53, also barricaded residents in their rooms, dressed them in multiple incontinence pads and switched off the call bell so they would not disturb her during the night. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) heard that, in addition, Olugbile left pensioners fully clothed overnight so that she did not have to dress them in the morning at the Bupa-run Collingwood Court Nursing Centre in Clapham, south London. Finding that Olugbile’s actions amounted to ‘serious abuse’, the NMC ordered that her name be struck from the register. Olugbile was caught when a care assistant, identified as Mr 1, witnessed the hair-pulling incident when the door to a resident’s room was left ajar. Giving evidence, Mr 1 said he was initially worried about making a complaint after Olugbile said she had a friend with supernatural powers. ‘I was hesitant to report the issue to management because Ronke [Olugbile’s nickname] would often comment that she has someone back home, in Africa, with supernatural powers who will do whatever she says, to the point of killing someone if necessary,’ Mr 1 told the hearing. Robert Benzyne, for the NMC, told the panel that Mr 1 witnessed the abuse on August 6, 2010. ‘He approached room 59 where he heard screaming and shouting. The door to the room was ajar and he witnessed the registrant pulling Resident A’s hair trying to get her to bed.’ She also turned off the call bell on several occasions, it was said, preventing vulnerable patients from summoning help. The nurse, who had claimed she was a victim of a ‘conspiracy’, was struck off the register and will not be able to apply for restoration for five years. NMC panel chairman Clive Powell said: ‘The panel determined that some of your conduct amounted to serious abuse. The 53-year-old barricaded residents in their rooms at Collingwood Court Nursing Centre in Clapham, south London. The Nursing and Midwifery Council heard she left pensioners fully clothed overnight so she didn't have to dress them in the morning, and switched off call bells preventing them from seeking help . 'The panel is of the view that you . demonstrated deep-seated attitudinal and personality issues and a . complete lack of insight into your failings. ‘Your overall failure . to accept responsibility and accountability for the patients in your . care, despite being the nurse in charge and being a role model for your . colleagues was a serious concern to the panel. ‘The panel noted its determination on impairment, in particular: The panel determined that some of your conduct in relation to the vulnerable residents at the Home amounted to serious abuse. ‘The panel noted that you have not shown any remorse or regret. ‘You have denied these charges from the beginning and have sought to blame others and accuse them of lying. ‘You have sought to abdicate yourself from any personal responsibility for your actions.' He added: 'The conduct, as highlighted by the . facts found proved, was an absolute departure from the standards . expected of a registered nurse. ‘The panel felt that the serious . breach of the fundamental tenets of the profession evidenced by your . actions is fundamentally incompatible with your remaining on the . register.’ Olugbile worked at the Collingwood Court Nursing Centre between 27 March 2006 and 9 February 2011 after registering as a nurse in 2005.","Osironke Olugbile was struck off by the Nursing and Midwifery Council .

"By . Glen Owen . and Brendan Carlin . MPs are blocking a plan by Speaker John Bercow to install a ‘bullying helpline’ for Commons staff amid fears it would be swamped by the volume of complaints. The proposal followed a string of allegations about MPs shouting, swearing, hurling staplers and sacking staff by Post-it note. The Mail on Sunday has learned Mr Bercow is also investigating claims that sexual harassment is ‘out of control’ at Westminster, with staff too frightened to blow the whistle in case it jeopardises their job prospects. Thwarted: Commons Speaker John Bercow attempted to close a loophole so MPs' staff could complain about bullying, but he was voted down at a recent meeting of the House of Commons Commission . A complaints procedure already exists for officials employed directly by the Commons – but it does not apply to MPs’ staff. When Mr Bercow suggested closing the loophole at a recent meeting of the House of Commons Commission – its supervisory body – he was voted down. Sources say MPs from the three main parties insisted they could not meddle in the relationship between MPs and their staff. But one said: ‘The employment thing is a fig leaf. If you set up a helpline it would be absolutely inundated. Do you know what this place is like? It would be carnage.’ Talk of MPs mistreating staff is rife, with some said to get through ‘dozens of employees’ because of their tempers.

"By . James Rush . Images have emerged of two plane tickets believed to have been purchased using stolen passports for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight. As relatives of the 239 people on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 continued to wait anxiously for news of their loved ones, attention has focused on how two passengers boarded the aircraft using stolen passports. Pictures have now emerged of what appears to be the tickets purchased by the stolen passport users, as Malaysian police say one of them has been identified. Scroll down for video . Images of two plane tickets believed to have been purchased for the missing Malaysian Airlines flight using stolen passports have emerged . The two stolen passports, one belonging to Austrian Christian Kozel and the other to Luigi Maraldi of Italy, were entered into Interpol's database after they were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and last year, the police body said . Interpol has confirmed it knew about the stolen passports but said no authorities checked its vast databases on stolen documents before the jet departed. Warning that 'only a handful of countries' routinely make such checks, Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble chided authorities for 'waiting for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates'. There was no indication that the two men had anything to do with the tragedy, but the thefts of the passports added a twist to the plane's mysterious disappearance. The two stolen passports, one belonging to Austrian Christian Kozel and the other to Luigi Maraldi of Italy, were entered into Interpol's database after they were stolen in Thailand in 2012 and last year, the police body said. Electronic booking records show that one-way tickets with those names were issued Thursday from a travel agency in the beach resort of Pattaya in eastern Thailand. Thai police Col. Supachai Phuykaeokam said those reservations were placed with the agency by a second travel agency in Pattaya, which in turn made the bookings through a China Southern Airlines office in Bangkok. Italian Luigi Maraldi, whose stolen passport was used by a passenger boarding the missing Malaysian airliner, shows his passport as he reports himself to Thai police at Phuket police station in Phuket province, southern Thailand on Sunday . Members of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) scan the seas about 140 nautical miles north-east of Kota Baru, Malaysia, for any signs of the missing Malaysia Airlines plane . The owners of the second Pattaya travel agency, which police said caters mostly to Iranian travelers, refused to talk to reporters. Thai police and Interpol officers went in to question the owners. Malaysian Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said on Sunday that officials have footage of the two men, and were examining it. He said local and international intelligence agencies were involved in the investigation. A telephone operator on a China-based KLM hotline confirmed Sunday that passengers named Maraldi and Kozel had been booked on one-way tickets on the same KLM flight, flying from Beijing to Amsterdam on Saturday. Maraldi was to fly on to Copenhagen, Denmark, and Kozel to Frankfurt, Germany. As holders of EU passports with onward flights to Europe, the passengers would not have needed visas for China.

Vietnamese military personnel prepare a helicopter for a search and rescue mission for the missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 off Vietnam's southern coastline . Interpol said it and national investigators were working to determine the true identities of those who used the stolen passports to board the flight. Interpol has long sounded the alarm that growing international travel has underpinned a new market for identity theft: Bogus passports are mostly used by illegal immigrants, but also pretty much anyone looking to travel unnoticed such as drug runners or terrorists. More than 1 billion times last year, travellers boarded planes without their passports being checked against Interpol's database of 40 million stolen or lost travel documents, the police agency said. Azharuddin also said the baggage of five passengers who had checked in to the flight but did not board the plane was removed before it departed. Airport security was strict according to international standards, surveillance has been done and the airport has been audited, he said.","Images emerge of what appears to be tickets bought using stolen passports .

"By . Simon Walters And Brendan Carlin . Ed Miliband faced a growing crisis last night after a key aide threatened to quit over a vicious feud that has split Labour’s high command. Furious Shadow Minister Michael Dugher told the Labour leader he wanted to resign, claiming he could no longer work with Douglas Alexander, who is masterminding the party’s General Election strategy. Mr Dugher is said to have told Mr Miliband: ‘Douglas is totally bloody impossible. Everybody says it. You have got to do something about him.’ Ed Miliband calls for the party not to panic after a pool showed their lead over the Tories had disappeared have seemingly gone ignored after a row erupted within his Election team . The row intensified after it emerged that Election guru Arnie Graf, who mentored Barack Obama and was brought in to secure a Miliband win, has returned to his native US amid claims he was sacked by Shadow Foreign Secretary Mr Alexander. And last week Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls was said to have snubbed Mr Alexander at a crisis meeting chaired by Mr Miliband. The feud follows post-Budget polls suggesting the Tories have narrowed Labour’s lead to a wafer-thin one per cent. Labour support was last night pegged  at just 33 per cent. Mr Miliband used a meeting of the Shadow Cabinet on Tuesday to issue a ‘Don’t panic!’ cry to MPs, saying ‘We must not be knocked off course by a few bad headlines or adverse poll results.’ It prompted one Labour MP to compare his response to Corporal Jones from Dad’s Army. The rows relate to Mr Miliband’s ‘safety first’ Election strategy, spearheaded by Mr Alexander, which relies on the Tories losing votes to UKIP. Mr Dugher is Mr Miliband’s ‘enforcer,’ tasked with leading Labour’s strategy against the Tories. He has had a series of rows with Mr Alexander, claiming he has been ‘shut out’. Write caption here . Mr Balls was accused of ‘showing his contempt’ for Mr Alexander by refusing to respond after the Shadow Foreign Secretary’s 30-minute presentation to Cabinet colleagues on his Election plans. ‘Balls is usually first to speak, but arrived late and sat looking at his shoes,’ said one source. ‘He and Douglas hate each other. If Dougie found the Holy Grail, Balls would oppose it. It can’t go on, but Miliband is too weak to intervene.’ The departure of Mr Graf, 70, follows arguments with Mr Alexander, who is said to have regarded the American’s  strategies as a ‘waste of time and money’. Mr Graf’s own credibility suffered a hammer blow when it was revealed he was in the UK without a work permit. The leak came shortly after he crossed swords with Mr Alexander. Allies of Mr Graf claimed he was the victim of a dirty tricks plot by Labour enemies. Mr Graf was a close ally of Labour policy review chief Jon Cruddas, who party insiders say was linked to a public letter last week by leading Labour thinkers urging Mr Miliband to be bolder in his Election plans. Mr Dugher last night denied that he threatened to resign.","Ed Miliband called for party not to panic after poll lead disappeared .

"By . Simon Walters . and Brendan Carlin . Jennie Bone (right), the wife of Tory MP for Wellingborough Peter Bone, claims bullying police have caused the cancer she suffered 10 years ago to return after finding a lump in her breast . The wife of a senior Tory MP accused of a £100,000 fraud over a subsidised care home for her mother has spoken of her fears of going to jail – and vowed to clear their name. In a highly emotional interview with The Mail on Sunday, Jennie Bone claimed the stress of the case had caused a recurrence of the cancer that nearly took her life ten years ago. Mrs Bone and her husband Peter, the Conservative MP for Wellingborough, vehemently deny that they sold the house of Mrs Bone’s mother to clear their own debts and avoid paying the full £26,000-a-year cost of her local authority nursing home. The couple, under investigation by police for nearly a year, said they would fight to prove their innocence. But they are well aware that, if charged and found guilty, they face personal and political ruin. ‘It’s an absolute nightmare. It’s killing us both,’ revealed Mrs Bone. She also said her 81-year-old mother would not be able to cope if they were jailed and she felt ‘violated’ by a police search of their home, which was ‘like a scene from A Touch of Frost’. She claimed police tried to ‘bully’ them into acquiescing to the council’s demand that they pay back the costs for her mother’s care. Mr Bone claimed he was targeted by police after defending former Cabinet Minister Andrew Mitchell over the ‘Plebgate’ affair. The MP, who has demanded ‘zero tolerance’ of crime, said: ‘If it was true, I’m a complete crook and should be locked up and the keys thrown away. But it’s not true.’ He also claimed political enemies had conspired with police to smear him. Until last week, Mr Bone, 61, was known at Westminster chiefly for his jocular habit of referring to his wife during questions to David Cameron. It prompted the Prime Minister to quip: ‘A very big part of my life is trying to give pleasure to Mrs Bone.’ But the couple were in a mirthless mood when they spoke to The Mail on Sunday on Thursday. The police are investigating the sale of the £130,000 Essex home of Mrs Bone’s mother, Dorothy Sweeney, seven years ago, before she moved into care. The couple are accused of a £100,000 fraud. They deny they sold Mrs Bone's mother's house to clear their own debts and avoid paying the full £26,000-a-year costs for Highmead House Residential Care Home . The Bones admit a large chunk of the money from the sale was used to pay off their debts, which they say built up when Mr Bone took time off to look after their son, Thomas, 13, when Mrs Bone had cancer. They say Mrs Sweeney gave her permission and they intended her to move in with them, but she changed her mind. They deny owing the council around £100,000 in care costs – or doing anything wrong. Mrs Bone, who earns £45,000-a-year as her husband’s office manager, says the ordeal has taken a toll on her health. ‘In the last three weeks they found a lump on my breast. I’m convinced it’s the stress. ‘It’s ridiculous to think Peter would do something wrong and imply I have gone against my mum’s wishes.’ Her mother was feeling the strain too. ‘She knows it could be really bad for all of us. She thinks it’s wicked. In the worst-case scenario, if we were charged, convicted, whatever, I’m her only lifeline. Otherwise, she’s stuck in there 24/7.’ Mrs Bone’s desperation is clear. And it is shocking to hear the language used by the Bones, traditional Tories, about the police. ‘We have always been very supportive of them,’ said Mrs Bone. ‘It absolutely sucks.’ She falters as she recalls the day they raided their home in Rushden, Northamptonshire. ‘It was like being burgled. I won’t ever forget .  .  . a knock on the door and .  .  . Peter wasn’t there  .  .  . I couldn’t stop shaking. Mr Bone and his wife have vowed to clear their names . ‘I feel violated by that day. I relive it every single day. It’s something that you see on the telly .  .  . Frost or whatever. Mr Bone’s sense of betrayal is just as deep. ‘I thought the police were great people who couldn’t do anything wrong. They have misled us. Some would say they lied to us. They raided our house and took our papers. We’ve only just got them back. ‘They promised they would not see Dorothy without telling us first. They went and video-taped her in the home. She had no representation, without any notice – and they refused to give her a copy of the tape.’ Mrs Bone’s simmering rage surfaces when asked about rumours that her husband will be kicked out of the Tory Party if the police charge them. ‘I’ll be damned if they force him . . . he’s done nothing wrong,’ she said, close to tears. Her husband links the police action to his support for Mr Mitchell, who was accused of calling a policeman a ‘f***ing pleb’ outside No 10. ‘I went on BBC Newsnight and spoke up for him against the Police Federation. You could put one and one together and make two – this was them getting back at me for that.’ But his main concern is for his wife. ‘There’s no question the lump is because of the enormous stress that the county council and police have put on to us. We spend most of our time talking about this thing.’ The Bones have plenty more talking to do before it is over. Police did not comment. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Jennie Bone and her husband Peter, Tory MP for Wellingborough, are accused of selling her mother's house to clear their debts .

"By . Lizzie Parry . Former Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin has indulged in another 'told you so' moment, taking part in a funny skit pointing out her prediction in 2008 that Russia would invade Ukraine. The one-time Presidential candidate appeared on The Tonight Show with host Jimmy Fallon, apparently speaking to President Vladimir Putin on the phone. Setting up the sketch, Fallon told viewers he had footage of a phone call between Putin and Palin. The skit featured Fallon dressed up in a wig and grey suit, playing the Russian President discussing Palin's 2008 prediction that he would invade Ukraine. Scroll down for video . Skit: Former Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin appeared on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon (left dressed up as Vladimir Putin), in a funny sketch pointing out her prediction in 2008 that Russia would invade Ukraine . Introducing the sketch, host Jimmy Fallon told viewers he had footage of a phone call between Sarah Palin and the Russian President . Putin said: 'I once invaded a country called . Youbetchavlad. …  Anyway, since you so great at guessing my next move, . who do you think I should invade next? 'I’m thinking Finland, Sweden – I . hear Jamaica is nice this time of year.' To which, Palin replied: 'My advice to you would be, you get those troops out of Ukraine right now.’ And when Palin brings up shooting a bear, Putin says he prefers to take them down in 'hand-to-hand combat'. Palin tells the president: ‘That’s why people say you’re such a strong leader . ‘Well, I come from strong genes. Obama comes from mom genes,’ he replies. Joking about hearing breathing on the line, the pair question whether the NSA are listening in. The camera cut to Fallon dressed up in a wig and grey suit, playing Putin as he dialled the one-time presidential candidate's number . Putin tells Palin: 'I once invaded a country called Youbetchavlad¿  Anyway, since you so great at guessing my next move, who do you think I should invade next? 'I¿m thinking Finland, Sweden ¿ I hear Jamaica is nice this time of year' To which, Palin advised the Russian President: 'My advice to you would be, you get those troops out of Ukraine right now' At which point President Obama cuts into the conversation, apparently listening in, sheepishly putting the phone down. Rounding off the sketch the pair made light of how close Alaska is to Russia, with Putin threatening to invade. But Palin tells him: 'I wouldn’t Vlad, you might be able to take down a bear, but you are no match for a mumma grizzly.’ In among the joking about the pair perform a strange duet of Pharrell's hit Happy, with Putin on the Ukulele-type instrument and Palin accompanying him on the flute. Palin grabbed the media spotlight last month with a 'told-ya-so' moment by pointing out on Facebook that she had predicted Putin's Ukraine invasion six years ago. The one-time vice presidential candidate wrote a strongly worded post on Friday calling out her liberal critics for mocking her. During the four-minute sketch the pair play a duet of Pharrell's hit Happy with Putin on a ukulele-type instrument and Palin accompanying on the flute . At one point Putin and Palin joke that breathing on the line could be the NSA listening into their call, and the camera cuts to Obama, looking sheepish and gently putting his phone down . And joking about how close Alaska is to Russia, the Russian leader threatens an invasion, to which the former Alaskan Governor replies: 'I wouldn't Vlad, you might be able to take down a bear, but you are no match for a mumma grizzly' At a rally in Reno, Nevada in October 2008 Sarah Palin (right) told the crowd that Obama's response to the Russia's invasion of Georgia was 'the kind of response that would only encourage Russia's Putin (left) to invade Ukraine next' 'Yes, I could see this one from Alaska,' Palin wrote. 'I'm usually not one to Told-Ya-So, but I did, despite my accurate prediction being derided as “an extremely far-fetched scenario” by the “high-brow” Foreign Policy magazine.' During the 2008 presidential campaign, Foreign Policy published an article ridiculing her prediction that if then-Senator Barack Obama is elected into office, Russia under President Vladimir Putin would be emboldened to occupy Ukraine. Palin's statements on the campaign trail came during an armed conflict that broke out between Russia and Georgia over the contested territory of South Ossetia. ‘After the Russian Army invaded the nation of Georgia, Senator Obama's reaction was one of indecision and moral equivalence, the kind of response that would only encourage Russia's Putin to invade Ukraine next,’ Palin told a crowd at a rally held in Reno, Nevada, in October 2008. Palin took to her Facebook page in February to point out her 2008 prediction, saying 'I'm usually not one to Told-Ya-So, but I did'","Former Alaskan Governor appeared on The Tonight Show in a fun sketch .

"By . John Hall . and Ian Drury . and Stephen Wright . Created: . 05:19 EST, 25 March 2014 . A legal firm has taken £2.5 million in taxpayers money from a public inquiry into the deaths of Iraqi men - even though the investigation's key claim has now been abandoned due to a lack of evidence. Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers represented the relatives of more than 20 Iraqis who claimed the men were taken prisoner by British soldiers, and later mistreated and murdered. Despite the relatives withdrawing their claims last week, the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry confirmed that it has spent more than £22million of public money on the investigation - including handing £2.5million over to Public Interest Lawyers run by the 'committed socialist' solicitor Phil Shiner. Probe: Despite the money that went to Public Interest Lawyers, allegations that soldiers had executed Iraqi captives were unfounded. The above photograph, shown during the inquiry, shows a soldier guarding prisoners . A spokesperson for the Al-Sweady Public Inquiry told MailOnline: 'The . £2.5 million has all gone to PIL [Public Interest Lawyers] but that’s . not just legal costs. It’s also the cost for witnesses: expenses for . witnesses to come over from Iraq and to hear some of them via video link . from overseas.' It is understood that the money received by Public Interest Lawyers included covering the cost of flying and accommodating 15 key witnesses in Britain, as the Al-Sweady Inquiry's chairman Sir Thayne Forbes wanted to see them face-to-face. It also included the building of - and transport to and from - a 'small studio' close to Iraq from which an additional 40 family members of the deceased gave evidence. As Public Interest Lawyers were the only . legal firm working with the Al-Sweady Inquiry, all the expenses of . gathering evidence from witnesses went through them the spokesperson said. Public Interest Lawyers is currently acting for more than 100 clients who claim their relatives were unlawfully detained, ill-treated, or killed by UK forces in Iraq. It has secured more than £3million in payouts, most notably, representing the family of Baha Mousa - the hotel receptionist who died in 2003 in custody in Iraq. The subsequent inquiry cost £13million. Responding to claims that Public Interest Lawyers earned, as opposed to received £2.5million from the inquiry, Phil Shiner said: 'The amount of costs PIL has received from the MoD [not Legal Aid!] for that issue is less than £70,000.' Money: Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers, run by Phil Shiner (pictured), received £2.5 million in taxpayers money for representing the relatives of more than 20 Iraqis at the Al-Sweady Inquiry . The Al-Sweady Inquiry was announced in 2009 after a long legal battle between Iraqi families and the Ministry of Defence. It examined allegations that troops executed 20 or more prisoners and mistreated nine others after a battle at the Danny Boy base near Basra in May 2004. The inquiry was named after Hameed Al Sweady, 19 - one of the men that died. Witnesses and family members of the dead Iraqis had alleged troops from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders took bloody revenge at a camp and detention facility for the massacre of six Royal Military policemen a year earlier. The claims were strenuously denied by the Ministry of Defence, which insisted the Iraqis were insurgents killed in battle. Enemy dead would normally be left on the battlefield but the soldiers were apparently given an order to identify them in order to find the ringleader in the six Red Caps murder. Last week the inquiry's key claim was abandoned when relatives of the dead Iraqis admitted there was no evidence the men had been killed unlawfully and withdrew their claims. The Ministry of Defence later said it was pleased the claims had been withdrawn. Last week the primary strand of the Al-Sweady Inquiry . effectively fell apart when relatives admitted there was no hard . evidence to suggest the insurgents were unlawfully killed in UK custody. In . a statement released as evidence drew to a close, Public Interest . Lawyers accepted the men were killed during a ferocious firefight, . dubbed the Battle of Danny Boy, near Basra in 2004. They admitted no evidence had been produced to suggest the men had been murdered unlawfully. The . extraordinary concession provoked outrage that British troops accused . of the most serious crime have had their names 'dragged through the mud' by publicly-funded lawyers. At . the time, Colonel Richard Kemp, who commanded UK forces in Afghanistan, . said: ‘Many in Iraq and Afghanistan have sought to discredit British . soldiers for political purposes or have made claims for personal . financial gain. ‘In some . cases, these people have been wittingly or unwittingly looking to turn a . quick buck at the expense of our fighting troops. ‘It . is tough for the MoD, who are under great pressure to answer these . cases, but to avoid wasting public funds we must be ready to make . stronger rebuttal.’ Phil . Shiner, the boss of Public Interest Lawyers, describes himself as a . 'committed socialist' on his company's website and has insisted the . business is 'not motivated by financial gain'. Following the developments last week, the Mail . revealed that to investigate Mr Shiner’s clients’ claims, a team of 12 . former Scotland Yard murder squad officers, commanded by a retired chief . superintendent was recruited by the Al-Sweady Inquiry. Rug pulled: Relatives of the captives supposedly killed by British soldiers actually died in a battle near Basra, their relatives admitted . Their role was research and evidence gathering, including taking statements from Iraqi witnesses and British soldiers. The . senior policeman is understood to have been paid more than £1,000 a day . plus expenses. Junior investigators on the inquiry team were paid £400 a . day. Along with three lawyers from Public Interest Lawyers, the investigators made four visits to Beirut to interview witnesses. Each . trip lasted two to three weeks, officials said. They flew business . class and the group stayed at the five-star Gefinor Rotana Hotel, which . is described on its website as being of ‘spellbinding luxury’. Al Sweady's father is pictured here with a photograph of his son . Suites . were hired to interview Iraqi witnesses, who stayed at a more modest . hotel in the city but were permitted to dine at the Gefinor Rotana. They . were also given a 'generous' daily living allowance. The . inquiry team later made three business class trips to Istanbul, where . they stayed in the five-star Grand Hyatt Hotel, as they interviewed . Iraqi witnesses. The Iraqis . again stayed in a less expensive hotel but were allowed to dine in the . inquiry team’s hotel and enjoy a daily living allowance. Investigative and ‘other expert . services’ accounted for £7million. Running costs including IT and . accommodation cost £5.9million, counsel and legal services a further . £4.9million, core participant and witness costs £2.5million and general . staffing £1.8million. This led to the total bill for the inquiry topping £22million at the end of February. But . sources have told the Mail last week that the actual total is closer to . £27million – six times the bill of the Macpherson Inquiry into Stephen . Lawrence’s murder. Speaking to MailOnline this morning, the Al-Sweady Inquiry spokesperson said: 'Over . four years, [the £2.5 million] has gone on getting statements from 91 . Iraqi witnesses. We’ve tested the evidence of 55 of them. So the money . has gone on that and all the related legal costs in the hearing and . taking evidence from all those witnesses.' 'The most . important witnesses – that is to say the nine who were detained by . British forces and who make the allegations, and another six who were . key to the central allegations – the chairman wanted to see them in . person, in the hearing room, and to be able to see them face to face,' they added. 'So we made . arrangements for them to fly from Iraq too here. The other 40 – who were . family members of the deceased – we set up a purpose built, very small . studio overseas in a secure location closer to Iraq so we could they . evidence via video link because it’s considerably less hassle and less . expensive than getting them over here,' the spokesperson went on. In a statement to MailOnline, Public Interest Lawyers said: 'PIL has received approximately just under £1.83m from the Al-Sweady Inquiry. Of that figure £670,990.64 is attributable to PIL’s costs and of that sum less than 10 per cent is attributable to work in relation to the issue that was conceded last Friday.' 'As you can see this is approximately 36.68 per cent of the total received. The balance of the monies (£1,045,095.66 - 63.32 per cent) is attributable to disbursements, including leading counsel and junior counsel’s fees.'","Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers took millions from inquiry .
Money was spent bringing witnesses from Iraq to Britain for evidence .

However Public Interest Lawyers claim they earned less than £70,000 .

An earlier version of this story stated that the Al-Sweady Inquiry had collapsed. In fact, while the primary strand of the inquiry is no longer proceeding, other parts of the inquiry are proceeding as planned. We are happy to clarify this."
"By . Simon Walters . UKIP leader Nigel Farage has vehemently denied having sex with his aide Annabelle Fuller and says he has not even kissed her. And he has dismissed claims that his 14-year marriage to German wife Kirsten is in trouble as a result of the latest headlines about his  so-called ‘womanising’. Controversial Euro MP Mr Farage spoke out after it was claimed in the European Parliament that UKIP press officer Ms Fuller was ‘his former mistress’ and he was using public funds to employ her and Mrs Farage, his £25,000-a-year assistant. Chatting in between pints, over balloons of brandy, Nigel Farage unleashes his torrent of rage of people who have wronged him in ope way or another . In his most candid interview ever, the man bidding to change the landscape of British politics in May’s Euro elections told The Mail on Sunday: . Interviewing Nigel Farage requires stamina. We met at 11.15am on Friday at his Mayfair campaign HQ, (one floor above PR man Max Clifford’s office and directly behind Claridge’s Hotel) and parted at 3pm. In between, we chatted in his office, continued over pints of London Pride ale in the suitably patriotic Iron Duke pub over the road, and adjourned to the nearby La Petite Maison French restaurant for lunch with two bottles of red wine between us and two brandies each. Sitting in the sunshine on the restaurant’s pavement terrace enabled Mr Farage to indulge in two of his many politically incorrect pleasures: smoking (he got through half a dozen cigarettes, breaking off to buy another pack after the main course, complaining ‘bloody £8.80 that cost me, outrageous!’); and taunting climate change zealots – he cosied up to a giant patio heater, blamed by many for adding to global warming, scoffing: ‘People like Prince Charles talk such nonsense.’ Annabelle Fuller, who worked in UKIP press office, and was the alledged mistress of Nigel Farage . The ex-stockbroker was wearing his trademark blue blazer (he buys his suits, all Italian-made, from John Bray tailors in London’s Jermyn Street), pressed pink shirt, cufflinks (his favourite pair has a Spitfire motif) and tightly knotted club tie. Does he ever undo his top button? ‘Weekends, of course, but not at work. 'That’s what posers like Dave (Cameron) do to show they are a man of the people. It’s all cobblers.’ With forecasts of a major UKIP success in May, Farage has panicked the main parties, in particular the Tories, into attacking his party and its notorious ‘fruitcake’ candidates. He trumpeted: ‘We’re like Millwall Football Club, “Everyone hates us and we don’t care!” The penny’s dropped, the great British public knows we cannot have our own immigration policy and stay in the EU. We’re on the edge of the biggest migratory wave yet – it could be a million plus over the next few years including a huge number from Romania.’ He derided attempts by David Cameron’s hard-hitting Australian born election campaigns chief, Lynton Crosby, to undermine UKIP. ‘Mr Crosby and his gang can paint me out to be the biggest, most dishonest, drunken womaniser or whatever they blooming well like, but they misunderstand why they’re in trouble. Tories won’t vote for them again because they don’t see Dave as a Conservative. ‘I accept that in the early days UKIP had all sorts we’d rather not have taken home to meet mum for tea. 'The Canadian Conservatives disappeared overnight - we could do the same to the Tories' But we now have thousands of decent men and women, ex-Conservative, ex-Labour, policemen, school teachers, businessmen.’ He’s been called the ‘heir of Thatcher’ but seems more Denis than Maggie to me. ‘He was a top chap!’ erupted Farage with boyish glee. ‘Wow! If I’m compared to Denis Thatcher – he fought for this country in the war, was decorated, made vast sums of money, was respected and lived well into his 80s – sounds pretty good to me.’ With recent successes of the UKIP party, Farage has caused worry amongst the three major political parties, especially the Tories who have had major attacks on his 'fruitcake' candidates . How will he tackle Europhile Mr Clegg in debates, starting this week? ‘I’ll say, “Come on Nick, tell me why you think British people want the EU flag, anthem and Mr Rumpy Pumpy [EU President Herman Van Rompuy] – I’m all ears. Clegg’s European at heart, not British.’ But his grin turned to a glare when I raised a different type of ‘rumpy pumpy’ – former UKIP ally Nikki Sinclaire’s bombshell claim in the European Parliament that Farage employed his wife Kirsten and ‘former mistress Annabelle Fuller’ on his MEP’s payroll. Mr Farage and Ms Fuller, 32, issued statements denying they had an affair, but his initial apparent failure to do so meant the rumour mill kept turning. Ms Sinclaire added insult to injury in last week’s Mail on Sunday, calling him a ‘bullying, hypocritical, preening show pony’. Farage’s frog eyes bulged with fury. ‘You normally rely on people on bail for fraud charges, do you?’ he scowled, leaning forward aggressively. (Ms Sinclaire was arrested in 2012 in connection with claims concerning alleged expenses fraud at the European Parliament. She denies any wrongdoing.) It’s obviously got under his skin. Farage is equally dismissive of critics who say UKIP¿s widely predicted success in the Euro elections will melt like spring snow in next year¿s General Election . ‘What gets under my skin is that the BBC decided it was headline TV news,’ he shot back, nostrils flaring. He maintains Ms Sinclaire held a grudge because Ms Fuller was picked ahead of her as a UKIP press officer in 2006. Farage trades on his colourful character to win votes, so he can’t complain if other aspects come under scrutiny. Has he had sex with Annabelle Fuller? ‘I don’t think we should go into the grisly details.’ Has he slept with her? ‘No.’ Has he kissed her? ‘No. When you work in a tight team, I understand why people might get the wrong idea.’Why hadn’t he denied it immediately in the European Parliament? Farage falls back on his best weapon: wit. ‘There’s an old saying, if you pick a fight with a chimney sweep you get covered in soot!’ Twice-married Farage does not deny he had a fling with a 25-year-old Latvian woman eight years ago: ‘I put myself in a very bad position there. I am not saying I am beyond stupidity and yes, I’ve made mistakes.’ Kirsten, 39, mother of two of his four children, is ‘pretty cheesed off’ with the claims about him and Ms Fuller, but he insists their marriage is not on the rocks. He is equally dismissive of critics who say UKIP’s widely predicted success in the Euro elections will melt like spring snow in next year’s General Election. ‘In 2009 we came from nowhere, like a horse on the rails, in the European elections. Everyone said, “Jolly well done Nigel, now bugger off back to the pub, you’ll never achieve anything in domestic politics."" 'Protestors smashed in my car when I was driving Enoch Powell' 'And blow me down, last year we got nearly a quarter of the vote in the English county council elections.’ He boasts UKIP could win up to 20 seats in 2015 and plans to stand as a candidate, probably in his native Kent. ‘The Canadian Conservative Party disappeared overnight – we could do the same to the Tories here over Europe. Believe me.’ As he downed a fourth large glass of Chinon red wine a passer-by, Steve, a hedge-fund manager, approached and told Farage how much he admired him. Farage invited Steve to pull up a chair and vigorously debated with him for half an hour, a common event for man of the people Nigel. Farage has also been described as 'not a compassionate man', who during the period of his interview, ignored a Big Issue seller on the street . But he had no time for the homeless man who tried to sell him The Big Issue, ignoring him completely. After the bedraggled toothless chap eventually gave up and trudged off, Farage quipped: ‘That’s the first Big Issue seller I’ve come across for a while who isn’t a Romanian immigrant!’ He doesn’t ‘do’ compassion. By the time we had progressed to the Napoleon brandies, Farage ripped into Cameron’s handling of the Ukraine crisis. ‘Egged on by reckless Dave and (William) Hague, the EU has incited the Russian bear and surprise, surprise, the bear has hit back. 'What’s Dave going to do if the Scots vote for independence, send troops to Edinburgh? Madness.’ Farage prefers Right-wing Tories like Enoch Powell and briefly acted as his chauffeur in his 20s. ‘He had spoken at my school and I was later asked to drive him to a by-election rally, I think they chose me because everyone else available had a Morris Minor and I had a Merc! It was scary. 'Protesters smashed the back of the car when we arrived but Enoch didn’t blink.’ Powell’s ‘rivers of blood’ immigration rhetoric made him a hate figure: naughty but nice Nigel is more Ronnie Corbett than Oswald Mosley. Farage found new inspiration when he visited Athelney in Somerset during the floods. Athelney is where King Alfred the Great hid before defeating the Danes in 878. ‘From a few flooded acres of land Alfred beat the Danes and created what we now know as England,’ he said with misty-eyed fervour, swirling the brandy in his glass. ‘If it wasn’t for him we would have been taken over by the Vikings.’ UKIP’s King Nigel is just as determined to repel the EU.","Farage spoke out about his recent gaffes, including alleged affairs .

If he wins a seat in next year’s General Election, the Tory Party could collapse and disappear overnight – just like its Canadian counterpart a decade ago.
He once acted as chauffeur to Enoch Powell."
"By . David Williams . Locked into wire mesh cages, four men including a former BBC producer are paraded before a court in Cairo. They were marched from their cells in white prison uniform to face accusations of terror-related offences. Peter Greste, who worked for the BBC in Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa, is among three journalists and 17 others charged with providing a platform to the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group of the democratically-elected former president Mohamed Morsi. Paraded: Defendants in the cages of the Cairo courtroom at a previous hearing. Defendants include (left to right) Student Suhaib Saeed, and Al-Jazeera journalists Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Modhamed . Australian journalist and former BBC correspondent Peter Greste stands inside a cage during the trial, where he called accusations that he was supporting a terrorist group 'preposterous' Suhaib Saeed, left, a student who is charged with helping three al Jazeera journalists falsify news accounts about Egypt, wore a t-shirt whose Arabic inscription read 'Scorpion Prison in Egypt's Guantanamo' The three journalists were arrested after the military backed government of Egypt declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation, in their Cairo hotel where they had set up a temporary office . In an unusual move, the judge, Mohammed Nagi Shehata, eventually allowed the defendants to approach the bench to deliver their pleas in a previous hearing . The 45-year-old Australian, who works . for Arab TV channel Al Jazeera, describes the charges as ‘preposterous’ and an international campaign has been launched to secure his . release. Mr Greste and two other defendants asked to be freed on . bail. Australian Journalist Peter Greste had only been in the country for two weeks before being arrested . Judge Mohammed Nagi . Shehata denied the requests, despite international pressure and . allegations that the charges have been made up because of hostility . between the Doha-based TV station and Egyptian authorities. Mr Greste told the judge he had been in Egypt for only two weeks before his arrest. ‘The . idea that I could have an association with the Muslim Brotherhood is . frankly preposterous,’ he said. ‘Our only desire at this point is to . continue to fight and clear our names from outside of prison.’ Al . Jazeera English bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, who holds dual . Canadian-Egyptian citizenship, also denied links to the Muslim . Brotherhood, saying he was an alcohol-drinking liberal who had lived . abroad for a long time. ‘Have you ever heard of a Muslim terrorist that drinks alcohol?’ he asked. Other defendants claimed they had been abused and tortured during interrogation. Mr . Greste’s parents had hoped he would be released after Australian Prime . Minister Tony Abbott took up the case with interim Egyptian President . Adly Mansour. The hearing came days after a judge sentenced to death hundreds of Egyptians with alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood. Many of the defendants have claimed the conditions in the Egyptian holding cells are akin to Guantanamo Bay, with one defendant asking for bail so that he could attend a private hospital for a broken arm .","Journalists accused of altering footage to support Muslim Brotherhood .

"By . Glen Owen, Mail on Sunday Political Correspondent . Home Secretary Theresa May faced a revolt last night after one of her own Ministers refused to implement a drugs ban. Liberal Democrat Drugs Minister Norman Baker is defying Mrs May’s order to criminalise khat, a plant chewed to give users a high and used predominantly in East African immigrant communities. Mr Baker – who once said cannabis was ‘no more harmful than alcohol or tobacco’ – has told Mrs May he disagrees with her plan to ban the substance, and flatly refused to act on it. Clash: Theresa May has since stripped Norman Baker (right) of responsibility for criminalising the drug khat . His rebellion has forced Mrs May to strip him of responsibility for enforcing the ban and give it to Organised Crime Minister Karen Bradley, a Tory who holds more hardline views. Mr Baker’s refusal is a demonstration of his political rift with Mrs May, who was said to be ‘spitting tacks’ at the Lib Dem’s appointment to her department last autumn. Drug: Ethiopian farmer Ahmed Mume with a khat plant in 2003 . He is distinctly to her Left on a number of issues, including immigration controls and ‘snooping’ powers. Mrs May is planning to categorise khat as a class C drug, which would make its importation, possession and supply a criminal offence. She last week rejected calls for a rethink from the Home Affairs Committee, whose chair, Labour MP Keith Vaz, has spoken of chewing khat in the past. It argued there was no compelling evidence the drug was harmful – and police would risk ‘antagonism’ when targeting communities which use it. Some experts, however, have linked khat to depression, irritability, psychotic episodes and violence. Last summer the Government’s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs also recommended that khat not be criminalised. But Mrs May has said her decision is based on an ‘extensive consultation process’. Mr Baker insisted last night the khat ban was not part of his portfolio because the decision was made before he joined the department. But a Lib Dem source said Mr Baker had told Mrs May face-to-face he opposed her decision. ‘The fact that Bradley covers organised crime, which is sort of linked to the khat trade, was his get-out-of-jail card,’ the source said. Despite their differences, Mr Baker’s friends say that he ‘gets on well with Mrs May on a personal level’.","The drug is chewed to give users in immigrant communities a small high .

"By . Simon Walters . Michael Gove shocked a Cabinet summit with the woman in charge of attracting more internet tycoons to London, by claiming they are flocking to the capital to have ‘hot sex’. He said the city was attracting young businessmen and women from all over the world because they believed there were ‘more opportunities for success and sex’. The Education Secretary’s boast shocked former Facebook and Google executive Joanna Shields, 51, boss of David Cameron’s Tech City task force. Only Berlin comes close! Gove said some very frank views had been expressed to him by young entrepreneurs . Embarrassed Mr Cameron, who chaired the meeting in his Commons office, spluttered: ‘Make sure that does not appear in the minutes.’ Home Secretary Theresa May, who was also present, gasped. Mr Gove’s extraordinary comment came after US-born Ms Shields made a presentation on Government measures needed to bring young entrepreneurs to London to launch new high-tech industries. Mr Gove said: ‘We are increasing computer science lessons in school, but there are some things the Government cannot do. 'I was talking to some young entrepreneurs recently and they said the reason they love London so much is not so much high-tech opportunities but that it’s a fantastic city with great opportunities to be successful, enjoy a great culture, have a good time and loads of hot sex. Only Berlin comes close!’ Shock: Former Facebook, Google and Bebo executive Joanna Shields was at the summit . He explained the ‘hot sex’ claim had been made to him by entrepreneurs in the Founders Forum, a glamourous international organisation which claims to promote ‘the world’s brightest and most dynamic digital entrepreneurs’. It has organised events involving businessmen such as Sir Richard Branson and The Voice TV talent show panellist, singer and philanthropist,  Will.i.am. Prince Andrew hosted a dinner for Founders Forum at Windsor Castle last year and Mr Cameron attended one of its events in California. An eyewitness said: ‘It was a jaw-dropping moment. Ms Shields looked as surprised as the rest of us and, after a pause, smiled broadly. One of two people giggled. Michael was unabashed and said casually, “I thought everyone knew that.” ’ Other Ministers at the event included Chancellor George Osborne, Business Secretary Vince Cable and Cabinet Office Minister Oliver Letwin. It is not the first sign that Mr Gove is shrugging off his previous strait-laced image. Increasingly, he is seen as a rival future leader to Boris Johnson. The Mail on Sunday revealed last month how a ‘tipsy’ Mr Gove called Mr Johnson ‘unfit’ to run Britain at a private dinner party. And he told this newspaper two weeks ago that he was a fan of ‘chap hop’ rapper Mr B The Gentleman Rhymer, who sings about sex and drugs.","David Cameron replied: 'Make sure that does not appear in the minutes'

"By . Barbara Jones In Cape Town . and Shekhar Bhatia In Mariestad, Sweden . Denial: Shrien Dewani will board a plane to South Africa tonight after three and a half years fighting to avoid it . Honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani will board a plane for South Africa tomorrow night after a three-and-a-half year battle – and the world will finally learn whether the mental illness which delayed his extradition is real or faked. The millionaire care home owner, 33, has denied any involvement in the killing of his Swedish wife Anni, 28, in a crime-ridden suburb of Cape Town in 2011. Since then his lawyers have fought his extradition to South Africa, where he faces charges of murder and conspiracy. They have claimed he is ‘too ill to be extradited’ and would be a high suicide risk as he  suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. But Anni’s father Vinod Hindocha told The Mail on Sunday yesterday: ‘I have always queried in my mind just how mentally ill he was. Just how long can post-traumatic stress last is a question that has been in and out of my mind continually. ‘Shrien was perfectly well during the time he travelled back from Cape Town with Anni’s body and he was arrested soon after.’ While the arguments raged at repeated appeal hearings, Dewani has spent the past 18 months living in a camper van in the grounds of Blaise View mental health hospital near Bristol and has been allowed to visit his family home nearby during the day. The Mail on Sunday has learned that Dewani is set to enjoy special privileges from the moment he arrives at Valkenberg, a South African psychiatric hospital. His lawyers have argued that these privileges are necessary to uphold his human rights after the protracted legal battle over his extradition. A private room has been prepared for him and he will even be allowed to pay for his own chef to bring him meals every day. Like other patients on the general ward, he will also be able to take part in group therapy, cooking, belly dancing, and sewing classes and will be allowed a free visit to a beauty salon and barber once a week. But, despite the apparently relaxed conditions, security has been tightened and Dewani’s every move will be watched by investigators determined to prove he is fit enough to stand trial for murder. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Anni Dewani was 28 when she was murdered in a remote suburb of Cape Town . Anger: Vinod Hindocha (right), the father of murdered bride Anni Dewani (left with murder suspect Shrien), said he had always questioned how genuine his son-in-law's mental illness could have been . Secure: The Valkenberg psychiatric hospital in Cape Town, where Shrien Dewani will be assessed to see if he is mentally fit to stand trial for allegedly organising the honeymoon murder of his wife Anni . The family of Anni Dewani have backed plans to televise the trial of Shrien Dewani in South Africa. Anni’s father Vinod Hindocha said: ‘She was my daughter, certainly, but since she was shot she has become the daughter of the world. ‘I have been asked if I have any objection and my answer is that I do not. I feel the world wants to know what happened to Anni. ‘Judging by the thousands of letters from across the world we have received from people we have never met, there is a great amount of interest.’ Showing Tuesday’s hearing when Dewani appears to be formally charged – and any resulting hearings – on TV is a decision for the judge. The case could rival the media sensation of the ongoing murder trial of Oscar Pistorius for shooting his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. Mr Hindocha said he had discussed cameras being in court with South African prosecutors and broadcasters and had given his backing. Several TV and radio networks have sent applications to the Judge President, arguing there is a valid public interest in live coverage. The announcement came as Mr Hindocha and his wife called for a change in the extradition process between Britain and South Africa as Dewani’s trial draws near – more than three years after the killing. ‘It has been nothing short of torture for us. An extradition order should not take so long,’ Mr Hindocha told The Mail on Sunday from his home in Sweden. Dewani’s flight will be met by . officers from the elite Hawks police unit and he will be escorted to . Cape Town’s High Court to be formally charged with murder. From . there, whether he is granted bail or not, he will go  to Valkenberg, . which houses some of South Africa’s most notorious killers and rapists. Hospital insiders say a private room has been refurbished for him in Ward 4 and he will be under 24-hour observation by a team reporting back regularly to the court. They must decide whether Dewani is capable of going for trial and whether he is aware of the serious nature of the indictment for murder. A report based on their findings will be submitted to the court within 30 days and his hospitalisation period could be extended or a court date set. Experts told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Any notion that he has been faking illness for the past few years will be minutely examined. 'Medication will be at a minimum so as not to mask his true condition. Dewani  will be seen regularly by  consultants but it is when he  is back in the ward that he will let his guard down and that is often where we get our most useful insights. ‘His attitude to other patients and the staff, even domestic workers, will be crucial to our observation methods.' A medical source at the hospital told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Frankly  it is impossible for him  to be genuinely ill for that period, we have never experienced that.’ Dewani denies any involvement in the killing of 28-year-old Swedish national Anni, who was shot as the couple’s taxi was apparently car-jacked in the Gugulethu township in November 2010. The South African government has made clear it is keen to have Dewani declared fit to stand trial for arranging the killing, after three men already jailed for the murder claimed they were offered £1,400 to carry out the crime.

"By . Stephen Wright . Two leading officials at the . scandal-hit police union dramatically quit yesterday, just days after it . faced fresh, disturbing questions over its role in the Plebgate affair. Steve . Williams, chairman of the Police Federation, and general secretary Ian . Rennie resigned days after the Daily Mail revealed it had hired a PR . firm to mastermind a ‘guerrilla’ and ‘blitzkrieg’ campaign against the . Government. In addition, the Mail has run a series of investigations revealing: . Quit: Chairman Steve Williams and General Secretary Ian Rennie will step down, plunging the Police Federation into crisis after a turbulent period . Both . Mr Williams and Mr Rennie were aware of the decision to award a . £10,000-a-month deal to a controversial public relations company to . oppose Coalition plans on police pay and reform. The . ‘guerrilla tactics’ deal had been agreed just weeks before the now . infamous Plebgate incident in September 2012, involving then chief whip . Andrew Mitchell and a policeman at the gates of Downing Street. Critics . of the Federation argue that the union mercilessly exploited Mr . Mitchell’s bust up at the gates as part of its ongoing campaign against . ministers who wanted to reform its working practices. Last . week Police Minister Damian Green said that the Federation – which . represents 125,000 rank and file officers – should put its house in . order or face tough new laws forcing it to reform. Shock jock: Jon Gaunt was hired to wage 'guerilla war' on ministers . Mr . Williams and Mr Rennie will leave in late May after the union’s annual . conference – plunging one of Britain’s most powerful staff bodies into . crisis. Last night their decision to leave at such a sensitive time was greeted with surprise by senior politicians. Home . Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz will today hear evidence about Sir . David Normington’s highly critical review of the union which called for . top-to-bottom reform and an end to a bullying culture. Last . night Mr Vaz said: ‘I am amazed and surprised by the proposed . retirement of two people who have been instrumental in instigating . reform in the Police Federation. ‘These . retirements will leave this important organisation with a huge vacuum . and leaderless at a time when they need strong direction. It will remain . to be seen if the Federation will continue on the path of change.’ Home . Secretary Theresa May said: ‘As chairman, Steve Williams understood . that the Police Federation needs to change, and I am sorry that he will . be retiring in May. ‘If the . Federation is to have public legitimacy, the Normington recommendations . now need to be implemented, in full and in good time.’ Pointedly, Mrs . May made no comment on Mr Rennie’s resignation. Insiders . predicted last night that further heads would roll over the Federation . scandal. A source said: ‘There are a lot of unresolved issues at the . Federation, not least the offshore bank accounts, outrageous spending on . credit cards and general culture of secrecy.’ Details of the ‘guerrilla . tactics’ plan were confirmed by a former senior Police Federation . official when she appeared before the Home Affairs Committee last week. Fiona . McElroy – who says she was sacked after advocating reform at the . Federation – said the anti-Government plot was outlined in a contract . handed to a public relations company run by former DJ Jon Gaunt in 2012. The deal, agreed by national Federation leaders, lasted only two months . but Mr Gaunt continued to provide PR advice to three branches of the . Federation in the Midlands, all central to the ‘Plebgate’ storm. But . cracks in the Federation’s unity had started to emerge in January, when . an independent review of the union by former Home Office mandarin Sir . David concluded that the organisation had a staggering £95million in . reserves and assets. Scandal: Mr Gaunt provided PR advice to three branches of the Federation in the Midlands, all central to the 'Plebgate' storm . Investigators . found there were centrally held funds of £29.5million and those held by . branch boards stood at around £35million, but there was also another . estimated £30million in separate accounts, details of which were not . given to the national heads of the organisation. In . a statement Mr Williams, who according to Miss McElroy’s testimony had . previously been ‘bullied and ridiculed’ by senior colleagues, . acknowledged the union had faced a ‘turbulent period’. The . chairman, who has been in the post barely a year, said: ‘When I took up . office it was quite clear that as an organisation we were not fit for . purpose and that is why I … commissioned an independent review … It . delivered a hard-hitting report that clearly showed that we were not . delivering what our members wanted, were failing in key areas and that . many of our practices were outdated. I have made no secret of my fears . that unless we get this right and embrace the change required others . will do it to us, a view echoed recently by the Policing Minister, . Damian Green.’ Mr Rennie, . who had been in the post for six years and was regarded as a hardliner . on police pay and conditions, said he was stepping down after it became . clear he no longer had the support of a number of senior colleagues. Yesterday it was claimed that the national Police Federation was set to reject demands for ‘top-to-bottom’ reforms.

"By . Jim Norton . Diseased and dirty meat could end up on Britain's dinner plates as a result of new EU legislation, a union has warned. British food inspectors reject millions of carcasses carrying parasites and infections from the food chain every year. But Unison, which represents government meat inspectors and official vets, has claimed proposed changes to food legislation by Brussels will water down their ability to check the quality and throw out sub-standard meat. More than two million instances of tapeworm (pictured) were discovered in red meat by the Food Standards Agency between 2012 and 2014 . Larvae of parasitic roundworms, like those pictured, can cause milk spot in pigs . The changes come just a year after the horsemeat scandal, in which food advertised as beef was found to contain horse meat. Statistics collected by the Food Standards Agency between 2012 and 2014 recorded more than two million instances of tapeworm being discovered in red meat. Inspectors also rejected more than 560,000 cases of milk spot - caused by parasitic roundworm larvae - in pigs. During that period, they also rejected nearly three million chickens that had been contaminated with faeces during slaughter - which causes the most common form of human food poisoning in the UK. But the European Commission has argued it needs to shake up current food legislation. There are fears the new rules could see contaminated meat find its way onto British dinner tables . It is now reducing 70 pieces of detailed regulation into a more simplified framework that will 'reduce the burden on business' and 'improve consumer protection'. Rules on inspections of pig carcasses have already been changed. Officials have until now cut into pig heads to check that the animals were not carrying hidden disease and abscesses, but new regulations from June replace it with a visual inspection. Currently, all chicken carcasses are checked after slaughter by official inspectors or vets in factories, but the European Food Safety Authority has recommended this requirement be abolished. Unison has accused the UK government of lobbying Brussels for deregulation in order to reduce industry costs. Millions of carcasses carrying parasites  are rejected by British food inspectors every year . A spokesman for Unison told The Guardian: 'The UK government’s agenda will result in food that repulses us being dished up on our plates. 'Most people do not know that there are a small group of meat inspectors and vets that keep them safe from harmful and repulsive additions to our sausages, Sunday roasts and beef pies. 'They work in some of the most awful conditions in blood and animal discharges every day. They are always the first to come under attack, not only from the food business operators, but also from our government.' The Food Standards Agency has defended the proposals, arguing that factories would still have to produce meat that was fit for human consumption.","Changes to EU regulations could weaken controls on contaminated meat .

"By . Simon Walters . and Glen Owen . UKIP leader Nigel Farage is on course to take the Commons by storm by winning a seat in next year's General Election . Nigel Farage is on course to take the Commons by storm by winning a seat in next year’s General Election after his success in the televised clashes with Nick Clegg. A poll for The Mail on Sunday in Folkestone, where the UKIP leader is considering standing as an MP in 2015, shows he could easily win. Asked by pollsters Survation if they would vote for Mr Farage as their MP, 33 per cent of people in Folkestone said yes, just three per cent less than those who said they would vote for sitting Conservative MP Damian Collins. If Mr Farage used his formidable campaigning skills to woo voters, he could defeat the low-profile Mr Collins, giving him a powerful Westminster platform to pursue his ambition of getting Britain to quit the EU. Mr Farage received a further boost in a separate national poll by Survation that showed the TV debates have helped UKIP leapfrog the Tories in the race to win May’s European Parliament elections . Labour is ahead on 34 with UKIP on 27, the Conservatives on 21 and Lib Dems on nine. The UKIP score is up by four since a similar survey conducted the week before the Clegg-Farage TV debates, while the Tories have slumped by six. Mr Farage threw down the gauntlet to Mr Cameron yesterday by challenging him to drop his refusal to take part in a TV debate with him. The UKIP leader said his message to the Prime Minister was: ‘Your Coalition pal Nick tried and failed to beat me in debate, come and see if you do any better, Mr Cameron.’ Following hard on the heels of his TV triumph, the Folkestone survey is fresh evidence that Mr Farage is on the brink of a major breakthrough in British politics. The UKIP leader, pictured during the TV debate with Nick Clegg, has now challenged Prime Minister David Cameron to an on-screen debate . At present, his status as a Euro MP restricts him to the fringes of  mainstream politics. That would change dramatically if he sat on the benches of the Commons. And the Survation poll shows Mr Farage’s dream of becoming an MP could become reality next year. Asked if he planned to stand for Parliament, Mr Farage recently told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: ‘To be honest with you, I was thinking about Folkestone.’ The seat, in Mr Farage’s home county of Kent, was held by ex-Tory leader Michael Howard until 2005, when he was succeeded by Mr Collins who won a thumping 10,000 majority in 2010. But that could disintegrate if Mr Farage stood against him. According to the Survation poll, Mr Collins’s share of the vote in 2010 would tumble  by 13 points to 36, with Mr Farage sending UKIP’s soaring from  five to 33. Given Mr Farage’s populist reputation, once the campaign got under way it is likely that he would overtake little-known former advertising executive Mr Collins. Furthermore, a total of one in two Folkestone voters said they would consider voting for Mr Farage. Last night a poll by ComRes found that Labour and UKIP are neck-and -neck in the race for the European elections. Survation pollster Damian Lyons Lowe said: ‘Given UKIP now has the ability to campaign effectively in a seat where half the electorate said they would consider voting UKIP in a General Election, Folkestone should be added to the list of seats in which Farage could finally make his entry into the Commons.’ A total of 529 adults took part in the Survation online poll in Folkestone on Thursday and Friday. A total of 1,001 adults took part in the Euro election national poll. Nigel Farage received a further boost in a separate national poll which showed the TV debates with Nick Clegg, pictured, have helped UKIP leapfrog the Tories in the race to win May's European Parliament elections .

"By . Ray Massey, Transport Editor . The Government unlawfully censored an embarrassing report about the controversial HS2 rail project, it is claimed. Patrick . McLoughlin, the Transport Secretary, employed a special veto used in . wartime to stop the release of a damning internal report about the . planned High Speed 2 line. In . an unprecedented move, Christopher Graham, the Information . Commissioner, has announced that he will seek a judicial review of the . veto. The Government is set to face High Court challenges after ministers used a wartime veto to censor information about the controversial HS2 high speed rail project . Mr Graham said he had ‘not taken the . decision lightly’, but added that it was a matter of principle since the . censorship was ‘unlawful’. He said ministers had acted unreasonably because there was ‘no demonstrable flaw in fact or law’ in an earlier order to publish. In . January, Mr McLoughlin used a rare emergency veto to ban publication of . a Project Assessment Report on the £50billion rail line. The . Information Commissioner had ruled six months earlier that the findings . must be published. But the Government refused to comply – first . appealing against the decision, then imposing the veto.Anti-HS2 campaigners accused the Government of censorship. They . suspect that the report undermines the case for the project and should . be published in the public interest. It is believed to contain . ‘red/amber’ warnings, which suggest the scheme could be in danger of . failing. The information Commissioner Christopher Graham and campaigners including Warwickshire GP Paul Thorton have launched legal action, with Mr Graham calling for a judicial review . But ministers argued the report on . the rail line, planned to connect London with Birmingham and the North, . was confidential advice to them from civil servants. Mr . Graham has raised the stakes, announcing in a letter to Sir Alan Beith . MP, the Justice Committee chairman, that he will challenge the veto in . the High Court. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told Parliament he was imposing the veto on the report which labelled HS2 in danger of failing . Mr McLoughlin has insisted it was ‘in the public interest’ to block publication of the document. Justifying . his ‘exceptional’ decision, he said that protecting the impartiality of . civil servants’ advice to ministers must take precedence over . disclosure to the public. But . furious protesters said it was the first time the secrecy laws had been . invoked since the Iraq War. They branded the gagging order ‘absolutely . disgraceful’ and said it was a ‘delaying tactic’ ahead of a . parliamentary vote on HS2. Announcing . his legal challenge, Mr Graham said: ‘The information in the HS2 . Project Assessment Report is all environmental information, and my . decision notice of 6 June 2013 (his earlier ruling on publication) was . issued in exercise of my obligations under the Environment Information . Regulations. ‘Therefore under UK law as it  currently stands . . . the Secretary of State’s veto of my decision  is unlawful. ‘The . reasons given for the HS2 veto do not amount to reasonable grounds, as . they merely express disagreement with the reasons given in my decision.’ He . added that he had taken into account a recent Court of Appeal decision . that it was wrong for Attorney General Dominic Grieve to prevent the . publication of 27  letters written by Prince Charles to ministers. Mr . Grieve used a veto to stop the letters – which were said to be lobbying . on climate change – being published under a Freedom of Information . request. That Court of . Appeal judgment, which is still subject to appeal to the Supreme Court, . states that using the ministerial veto on environmental information is . incompatible with European law. Campaigner . Richard Houghton, of HS2 Action Alliance, said: ‘So far as we can see, . the last time secrecy laws of this nature were invoked was during the . Iraq war. The implications are immense.’","Christopher Graham is launching a judicial review over censored report .

"By . Jim Norton . The Easter plans of millions of Britons were washed away yesterday as rain and thunderstorms swept the country. Southern counties suffered under the worst of the downpours, with some areas seeing a week’s rainfall in less than 24 hours. It left families hoping to enjoy the first holiday weekend of the year reaching for their brollies and wellingtons or remaining tucked up indoors. A turn for the worse: Britain will be lashed by some of the worst Easter rains and thunderstorms in tens years. Above, a couple walk along a beach in Southsea . Dismal: Forecasters are predicting heavy rain in parts of the country, with thunder and lightning in coastal regions. Above, a woman walks along Southsea beachfront . Kitted up: Southern areas of the UK, such as Kent, Sussex, Dorset and Portsmouth (pictured), are expected to be the worst hit - with more than an inch of rain forecast . Brollies at the ready: Emma Furmanski (left), four, from Buckinghamshire, splashes around on Bournemouth beach, while a woman takes to the streets of London (right) Today’s forecast is a little brighter, but there is still a risk of thunderstorms and the outlook remains unsettled. Although . the North escaped the worst of yesterday’s rain, high winds caused . problems. Four people, including a child, were injured when a tree fell . at a pub in Hindley, near Wigan, that was hosting a fun day. A . seven-year-old boy was treated for a broken leg when the tree was . uprooted and fell close to a bouncy castle at The Hockery Brook. Two . women, aged 23 and 26, and a 23-year-old man were also hurt. Hull’s . home match against Arsenal in the Premier League was brought to a . standstill shortly after kick-off when high winds blew advertising . hoardings on to the pitch.

Difference: The rain follows days of glorious sunshine across Britain, particularly in the south. Above, sun-seekers punt on the River Cam in Cambridge yesterday . Making the most of the sun: Meterologist Charles Powell, of the Met Office, said: 'Most people across the UK have enjoyed warm, settled weather over the past few days' Much . of the South Coast fell dark under violent thunderstorms, leaving . popular resorts almost deserted. Bournemouth’s seven-mile stretch of . sands was virtually empty as temperatures dropped to just 10C (50F) – . well below the average for April. At . Highclere Castle in Hampshire, where Downton Abbey is filmed, rain . pelted down on children taking part in an Easter egg hunt. The all-day . event was blighted by thunder and lightning, as crowds sought shelter in . the shadow of the historic home. A low pressure front that swept in from Germany was to blame. ‘It . was a different weather pattern to normal, with the weather moving . westwards due to last week’s high pressure,’ said Met Office forecaster . Charles Powell. ‘The wettest places were central and southern parts and around Dorset.’ He . said today should be ‘slightly better’, but after a decent start . thundery showers may develop, starting in Wales and moving . south-eastwards towards Sussex. Crowded: On Friday, members of the public flocked to Brighton beach (pictured) in Sussex to bathe in the glorious Easter sunshine, which has now given way to rain . Promising start: Easter's rainfall will be bad news to the thousands of people who invested in disposable barbecues. Above, a man relaxes on Brighton beach on Friday . Ready for a dip: Sisters (l-r) Tori-Lee, India, eight, and Lola, six, run towards the sea as they make the most of the Good Friday sunshine at Barry Island in South Wales . ‘The outlook remains unsettled for the rest of the week,’ added Mr Powell. It . seems that the best that holidaymakers can hope for today is a . trouble-free journey home, but motoring groups are warning of traffic . jams on many of the major routes. An estimated 18million motorists travelled on the roads this weekend, according to the RAC. The . M5 is likely to be problematic today, with a bottleneck around Bristol. Further jams are expected on the M3 from Southampton, the A303 from the . South West, the M23 from Brighton, the M25 and the M6 from the Lake . District. Jennifer Hart, . from the Highways Agency, said a number of roadworks have been lifted to . ease congestion but added: ‘We are predicting that Easter Monday . afternoon will be busier than usual as people head back on the main . holiday routes home.’ Engineering work on the railways could also affect journeys home, with work being carried out at more than 3,000 locations.","Heavy rain struck parts of Britain today the as weather took turn for worse, with thunder hitting coastal areas .

"By . Dan Bloom . and David Williams . A judge in Egypt has dismissed 'irrelevant' evidence against three journalists accused of terrorist links after it included footage of donkeys at an animal hospital. The Al Jazeera journalists, including former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, have been paraded in cages charged with altering footage to support the Muslim Brotherhood in a trial which Amnesty International condemned today as a 'vindictive farce'. Today the court watched the first tranche of video evidence found on the journalists' flash drives and computers - which included clips about an animal hospital with donkeys and horses, and footage about Christian life in Egypt. Paraded: Defendants in the cages of the Cairo courtroom at a previous hearing. Defendants include (left to right) Student Suhaib Saeed, and Al-Jazeera journalists Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Modhamed . Australian journalist and former BBC correspondent Peter Greste stands inside a cage during the trial, where he called accusations that he was supporting a terrorist group 'preposterous' Defence lawyers and even the judge dismissed the videos as irrelevant, while Greste shouted from a cage in the Cairo courtroom: 'This is a complete joke.' None of the clips appeared to have any connection to terrorism, and none of them were Al-Jazeera footage. 'This clearly does not contain anything supporting the case,' said presiding judge Mohammed Nagi Shehata after the footage was aired. Khaled Abu Bakr, Fahmy's lawyer, mocked the prosecutors and claimed they had not watched the footage before submitting it as evidence. The three journalists - Greste, Canadian-Egyptian acting bureau chief Mohammed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohammed - have been detained since December 29 last year. Suhaib Saeed, left, a student who is charged with helping three al Jazeera journalists falsify news accounts about Egypt, wore a t-shirt whose Arabic inscription read 'Scorpion Prison in Egypt's Guantanamo' The three journalists were arrested after the military backed government of Egypt declared the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organisation, in their Cairo hotel where they had set up a temporary office . They are accused of being part of a terrorist group and airing falsified footage to damage Egyptian national security. Egyptian authorities accuse Qatari-owned network Al-Jazeera of providing a platform for the Muslim Brotherhood, which the government has branded a terrorist organisation. Al-Jazeera denies the claim, and the defendants deny being members of the Brotherhood, saying they were simply doing their job reporting on Egypt's political turmoil. 'This is a politicized trial and a politicized judge,' Fahmy shouted from the courtroom cage. He said prosecutors had told him privately that he and his co-defendants 'are paying the price' for tensions between Egypt and Qatar. Protest: Hundreds of BBC employees demonstrated outside the Corporation's London headquarters on Monday to mark 100 days since the arrest of the three journalists, including a former BBC correspondent . Anger: Peter Greste worked for the BBC in Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa . 'I want to get out of this place... I am going to expose all of this,' he shouted. 'There are crimes against humanity taking place. Nothing is right in this system.' Besides the three journalists, 17 others are charged in the case, but only five are present and the rest are being tried in their absence. Prosecutors are expected to present more videos in later sessions. 'What the Egyptian authorities are doing is vindictive persecution of journalists for merely doing their jobs' - Amnesty International . Shortly after the court session started today, one of the other defendants, Khaled Abdel-Raouf, collapsed after complaining he had been in hunger strike because he was being denied medical care and visitors in prison. Dozens of defendants in several Brotherhood-related cases have gone on hunger strike over similar conditions. Last month a judge sentenced 529 people to death for alleged Brotherhood links in a case that was condemned around the world. Today Amnesty International condemned the trial as a 'vindictive farce'. Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa Programme Deputy Director, said: 'What the Egyptian authorities are doing is vindictive persecution of journalists for merely doing their jobs. 'So far, the Prosecution has failed to produce any convincing evidence and the journalists appear to be pawns in the hands of the authorities in their ongoing dispute with Qatar. 'The truth is that Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed are prisoners of conscience who must be released immediately and unconditionally. In an unusual move, the judge, Mohammed Nagi Shehata, eventually allowed the defendants to approach the bench to deliver their pleas in a previous hearing . 'This trial is nothing more than posturing by the authorities to gain public support. 'This farce must end and the charges against the three men must be dropped.' Peter Greste worked for the BBC in Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa, and has won awards for his work. Australian Journalist Peter Greste had only been in the country for two weeks before being arrested . The 45-year-old Australian, who works . for Arab TV channel Al Jazeera, describes the charges as ‘preposterous’ and an international campaign has been launched to secure his . release. The defendents have previously been asked to be released on bail but the judge denied their request. At a previous hearing Mr Greste told the judge he had been in Egypt for only two weeks before his arrest. ‘The . idea that I could have an association with the Muslim Brotherhood is . frankly preposterous,’ he said. ‘Our only desire at this point is to . continue to fight and clear our names from outside of prison.’ Al . Jazeera English bureau chief Mohamed Fahmy, who holds dual . Canadian-Egyptian citizenship, also denied links to the Muslim . Brotherhood, saying he was an alcohol-drinking liberal who had lived . abroad for a long time. ‘Have you ever heard of a Muslim terrorist that drinks alcohol?’ he asked. Other defendants claimed they had been abused and tortured during interrogation. Mr . Greste’s parents had hoped he would be released after Australian Prime . Minister Tony Abbott took up the case with interim Egyptian President . Adly Mansour. Many of the defendants have claimed the conditions in the Egyptian holding cells are akin to Guantanamo Bay, with one defendant asking for bail so that he could attend a private hospital for a broken arm .","Journalists accused of altering footage to support Muslim Brotherhood .

"By TANIA STEERE . David Cameron was recovering yesterday after being stung by a jellyfish while on holiday in Lanzarote. The Prime Minister was reportedly stung as he swum on the Spanish island's popular Arrieta beach. Tourists told how he came running out of the water in his blue swimming trunks rubbing his arm. Stung: Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha stop for a drink by a beach during their holiday on the Spanish island of Lanzarote . One local said Mr Cameron – who is a keen swimmer and patron of the Chipping Norton lido outdoor pool in his Oxfordshire constituency – got his children out of the sea after someone shouted a warning but then went back in the water himself. Ex-pat Wendy Lambert, 59, said one of her friends had pointed out to Mr Cameron that 'there's loads of jellies down there'. Miss Lambert added: 'Everyone got out of the water and his kids walked back with their minders around the pier. 'But then he decided to get back in, then suddenly he came out shouting in pain after getting stung.' Prime Minister David Cameron escapes the family to spend some alone time during their vacation to the Spanish island of Lanzarote . It was not clear what type of jellyfish stung the Prime Minister. Miss Lambert, who has lived at the Canary Island resort for 12 years, described the type of jellyfish usually seen nearby as 'a reddy colour, quite small but with very long tentacles'. Sources close to Mr Cameron confirmed he had been stung but stressed that he had not required treatment. Mr Cameron, 47, has been staying with his wife Samantha, 42, and their three children at a £200-a-night yoga retreat at the resort. They are due back in the UK this weekend.","Tourists told how he came running out of the water rubbing his arm .

"By . Jim Norton . The Oxford English Dictionary may disappear from bookshelves because future editions could be too big to print. Only an online format would be practicable and affordable as the third edition is expected to be twice the size of the current version, according to its publishers. Dubbed OED3, it is already running 20 years behind schedule – and compilers are not expected to finish until 2034. The Oxford English Dictionary may disappear from bookshelves because future editions could be too big to print . OED editor Michael Proffitt said the internet had slowed the process by creating so much more source material. ‘A lot of the first principles of the OED stand firm, but how it manifests has to change and how it reaches people has to change,’ he told Country Life magazine. ‘Although the internet has made access easier, it’s also created the dilemma of information overload.’ Publishers Oxford University Press said a print version would only appear if there was sufficient demand when the third edition was completed. If it does appear in book form, it is expected to comprise 40 volumes – double the length of the second edition in 1989. Only an online format would be practicable and affordable as the third edition is expected to be twice the size of the current version, according to its publishers . Mr Proffitt’s team of 70 word experts have been working on the latest version since 1994. They have a target of 50 to 60 words a month for the third edition, which currently numbers 800,000 words. The second edition, which has nearly one third of a million entries, costs £750. It has been online since 2000 and receives more than two million hits a month. Mr Proffitt said giant reference works such as the OED had a great future on the internet. He added: ‘In 1989, we looked for five years’ recorded usage before a word entered the dictionary. ‘Now it’s ten years because there is so much more material to sift through.

"By . Jim Norton . Heritage: Cox's Orange Pippin, pictured growing on the tree, has been named the most popular fruit tree for home gardening . There might not be many traditional English apples to be found in your supermarket any more – but you’ll certainly find them cropping up in gardens. Record sales of ‘heritage’ fruit trees have been reported this year - with one of the country’s finest apples, Cox’s Orange Pippin, the most popular. The figures suggest there is still a great appetite for fruit varieties native to Britain, despite claims that supermarkets tend to rely on more consistent varieties from abroad. The latest sales figures from Homebase have revealed a 30 per cent increase in sales of fruit trees this year. According to the retailer, the number one choice was Cox’s Orange Pippin - widely regarded as the finest eating apple in the world. Worcester Pearmain - a small, classic English apple renowned for its strawberry-like flavour - came in second place. It was closely followed in third by Laxton’s Superb, the definitive late-Victorian dessert apple. Homebase has further predicted demand for vegetable seeds to increase by 20 per cent this year. The retailer has claimed record numbers of gardeners are growing their own heritage fruit in order to show their ‘anger at supermarkets who refuse to stock UK sourced traditional fruit and veg’. Strawberry-like: The Worcester Pearmain variety, pictured, was the second-most popular, according to Homebase . But fruit expert Adrian Barlow said a number of English varieties just weren’t commercially viable. He added that supermarkets had in fact been very supportive of the UK apple industry in recent years. Mr Barlow, who is the chief executive of English Apples and Pears Ltd, said: ‘A number of varieties can’t be grown commercially because the yields are insufficient in order to provide the grower with a profit. He used Laxton’s Superb as an example, explaining that supermarkets didn’t stock them because they didn’t keep well and had a greasy skin. Mr Barlow . said: ‘Supermarkets have actually increased their stocking of English . apples hugely over the past seven or eight years. In fact, they are . selling as much as the industry can produce. Definitive: Laxton's superb, pictured, a Victorian classic which has not proved commercially viable, is also enjoying a comeback . ‘During the 1990s, it’s true to say supermarkets focused on imports, but that has changed completely. The rise in sales also suggests that people are searching for ways to save on their grocery shopping. A separate report by Homebase, which surveyed the shopping habits of over 61,000 people across the UK, found that 26 per cent of homeowners now owned a vegetable plot. A spokesman for the store said: ’An entire generation is rediscovering the delicate flavours of fruit and vegetables eaten straight from the garden. ‘These are the subtle taste and textures which our grandparents would have taken for granted - and gardeners are also saving hundreds of pounds in the process.’","New figures from Homebase shows a boom in grow-your-own food .

"By . Rebecca Evans, In London . and Gerard Couzens, In Marbella . The ex-girlfriend of a British millionaire gold dealer is being sought by police after he was murdered at his Spanish villa. Company director Andrew Bush, 48, was shot twice in the head, apparently as he arrived at the beach-side holiday home with his new British girlfriend. Spanish police are seeking a blonde Eastern European in her twenties, believed to be his former lover. 'Crazed and jealous': Mr Bush was in a two-year relationship with lingerie and swimwear model Miss Kukucova (pictured), who is half his age, until he ended it in October. She is said to have taken the break-up badly . Scene: The wealthy jeweller was found lying in a pool of blood at his villa with two gunshot wounds to his head . Andrew Bush is understood to have been shot as he and his British girlfriend returned to his Costa del Sol villa . Search: Last night, as the net was closing in on Miss Kukucova after police found Mr Bush's 4x4 Hummer she is accused of fleeing in, videos and messages she had sent to her former boyfriend emerged . Obsessive? Photographs and videos of the couple together, captioned with words of affection and apology, show how intensive and perhaps obsessive, Miss Kukucova's feelings for the businessman were . Mr Bush, from Bristol, is understood to have been shot as he and his British girlfriend returned to the villa on the Costa del Sol from a holiday together. The killer is believed to have fled the scene in his Hummer truck. Sources close to the investigation say police are considering whether his former partner – who is from Slovakia – was at the property near Estepona when Mr  Bush was shot. They believe the killer had been waiting, possibly for days, for the couple to return. A source said: ‘It is being treated as murder and police are hunting the dead man’s ex.’ Andrew Bush, right, with Mayka Kukucova. The 48-year-old company director was shot at the beach-side holiday home as he arrived with his new British girlfriend . Mr Bush, who owns a chain of jewellery shops, had a home in South Wales but spent much of his time at the rented five-bedroom villa at Cancelada, between Estepona and San Pedro de Alcantara. Yesterday, police took luxury cars – including a Porsche and Ferrari – from the property. An Audi believed to have been used by the killer was also taken away. Mr Bush’s British girlfriend, who has not been named but is thought to be in her twenties, is said to have told investigators that his ex-lover opened the door as they returned from a week away at around 2am on Saturday. She called police after being barred entry and seeing the woman speed off in Mr Bush’s Hummer. She did not have keys to get in. Police and fire officers climbed into the building and found Mr Bush’s body lying in a pool of blood next to a gun. The ex-girlfriend’s identity is not known but the source said she was Slovakian. Several photographs on Facebook show Mr Bush embracing a blonde model, Mayka Marica Kukucova, who is Slovakian and who is believed to be an ex-girlfriend. The neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘She and Andrew moved in to the villa together nearly two years ago. The English girlfriend only appeared recently on the scene. Andrew was away and the Spanish owner let himself into the garden a week before Saturday’s shooting to show the gardener something to do with the swimming pool. A British millionaire gold dealer and jeweller has been shot dead at his mansion Spain, it has emerged.  The victim, named locally in Costa del Sol as Andrew Bush, 48, was found shot in the head on Saturday morning . Sources close to the investigation say police are considering whether his former partner, who is from Slovakia, was at the property near Estepona when Mr  Bush was shot . Detectives sealed off the villa late on Saturday ahead of its examination by police forensic experts . Sunbathing: Several photographs on Facebook show Mr Bush embracing blonde model, Miss Kukucova . Miss Kukucova’s Facebook page shows a number of photographs of her posing in swimwear and lingerie . Pose: One photograph on Miss Kukucova's Facebook page appears to have been for the fashion chain H&M . ‘He has told police all the curtains were drawn, which he found strange because whenever Mr Bush was away – and he was away often – he never drew the curtains.’ Miss Kukucova’s Facebook page shows photos of her posing in swimwear and lingerie, as well as less revealing outfits. One photoshoot, in her underwear, appears to have been for the fashion chain H&M. She says she was a student at a Bristol language school. One of the businesses owned by Mr Bush . was Andrew Davids jewellers in Bristol. Its city centre branch in The . Galleries was closed yesterday but a woman who runs a business opposite . said: ‘I used to see him around. He was a really nice guy – I can’t . believe what has happened.’ Another neighbour in Cancelada said that Mr Bush was a quiet man who kept himself to himself. ‘He . wasn’t around all the time. I’ve heard he had business interests all . over the world although I wasn’t sure exactly what he did. Hiding: Mr Bush's allegedly killer may have been laying in wait for several days after letting herself into the villa . An Audi car believed to have been used by the alleged killer was taken away along with a Porsche and Ferrari thought to be owned by the dead man and a gun found by his side . Goldtrader jewellers in Bristol, which is owned by Andrew Bush . The . only woman I ever saw at the property was a pretty young blonde woman . who was British like him. She was his current girlfriend. She must have . been in her mid to late twenties. He kept a boat in the grounds and he . always drove nice cars.’ A . Spanish emergency services spokesman said: ‘We received a call at . 2.10am on Saturday from the partner of the dead man because she could . not gain access to the property. Firefighters managed to get in and found the man lying dead inside with a gunshot wound to his head. Police are investigating.’ Mr . Bush had a five-bedroom, £500,000 property in Chepstow, South Wales, . with metal shutters on the windows and reinforced gates. A neighbour . said an armed robbery took place there last year, when an Eastern . European housemaid was tied up. A . Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British . national in Estepona. We are in touch with local authorities and stand . ready to offer consular assistance to the family.’ Firefighters and police made the grim discovery after forcing their way into his beachside villa near the resort of Estepona following a desperate 999 call from a new girlfriend .","Dead man, a 48-year-old company director, named locally as Andrew Bush .

"By . Jim Norton . Chris Grayling claimed the legal system was being used as a 'weapon' against Government reforms . Legal aid should not be used by foreigners to fight cases in British courts, the Justice Minister has warned. Chris Grayling said such cases jeopardise public faith in the justice system. He also accused law firms and pressure groups of using taxpayers’ money to profit from cases aimed at blocking legitimate Government decisions made by democratically-elected MPs. In an article for the Telegraph, he argued that the legal system was being used as a ‘weapon’ in order to stop the difficult decisions the Government was taking to ‘secure a better future for our country’. Claiming that British society was ‘too legalistic’, he added: ‘A minority of law firms and some pressure groups make a healthy living by finding more and more varied ways to challenge government  in court – and getting you to pay  the bill.’ As an example, Mr Grayling cited Public Interest Lawyers – which acted for Iraqis who are claiming that British troops unlawfully killed up to 20 civilians. But last month, following a year-long public inquiry costing the taxpayer more than £20million, the firm accepted there was no evidence to substantiate the claims. Mr Grayling, who also has the title Lord Chancellor, is attempting to cut legal aid spending and tighten rules on judicial reviews, despite fierce opposition from the legal profession. The minister postponed some cuts in legal aid spending until the next Parliament following a protest from barristers last month – but he still plans to trim the cost of publicly-funded legal services. He added: ‘We have made some exceptions for certain cases involving particularly vulnerable people, such as refugees who arrive in the UK ﬂeeing persecution elsewhere. But why should you pay the legal bill of people who have never even been to Britain?’ The minister postponed some cuts in legal aid spending until the next Parliament following a protest from barristers last month .","Minister claims legal system is being used as a 'weapon' against reforms .

"Leading preps including Duchess of . Cambridge's old school back plan . By . Jonathan Petre . Britain's poorest children should be given priority places at all top schools, including fee-paying institutions such as Eton, leading head teachers will demand today. Under plans that will dismay middle-class families who fear their children will lose out, sought-after state and elite private schools would be compelled to fast-track pupils on free school meals to the front of every admissions queue. The heads will say that independent schools should reserve about ten per cent of their places for poor pupils and waive most of their fees – or risk being stripped of their charitable status. Free Places: Britain's poorest children should be given priority places at all top schools, including fee-paying institutions such as Eton College, leading head teachers will demand today . Popular state grammars, academies and comprehensives would have to allow children on free school meals from anywhere in the country to jump the queue over better-off families who can afford homes in the catchment area where prices may be higher precisely because of the school’s reputation. The radical proposals have been drawn up by the executive of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), which represents more than 28,000 heads and senior staff, and will be debated at its annual conference in Birmingham today. They have already gained support from leading independent prep schools, including the head of St Andrew’s School in Pangbourne, Berkshire, the alma mater of the Duchess of Cambridge. NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby . admitted the proposals were controversial, but said: ‘This would mean . that parental wealth was no longer a barrier to getting children from . disadvantaged backgrounds into the best schools in the country and it . will narrow the attainment gap between rich and poor, which is the No 1 . problem we face in education.’ Controversy: National Association of Head Teachers  general secretary Russell Hobby admitted the proposals were controversial . But Margaret Morrissey, founder of the pressure group Parents Outloud, said: ‘I find this disgusting. If my child has every right to a place but is not eligible for free school meals, why should he or she be put to the back of the queue behind a child who is claiming free school meals? What is the difference? ‘You have a hard-working family doing their best for their kids but they earn just too much and they lose out to parents who never get off their backsides to do any work at all, claim every benefit there is under the sun and get the place. ‘That can’t be right, and I am staggered that these head teachers cannot see that point, because there is not any equality in that for children.’ The NAHT executive’s plans, which delegates are likely to endorse today, follow disclosures last week that several selective grammars have already chosen to use existing legislation to encourage poor children to apply to their schools. But the NAHT’s proposals go much further by urging politicians to ensure that all schools should offer places to the 1.3 million children who are eligible for free school meals because their parents are on benefits or earn less than £16,000 a year. Fee-paying schools that can charge more than £20,000 a year for day places would recoup some of their costs from the pupil premium – extra Government funding allocated to recipients of free school meals worth £1,300 per pupil next year. Popular state schools that normally give priority to children who live closest to them, resulting in house prices soaring in the vicinity of the schools and creating middle-class enclaves, would be required to  give places first to poorer pupils from elsewhere. Poor pupils would still have to pass any entrance tests, such as the 11-plus. Mr Hobby will today tell the NAHT conference: ‘Looked-after children currently get priority in admissions. What if we extended this right to all children on free school meals, who could automatically go to the head of the admissions queue for any school their parents chose? ‘At a stroke, this would limit the house price barrier to good schools and secure more firmly the comprehensive principle of education.’ He said many private schools already provided generous bursaries to poorer pupils, and he hoped they would comply voluntarily. But if they did not, the Government could change the law so they could lose their charitable status which allows them to reduce their tax bills. Cost: Fee-paying schools that can charge more than £20,000 a year for day places would recoup some of their costs from the pupil premium . David Hanson, chief executive of the Independent Association of Prep Schools, said: ‘We have long been calling on the Government to help hard-pressed families gain access to the excellent education our schools offer. ‘The NAHT has raised a very interesting proposal that, on the face of it, we would warmly support. ‘If fees could be partly funded by a pupil premium from the Government, many of our schools would be very happy to make up the difference through their bursary funds.’ St Andrew’s head David Livingstone added: ‘I’m very much for it. To increase the choice of parents about where they send their children must be good.’ But former private school head and NAHT member Chris McGovern, of the Campaign For Real Education, said: ‘This is social engineering that will result in unfair discrimination against anybody who does not fit the free school meal criteria. ‘It is an incentive for parents not to work in order to benefit from this positive discrimination. It should never see the light of day.’ Delegates at the conference  yesterday held a minute’s silence for teacher Ann Maguire, who  was stabbed to death in front of  her pupils in Leeds. Mrs Maguire, 61, was attacked in her classroom  at Corpus Christi Catholic College last Monday.","Fury of parents who fear their children will lose out because of 'anti-middle-class' social engineering .

"By . David Williams . They were intended to be ‘Tapes from Beyond the Grave’ – explosive interviews with former IRA terrorists revealing some of their most notorious crimes. The interviews, recorded for a history project, were granted only under strict condition that they were not released until after the deaths of all concerned. But after a fierce legal battle, the secret interviews were passed to the police in Northern Ireland – and the bombshell revelations contained on the tapes are thought to be a key factor behind the dramatic arrest and questioning of Gerry Adams at a police station in Antrim yesterday. Former friends: Gerry Adams (left) is pictured in Long Kesh prison with Brendan 'Darkie' Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA's Belfast Brigade. Hughes said Jean McConville was killed on Adams' orders . Murdered: At least two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader (right) to the murder of Jean McConville (left), the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, executed and secretly buried in December 1972 . At least . two high-profile IRA operatives have linked the Sinn Fein leader to the . murder of Jean McConville, the mother of ten who was brutally abducted, . executed and secretly buried in December 1972. The former IRA terrorists who claim they served alongside Adams say he ordered the killing. Adams . has repeated and categorically denied involvement in the death or the . IRA policy of ‘The Disappeared’ – men and women in Northern Ireland . suspected of being informers of the British who were taken from the . streets, questioned, shot and buried. But . the tapes and subsequent interviews allege a very different story in a . detailed series of claims which were yesterday being put to the . 65-year-old politician and architect of the Good Friday agreement. Denial: Adams has repeatedly denied involvement in McConville's death or the IRA policy of 'The Disappeared' Grieving: Jean McConville's family members carry flowers and a photo of their mother following her death . They . include two damning accounts – one of which was given by ex-hunger . striker Brendan ‘Darkie’ Hughes, a former deputy commander of the IRA’s . Belfast Brigade. Hughes, . who died in 2008, said McConville was killed on Adams’ orders. ‘There . was only one man who gave the order for that woman to be executed . . . that man is now the head of Sinn Fein,’ he said. ‘I . did not give the order to execute that woman. He did. I knew she was . being executed. I knew that. I didn’t know she was going to be buried or . disappeared as they called them now. ‘The . special squad was brought into the operation then called the Unknowns, . you know, when anyone needed to be taken away, they normally done it. I . had no control over this squad. Gerry had control over this particular . squad.’ Search: Irish police excavate the beach in Louth, Ireland, where the body of Jean McConville was found in 2003 . Removing her body: The mother of ten's body is removed from an area near Templetown beach in County Louth . Funeral: The family of McConville carry her coffin into church - 31 years after she was abducted and murdered . The . other damning account is that of Dolours Price, the first woman to . become a member of an IRA active service unit and the leader of the . terror cell which bombed the Old Bailey in 1973. Price, . who died last year, recounted how she was chosen to be part of a small . select unit within the three battalions that made up the Belfast . Brigade. The group of eight hand-picked volunteers, labelled ‘the . Unknowns’, were responsible for ‘special operations, including internal . investigations to weed out informers’. ‘The . hardest thing I ever did was drive those people away, the Disappeared,’ Price said. ‘I never knew for sure their ultimate end, I was simply . told by Gerry Adams to take the people away, a couple of lads or . whatever. Past: A younger Adams (centre) attends the funeral of an IRA member who was killed while planting a bomb . Interview: Gerry Adams remained in police custody here in Co Antrim, where he has been in custody since Wednesday . 'It was part of my job within the “Unknowns” to take them . across the border to hand them over to others. I don’t even remember . some of the names, isn’t that terrible?’ Price’s interview continued: ‘I drove away Jean McConville, a very, very unpleasant woman. ‘I know I shouldn’t speak ill of the dead and I don’t think she deserved to die and, at the time, I didn’t know she had children. Damning: Dolours Price, the first woman to become a member of an IRA active service unit, was the other operative to give a damning account . ‘I had a call one night and Adams was in a house down the Falls Road and she’d (McConville) been arrested by Cumann na mBan (a female wing of the IRA) women and held for a couple of days. She got into my car and as far as she was concerned she was being taken away by the Legion of Mary to a place of safety. ‘It was unfortunate for her and it was unfortunate for me as well because she was a foul-mouthed woman who cursed and swore a lot all the way down to the border. She went on and on about “them provies, they wouldn’t have the balls to shoot me... I don’t care what I did”. I was saying to myself, “please don’t say any more”, but she went on and on – she convicted herself out of her own mouth. It wasn’t my decision to disappear her, thank God. ‘You don’t deserve to die if you are an unpleasant person, as she was, but you do deserve to die if you are an informer, I do believe that. Particularly in a war, that is the Republican way.’ Like Hughes, Price provided her personal account of her time in the IRA to be part of the Boston College history project and in subsequent interviews. Researchers at Boston College last year lost a Supreme Court challenge in the US when they tried to block the release of the 84 tapes after the PSNI launched a high-profile legal challenge. So far, 11 have been handed over relating to the McConville case. The wild card in any prosecutions could be a former IRA man called Ivor Bell, 77, who had a bitter split with Adams in the mid-1980s. Bell’s interviews, if accepted as admissible evidence, could be used against Adams because Bell is still alive. Bell was charged in March with aiding and abetting in the murder of McConville, which he denies.

"By . Jim Norton . and Chris Pleasance . A British lottery winner scooped a staggering £73million jackpot on last night’s EuroMillions draw. It is the eighth highest lottery win in the UK – making the ticket holder richer than Formula One star Lewis Hamilton and level with Oasis musicians Noel and Liam Gallagher. They will also outstrip the likes of comedian Rowan Atkinson, film director Sir Ridley Scott, and England footballer Wayne Rooney. Last night’s winning numbers were 4, 30, 31, 38 and 42. The Lucky Star numbers were 2 and 11. A British winner has won £73million on the Euromillions, the eighth highest in UK lottery history . A spokesman for Camelot confirmed this morning that nobody had come forward to collect the prize. The spokesman told Mail Online: 'With the draw being at the weekend there's always the likelihood that people won't check their tickets immediately and will leave it until the start of the week. 'With this weekend being a bank holiday that is even more likely as they could be away from home and doing other things. 'So far nobody has come forward to claim the money so we are urging people to dig out their tickets and check because they could be sitting on a windfall.' There was no indication last night where . the winning ticket was bought, or who the winner was. With that cash whoever the lucky winner is will be able to buy themselves 31 Lamborghini Veneno supercars at £2.3million each. With £73million in your pocket, you could afford to buy yourself 73 Aston Martin One-77 supercars . You could also afford to dine out on 121,666 Zillion Dollar Frittatas. The £600 snack is sold at New York's Le Parker Meridien Hotel and contains 10 ounces of sevruga caviar . They will also be able to afford 121,666 Zillion Dollar Frittatas, officially the world's most expensive omlette, which is served up at Le Parker Meridien Hotel, New York and contains lobster and ten ounces of sevruga caviar. Britain’s largest jackpot winners to date are Colin and Christine Weir, who won £161million on EuroMillions in 2011. The couple, who have two children and had been married for 30 years when they won, reportedly bought a fleet of cars for their friends with the winnings, as well as a mansion. But winning the lottery can have its downsides. Adrian and Gillian Bayford announced that they were divorcing because of the ‘stress’ of scooping £148million, the second highest ever jackpot. Lottery operator Camelot has claimed only 2 per cent of winners had separated from their partners since winning a major prize. The biggest UK Euromillion winners are Colin and Christine Weir, from Largs in Ayrshire . Adrian and Gillian Bayford vowed not to let the money change them when they scooped £148million, but have since separated, citing the stress the win put on their marriage . But Paddy O’Donnell, psychology professor at the University of Glasgow, has previously warned such a large windfall creates an ‘enormous disruptive effect’ which can change friendships and family relations. He said winners experience an initial surge of happiness. But in a few months this would probably drop back to the level of contentment they felt before their windfall. Mr O’Donnell said: ‘If you ask people how they would feel if they won the lottery, everybody says “I would be happy for the rest of my life”.’ But he added that, in reality, someone earning £25,000 a year would be more or less as happy as someone earning £250,000 a year. The winning ticket-holder of last night's EuroMillions has shot to eight place on the National Lottery Rich List. Here are the official top 10 biggest winners since the lottery began: . 1. Colin and Chris Weir: £161,653,000 . The husband and wife, from Largs in Ayrshire, said they were 'tickled pink' after becoming Europe's biggest lottery winners in July 2011 . Married for 30 years and with two children, the life-changing £161 million prize catapulted them into the Sunday Times Rich List above Beatle Ringo Starr and Sir Tom Jones. Colin and Chris Weir hold the EuroMillions record win and have reportedly bought a fleet of luxury cars for their friends and a mansion for themselves . Psychiatric nurse Mrs Weir, 55, and Mr Weir, 64, who worked as a TV cameraman and studio manager for 23 years, have reportedly bought a fleet of cars for friends since their win as well as a mansion. 2. Adrian and Gillian Bayford: £148,656,000 . Children's nurse Gillian, 40, and record seller Adrian, 41, from Haverhill, Suffolk, said they planned to fork out on luxury holidays and cars when they won in August last year. Adrian and Gillian Bayford scooped £148million last year and bought a Georgian mansion together, but have since split up and are now with other people . Adrian joked to his wife that he had not bought any tickets, before she told him to be quiet as she was trying to get their children to sleep as he celebrated the win. The couple have since separated. 3. Anonymous: £113,019,926 . One British ticket scooped the massive prize in October 2010 but decided not to go public. 4. Neil Trotter, 41: £107,932,603.20 . Mr Trotter bought £10 worth of Lucky Dip tickets on Friday after getting a 'funny feeling' that he had to play while on the drive to work. Neil Trotter, a car mechanic, joked that he knew he would be a millionaire one day after his win, in reference to Only Fools and Horses . The winner, from Coulsdon, Surrey, is taking home £107,932,603.20, making him the 745th wealthiest person in the UK. It also means he is worth more than celebrities such as George Michael and Robbie Williams (who both have £105million) and David Bowie (£100million), according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. 5. Dave and Angela Dawes: £101,203,600 . Dave Dawes, 47, a shift supervisor for Premier Foods, and Angela Dawes, 43, a volunteer for the British Heart Foundation, hit the EuroMillions jackpot in October 2011. Dave and Angela Dawes went from living in a one-bedroom flat in Wisbech to a £9million country pile in Surrey after their win, but split up after arguing over how to split the money between their friends . It was only the third time the couple, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, had played the lottery. 6. Anonymous: £84,451,320 . The haul was won in May 2010 but the winner kept their identity secret. 7. Anonymous: £81,381,673 . A winner from 2013, who is yet to come forward: £81,381,673 . 8. Anonymous: £73,000,000 .

Self-confessed white van man Nigel Page, 43, scooped a cool £56 million in February 2010. Nigel Page married girlfriend Justine after his win, but reportedly paid an ex £2million after she sued him . The skydiving enthusiast, who lived in a three-bedroom semi near Cirencester, Wiltshire, married his girlfriend Justine, 42, and moved into a mansion in the Cotswolds. It was reported that he paid ex-wife Wendy, 43, £2million after she made a legal claim for £8million. The pair had separated 10 years before his bumper win. 10. Anonymous: £46,432,285 .

"By . Lucy Crossley . Karen Lyle, 50, was jailed for 22 years after she drugged her husband before dousing him in fuel and setting him alight . A woman who drugged her husband before dousing him in fuel and setting him alight has been jailed for 22 years. Karen Lyle, 50, searched the internet for 'ways to poison somebody' before secretly administering a strong anti-depressant to husband Andrew. She waited until Mr Lyle, 47, became drowsy and fell asleep on their bed - and then continued with her plot to murder him. The father-of-two was only saved by the fact he woke up halfway through the 'horrific' attack, which left him traumatised and with life-changing burns, Portsmouth Crown Court heard. Lyle denied attempting to murder her husband at their home in Fareham, Hampshire, but was convicted by a jury at trial. Nobody else was at home when the attack took place on July 2 last year. A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'An investigation by specialists from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service concluded that the cause of this fire was a naked flame upon an ignitable liquid. 'Mr Lyle was treated at Queen Alexandra Hospital and later airlifted to the burns unit at Salisbury hospital, where he was treated for significant injuries. 'He remained there for approximately a month. 'The police investigation showed that there was evidence of the drug Mirtazapine - which causes drowsiness - in Mr Lyle's system. 'It was revealed during the court case that Mrs Lyle had given this to her husband without his knowledge. The father-of-two was only saved by the fact he woke up halfway through the 'horrific' attack, which left him traumatised and with life-changing burns, Portsmouth Crown Court heard . 'Evidence to show that Mrs Lyle has been searching online for information about poisoning someone, was presented to the court.' Mr Lyle said after the case: 'This was an horrific attack, which has left me with life changing injuries and could easily have been fatal. 'The incident has deeply affected me and my two sons. 'The court case was traumatic for all my family, but I am content that justice has been done. Mr Lyle was treated at Queen Alexandra Hospital (pictured) and later airlifted to the burns unit at Salisbury hospital, where he was treated for significant injuries. 'I am grateful to all the professionals who helped us through this. 'They include the burns unit at Salisbury Hospital, Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service, and the prosecution team.'

"By . Glen Owen, Political Correspondent . Speaker John Bercow wants to increase the commercial potential of the House of Commons . John Bercow is planning a worldwide search for a £200,000- a-year Commons chief executive to  help to drive forward his controversial plans to commercialise the  Palace of Westminster. The Speaker is looking to break with centuries of history by appointing an entrepreneurial figure ‘in the mould of businesswoman Karren Brady or Sir Richard Branson’, with a shortlist of candidates drawn up after an extensive search. But Mr Bercow’s critics claim the plan is part of the Speaker’s desire to create his own West Wing-style powerbase in Parliament. The move follows last week’s announcement that Clerk of the House, Sir Robert Rogers – the most senior Parliamentary official – is retiring after just two-and-a-half years in the post. Sir Robert, who has worked in  Parliament for more than 42 years, had a tense relationship with Mr Bercow, marked by disagreements over the Speaker’s plans to increase Parliament’s income and bring more ‘outsiders’ into management. With the crumbling Commons  facing a repair bill estimated at more than £1 billion, Mr Bercow believes that more money needs to be found from commercial  ventures, such as hiring out the facilities to film companies – so  Sir Robert’s replacement should have a dazzling business CV. The Clerk of the House has traditionally been a constitutional  expert promoted from within the ranks of Commons officials. The Clerk’s job, which comes with a  £196,000-a-year salary, is currently split into two roles, doubling as both the chief constitutional adviser to the Speaker and the effective chief executive of the Commons. Under the new plan, the constitutional duties will be largely taken over by other officials. Public advertisements for the  position will be placed throughout  the Commonwealth. Sir Robert Rogers, Clerk of the House wanted to maintain the the traditions associated with the building . Sir Robert, 64, is highly respected  for the way he has managed to juggle Mr Bercow’s desire to modernise Parliament with the need to preserve Westminster’s traditions. He received a rare round of applause from MPs after his  retirement letter was read out  by Mr Bercow. It read: ‘Whatever the vicissitudes of parliamentary life and whatever brickbats may be thrown at it, I can truly say that the House now is a more effective scrutineer of the executive and more topical, relevant and independent-minded than I  have ever known it.’ But relations between him and  Mr Bercow had become increasingly strained as the Speaker  explored ways to boost Parliament’s revenues, described by critics as the ‘Disneyfication of the Commons’. Mr Bercow's plan has been dismissed by opponents as the 'Disneyfication of the Commons' A source said: ‘There was a running tension between Robert and Bercow over the extent to which outsiders should be brought in to run the place. ‘It was not so much the principle  – Robert is a good deal more open-minded than his predecessors and knows the Commons needs to be modernised – as the bombastic  and temperamental manner of  Bercow’s demands. It was all about creating his own fiefdom, a sort of White House West Wing. ‘He has made clear that the new boss has to be more of a Brady or a Branson than an Erskine May.’Labour MP Barry Sheerman said last night: ‘This doesn’t surprise me at all. The House of Commons Commission [its governing body] has completely lost the plot. ‘Opening up to every Tom, Dick and Harry does not work. It is a security risk and prevents us from serving our constituents in the efficient way they deserve.’ A spokesman for the Speaker said: ‘The search has begun to recruit  a new Clerk, which will include candidates drawn from abroad. ‘The successful candidate will need to combine business experience with constitutional expertise.’","Speaker John Bercow has been keen to increase the commercial potential of the Commons .

"By . Mark Duell . Couple: Lynsey McConnell, 24, of Kirkcaldy, is set to marry her 36-year-old fiancé Ally Grubb next year . A 24-year-old woman today revealed the ordeal of losing her unborn baby after she was mugged for a cigarettes packet by two female attackers. Lynsey McConnell was nine weeks pregnant when she was attacked by two women who beat her so savagely she suffered a miscarriage. She was confronted in Kirkcaldy, Fife, by Cheryl Henderson, 27, and 29-year-old Kelly Vanbeck, who demanded she hand over cigarettes. But the pair kicked her in the stomach after she said she did not smoke and tried to flee. A passing cyclist helped Miss McConnell escape but she was left devastated when doctors told her she had lost her baby in the assault. Now Miss McConnell - who is set to marry her fiancé Ally Grubb, 36, next year - is hoping that fertility treatment will help her have a baby. She said: ‘I was diagnosed at 15 with polycystic ovary syndrome and had been told it would be difficult to fall pregnant without help. ‘But in July 2012 I went to my GP thinking I had a sickness bug. The doctor asked me to do a pregnancy test as standard and I was gobsmacked when it came back positive. ‘So I was ecstatic when I found out and when I told Ally he was over the moon as well. Days later I went to visit a friend who had badly sprained her ankle and tell her my news. ‘I went to the garage to get her cigarettes but when I came out I was approached by two women who asked if I had any cigarettes and I said I didn’t smoke. 'But when she saw them in my pocket, one grabbed me and dragged me into an alley. ‘They went through my bag and demanded I hand over my bank card. When I said I didn’t know the pin I was kicked me in the face and as I fell to the ground they started kicking me. ‘I pleaded - saying I was pregnant, hoping they would leave me alone and begged them not to hurt my baby. But as soon as I said that, they started kicking me in the stomach and the pain just erupted. Miscarriage: Miss McConnell, who suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome, is hoping that fertility treatment will help her have a baby . ‘I kept saying “my baby”, but they continued to kick me. They robbed me of my great aunt’s necklace and my engagement ring.  I thought since they had what they wanted and that it would be over. ‘But then one of them ground her knee into my stomach and I felt a sudden damp patch on my leggings. Everything was a blur but I knew it was blood. I knew in that moment, I was losing my baby.’ Moving on: Miss McConnell and Mr Grubb are now planning their wedding for summer next year . Miss McConnell was taken to Kirkcaldy’s Victoria Hospital she was told the baby had been lost. She added: ‘My world just crashed down around me when I heard the words “no heartbeat”. ‘I was treated for broken ribs, a chipped eye socket and a dislocated ankle. They had dislocated my finger trying to snatch my engagement ring off it. ‘But I didn’t feel the pain - only numbness as I grieved for the baby I never thought I’d have, who was now gone. We had to postpone our wedding as we mourned our baby. ‘I gave a statement to police and within a few days the girls were caught. I still suffer flashbacks and have terrible nightmares.’ Henderson and Vanbeck pled guilty to assault and robbery at Kirkcaldy Sheriff Court in October 2012. Henderson was jailed for 33 months and Vanbeck for 27 months. Miss McConnell and Mr Grubb are now planning their wedding for summer 2015 and undergoing fertility tests and treatment at Victoria Hospital. She added: ‘Now we are just having tests done to hopefully decided what avenues can be explored. After everything, it has given us hope.’ Mr Grubb, who gave up his call-centre work to become Lynsey’s full-time carer, said: ‘It was a terrible time and losing the baby was very traumatic.’","Lynsey McConnell, 24, was nine weeks pregnant when she was attacked .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . and Hayley Coyle . Even before they took their seats for her show last night, mothers and their young daughters were left in no doubt about what Miley Cyrus had in store for them. Dozens of explicit images displaying the controversial star’s body parts had been branded on to clothing, bags and underwear and displayed on merchandise stalls ready for the fans, some as young as six. And once Miss Cyrus did appear on stage – via a long, pink slide designed to resemble her tongue – things only got more shocking. Scroll down for video . Fresh off the boat: Miley Cyrus arrived at the O2 Arena in London by boat where she had promised to 'f*** this place up' during a show where all children under 15 had to be accompanied by a parent . It took only one minute for her to utter four swear words, and her foul language became increasingly appalling as the concert went on. In her first London show on the European leg of her Bangerz tour, Miss Cyrus also simulated an orgy, talked about watching pornography, asked the audience of mostly young girls if they were ‘slutty’, urged the crowd to ‘make out’ with each other and joked about drinking, smoking and taking drugs. During her rendition of her godmother Dolly Parton’s son Jolene, towards the end of her set, she shouted the C-word, before telling fans: ‘This is Europe, y’all can say c*** here.’ She also simulated an orgy on a bed with six male and female dancers, before asking the audience if they were as slutty as her American fans. She then urged people to ‘make out’ with the person next to them, the ‘dirtier the better’, before projecting images of her young fans passionately kissing onto a giant screen. Later she spat bottled water onto the front row. Not too worried: Hannah Cave, 37, from Yateley, Hampshire, took her eight-year-old daughter Ruby and said her daughter was too young to understand the sexualised imagery . Controversial from start: This merchandise stand featuring Miley Cyrus in a series of explicit photographs with parental advisory and censoring signs met parents and their young children when they arrived at the O2 arena for the show . She hasn't changed: Miley performs provocative moves onstage at London's O2 arena . Some parents said they had taken their children to the concert on a school night after giving in to pressure from them. Others justified subjecting their young daughters to lewd displays from Miss Cyrus by claiming ‘it’s nothing they haven’t seen before’. The former Disney star performed her first London show on the European leg of her Bangerz tour at the O2 arena last night. The show has an age restriction with under-15s needing to be accompanied by an adult. At a press conference earlier in the day, 21-year-old Miss Cyrus, who has undergone an extreme and raunchy makeover since her days playing wholesome teenager Hannah Montana for Disney, declared: ‘I’m gonna f*** this place up. ‘We’re gonna have a lot of fun. We’re gonna be, like, tops off, f*****g screaming.’ As they made their way inside the arena, many parents said they expected the show to be explicit but did not think it would harm their young children. Hannah Cave, 37, from Yateley, Hampshire, took her eight-year-old daughter Ruby and said that although the show was ‘likely to be shocking’, her daughter was too young to understand the sexualised imagery. She said: ‘To her licking a hammer is just licking a hammer. Plus a lot of these young girls loved Miley as Hannah Montana. ‘I think she thinks her transformation is a bit weird but sex and shocking stunts like Miley’s are all over the internet and news so children are much more unshockable now.’ Ego show: Miss Cyrus simulated an orgy, talked about watching pornography, asked the audience of mostly young girls if they were 'slutty', urged the crowd to 'make out' with each other and joked about drinking, smoking and taking drugs . They were warned: Miley has the phrase 'Parental Advisory Explicit Content' projected onto the stage . Party hard: There was no trace of Hannah Montana in her performance . Bad role model: Miley made several references to taking drugs, including saying her band was 'stoned' and asking the audience to take pills . Katie Thomas, 41, from High Barnet, north London, who brought her nine-year-old daughter Bay, said she felt ‘conflicted’. ‘I . work in the entertainment industry so I understand what she’s doing . somewhat. She’s young and pushing boundaries. But would I want my . daughter acting like that and dressing like some of the fans here? Absolutely not. ‘Though I . wouldn’t want my child to behave like Miley I don’t want my child to . judge either and I don’t think it’s wrong for them to experience new and . unusual things. ‘It develops their character and it’s not good to have too much censoring.’ John Hurst, 38, from Loughton, Essex, . took his 11-year-old daughter. He said: ‘It’s not my cup of tea, but she . wanted to come. It’s going to be a late night and it’s a shame, but . she’s promised to be good in school.’ But . Claire Dyer, 37, from Biggin Hill, said she had not wanted to bring her . six-year-old Emily, but had eventually caved in to her daughter’s . pleas. She said: ‘I don’t think Miley is a very good role model. I don’t like the idea of them selling suggestive underwear either. ‘The . show will probably be very shocking, I’ll probably have to cover . Emily’s eyes. Some of the girls here are dressed very indecently. I . would not want my daughter dressed like that at her age.’ She likes the high life: Miley wore Marijuana leaf shades with a gold chain to match . Injured: Miley said on stage hat she had sprained her foot during her stint in hospital . Last night parents looked furious as Miss Cyrus uttered four swear words in the first minute of her show. She also joked to the audience of mostly young girls that they had been drinking, smoking and taking drugs. Miss Cyrus was forced to postpone her US tour last month after a sinus infection and an unexplained bereavement. Yesterday she said suggestions on the internet that she may have overdosed on drugs were lies. She said: ‘When people are lying on the internet saying you’ve had an overdose, that makes you feel better. ‘I’m feeling good, I’m alive, so that’s f****** awesome. Look at me, I’m the poster child for good health.’ The daughter of country singer Billy Ray Cyrus, Miss Cyrus brought the word ‘twerking’ into the popular vocabulary last year when she performed a provocative set with pop star Robin Thicke at the MTV Music Awards. It prompted a storm of complaints, but the pop star brushed them off, saying she was ‘representing women in a cool way’.","Miley Cyrus performed her first London concert at the O2 on Tuesday .

"By . Lucy Crossley . The story of one Scottish mother's struggle after she lost four sons in the First World War has been turned into a book which will be published to coincide with her family's first ever international reunion. Elizabeth Cranston was so devastated when four of her sons were killed and another two seriously injured that she left Scotland for Australia in an attempt to escape her tragic past. But her dreams of a new start also turned sour and she gradually lost her grip on reality, ending up making a daily pilgrimage to the local railway station . where she would wait for hours for her beloved boys to come home. Sacrifice: Mother Elizabeth Cranston (pictured in the second row, second from right, with her family in 1908) was so devastated when four of her sons died in the First World War that she emigrated. This photo shows the entire Cranston family in 1908. Back row left to right, William, born 1884; Mary, born 1891; James, 1887, who died in basic training of tuberculosis; Agnes, born 1885; Adam, born 1889, listed as missing presumed killed in Belgium.

Centre, Robert, born 1899, and front left to right Andrew, born 1895 and George, born 1892. Now the tragic story of losing her sons has been turned into a book, Blood On The Thistle, written by her Australian great-grandson Stuart Pearson, with the help of a Scottish historian. One of Mrs Cranston's son's James, 28, a sapper in the Royal Engineers, didn't even make it to the front line. He died of . tuberculosis while still doing his basic training in England, and living in a . cold, cramped army barracks. John, 34, a Company Sergeant . Major in the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, died under a barrage of . shellfire in the first battle of the Somme. He posthumously received a Distinguished Conduct medal for bravery under fire. Tragedy: James, 28, (left) died of tuberculosis while in basic training, while John, 34, (right) a Company Sergeant Major, died under a barrage of shellfire in the first battle of the Somme .

Royal Scots Fusiliers, was listed as missing, presumed killed in action . at the Battle of Ancre in France where 100,000 soldiers marched . straight into German machine gun-fire. In 1918, eldest brother Sergeant . Alexander Cranston, 39, of the Royal Engineers, was posted as missing, . presumed killed at the second Battle of the Somme. Two of the three remaining brothers . were left scarred for life. William lost an eye and three fingers under . fire in France, while Lance Corporal George Cranston of the 8th Royal . Scots was so severely gassed in 1918 his skin continued to peel off for . the rest of his life. Only Robert, a member of the Royal Flying Corps who did not fight in the trenches survived relatively unscathed. Injured: William (left) lost an eye and three fingers under fire in France, while Lance Corporal George Cranston (right) was so severely gassed in 1918 his skin continued to peel off for the rest of his life . Survivor: Only Robert Cranston, a member of the Royal Flying Corps who did not fight in the trenches survived relatively unscathed . Mrs Cranston moved to Sydney in 1920 to start a new life, only to live out her days in a psychiatric hospital. She . would often be seen waiting on a platform at the nearby railway . station, tragically telling passing travellers she was 'waiting for my . boys to come home'. Her . youngest son, Angus, was too young to serve in the First World War and . suffered survivor's guilt after serving in World War Two. He later . became alcoholic. The Cranstons' sacrifice has been . recognised by the Imperial War Museum and Scottish National War Memorial . as one of the most significant made by a family during the Great War. Mourning: Elizabeth Cranston and her son Andrew pictured wearing mourning dress in Australia in 1921 . The publication of Blood On The Thistle coincides with the first international reunion of Mrs Cranston's descendents, with family members from Canada, New Zealand and Australia all . travelling to Haddington, East Lothian, Scotland to pay a poignant tribute to the . seven brothers who went to war. One of the family members who is organising the three-day event later this month said it will be heart-warming to meet fellow descendants of the Cranston family. Sydney-based Mr Pearson, great-grandson of Mrs Cranston, stumbled across his family's story a few years ago and travelled to Scotland in 2011 to research it with Lothian historian Bob Mitchell. New start: Elizabeth, George and Robert Cranston (all circled) arrive in Australia in 1920 on TSS Euripides . He was also instrumental in the installation of a bronze plaque dedicated to the family, which will be unveiled at Haddington's museum and local history archive the John Gray Centre during the reunion. 'The Cranston story is heartbreaking,' said Mr Pearson. 'A most poignant aspect was the affect on the mother, Lizzie Cranston. 'Once a proud, capable, strong woman, the loss and wounding of so many of her sons caused her to suffer mentally. Honour: A bronze plaque dedicated to the family will be unveiled at Haddington's museum and local history archive the John Gray Centre (pictured) during the reunion . 'In 1920, she was taken to Australia for a better life, but her condition continued to deteriorate so badly that she was institutionalised in a psychiatric hospital where she died in 1929. 'Until the day she died, she kept waiting for her boys to come home. 'Now descendants of the family, scattered across the globe, are returning to East Lothian for a weekend of activities to mark the centenary of the war which broke us apart.' Activities planned at the reunion include a heritage walk around Haddington, a coach tour of the Scottish borders and a ceilidh.","James, John, Adam and Alexander Cranston all died in First World War .

"By . Jim Norton . Tax shelter: A court has ruled that Gary Barlow used an so-called investment company in order to avoid tax . Gary Barlow and fellow Take That members invested more than £20million in a massive tax avoidance scheme, it was reported last night. The X Factor judge, Mark Owen, Howard Donald and their manager Jonathan Wild invested £66million into Icebreaker Management, which styled itself as a music-industry investment scheme. But a court ruled yesterday that it was in fact an artificial tax shelter for the super-rich. The band members are now likely to face repaying £20million to HM Revenue & Customs, according to The Times. For years, HRMC has been trying to shut down Icebreaker Management, which claims to invest money in the music industry for profit by producing ‘creative and artistic material and taxable profits’. In 2012, it was revealed that the three Take That members had invested £26million into an Icebreaker partnership. It is claimed the musicians were able to avoid tax on about £63 million from world tours and CD sales. They were among nearly 1,000 people who contributed £480million to 62 partnerships. But a tax judge found that 51 of the Icebreaker partnerships, which were formed between 2004 and 2010, hadn’t made any profit - despite investigating in a range of musicians including Sinead O’Connor. According to The Times, Judge Colin Bishopp said: ‘Icebreaker is, and was known and understood by all concerned to be, a tax avoidance scheme. ‘The aim was to secure [tax] relief for members, and to inflate the scale of the relief by unnecessary borrowing.’ He added: ‘No serious or even moderately sophisticated investor, genuinely seeking a profit... would rationally have chosen an Icebreaker partnership. Bandmates: Barlow (centre) as well as Mark Owen (right) and Howard Donald (second from left) used the scheme. There is no suggestion that either Robbie Williams or Jason Orange, also pictured, were involved . ‘The predominant purpose of entering the scheme was ""to achieve a tax saving"".’ A spokesman for HRMC said: ‘HMRC has put in place generous reliefs to support genuine business investment and our tax reliefs for the creative industries work well, enabling the UK’s world-class film, television and video production companies to compete on the global stage. ‘But we will not tolerate abuse of the system by people trying to dodge their tax obligations. HMRC will continue to challenge in the courts and anyone who engages in tax avoidance schemes risks not only the high cost of these schemes but also lay themselves open to penalties and, potentially, prosecution.’ In 2012, lawyers representing Barlow, Donald, Owen, and Mr Wild confirmed they were investors in the partnerships, but believed they were legitimate enterprises and not tax-avoidance schemes. They added that their clients paid significant amounts of tax. There is no suggestion that the other members of Take That, Robbie Williams and Jason Orange, were investors. A spokesman for Icebreaker Management said: ‘This decision puts valuable funding for the UK’s independent music industry in jeopardy.’","Barlow, as well as bandmates Mark Owen and Howard Donald used scheme .

Victim: Darrin Campbell, pictured right, his . wife Kimberly and their teenage children aged 19 and 16 were identified . as the victims of the fire that engulfed the home they were renting from . tennis ace James Blake, left . 'I was walking my . dogs, and I walked by the house and it exploded!' the caller told the . dispatcher. Describing . the scene inside the burnt-out mansion as 'unusual,' firefighters said . they discovered fireworks littered through the five-bedroom home rented . from former tennis player Blake, who was ranked fourth in the world in . 2006. Authorities said the two teenagers were found in their bedrooms and the two adults . were found in their bedroom. There was an accelerant was found across the . mansion. They also said that no weapons have been recovered from the home. The mother of Darrin Campbell said she was distraught and confused. 'I have no idea what happened,' Mary Campbell said. 'I spoke to him last night.' Sad: Colin Campbell, 19, pictured left at prom and right on the baseball field, was an active sportsman while at school . Tragic: Megan, 16, pictured left and right, . attended Carrollwood day school, and the principal reportedly said this . afternoon that both students will be missed . Fire: The blaze was so ferocious on May 7 that firefighters could not get in to examine the grisly scene until the next day .

I’m out in Tucson, and he . wanted to make sure I was taken care of.' At one time, Darrin Campbell was the senior vice president at PODS, a company that provides mobile, temporary shipping and storage containers. According to his LinkedIn profile, he left PODS in 2007 and was a vice president at IVANS, an insurance company. IVANS was purchased by another company and Campbell no longer worked there, said Matt Fogt, a spokesman for the new company, Applied Systems, who was reached by telephone. Both children, Colin, and . Megan, attended Carrollwood day school, and the principal said on Wednesday that they will be missed. Guards were posted at the . front gate, turning away visitors, Fox 13 reported. According to her Twitter, Megan won an academic award at the school just a day before the deaths. Authorities said it is unclear whether the family was killed by the fire or . some other cause and will remain so until autopsies are completed. TV . reporter Meredyth Censullo, most recently of ABC, tweeted that the . victims had 'gunshot wounds to the head.' In . a follow up tweet, she cited a source as saying the bodies found in the . burning mansion 'had heavy duty fireworks wrapped around their heads.' Scorched: At least three people were discovered dead in the lavish home, pictured . Darrin Campbell was reportedly found dead on the floor, and Kimberly in a bed. Censullo tweeted that several gas . cans were found on the second floor of the mansion. Campbell, . who is originally from Detroit, Michigan, began his career in 1992 at . Ford Motor Co, according to an article in the Tampa Bay Times. He . worked in various financial positions, principally financial analysis . before moving to San Antonio, Texas as chief financial officer for the . Pabst Blue Ribbon beer company. In . 2000 he relocated to Tampa and joined Anchor Glass Container Co. as . senior vice president of sales, leaving as chief executive to join PODS. He later joined Tampa based Ivans Insurance Solutions but left three years ago. A spokesman for the company said they did not believe he had a job to go to when he quit the company. Crews: Emergency crews rushed t the property, pictured, after 911 calls were made before 6a.m. Scene: A firefighter is seen entering the smoke-filled mansion in the early hours of Wednesday morning . In a 2005 profile of Campbell the Tampa newspaper said he and his wife had their honeymoon at Disney World in Orlando. Campbell said he and his family visited the theme parks in the area about a half-dozen times a year. The fire broke out before 6a.m. and Hillsborough County Fire Rescue crews rushed to the scene. Hours . later, firefighters were still there putting out hot spots at the home. It could be days before detectives are able to sift through the charred . debris, officials said. Blake purchased the home in Avila for $1.5 million in 2005, according to Hillsborough County property records. Neighbors told detectives that Blake hasn't lived in the house for a while and was renting it out, police said. Detectives hadn't talked with Blake, whose agent said he was certain Blake was not in Florida. 'He's not in Florida, I can tell you 100 percent that he's not in Florida,' Carlos Fleming told The Associated Press. It had five bedrooms and five bathrooms. Video of the fire showed it totally engulfed in flames. 'It's . in the back part of Avila, the million-dollar homes. It's a massive . home,' said Nacole Revette, a spokeswoman for Hillsborough Fire Rescue. Star's house: A James Blake Foundation spokesman said Blake was not inside when the fire broke out . Fireworks: TV reporter Meredyth Censullo, most recently of ABC, tweeted that the victims had 'gunshot wounds to the head' and fireworks strapped to them . Rented: The mansion, in Avila, Tampa, pictured, was reportedly being rented out at the time of the fire . Away: Blake, pictured with his wife, Emily, was reportedly at their Connecticut residence when the fire broke out . The Sheriff's office said they are concerned about losing evidence to the fire. Blake's . next door neighbor reportedly told TMZ Sports that he heard several . large explosion in early this morning and saw an 'instant fireball . inferno' when he went outside to check it out. He said the sound seemed to be coming from the garage of Blake's house. They . added that detectives may not be able to even enter the remains of the . home until Thursday, due to structural damage. This will delay the official . identification of the victims. Once it is safe to enter, investigators will likely be on site for days gathering evidence. Avila is an exclusive enclave north of Tampa known for its mansions and heavy security. Many . well-known athletes call the community home and over the years, various . football, baseball and tennis players have bought homes in the . subdivision, which has a country club and golf course.

"By . Francesca Chambers . President Obama last night claimed that the GOP had blocked 500 bills since 2007 as accusations of 'Republican obstructionism' are making an election-year comeback. Obama and the Democratic Party have been forced onto the offensive as they try to explain to their big dollar donors why they've been unable to move forward on issues important to the base despite holding the upper chamber and the presidency. 'Their willingness to say no to everything — the fact that since 2007, . they have filibustered about 500 pieces of legislation that would help . the middle class just gives you a sense of how opposed they are to any . progress,' President Barack Obama told attendees of a Democratic Party fundraiser on Wednesday evening at the home of Walt . Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn in Los Angeles, California. The President said Republicans' behavior 'has actually led to an increase in cynicism and . discouragement among the people who were counting on us to fight for . them.' President Barack Obama listens to the remarks of movie director Steven Spielberg as he attends a USC Shoah Foundation event in L.A. on Wednesday night. Obama made remarks at Democratic Party fundraiser earlier in the evening, where he claimed Republicans had filibustered 500 bills in the last seven years . Obama is in California this week raising money for Democrats' re-election efforts. Last night's fundraiser was the first in a string of money-making events the president is shilling for his party at as they attempt to build up their war chest ahead of November's mid-term elections. His '500 filibusters' remark likely came from claims Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has been making this week. 'We’re now . at more than 500 filibusters,' Reid said on Wednesday. 'They do . everything they can to stop us from progressing in this country.' Reid . was was referring to the number of times bills he'd brought to the . floor did not make it through the cloture process, a Senate staffer . clarified on background, not the number of actual number of talk-a-thons Republicans . have had throughout the last seven years. A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell characterized it as the number times any bill introduced introduced by either party did not make it out of the Senate. 'To . get to 500, you’d have to include all the times during the same time . period that then-Sen. Obama voted to “filibuster” legislation and . nominees, and all the times that Democrats ""filibustered"" Republican . bills,' McConnell Communications Director Don Stewart told MailOnline in an email. 'It’s statements like . those that keep fact checkers and late-night comedians in business.' The National Republican Congressional Committee, the ideological counterpart to one of the groups Obama was campaign for on Wednesday, said it was the president who of standing in the way of legislation that would help Americans, not the other way around. Maybe if President Obama spent less time jetting around the country for fancy fundraisers, and more time working with Congress, he could convince Democrats in the Senate to start voting on the dozens of jobs bill that House Republicans have passed and sent their way,' National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Andrew Clark told MailOnline. 'Voters have shown time and time again they are looking for a pro-growth, pro-jobs agenda, but the Democrats in Congress are simply refusing to listen.' Also in attendance at last night's Shoah Foundation was Honorary Chair and famed director Steven Spielberg, right. Spielberg as a major contributor to President Obama's re-election. He gave $1 million alone to a pro-Obama PAC the month before the November 2012 election . Throughout the 2012 presidential election, Obama referred to it as his 'last campaign' because U.S. presidents are limited to two terms in office. Obama admitted at Wednesday's event that he recently realized that wasn't true and had to apologize to the First Lady for inadvertently misleading her about how much time he'd have to spend on politics in his second term. 'A couple months ago, I had to let her in on a secret, and that is, . honey, I got one more campaign I got to run,' Obama said. 'I need to make sure we continue to have a . Democratic Senate, and I need a Democratic House of Representatives in . Washington.' Both parties are desperate to win the Senate this year. If Republicans successfully grapple the upper chamber out of Democrats' hands, President Obama would quickly become a lame duck president. 'I've got to have a Democratic Senate,' President Obama told donors on Wednesday. 'And when you think about . everything I was able to accomplish with Nancy Pelosi at the helm in the House, . all the issues that you care about that we were able to advance when she was . the leader, I think you’ve got a big stake in making sure that we've got a . Democratic House as well,' he continued. Republicans are not in danger of losing the House, and with control of the Senate, too, they could effectively halt the president's agenda during his final two years in office. Depending on how many seats Republicans pick up in the Senate, the president could go from playing offense on issues important to progressives to playing defense. No more threatening to use his pen and phone - President Obama's only remedy to Republican-led initiatives would be to use his veto authority to send legislation back to the House and Senate, where it would take a super majority to overturn his decision. Obama could also move his agenda though executive orders, something he has not been shy about doing in the past. Obama took a break from fundraising to attend the dinner, where he received an award from the Spielberg, who created the foundation . Republicans are equally aware of what is at stake in November. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell fired back on the Senate floor on Thursday that the way Senate Democrats are acting is 'disgraceful.' 'Instead of a forum for debate and resolution of the most pressing domestic and international issues facing our nation, it’s become fodder for late-night TV,' McConnell charged. 'When the American people turn on C-SPAN these days, they don’t often see a Majority Party driving serious debate on the issues of the day. They hear bizarre monologues about greased pigs and a couple of Kansans the Majority Leader seems to see around every corner. They see a daily display of absurd political theater that has almost no relevance at all to their daily lives,'  the Minority Leader, who races a rocky road to reelection this year himself, continued. McConnell was referring to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's barrage of attacks against conservative billionaires Charles and David Koch, who are from Kansas, and his claims that GOP Senators are obstructing legislation at the Koch's behest. A poll recently showed that few Americans know who the Koch Brothers are, but name dropping the activists on the Senate floor has proven to be lucrative for Democrats.","Democrats are claiming Republican obstructionism is to blame for the Senate's inability to pass progressive legislation .
At a Democratic Party fundraiser last night, President Obama claimed Republicans 'have filibustered about 500 pieces of legislation' since 2007 .

"By . Sian Boyle . As one of television’s most famous couples, Richard Madeley and Judy Finnigan have rarely shied away from controversial topics. Now they have addressed the assisted suicide debate – by revealing details of a suicide pact they have made following the death of Richard’s mother. After 26 years of marriage, the presenters said they had made a ‘pledge’ to help one another if they were suffering and considered it the ‘responsibility’ of their partner, regardless of the consequences. TV couple Judy Finnegan, left and Richard Madeley, right, who say they would help each other to die if the other was suffering . Under British law, a partner can be prosecuted if they help someone to die, even if it is abroad. But Richard, 57, said: ‘If Judy was really ill and in logical mind, and at that point where you just need a little push to go over the edge, I wouldn’t give a tuppenny f*** if there was a risk of being prosecuted. ‘I’d do what was right for my wife. And I’d take the consequences. That is your job, that is your responsibility as a partner.’ Judy, 65, added: ‘And I’d do the same. Stuff it all. We’ve made ourselves give each other a pledge along those lines.’ Her husband then joked about his method, saying: ‘For me, it would be the locked room, the bottle of whisky and the revolver. I wouldn’t want to mess around.’ After 26 years of marriage, the presenters said they had made a 'pledge' after the death of Richard's mother . The couple, who became grandparents 18 months ago, revealed they decided to confront the issue when Richard’s mother died last month. Richard said that although she had Alzheimer’s and lung cancer, her death came a shock. ‘At my mother’s funeral, the first eulogy was given by my 32-year-old niece who is heavily pregnant,’ he told the Daily Telegraph as they launched their latest Book Club. ‘She was stood in front of the coffin, grandmother, granddaughter and great-grandchild all in the same place. And it was … interesting. Because the death bubble really isn’t that dissimilar from the birth bubble. With both, you’re in this incredibly intense, closed world, and nothing else matters.’ Judy added: ‘I remember when my mum died in 2007 and I felt like I’d been kicked in the stomach. I felt something similar with Richard’s mum. It’s just the shock of death. It is so final … I suspect that the closer you get to your own mortality, the more final it seems.’ Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in England and Wales, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Guidelines issued in 2010 indicated that anyone acting with compassion on the will of a dying person is unlikely to face charges. Increasingly, however, severely ill Britons are ending their lives by travelling to clinics abroad, such as Dignitas in Switzerland.","The TV presenters have revealed details of a suicide pact they have made .

"By . David Williams . and Matthew Blake . Nigeria’s military was warned about the abduction of nearly 300 schoolgirls by Islamic  militants but failed to act, it was claimed last night. Human rights group Amnesty International said it had reports from credible sources insisting that security forces knew about the planned raid four hours before it took place.

"By . Glen Owen . A £6 million party funded by the EU for 5,000 young people  this weekend caused a headache for the Eurocrats: what if it all  got out of hand? So, to avoid doubt, the organisers issued an edict – don’t have an orgy without the strict consent  of all those involved. The three-day European Youth Event in Strasbourg is being held to teach 16 to 30-year-olds from across the EU about ‘common European values’. The 16 to 30-year-olds attending a youth event at the EU Parliament in Strasbourg were issued adivce warning them not to have sex with other participants without getting consent from all involved . But with all those hormones flying around, organisers felt obliged to warn participants: ‘Do not engage in any sexual activities without obtaining explicit and informed consent of all persons present.’ Paul Nuttall, Ukip deputy leader, called the advice 'mind-boggling' and branded the whole exercise a 'propaganda event' The advice, contained in the 171-page event guide, goes on: ‘Be aware that personal boundaries are different and not everyone enjoys the same level of physical contact. ‘Consider this in your interactions and remember that others may misinterpret your actions.  Be aware that some participants are under 18. 'Act in accordance with any applicable laws and avoid situations where positions of trust can be misused.’ The advice led to ridicule from UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall, who said: ‘It is mind-boggling that they want to give advice about having sex on the premises.’ He added: ‘Brussels bureaucrats have a neck spending millions on a propaganda event to make young people love the EU when youth unemployment is reaching 60 per cent in Greece and Spain. It is a scandalous waste of money.’ A European Parliament spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.","Three-day European Youth Event in Strasbourg designed to teach 'values'

"By . Candace Sutton . People smugglers are offering 'kids travel free deals' to asylum seekers as well as discount prices on boat trips to Australia, says the chief of the border protection command. Operation Sovereign Borders commander, Lieutenant General Angus Campbell said the government's toughened border policies had made people smugglers desperate to make money. '[There are] much reduced prices, special deals, and some smugglers offering kids to travel for free: all this and more, to put people’s lives at risk, in small boats on a large ocean,' General Campbell said. Scroll down for video . Kids go free: People smugglers are offering 'kids travel free' deals to asylum seekers and discount boat trips to Australia since border protection rules changes . Neverending flow: Border protection chief Lt General Angus Campbell (above) says desperate people smugglers will make money anyway they can and the flow of people seeking refuge across the world had reached 232 million, three per cent of the world's population, and showed no sign of abating . In his first speech since taking over Australia's border protection and the Abbott Government's new strategies regarding detention centres on the island of Nauru and in Papua New Guinea, General Campbell said international syndicates were looking for any gaps in policy to exploit the nation's borders. 'The ability of people to travel—through a range of both regular and irregular means—has never been greater,' he said. Operation Sovereign Borders launched in September 2013 with these key components to stop asylum seeker boats to Australia: . •    No onshore processing of refugees and increased offshore centres . •    Expanded customs fleet and disruption of boat activity . •    Improved air/sea military surveillance . •    Regional awareness campaign that people smuggling is criminal and illegal boat people cannot stay on Australia soil . •    Boat buy back programme to discourage sale of vessels to smugglers . •    Intelligence scheme to uncover smuggling operations and bounty payments for arrests . •    Lifeboats for refugees to thwart scuttle attempts, demands for Australian rescues and allow boat people to safely turn back . 'This trend shows no signs of abating. There are too many prospective travellers susceptible to believing that Nauru is a town in Australia.' He said the number of people crossing international borders had grown from about 77 million in 1960 to about 232 million in 2013, or just over three per cent of the world's population. Addressing the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Thursday night, he said the Operation Sovereign Borders team had 'greatly disrupted maritime people smuggling to Australia'. 'Business is down, but smugglers will keep trying because they hope to turn a profit. As with combating other forms of organised crime, our determination and long term perseverance is essential to effectively dealing with this wicked problem.' While no boatload of refugees had successfully arrived in Australia for five months, his job was far from over. 'The benefits to date, while real, are modest,' he said. 'Substantially changing the irregular flow toward Australia and drawing down the pool of potential illegal immigrants in transit countries will require years, not months, of collective regional effort. 'To modify a well-known and very apt phrase, the price of border security is eternal vigilance.' Gen Campbell said he would not be heading the new $480.5 million super front-line agency, Border Force Australia, which would take over border protection in July 2015. He expected the Syrian conflict would continue to drive refugees across borders into other countries. aimed at stopping maritime arrivals of asylum seekers to Australia.","People smugglers now offering 'kids travel free' deals to Australia .

"By . Glen Owen . Tory MP Andrew Mitchell could be forced to sell his family home to pay for the costs of the legal fees he is running up over ‘Plebgate’. The former Chief Whip is facing a £200,000 libel action by the police constable who refused to let him cycle through the Downing Street gates – and Mr Mitchell has told friends that the cost of defending the action could force him to sell his £1 million home in Islington, North London. PC Toby Rowland, who insists that Mr Mitchell used the term ‘f****** plebs’ during the exchange in September 2012, has been backed by the Police Federation in his legal battle. Andrew Mitchell was stopped from riding his bike through the gates of Downing Street in September 2012 . PC Rowland claims that Mr Mitchell has falsely accused him of ‘fabricating the damning allegation’ about the remark, and is seeking aggravated slander. Mr Rowland’s lawyer has claimed the officer ‘has been very seriously injured in his personal and professional reputation and suffered great distress, humiliation and upset’. It is understood Mr Mitchell has already incurred legal fees of more than £40,000 fighting the defamation case – and fears that if costs spiral out of control he may have to sell his house. Last night he said: ‘I have always told the truth about the incident. I was fitted up. If it can happen to a Government Minister, it can happen to anyone’.

"By . Tara Brady . The father of a kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirl has revealed photographs of his daughter pictured before she was snatched by blood-crazed Boko Haram fanatics. Mary was taken alongside her closest friend who lives next door to her. Speaking to ITV News, Mary's father said he is desperate with worry and the thought of what his daughter is going through. Scroll down for video . A father of one of the missing schoolgirls reveals a photograph of his daughter Mary who was kidnapped . Five of his nieces have also been snatched by the militant group Boko Haram which is holding 276 female students. This week it released a video showing around 100 of the girls and said they will only be freed after the government releases jailed militants. Mary's father was shown the video in the hope he may recognise his own child or nieces. Despite not seeing his own daughter he did recognise a girl, he believes to be around 16 or 17, who lives opposite to his family's home. Snatched: Mary was taken alongside her closest friend who lives next door to her . A group shot of some of the schoolgirls before they were kidnapped by Boko Haram fanatics . He told ITV News that he did not trust the offer made by Boko Haram to release the girls in exchange for prisoners. The group, which wants to impose Islamic law on Nigeria, has killed more than 1,500 people this year in a campaign of bombings and massacres. Boko Haram's kidnapping of schoolgirls at a boarding school in northeast Nigeria last month has focused international attention on the extremist group amid outrage that most of the girls have not been rescued Nigeria's government, which has repeatedly denied allegations that it was slow to respond to the mass abduction, had initially suggested there would be no negotiations with Boko Haram. Missing: Mary, pictured left, with her best friend who was also kidnapped by the militant group last month . Mary's father was shown the video in the hope he may recognise his own child or nieces . Now it appears that stance may be relaxed. Washington has sent military, law-enforcement and development experts to Nigeria to help search for the missing girls who were kidnapped by the militants from a secondary school in Chibok in remote north-eastern Nigeria on April 14. ‘We have shared commercial satellite imagery with the Nigerians and are flying manned ISR (intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) assets over Nigeria with the government's permission,’ a U.S. official said. Two U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was also considering deploying unmanned drone aircraft to aid the search. Captured: This image is taken from a video released by the Nigerian terror group Boko Haram reportedly showing some of the girls who were kidnapped from their school last month . One of the U.S. officials told Reuters the United States had been carrying out the manned surveillance flights ‘for a few days’ but did not elaborate. Boko Haram paraded the shell-shocked teenagers on a chilling video, in which the leader, Abubaker Shekau, chuckled and confirmed his prisoners - the vast majority of them Christians - had been forced to convert to Islam.Forensic analysis of the video has begun, with one expert confident that it contains clues that will help focus security services' search efforts. Captured: The video shows the girls wearing the full-length hijab and praying in an undisclosed rural location . Chilling: The schoolgirls were paraded on video by Boko Haram . U.S experts previously determined where an Osama Bin Laden video was shot from studying the rock formations that formed the backdrop to it. They were also able to work out exactly when it was recorded - that was done through a study of the shadows and the geometry of the area. However, it was impossible to fully authenticate the video. Extremist group Boko Haram seized 276 girls who were taking exams at a school in Borno's north-eastern village of Chibok on April 14 . Abubakar Shekau said that the girls would never be released unless there is an exchange with prisoners .

Fifty-three girls managed to escape and 276 remain missing, police say. Bitrus said vegetation in the video looked like the Sambisa Forest, some 20 miles (30 kilometers) from Chibok, where the girls were believed to have been spirited away.","Mary was taken alongside her closest friend who lives next door to her .

Nick Park said he was unsure whether to continue the much-loved British comedy without actor Peter Sallis, who has voiced Wallace since 1990 when he accepted the voiceover job for £25, yet is growing increasingly frail at 93. The voice of the veteran, who starred in Last of the Summer Wine, is inextricably linked with Wensleydale-loving Wallace, – but Sallis is said to be in poor health. Scroll down for video . The creator of Wallace and Gromit has said he is unsure whether to continue with the comedy . He suffers from the eye condition macular degeneration and hasn’t voiced the character since the Wallace and Gromit World of Invention series on the BBC four years ago. Instead, Ben Whitehead, 38, has worked as his stand-in in recent projects such as a live show at the Proms and a computer game. Park, 55, said of Sallis: ‘He’s not too well.

"By . Glen Owen, Political Correspondent . Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured, will be interrogated by the powerful Public Administration Select Committee . Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood will be forced to explain to MPs why the long-awaited report into the Iraq War has been held up by a row over secret letters between Tony Blair and George W. Bush. Sir Jeremy, a key member of Mr Blair’s inner circle during the build-up to the 2003 conflict, will be interrogated by the powerful Public Administration Select Committee (PASC) about his role in blocking the release of the sensitive correspondence. Sir John Chilcot, the chairman of the Iraq inquiry, wants to release the Blair letters, but has run into fierce opposition from Sir Jeremy, the country’s most senior civil servant. He has argued privately that high-level exchanges should remain classified to protect the ‘machinery of government’. Sir John says his report cannot be finished until the row is resolved. The move follows The Mail on Sunday’s disclosure last week that David Cameron had called for an end to hold-ups in the Chilcot process amid claims that Mr Blair and Labour hope to delay it until after next year’s General Election to limit damage to the party’s reputation. The Prime Minister’s stance has clear public support: according to a Survation survey for The Mail on Sunday, 70 per cent of voters agree that the inquiry should publish the letters between Mr Blair and Mr Bush, compared with 13 per cent who think they should remain secret. The poll also found that 58 per cent think it  is important that the report is published as soon as possible. Now committee chairman Bernard Jenkin has written to Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude as he ‘is concerned about the length of time the Inquiry is taking to report’. He asked Mr Maude to outline the ‘steps  you are taking to overcome the barriers to publication’. Sources on the PASC said that Sir Jeremy would face a grilling over the issue when he makes a pre-arranged appearance before the committee next month. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood will be forced to explain to MPs why the long-awaited report into the Iraq War has been held up by a row over secret letters between former Prime Minister Tony Blair, right, and former US President George W. Bush, left . He was Principal Private Secretary to Mr Blair during the run-up to the war, and the only civil servant invited to join the so-called ‘sofa government’ at No 10, when major decisions were taken by a Blair-led coterie which also included his top aides Alastair Campbell and Jonathan Powell. The inquiry wants to release 25 notes sent from Mr Blair to Mr Bush in advance of the  US-led invasion, in addition to more than 130 records of conversations between either Mr Blair and Mr Bush, or Gordon Brown and Mr Bush, and information relating to 200 Cabinet discussions. Sir John, who has seen the material, has made clear to Mr Cameron that without a decision on its publication he cannot start the process of giving those individuals who face criticism in his report - which could include the Mr Blair – the chance to respond. A Cabinet Office spokesman said officials had had a constructive dialogue with the inquiry team over declassification during recent months and added that the process should be concluded shortly. Meanwhile, two RAF Servicemen under investigation after pictures appeared to show British personnel posing beside the bloodstained body of a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan are expected to keep their jobs, Defence sources suggested last night.","Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to be quizzed by select committee .

"By . Ryan Kisiel . British agency Mad Dog casting is suing Eleanor McLaughlin, 32, accused of trying to steal a lucrative deal to provide extras for the latest Star Wars film . It is a story set a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away where Jedi knights battle an evil empire. But before even a phaser has been blasted or a lightsabre drawn in the highly anticipated new Star Wars movie, the first battle is expected to take place at the High Court over who will supply the hundreds of stormtroopers and wookies. And at the centre of the legal fight is 32-year-old Eleanor McLaughlin who is accused of trying to steal a lucrative contract to provide extras for the forthcoming seventh instalment of the sci-fi saga. British agency Mad Dog Casting is suing her for up to £250,000 after claiming it had entered ‘mature’ negotiations to supply extras for crowd scenes that involve aliens and other creatures last year. However, it argues McLaughlin, a former employee, quit the firm to set up her own casting agency and also started competing for the £1million contract. Fears have now been raised that the legal fight could delay the shooting of some of the big crowd scenes for Star Wars: Episode VII. In legal documents submitted to the High Court, the firm accuses Miss McLaughlin, whose film credits include the latest James Bond movie Skyfall, Pirates of the Caribbean and World War Z starring Brad Pitt, of taking the personal details of thousands of extras from its database. It adds that through her new company called ‘We Got Pop’, Miss McLaughlin emailed them touting work and took ‘further steps to pursue the Star Wars Episode VII opportunity’. Miss McLaughlin denies the allegations. Filming has already begun on the movie which will reunite many of the original stars. Fans were informed that cameras had begun rolling at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire after a photo was posted online by director JJ Abrams’ production company, Bad Robot, with the hashtag £dayone, alongside a photograph of the film’s clapperboard. British studios and actors have featured prominently in the Star Wars franchise since its first film, A New Hope, was shot at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire in 1977. Episode VII will become the fifth film in the franchise to be made in the UK which originally starred Alec Guinness as Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader played by Bristolian David Prowse. The latest installment of the sci-fi franchise is set to reunite members of the original cast (pictured) Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher will reunite for the new Star Wars film almost 40 years since the original cast members first appeared on screen together. The trio were pictured in a rehearsal room reading through the script for the seventh instalment of the hit sci-fi saga. It will feature the return of Hamill, 62, as Luke Skywalker and Fisher, 57, as Princess Leia. Ford, 71, will reprise his role as the buccaneering Han Solo - to the delight of fans. Directed by Hollywood star JJ Abrams, the £120million movie also features original actors Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew - reuniting to play C-3PO R2-D2 and Chewbacca respectively. The action is set 35 years after the last film they all appeared in together - 1983’s Return of the Jedi. A picture released last month shows the original cast together with new stars include Andy Serkis, who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and Adam Driver from TV hit Girls. Abrams said: ‘It is both thrilling and surreal to watch the beloved original cast and these brilliant new performers come together to bring this world to life, once again.’ Lawrence Kasdan, who wrote the The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, will help write the script. Anthony Daniels, 68, who has played C-3PO in all six films, tweeted to fans last night: ‘Keeping the secret in front of y’all was the hardest act I ever did.’ Mad Dog Casting declined to comment. A spokesman for Miss McLaughin said she would be robustly defending the allegations. A spokesman for Disney, which is now making the Star Wars franchise, declined to comment about delays in filming.

Busted: A Chinese national lies on the road in Sydney's western suburbs after members of the NSW Organised Crime Squad swooped, arrested six men, one woman and seizied almost 60kg of precursor chemicals for the drug 'Ice' Midday raid: Months of investigation into the alleged Sydney drug syndicate by a joint task force of federal and state police and customs culminated in the arrest (above) of seven Chinese nationals, including four men aged between 22 and 24 years old who have been charged with the supply of a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs . High yield: Police and crime commission officers' months of investigation paid off when they uncovered cash, drugs and other items at properties they searched in Sydney's west. They say the drug operation is linked to a 'high risk serious and organised crime syndicate that had been highly resilient to traditional law enforcement' Four men aged between 22 and 24 years old were charged with supplying a large commercial quantity of prohibited drugs. Two men were released pending further inquiries and the woman was taken to Sydney's Villawood detention centre. Following the arrests, police searched six properties in five Sydney suburbs. They discovered one kilogram of pseudoephedrine, one ounce of methylamphetamine, passports suspected of being counterfeit, half a kilogram of powder believed to be precursor drugs, mobile phones, cash and documents. The arrests and seizures follow earlier charges against two men in April by Strike Force Duperry, a joint drug trafficking investigation by the NSW Police Organised Crime Squad, the Australian Crime Commission and the NSW Crime Commission, with the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Five suburb raid: Following the arrest of the young Chinese nationals in the western Sydney suburbs of Auburn (above) police searched properties in five suburbs and discovered one kilogram of pseudoephedrine, methylamphetamine, passports suspected of being counterfeit, half a kilogram of powder believed to be precursor drugs, mobile phones, cash and documents . Led away: The seven arrests by the Organised Crime Squad in the Sydney suburb of Auburn have led to four men being charged with commercial drug supply. More arrests are expected in the coming days . Previous raids: The strike force which uncovered the alleged 'Ice' trafficking operation linked to this week's arrrests (above) has also uncovered an SKS Assault Rifle, more than 300 rounds of ammunition, methylamphetamine worth $2 million, $870,000 worth of heroin  and $18,000 in cash in earlier raids . Previous raids by the strike force last year and earlier this year have uncovered an SKS Assault Rifle, more than 300 rounds of ammunition, methylamphetamine worth $2 million, $870,000 worth of heroin  and $18,000 in cash. Joint intelligence analysis has identified that members of the drug syndicate were allegedly involved 42 kilograms of pseudoephedrine importation in sea freight from China, which was seized this month those allegedly responsible for the importation will be charged in the coming days. NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said Strike Force Duperry served as another example of the importance of inter-agency partnerships in combating modern day organised crime groups. 'As we keep saying, contemporary organised crime syndicates are complex, multi-faceted, international operations, where criminals from a range of different backgrounds combine their resources to collectively increase their black market profits,' Commissioner Scipione said. 'To combat this new and increasingly complex black marketplace, we are working closer than ever with our partner agencies and, collectively, are causing more disruption and damage to illicit enterprises than we ever could working alone.' Organised Crime Squad commander, Detective Superintendent Cook, said his detectives were working with police interstate and overseas. 'We’re confident many more syndicates will be dismantled in the months ahead,' Detective Superintendent Cook said. Australian Crime Commission Chief Executive Officer Chris Dawson said the operation lead to the dismantling of a high risk serious and organised crime syndicate that had been highly resilient to traditional law enforcement approaches. 'The Australian Crime Commission’s involvement in this investigation stemmed from Eligo National Task Force, which is primarily focused on money laundering, but captures drug trafficking and manufacturing offences,' Mr Dawson said. 'The success of this operation in particular—the dismantling of this syndicate—is a direct result of state and Commonwealth agencies not only pooling their resources, but also their knowledge in regards to some of Australia’s highest risk criminal targets.' AFP Acting National Manager Crime Operations Ian McCartney said the operation was a great example of the importance of law enforcement agencies working together to bring criminals to justice. 'The continued success of these joint operations demonstrates the effectiveness of cooperation between Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies to detect and disrupt organised crime syndicates operating across international borders,' Mr McCartney said.

"By . John Hall . and Ted Thornhill . A dog which viciously attacked a four-year-old boy only to be scared off by a fearless cat has been euthanized, it has been claimed. Scrappy, an eight-month-old Labrador-Chow mix, was apparently put down at Bakersfield animal shelter after he was filmed attacking his young neighbor Jeremy Triantafilo. Jeremy's life was saved when his pet cat Tara selflessly pounced on the dog as it launched its attack, chasing the vicious animal down the street so her best friend could receive emergency medical help. Scroll down for video . Lurking: Jeremy Triantafilo was outside his family's home when Scrappy the dog escaped and ran towards him. The Labrador-Chow mix has since been destroyed at nearby at Bakersfield animal shelter . To the rescue! Tara runs towards her owner as Scrappy shakes him. The dog was euthanized after continuing to show aggression during a 10-day assessment . Scrappy was destroyed after he continued to display aggressive traits during a 10-day assessment period at Bakersfield animal centre, according to TMZ. He bit two staff during his stay, and tried to attack any employee who brought him food and water. Last Wednesday, surveillance footage emerged showing Tara the cat saving Jeremy by pouncing on the dog as it attacked him. Tara's owners said she has been best friends with Jeremy since he was born. She . followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park about six years . ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said. 'It's pretty amazing to see just a cat . take on a dog and selflessly put herself out there,' Roger Triantafilo . said. 'That dog did not even know what hit him.' Feline brave: The cat launches herself at the startled dog and knocks it away from Jeremy . And don't come back! Tara follows the dog to make sure it has left, before returning to check on Jeremy . Erica . explained that she had been near to the house watering a tree when the . neighbor's dog, Scrappy, escaped and grabbed her son by the leg. 'I'd . never seen a dog just shake a child like that so violently,' she said. 'I just remember hearing him and the next thing I know, I see my cat . flying out of nowhere and getting to this dog.' After the attack, Tara can be seen chasing the dog away before returning to Jeremy's side. In . an interview with the Bakersfield Californian, his family said she had . always been protective over their oldest child and slept in his crib . when he was a baby. They also have younger twin boys. They . added that Tara became part of the family in 2008 when she followed . them home from a nearby park - and they accepted her into their home, . even though Erica is allergic to cats. She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said. They . named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond . Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means . driftwood. 'We named her . driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.' She said that even though her three boys tug at Tara, she sits there and takes it.

"By . Freya Noble . and Lillian Radulova . A group of friends soaking up the golden Australian sun, laughing as they fish with sticks by a campsite and showing off a shark caught in shallow waters. These are the stunning images which give a beautiful insight and rare context into Sunbaker, the iconic 1930s photograph which best represented Australia's unique beach culture. The quintessentially Australian image, snapped my Max Dupain, has been revealed to have come from a collection of 108 other photographic prints from a group camping trip down the New South Wales south coast. They were put together into an album by Dupain's good friend, architect Chris Vandyke, and hidden away in the dark room at his home for many years. The Sunbaker: Max Dupain took this iconic image in 1937 though it wasn't published until 1975. There are believed to be around 200 signed prints of the photograph . Now on display for the first time at The State Library of NSW, the 'Vandyke Album' shows an array of photographs taken by Dupain and his then partner Olive Cotton during camping trips to Culburra Beach in 1937. Beyond the one iconic photograph, the album, donated to the Library by the late Mr Vandyke's son, Tony Vandyke, presents an important record of Australian life in the late 30s, just after the depression. 'Every now and then it would come out at dinner parties and things like that but after my dad died I think we forgot about it for some period of time,' Tony Vandyke said of the album to the Sydney Morning Herald. 'Dad used to talk a little bit about history, he wasn't one that dwelled on the past a lot but there were a couple of stories that he told about those times which were, life was very simple during the depression and I think some of these simple camping trips reflected some of that - and it was always good to have such interesting good friends around.' Fellow photographer: Olive Cotton's work was also featured in the Vandyke Album . But what astonished the library's curators, was the alternative versions of the famous Sunbaker image that were found in the holiday album, one of which Dupain preferred and had originally chosen for publication. The extremely rare photo, of which the negative has been long lost, looks identical to the popularised image at a moment's glance, but actually presents the subject in a more realistic way. The photographs subject, British builder Harold 'Hal' Salvage, holds one hand in a fist and lies somewhat more in proportion to the sky, the surf clearly seen behind him. The album also reveals alternative shots of Sunbaker, taken from different angles and varying views by Dupain, despite his claims that the shot was spontaneous. Dupain, who died almost 22 years ago, was known to have resented the undying fame and attention given to Sunbaker, striving to give credit to his other works.

Villagers gather to discuss the violence, which began after a neighbour put a mirror outside his home . Suppressed in mainland China during the Cultural Revolution, it has in recent years become very popular in the West and enjoyed a resurgence in its homeland. The argument broke out when the 40-year-old discovered his neighbour had put a mirror on the front of his house to deflect evil spirits. The problem, according to Li, was that the mirror pointed directly at his house. As far as he was concerned that meant he would end up with his neighbour's bad luck.

And other cities may also soon get their chance to battle for the cash, which is stuffed inside envelopes and hidden beneath benches or in public parks, restrooms or stairways.

"By . Associated Press . When California Chrome crosses the finish line in the Belmont Stakes next month, win or lose, his bid for a Triple Crown will be over and horse racing will begin its annual retreat from the mainstream. For once, that could come as a relief to the people who run Churchill Downs. Their biggest weeks of the year are the run up to and right after the Kentucky Derby, which California Chrome won back on May 3. But it's been a rough stretch for the track's image, the latest issue being the death of a horse Thursday in a fall on the track that her trainer immediately blamed on the sound system attached to Churchill's vaunted new video board. Sudden start: A racehorse died Thursday, May 22, 2014, at Churchill Downs after a freak fall that the trainer blamed on the sound of a starting gate bell blaring on the track's new sound system . Here's a look at some of the public relations problems the sport's most famous track has faced this spring. Firstly, the debut of the world's biggest HD video screen - the 'Big Board,' Churchill dubbed it - and its 750-speaker sound system were the track's biggest bragging point going into Derby week. Towering 170 feet over the backstretch, the high-definition, $12 million video screen is bigger than three basketball courts, bigger than any single panel of the giant display hanging above the field at AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys. In a press release, Churchill bragged that the screen is five times the size of the average home - that's the equivalent of 2,200 46-inch flat-screen TVs or 320,000 iPhone 5 screens. Smitten by the close-up view of the action it gives those in the infield and the grandstand, many fans loved it right away. Some trainers and jockeys didn't. The day before the Derby, jockey Rosie Napravnik called the speakers 'overwhelming' minutes after she won the Kentucky Oaks aboard Untapable. Napravnik said it didn't seem to affect her horse, however, and several trainers have said they haven't had problems with the speakers. On Thursday, five-year-old mare Never Tell Lynda was walking toward the paddock on the track when she reared, twisted and fell, hitting her head, said her trainer, Kenneth Wirth. The horse was startled by what Wirth thinks was the sound of a starting gate bell coming from a commercial on the video board. Oversized: The new screen and sound system was a hit with punters but jockey and trainers weren't impressed . 'We teach horses to break from that,' he said. 'And you've got it on a loud speaker that everybody in a two-city block can hear. Well, what's she going to do? She thinks she's supposed to take off. And that's what she did. And when she did, she lunged and she lost her balance and went down.' Track officials extended their condolences after the horse was euthanized, called the accident extremely rare and said they were still gathering the facts. Wirth said the sound system was 'way too loud' at the time of the accident. 'The only thing you can blame is the music,' Wirth said. 'They've got to do something about it... The horses are the main thing here.' The second problem for Churchill was when weeks before the Derby, a spokesperson announced Churchill would take a bigger cut of the money bettors place on its races. The decision came after Kentucky lawmakers rejected the racing industry's latest effort to add slot machines to generate more cash to boost prize money for horse owners. Honored guest: The jockey who rode Secretariat to Triple Crown victory in 1973 Ron Turcotte has accused Churchill Downs of 'snubbing' him . Churchill spokesman John Asher said without the bigger cut, the track would have had to reduce the prize money for winners of spring races and some races would likely have been cut altogether. Horse players at the betting windows grumbled that Churchill, of all places, should have enough other means of revenue without having to pinch pennies from people who come to the track. The third issue happened days before the Derby, when Churchill rushed into damage-control mode after Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte, who rode Secretariat to Triple Crown glory, declared he would skip seeing the Derby because track management had snubbed him. Turcotte, who is paralyzed, said he couldn't get a parking spot during his last Derby Day visit, and then couldn't even get into the track to watch last year's race. The track said any perceived snub of Turotte was the result of a 'communication breakdown.' Turcotte's comments were posted on the website of a horse farm run by Rick Porter, who owned Eight Belles, the filly that was euthanized on the track after breaking both of her front legs following a second-place finish in the 2008 Derby. PR nightmare: California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn has also accused the race track of being less than hospitable . Porter had posted about his own difficulties in obtaining tickets to watch one of his horses race at Churchill Downs on Friday, and in getting Derby tickets last year for four World War II veterans who were part of the D-Day invasion. 'What is wrong with this management group?' Porter wrote. 'No wonder racing is on the decline.' Steve Coburn, co-owner of this year's Derby and Preakness winner, California Chrome, lashed out at Churchill after the Preakness, which is held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. 'Churchill Downs needs to call Maryland to get a lesson in hospitality,' Coburn said. 'These people right here, they've treated us like royalty.' Co-owner Perry Martin didn't make the trip to Pimlico, and Coburn was asked why. 'The hospitality we received at Churchill Downs wasn't very good,' Coburn said, so Martin decided not to make the trip to the next stop on the Triple Crown trail.","Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby, has faced PR nightmares this racing season .

The former police detective accused of murdering Jamie Gao appeared briefly in Kogarah Local Court today, where he was refused bail. Glen McNamara, 55, was brought up into the dock at around 12.10pm from the police cells where he had spent the night after being arrested and charged with murder and with supply of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine at Padstow, in Sydney's west last Tuesday. Wearing a dark grey t-shirt, navy denim jeans, brown suede boots and his hair cropped short, Mr McNamara sat passively in the court for the brief hearing. At one point he peered through his black framed spectacles at the gallery where two adult women and two teenage girls, believed to be his family members, were sitting. Earlier the two young girls had appeared upset as they passed through the court doors. McNamara's lawyer, Hudson Lu, made an application to Magistrate Christine Haskett for protective custody in Silverwater prison where McNamara will be taken this afternoon. Mr Lu did not apply for bail and police prosecutor Kristy Zurvas formally refused it. Magistrate Haskett adjourned the matter to July 22 at Central Local Court.

Churchill, located on the west shore of Hudson Bay in Manitoba, Canada, is so famous for the large number of polar bears that it has earned the nickname Polar Bear Capital of the World. Takes two to tango: Two polar bears took centre stage as they appeared to be waltzing on the frozen wilderness . Bear hug: The young bears got up close and personal as they played around in the snow in Churchill, Hudson Bay, Canada . You stepped on my toe! The argument over whose foot was going forward got a little bit heated . The area has developed an entire tourist industry around polar bear sightseeing and for the population they are a part of daily life. Residents of Churchill often leave their cars unlocked in case they need to make a quick escape from an approaching polar bear, and local police keep a 'polar bear jail' where animals who come too close to civilization are kept after being tranquilized, before it is safe to release them back into the wild. Amateur photographer Alexey Tishchenko, from St. Petersburg, Russia saw the five-year-old bears playing in the snow and look like they are doing a ball room dance. ‘I love these photographs because it looks like the polar bears are dancing with each other.' Can I have this dance? One of the beards appears to be bowing, and the other graciously accepting the proposal of a cha-cha . Where's Brucie? The bears' lively evening on the tundra looked no too different from an episode of Dancing With The Stars . Merry dance: The adolescent polar bears jumped around and play fought in the snow . Big busines: Churchill, in Manitoba, Canada, is so famous for the large number of polar bears that it has earned the nickname Polar Bear Capital of the World . Alexey added: ‘I was watching them for a while, and they were just playing with each other. ‘But it took me by surprise when I noticed that they looked like they were dancing.' ‘I have always loved photography, ever since my grandmother gave me my first camera and from that moment I have always had a camera in my hand - I started taking pictures of the beautiful nature and wild animals. ‘I try to take photographs that compare the two worlds of human and animal, then find similarities between them.’","Young bears caught playing around in the snow in Churchill, Canada .

"By . Sara Malm . Company bosses are paid more than ever before, as the median pay package for a CEO rose to above $10million for the first time. The salary for a CEO of a ‘typical’ large public company has increased 8.8 per cent year-on-year from 2012. The median annual pay is now a record $10.5million, compared to $9.6million in 2012, a study has found. Money, money, money: Nabors Industries' Anthony Petrello was the highest paid CEO in 2013 at $68.2million while CBS boss Leslie Moonves' pay rose 9 per cent to $65.6million, making him the second-highest paid . CEO pay has risen for the fourth year in a row, after a decline following the 2008 recession. Since 2009, the median CEO pay package has climbed more than 50 per cent. A chief executive now makes about 257 times the average worker's salary, up sharply from 181 times in 2009. A surge in stocks drove the Standard & Poor's 500 index up 30 per cent in 2013, which saw the stock component of pay packages rose 17 per cent to $4.5million. ‘Companies have been happy with their CEOs' performance and the stock market has provided a big boost,’ says Gary Hewitt, director of research at GMI Ratings, a corporate governance research firm. ‘But we are still dealing with a situation where CEO compensation has spun out of control and CEOs are being paid extraordinary levels for their work.’ They see me rollin': Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. CEO Richard Adkerson's salary increased with an astonishing 294 per cent, to $55.3million, while TripAdvisor CEO Stephen Kaufer came in fourth at $39million . The highest paid CEO was Anthony Petrello of oilfield-services company Nabors Industries, who made $68.3million in 2013. Petrello's pay ballooned as a result of a $60million lump sum that the company paid him to buy out his old contract. 1. Anthony Petrello, Nabors Industries, $68.2million . 2.

"By . Sarah Michael . and Candace Sutton . Murdered student Jamie Gao was living his Australian dream: A first-class education at Sydney's University of Technology, a happy family life in a $1.5-million Hurstville home, an active social life, and even a budding romance with a girl whom he'd 'liked for a while'. But that dream turned into a nightmare on Tuesday, May 20. That afternoon began, police allege, with Mr Gao wading 'in over his head' into a high-stakes drug deal, and ended with the university student being shot twice in the chest, his body wrapped in a blue tarpaulin before being dumped into the ocean off Cronulla. The body found floating off Shelly Beach has now been formally identified as the 20-year-old student. Scroll down for video . Jamie Gao's girlfriend (pictured right kissing him) is in shock over his death . The day before, though, was reportedly as normal for Mr Gao as any other. He went to his morning university classes before stopping for lunch at a nearby cafe with a uni friend. At no stage, the friend says, did he seem nervous or on edge. Nor did he mention his plans for the following day. Instead he spent his time gushing about his new girlfriend - a young woman he'd had a crush on for some time and had been dating for just 'a couple of months'. Pictures posted to Mr Gao's girlfriend's Facebook page show the couple hugging and kissing. Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her. On Monday May 19, the UTS business student went to class in the morning and afternoon as normal. During a break between 11am and 1pm he lunched with a friend at Caffe Tiamo on Pitt St in Sydney's CBD. The 19-year-old female friend, who did not want to be named, told MailOnline Mr Gao did not talk about his plans for the next day. 'He was fine, normal. we had lunch,' she said. 'He didn't tell me about the meeting.' Mr Gao's girlfriend told the MailOnline it was a 'very hard time' for her . Police allege Mr Gao was murdered on Tuesday, May 20 at Padstow in Sydney's southwest between 1.40pm and 2.30pm after allegedly meeting two young Asian men and former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson. Mr Gao's friend told MailOnline that, before the body was formally identified, his girlfriend was still hopeful he'd return, saying she 'still expects him to come back'. 'They've only officially been together a couple of months, but he liked her for a while,' she said. She told MailOnline that his involvement in a drug deal seemed completely out of character, describing him as a 'nice guy' who was swayed by peer pressure. 'People say he's dealing drugs and he's bad. But his intention is not to be bad,' she said. 'He doesn't do anything on purpose to hurt anyone, I think he was just persuaded by his friends and by peer pressure.' Mr Gao lived with his mother Catherin Sui Ying Gao and grandmother in a $1.5 million house in Hurstville. A woman at the home on Monday declined to comment. Mr Gao (left) and his girlfriend (right) started dating at the beginning of the year . Police say CCTV footage shows Mr Gao arriving in his own vehicle at Arab Road, Padstow, last Tuesday and meeting with two young Asian men before he allegedly met up with former detectives McNamara and Rogerson. Footage shows one man, believed to be Mr Gao, getting out of a car and carrying a large bag to a station wagon. A body found floating off Shelly Beach near Cronulla was formally identified as Mr Gao on Tuesday afternoon . He is seen getting into the station wagon before it drives away. The car was driven to a storage unit nearby, where police will allege Mr Gao was killed for the bag's contents just before 2.30pm.' Mr Gao's friend said she was shocked the student, who graduated from Caringbah High School in 2011, was allegedly involved in drug dealing. 'He doesn't tell us about all the stuff he does,' she said. 'He does tell us about his private life, family and girlfriend but not about the illegal stuff.' The friend described Mr Gao as social and naturally smart. 'He wasn't crazy about study, he wasn't the nerdy type that studies every day, he was more social,' she said.

"By . Tom Mctague, Mail Online Deputy Political Editor . First Minister Alex Salmond claims Scotland will be richer after independence . After independence Scots will either be £1,400 a year out of pocket or £950 better off, according to rival reports published this morning. Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander claimed Scottish voters would be throwing away a 'UK dividend' of £25 a week if they voted Yes to independence in September. He spoke out as the Treasury published a new report on Scotland's finances in the 20 years after independence. Mr Alexander argued that leaving the UK would mean lower tax revenues north of the border and increased public spending, leaving Scots £1,400 a year worse off. The UK Government minister said a separate Scotland could face higher interest payments on Government debts, at the same time as it had to deal with falling oil revenues and an ageing population. Speaking on a visit to Edinburgh, Mr Alexander said: 'Because as a United Kingdom we can pool resources and share risks, it means a UK dividend of £1,400 a year for every man, woman and child in Scotland. 'That dividend is our share of a more prosperous future. It is the money that will pay for better public services and a fairer society.' But Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond said Scotland could be £5billion a year better off in 15 years' time without having to raise taxes if it became independent - amounting to just under £100 a year for each Scot. He said an increase of 0.3 percentage points in the long run productivity growth rate could raise an additional £2.4 billion a year in revenues by 2029/30. Meanwhile, upping the number of people in work by 3.3 per cent could provide additional revenues of £1.3 billion a year, according to a paper released by the Scottish Government. A rise in the population, which is less than the UK as a whole is expected to see, could net a further £1.5 billion a year by 2029/30, it argues. Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander has claimed Scots will be £1,400 a year worse off if they vote to leave the United Kingdom . Mr Salmond said the Outlook For Scotland's Public Finances paper 'gives a very clear picture of what independence could deliver in economic terms for the people of Scotland'. But Mr Alexander said some of the claims the SNP were making were 'utterly preposterous' He pointed to Treasury analysis which said there would be a £2.7 billion cost for setting up a new Scottish state - which was based on a £15 million estimated cost for setting up each of 180 policy departments. However Professor Patrick Dunleavy, whose work was used as the basis of the report, said 'the Treasury has badly misrepresented the research of the London School of Economics'. Mr Salmond said the Treasury had been 'caught red-handed trying to cook the books'. He said: 'This leaves the Treasury claims about Scotland's finances without a shred of credibility.' Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney added: 'The UK Government has been caught fiddling the books as they have tried to undermine confidence in Scotland about the steps that we can take towards independence.' He said: 'Scotland will start life as an independent nation with access to our own wealth and a key stake in the £1.3 trillion of assets built up by the UK and funded by Scottish taxpayers.' Mr Swinney added: 'In the case of physical assets overseas or defence assets that cannot be transferred or shared with Scotland, then the result will be for Scotland to receive a cash share of their value or to see our share of UK debts reduced. 'The UK Government is very keen to talk about the debt we have built up or to invent costs, but rarely talks about the assets that have been accumulated and for which Scotland has paid.' Former Chancellor Alistair Darling is leading the 'Better Together' campaign against independence, but has been criticised for his lackluster campaign . But Mr Alexander insisted that Prof Dunleavy's work 'doesn't form part of the building blocks of the analysis we are publishing today'. This research estimated it could cost up to on per cent of a country's economy to establish a new state - which in Scotland's case would be £1.5 billion. Mr Alexander said: '£1.5 billion is the figure we use in our analysis today, but it's dwarfed by the massive deficit, the extra deficit, that an independent Scotland would have.' Mr Swinney added on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that analysis showed an independent Scotland would have been £8.3 billion better off compared to the rest of the UK over the last five years. The Lib Dem minister said Scotland would be starting off with a deficit about twice the size of the rest of the UK, which would necessitate higher taxes or substantial spending cuts. Mr Alexander stood by the Treasury analysis in relation to Prof Dunleavy's figures and pointed out that a leaked memo of Mr Swinney's previously suggested that setting up the tax system alone would cost £600 million.","Treasury says independent Scotland will be billions of pounds a year poorer .

"By . Glen Owen . and Miles Goslett . The BBC’s Director General was at the centre of a conflict of interest row last night after it emerged that his wife’s company has landed the lucrative contract to recruit a new chair of the BBC Trust. Tony Hall’s wife Cynthia earns a six-figure salary at headhunters Saxton Bampfylde, which is being paid tens of thousands to find a successor to Lord Patten. Last night MPs reacted angrily, with one claiming it was a ‘catastrophic waste of public money’. Inappropriate: Cynthia Hall, wife of Tony Hall (right), works for the firm replacing the BBC Trust chaiman . Lord Patten, the current Trust chair, announced a month ago that he was standing down, triggering speculation about his successor. Tory peer Lord Coe has been identified as an early front-runner, while other sources have said the Prime Minister would ‘prefer a woman’ to fill the position. The successful candidate, who will be paid £110,000 a year for the four-day-a-week job, will take over at a delicate point in BBC history – leading negotiations over the renewal of the BBC’s Charter while still dealing with the fallout from the Jimmy Savile sex abuse storm, in addition to scandals over executive pay and perks. Lord Hall, previously chief executive of the Royal Opera House, became Director General in April 2013 on £450,000 a year. Vacancy: Saxton Bampfylde is being paid tens of thousands to find someone to take Lord Patten's role . He joined the BBC as a graduate trainee in 1973, becoming Director of News twenty years later. His wife is former head of girls’ public school Wycombe Abbey and joined Saxton Bampfylde’s 18-strong team last year. The couple have two grown-up children. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport has paid a five-figure sum for Saxton Bampfylde to ‘define the scope of the role and identify the best candidates’. But critics say the appointment means Lord Hall could be privy to information about candidates – breaking down the ‘Chinese wall’ between the Trust, which represents the licence payer, and the rest of the BBC. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid’s team are already thought to have assembled a list of runners and riders after soundings from senior broadcasting figures. Apart from Lord Coe, candidates may include Dame Marjorie Scardino, former chief executive of the company behind the Financial Times, and Colette Bowe, former chair of regulator Ofcom. Figures obtained by The Mail on Sunday reveal the BBC spent almost £500,000 on headhunters to recruit senior staff from November 2012 to March 2014. Tory MP Philip Davies, of the Commons media select committee – which must approve the new BBC Trust chairman – said: ‘I don’t see why they need to hire headhunters. It’s a catastrophic waste of public money – this is a job that people can apply for. 'And if they are going to hire headhunters, you’d think they’d be able to find a firm that didn’t have the Director  General’s wife working for it.’ A spokesman for Mr Javid denied a conflict of interest on the grounds that Lady Hall will not be involved in the recruitment process.","Headhunter Cynthia Hall, wife of Director General, earns six-figure salary .

"By . Sally Lee . A man trying to sleep off a big night at a Christmas party punched a police horse when he was disturbed by police, an Adelaide court heard on Tuesday. The court heard that when Colm James Keogh was woken by mounted officers, he lashed out and punched a police horse twice in mouth in December. However, the 31-year-old has avoided conviction and instead has been placed on a good behaviour bond. Colm James Keogh was trying to sleep off a big night at a Christmas party dressed only in his underwear and one sock, an Australian court heard on Tuesday . Mr Keogh pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court to one count of disorderly behaviour over the incident last December. His original charge of ill-treating an animal and two counts of assaulting police were withdrawn. Mr Keogh's lawyer, Con O'Neill, told the court his client had left a Christmas party at the Hilton Hotel on South Road in Adelaide and remembered getting in a taxi. He then found himself 'sleeping it off' on Hindley Street in his underwear and wearing one sock. Mr Keogh next recalled mounted police telling him to wake up and get dressed. He admitted to punching a police horse which resulted in a swollen hand in the morning. Mr Keogh spent eight hours in custody and had been 'humiliated by the whole experience'. 'He looks back with shame and embarrassment. He’s from a culture which loves horses,' his lawyer said. The drunk Irishman was approached by mounted Adelaide police last December which is when he punched the police horse twice. Pictured are Adelaide police during a parade in 2006 . He described his client as 'a gentle giant' and his actions weren't deliberate. Mr O'Neill said Mr Keogh had alcohol problems but hadn't consumed any since the incident. 'It's not suggested in this case that there was any demonstrable harm cause to the horse, although it must have been discomforted,' the magistrate Paul Bennett said. 'December last year was a difficult time for you because you and your partner lost a child in very tragic circumstances in December 2010, so I understand when December comes around every year it's very sad.' Mr Keogh was put on a 15-month good behaviour bond, a $600 fine and ordered to pay legal costs. 'You accept that you were very intoxicated at the time,' Mr Bennett said. 'But there's no excuse for you in the fact that you were so intoxicated. It was in fact a shameful thing for you to do.' Mr Bennett said Mr Keogh had been seeing a psychologist since the offending. He said there was good reason to suspend the sentence. The police prosecutor said the incident had left police horse Viking with 'no lasting impact'. Unit Senior Sergeant Damien Eichner said Viking was on patrol that night as part of a police crackdown on alcohol-fuelled violence and anti-social behaviour, The Advertiser reported in February when Mr Keogh appeared in court. Senior Sergeant Eichner said attacks on police horses were uncommon and Viking had recovered well. Mr Keogh is hoping to apply for permanent residency for his family. It may not have been granted if he had a conviction recorded.","Colm James Keogh pleaded guilty in the Adelaide Magistrates Court to one count of disorderly behaviour over the incident in Adelaide last December .

"By . Daniel Martin . and Tom Mctague . The Liberal Democrat peer accused of sexual impropriety by a string of female party activists finally issued an apology to his alleged victims last night. For four months Lord Rennard, the party’s former chief executive, has defied Nick Clegg by refusing point blank to say sorry to the women, who accused him of inappropriately touching and propositioning them. Now, in letters to the four traumatised women, he has acknowledged for the first time that he ‘may well have encroached upon personal space’. Lib Dem peer Lord Rennard has finally apologised to women who accused him of sexual harassment. He said he now realises he may have 'encroached upon ""personal space""' In grovelling terms, Lord Rennard wrote that he would like to ‘apologise sincerely for any such intrusion’, which he says ‘would have been inadvertent’. He expressed ‘regret for any harm or embarrassment caused’. Last night two of the women refused to accept the peer’s apology, with one demanding that the Lib Dem leader throw Lord Rennard out of the party. But a friend of the peer said he now wanted to resume a full role in the party. The return of the ‘pervy peer’ story to the headlines tops an appalling week for Mr Clegg. His party endured a meltdown in the . European elections, coming fifth and losing all but one of its seats – . leading to calls for his resignation. On Wednesday, Lord Oakeshott, a . friend of Business Secretary Vince Cable, resigned from the party after . being caught out commissioning and leaking constituency polls designed . to undermine Mr Clegg. Now Mr Clegg faces a dilemma over whether he should re-admit Lord Rennard to the party following his apology. Grovelling: Lord Rennard has made an apology to bring 'closure' after repeatedy saying he would not do so . It . was in February last year that women who worked for the Lib Dems told . Channel 4 News that the party’s most powerful official abused his . position for years by inappropriately touching and propositioning them. They claimed that leading Lib Dem MPs and peers who knew failed to take decisive action. Lord Rennard denied the allegations. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said Lord Rennard would not be allowed back into the party until he apologised . The . party conducted an internal inquiry, chaired by Alistair Webster QC. This January, the inquiry concluded that there was broadly credible . evidence of ‘behaviour which violated the personal space and autonomy of . the complainants’. But it . said it was ‘unlikely that it could be established beyond reasonable . doubt that Lord Rennard had intended to act in an indecent or sexually . inappropriate way’. The report suggested Lord Rennard should apologise to the women, and when he refused to do so, he was suspended. At . the time, the Lib Dem peer issued a personal statement denying the . allegations of sexual impropriety, saying: ‘I do not believe that people . should be forced to say what they know they should not say, or do not . mean.’ But, now he has had a change of heart. The letter to the four . women reads: ‘Lord Rennard wishes to achieve closure of the contentious . issues that have been in the public domain for the last 14 months by . expressing his apologies to Susan Gaszczak, Alison Goldsworthy, Bridget .

A Lib Dem spokesman said three of the women have appealed against the outcome of Mr Webster’s investigation. Lord Rennard has appealed against part of the disciplinary process. ‘We cannot comment further on any aspect of that process while it is on-going,’ the spokesman added.","Lord Rennard was accused of groping Lib Dem activists .

"By . Candace Sutton . Billionaire MP Clive Palmer is standing by his criticism of the Prime Minister's chief of staff  Peta Credlin, who Palmer says has 'undue influence' over Tony Abbott and who many regard as 'the brains' and the 'power' behind the PM. Palmer, the MP for Fairfax in Queensland, attacked Ms Credlin in parliamentary debate on Monday, saying the Federal Government had designed the paid parental leave scheme 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant'. Government MPs were quick to condemn Mr Palmer's comment, however Ms Credlin has previously been credited with being the 'power' and the 'brains' behind the prime minister and the person he is 'closest to politically'. Scroll down for video . Glamorous and influential: Peta Credlin, who posed for this shot in the January edition of Marie Claire last year, is the best known woman in Canberra and has a powerful political rapport with Prime minister Tony Abbott . Politically close: Prime Minister Tony Abbott (pictured with Peta Credlin) is politically closest to his powerful chief of staff, who even members of his own party say he relies on heavily and respects her judgment . Thr right stuff: The tall, glamorous and highly intelligent Ms Credlin is the most discussed woman in Canberra. Clive Palmer's comments echo previous assessments from within Tony Abbott's own party that she is 'widely believed to have more influence over the way the country is run than most' MPs, who she describes as 'the front men' Canberra correspondents, a member of Mr Abbott's own party and a senior official told Good Weekend last year Ms Credlin had more influence than many MPs and her role was more like the chief of staff of a US president, 'with cabinet-level status'. Dubbed 'Ms Fix-it', Credlin was 'the most discussed woman in Canberra, and probably the most powerful'. Coalition politicians on Tuesday called Mr Palmer's comments  'sexist' and 'hurtful' because Ms Credlin has been struggling to conceive her first child. Ms Credlin, 43, who has been married to Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, since 2001, has been on an IVF programme. She told marie claire magazine in January last year the prime minister was deeply supportive of her efforts to have a child through IVF with her husband and said Mr Abbott’s views on abortion, contraception and IVF were far more balanced than many people believe. Won't back down: MP and mining magnate Clive Palmer has refused to apologise to Tony Abbott staffer Peta Credlin following comments he made during a parliamentary debate that she had 'undue influence' over government policy and was behind the paid parental leave scheme . Time to question: MP Clive Palmer's criticism of Peta Credlin (pictured with Tony Abbott during question time in the House of Representatives) was that the influence she wields should not supersede that of MPs.  'I think policies should be formulated from the party room,' he said. 'It shouldn't come down from Tony Abbott's office telling elected members of parliament what they will do' Power behind the throne: Billionaire MP Clive Palmer's claims the government's paid parental leave scheme was designed 'just so that the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff (Peta Credlin, pictured) can receive a massive benefit when she gets pregnant' have been widely condemned as insensitive to Ms Credlin who has struggled to conceive on an IVF programme. But the 43-year-old is widely regarded as the 'power' and the 'brains' behind Tony Abbott . The normally private Ms Credlin came under fire then from the Labor Party, which claimed a member of Mr Abbott's personal staff should not use a public forum to overcome Mr Abbott's perceived popularity problem at the time with women voters. Mr Palmer said he was not aware of Ms Credlin's personal struggles. The 60-year-old mining magnate denied he was being sexist, telling reporters in Canberra, 'I believe as chief of staff, regardless of whether she is a woman or man, she exercises undue influence on government policy to the detriment of many of the elected members of parliament'. He said he had made the comments because they concerned government policy. Calling the shots: Peta Credlin's influence on Prime Minister Tony Abbott is such that journalists say when Mr Abbott made some comments Ms Credlin thought were 'just a little bit out of school' she 'gave him a swift kick in the shin. . . it was done with good humour, but for us, it was a really interesting insight into their relationship.' 'I think policies should be formulated from the party room,' he said. 'It shouldn't come down from Tony Abbott's office telling elected members of parliament what they will do.' A senior Liberal told Good Weekend last year that Mr Abbott, 'relies on her heavily and respects her judgment' and that 'she is the person in politics he's closest to, no doubt about that.' Seven network political correspondent Mark Riley gave an account of Mr Abbott and Ms Credlin on the way back from an overseas trip in 2013 when the prime minister made some comments Ms Credlin thought were 'just a little bit out of school'. 'She gave him a swift kick in the shin,' Riley said, 'It was done with good humour. But for us, it was a really interesting insight into their relationship.' But the government's frontbencher Christopher Pyne has described Mr Palmer's comments as 'cowardly' and 'ignorant', saying the paid parental leave scheme was proposed before Ms Credlin worked for Mr Abbott. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she hoped Mr Palmer reflected on his 'hurtful' comments about Ms Credlin. 'For him to single her out is a particularly hurtful thing for him to do,' she told Sky News. Nationals MP Darren Chester said he was disgusted with Mr Palmer's comments, and worried about the tone of parliamentary debate when unelected staffers were drawn in and 'personally vilified'. Struggle to conceive: Ms Credlin, 43, who has been married to Liberal Party federal director Brian Loughnane, since 2001, last year revealed their battle to have children . 'It was unnecessary for Mr Palmer to be so personally vindictive in the comments he made,' he told reporters, 'he should apologise.' Liberal MP Dennis Jensen said staffers were not 'fair game' in parliament. 'The people who to a certain extent are fair game are us as politicians, but once again it shouldn't get down to personal invective,' Dr Jensen said. 'You should deal with issues, not with personalities.' Nationals MP Andrew Broad, who tweeted his disapproval of the 'gutter politics' after Mr Palmer made the statement, added the comments were hurtful for couples like he and his wife who had also struggled with fertility. 'People expect better of members of parliament,' he said.","Clive Palmer said Tony Abbott's chief of staff inspired paid parental leave because she would get a 'massive benefit' when pregnant .

'At some stage there will be another operation to put them back in.' Thorpe has been regaining his fitness with the help of his friend and trainer Christian Miranda, who did not want to comment about the swimmer's progress. The former athlete will ease his way back into the social scene but will be avoiding parties and alcohol.
